[The Tomb of Wushuang]

4
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,840
Pingkang,

5
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,960
you haven't eaten or drunk anything for two days.

6
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,870
You will die if you keep this up.

7
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,000
Wushuang

8
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,120
wanted

9
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,910
you to live well.

10
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,960
You can't go on like this.

11
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,680
You can't give up on yourself, Pingkang.

12
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,710
I can't find her

13
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,110
anywhere.

14
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,190
Now,

15
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,950
I just want to see Wushuang one more time.

16
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,520
Unfortunately,

17
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,570
only in dreams can we meet again.

18
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,280
But I can't control my dreams.

19
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,120
Perhaps

20
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,310
only here can I dream of her.

21
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,910
Pingkang.

22
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,000
Pingkang.

23
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,190
Sun Pingkang,

24
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,140
Wushuang was a heroine who lived a free and easy life.

25
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,760
If she saw you so dispirited,

26
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,120
she would have thought she had been blind

27
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,560
and misjudged you.

28
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,910
Now, the Sun Family is facing trouble

29
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,400
but you're here avoiding your responsibilities.

30
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,430
You've given all the burden to Qingcheng.

31
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,750
Can you face Wushuang with a clear conscience?

32
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,760
Just leave.

33
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,400
Pingkang.

34
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,470
Give him some time.

35
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,630
Sun Pingkang.

36
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,830
Sun Pingkang.

37
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,870
It is said that

38
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,840
the bellflower can transmit sound over a thousand miles.

39
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,530
If there's anything urgent,

40
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,390
you can talk to it.

41
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,950
Sun Pingkang,

42
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,830
I miss

43
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,270
you.

44
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,390
Wushuang.

45
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,920
Wushuang.

46
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,000
Wushuang, don't leave! Wushuang!

47
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,950
Wushuang?

48
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,560
Wushuang.

49
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,560
Wushuang.

50
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,360
Wushuang.

51
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,310
Wushuang.

52
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,040
Wushuang.

53
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,950
Wushuang.

54
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,560
Wushuang.

55
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,240
Wait for me.

56
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,160
Once I've settled the things of my family,

57
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,330
I'll come to be with you.

58
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,790
You stinky monkey, cheating is not allowed.

59
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,250
If you lose, you have to drink.

60
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,450
I didn't cheat!

61
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,280
Why are you looking at me?

62
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:21,920
Drink up!

63
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,240
You're even worse than me.

64
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,510
Come on. One more time.

65
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,070
Cheating is not allowed.

66
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,870
You cheated again.

67
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,830
I didn't play tricks.

68
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,830
Use your left hand. Left hand!

69
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,920
Come on, man!

70
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,840
You can use your right hand, too.

71
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,370
Don't tell them Wushuang died.

72
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,040
Just tell them that I sent Wushuang

73
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,600
on a long journey to handle something for me.

74
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,190
Okay.

75
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,390
How nice it would be if everyone could be so carefree forever.

76
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:48,850
Knowing the truth will only make them sad.

77
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,930
I just hope

78
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,800
we can all be together forever.

79
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,270
I hope all nine of us

80
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,680
can

81
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
spend every New Year's Eve together.

82
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,430
I want to marry a beautiful girl this year.

83
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,000
People always make wishes

84
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,510
to the wishing tree.

85
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,950
But they don't know that the more hopeful they are,

86
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,340
the more likely they are to be disappointed.

87
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,190
Sometimes, even when making a wish,

88
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,240
they already know

89
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,510
the wish is impossible to come true.

90
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,470
So what did you wish for?

91
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,040
I want everything

92
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,020
to start over.

93
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,020
I hope you

94
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,550
and the demons in the Qingcheng Flower Nursery

95
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,680
can live a healthy,

96
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,890
happy and free life.

97
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,560
I also hope Qingcheng and I

98
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,310
could go back to the day we first met.

99
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,830
You're not good at being sentimental.

100
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,990
Ye You,

101
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,290
please take good care of the demons in the Qingcheng Flower Nursery

102
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,049
and Qingcheng for me.

103
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,320
No.

104
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,990
If you let me take care of them...

105
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,120
This is also my home.

106
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,080
It's my duty to take care of them.

107
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,300
As for Qingcheng,

108
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,090
I've long considered her as my younger sister.

109
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,000
You've watched over me for hundreds of years,

110
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,780
so I should say

111
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,560
thank you.

112
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,670
Thank you for taking care of me all these years.

113
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:24,960
Well,

114
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,080
you

115
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
want to use several words to thank me

116
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,270
for what I did in the past hundreds of years?

117
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,750
Don't you like aged wine?

118
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,440
It's all yours from now on.

119
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,100
♫Light, still lingering♫

120
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,310
Okay.

121
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,740
♫For the days and nights are too brief♫

122
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,890
♫Before we share the rain's refrain♫

123
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,670
Lyu Gengyun.

♫A falling star, two eyes embrace♫

125
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,000
Tell me.

126
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,320
Everything in this world has dreams.

127
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,510
♫In this world, blossoms fall like dreams, countless as the stars♫

128
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,980
♫Yet no radiant light compares to the grace of your gaze♫

129
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,320
Can I dream, too?

130
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,710
♫Through storm and snow, love carves its trace♫

131
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,640
♫Reluctantly, I take one last lingering look♫

132
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,490
♫I vow to stay, through time and tide♫

133
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,770
♫Like morning dew, unswayed, untried♫

134
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,030
The wine doesn't taste good.

135

♫A single tear, a thousand words♫

136
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,840
No more.

137
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,650
♫Enter your dreams♫

138
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,000
Everything started because of me.

139

♫Then, I know you love me♫

140
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,000
It's time to end it all.

141
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,130
♫I suddenly have a thought♫

142
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,510
Qingcheng,

143
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,540
♫Love means I should protect you♫

144
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,960
forgive me for acting on my own.

145
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,390
As for the Luowei Flower Seed you mentioned last time,

146
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,270
I can help you get it.

147
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,440
In addition, I will

148
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,690
take my own life as you planned.

149
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,490
But you have to promise me

150
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,680
to help Gu Qingcheng in her immortal cultivation,

151
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,140
and not to harm anyone around me.

152
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,940
Tell me where the flower seed is first.

153
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,120
I don't know where it is.

154
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,620
But there's a Fairy Cave on Shouyang Mountain.

155
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,000
You may find what you're looking for there.

156
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,410
Now, can you make a promise?

157
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,240
Alright,

158
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,630
I promise you.

159
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,230
Take it.

160
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,930
You'll turn into dew before sunset.

161
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,950
From now on,

162
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,030
Lyu Gengyun will no longer exist in this world.

163
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,240
Master,

164
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,250
it's not raining today.

165
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,880
Why do I suddenly hear the sound of rain?

166
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,630
This is an All-sound Conch.

167
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,480
It can help you hear the sounds of everything in the world.

168
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,370
So what sound is this?

169
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,390
This is the sound of rain in the West Lake.

170
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,540
At this moment, the West Lake

171
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,960
is raining.

172
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,090
Master,

173
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,790
we made a promise

174
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,270
to go boating on the West Lake.

175
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,660
If nothing had happened

176
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,150
to my family,

177
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,440
we would be there by now.

178
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,240
But it's alright.

179
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,320
I heard the sound of rain in the West Lake.

180
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,910
It could make up for the regret.

181
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,660
Listen.

182
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,260
Master,

183
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,690
what's that sound?

184
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,330
It's the sound of a falling star.

185
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,650
I didn't know falling stars have sounds.

186
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,490
Of course, they do.

187
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,120
The stars in the sky

188
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,550
are too far away from us.

189
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,500
Normally, we can't hear their sounds.

190
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,550
That's wonderful.

191
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,400
Master,

192
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,000
I know you're trying to cheer me up.

193
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,240
But right now,

194
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,360
I don't know what to do.

195
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,550
I need to find a solution.

196
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,920
I can't figure out how to deal with

197
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,870
the strange illness affecting everyone in the Sun's Mansion.

198
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,210
I have a way.

199
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:07,940
Really?

200
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,750
What's your solution?

201
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,550
Qingcheng,

202
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,270
we made a promise

203
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,320
that whatever happens,

204
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,910
we will face it together,

205
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,960
and we can't deceive each other, right?

206
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,670
I know how to save everyone in the Sun's Mansion.

207
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,190
They've been afflicted by an extremely rare flower poison.

208
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,660
We need an extremely rare thousand-year-old flower dew to cure them.

209
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,040
Thousand-year-old flower dew?

210
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,690
Isn't it like the thousand-year-old frost on tiles

211
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,390
and the ten-thousand-year-old wall soil?

212
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,790
Nobody

213
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,440
has ever seen these things.

214
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,150
Qingcheng,

215
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,360
we've listened to the rain falling in the West Lake together,

216
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,030
the sounds made by horses' hooves

217
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,550
and even the sounds of falling stars.

218
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,000
Can you consider that

219
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,960
I haven't broken my promise,

220
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,480
and I've taken you to see

221
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,080
beautiful landscapes?

222
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,290
What do you mean?

223
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,270
Master,

224
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,120
what do you mean?

225
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,460
Although no one has seen the thousand-year-old flower dew,

226
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,510
floral demons that have cultivated for over a thousand years

227
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,170
can condense themselves into dew

228
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,150
to cure the flower poison.

229
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,030
What are you talking about?

230
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,390
We've been through

231
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,830
so many things together,

232
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,270
visited so many magical places,

233
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,080
and seen so many rare flowers and precious plants.

234
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,510
We can find

235
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,960

236
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,270
I...

I...

238
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,050
I'll go find Immortal Yuxiao.

239
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
He's the Flower God.

240
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,550
He must have a way.

241
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,270
Qingcheng,

242
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920

Forgetting is more terrifying than separation by death.

372
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:04,610
♫Liuli grass sways, carrying my longing♫

373
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,310
As long as I love someone,

374
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,590
I am happy.

375
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,550
Master,

376
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:11,610
♫Fate turns, time flows like a waterwheel♫

377
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,750
the spider silk is poisonous.

378
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,200
In fact, all these years,

379
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,550
I didn't know what love was.

380
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:17,360
♫Peonies bloom, stars shine deep in the clouds♫

381
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,160
But since I met you,

382
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,920
I discovered that longing for a loved one

383
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,110
is the best nourishment for life.

384
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,550
It feels so good to be in someone's thoughts.

385
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,310
Please don't be sad.

386
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,590
As long as you miss me,

387
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,030
I'll always be by your side.

388
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,790
I believe that my little gardener

389
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,550
can revive

390
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,550
nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine little flowers to

391
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,000
become the best flower fairy in the world,

392
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,390
and live a life as beautiful as blooming flowers.

393
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,980
Master,

394
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:51,640
♫Wind follows water, asking the flower spirit♫

395
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,350
I will

396
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,750
say goodbye to you with a smile.

397
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:59,500
♫Years pass, yet we are fortunate to reunite♫

398
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,830
I will

399
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,350
do what I should do.

400
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:06,240
♫A blessed land, moonlight shines on two shadows♫

401
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,350
All right.

402
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:12,600
♫Love fills the city, inseparable like shadows♫

403
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,640
The illusion will finally dissipate.

404
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,960
With a loved one by your side,

405
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:19,290
♫Evergreen like the bond we share♫

406
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,920
the sky is not high,

407
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
and the sea is not deep.

408
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,720
Gu Qingcheng,

409

♫Liuli grass sways, carrying my longing♫

410
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,430

♫Fate turns, time flows like a waterwheel♫

412
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,680

♫Peonies bloom, stars shine deep in the clouds♫

414
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,240
Father.

415

Father.

416
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,350
Mother.

417
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,000
It's alright now.

418
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,200
Father, Mother,

419
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,720
since you woke up,

420
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,960
you will recover after

421
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,440
taking a few more doses of medicine,

422
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,030
Don't worry.

423
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,590
I feel better now.

424
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,440
Pingkang, what are you doing?

425
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,030
Father,

426
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,270
Mother,

427
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,750
forgive your unfilial son.

428
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,690
Isn't everything alright now?

429
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,440
Yes, it is.

430
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,440
Get up, get up.

431
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,110
Come on.

432
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,480
Pingkang,

433
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,310
what are you doing?

434
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,000
Your father and I have recovered.

435
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,310
Everything is fine now.

436
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,480
Yes.

437
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,070
It's all right.

438
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,240
It's okay, it's okay.

439
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,960
Right.

440
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,160
Pingkang,

441
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,730
you know what,

442
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,270
those who survive great calamities

443
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,350
are bound to have good fortune.

444
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,270
From now on,

445
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,920
we

446
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,080
must be happy

447
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,200
and joyful.

448
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,110
Dear.

449
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,290
Yes.

450
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,310
There's no hurdle we can't overcome.

451
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,680
Good boy.

452
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,750
I'm sorry.

453
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,590
Mother.

454
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,960
No.

455
00:28:59,030 --> 00:28:59,980
Good boy.

456
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,160
Alright, Pingkang.

457
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,550
Come on.

458
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,640
Come on.

459
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:03,720
My Lady.

460
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,110
Look,

461
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,030
the flowers have come back to life.

462
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,920
Be careful.

463
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,310
Like this.

464
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,240
Move a bit more to the left.

465
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,900
[Sun's Mansion]

466
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,110
Finally, it's over.

467
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,050
Dear, look at the courtyard.

468
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,350
Slow down, slow down.

469
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,310
It's wonderful!

470
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,270
A little more to the left.

471
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,510
Has someone been arranged to clean the backyard?

472
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,400
Yes.

473
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,270
Be quick and efficient.

474
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,200
Everything has been arranged.

475
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,350
Everyone's illnesses have been cured.

476
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,000
We must have a grand celebration.

477
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,350
Let's get rid of the bad luck.

478
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:26,920
Yes.

479
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,240
Dear.

480
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,510
Clean everything up.

481
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,720
Wash away the bad luck.

482
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,590
Yes, My Lord.

483
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,110
Slow down.

484
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,550
Where's Qingcheng?

485
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,880
Qingcheng?

486
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,960
She's over there.

487
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:45,830
Look!

488
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:46,830
Rainbow.

489
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:47,830
Look.

490
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,020
Dear.

491
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,800
Rainbow.

492
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,880
Rainbow.

493
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,960
Dear.

494
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,920
Slow down.

495
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,070
I love rainbows the most.

496
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,160
So beautiful.

497
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,920
It's beautiful.

498
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,160
This is a good omen, Dear.

499
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,880
Wish us great fortune and prosperity.

500
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,440
Great fortune and prosperity.

501
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,750
I hope I can stay with My Lady forever.

502
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,110
Great fortune and prosperity.

503
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,400
This is a sign of great fortune.

504
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,120
Master,

505
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,610
is it you who came back?

506
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,680
After extreme misfortune comes extreme good fortune.

507
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,020
Everything will go smoothly from now on.

508
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,400
Master,

509
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,660
will you be waiting for me

510
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,880
at the other end of the rainbow?

511
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,000
Everyone, have a good rest.

512
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,920
Say thanks to My Lord.

513
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,440
Thank you, My Lord.

514
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
Thank you, Eldest Madam.

515
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,070
Bless the Sun Family.

516
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,030
This is a great omen.

517
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,720
Peace and safety.

518
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,510
Good.

519
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,460
After extreme misfortune comes extreme good fortune.

520
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,960
What good fortune!

521
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,550
Dear,

522
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,920
it's a joyous day.

523
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,440
Indeed.

524
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,110
Good.

525
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,790
Okay. Okay.

526
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,880
That's wonderful. Thank you.

527
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,510
It's so beautiful.

528
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,790
It looks amazing.

529
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,790
I wish I could see rainbows every day.

530
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,650
Master,

531
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,010
all this joy is because of you,

532
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,390
but it has nothing to do with me.

533
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,270
Don't worry,

534
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,760
I will do what I have to do.
