00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,080
I can't stay here for too long.

191
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,630
Moreover,

192
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,550
I came here today

193
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,830
to look for something.

194
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,480
Are you looking for

195
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,480
this?

196
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,240
This...

197
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,790
This is

198
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,510
Qionghua Twig.

199
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,710
People don't believe

200
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,580
the Cave Paradise exists.

201
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,200
But they don't know

202
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,240
only those who truly believe the Cave Paradise's existence

203
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,730
can enter this place.

204
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,360
I'm willing to

205
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,320
give the Qionghua Twig

206
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,240
to the person who is destined for it.

207
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,270
Thank you.

208
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
I see.

209
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,870
Qionghua Twig

210
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,030
and Cave Paradise...

211
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,670
I've seen

212
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,720
the Cold Pond Path

213
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,990
and Seven-colored Moonlight mentioned by my father.

214
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,870
Then, what does

215
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,000
"Drink all night in the Mountain God's Mansion"

216
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,840
mean?

217
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,790
You will know

218
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,140
after you go back.

219
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,670
Drink this cup of tea.

220
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,220
Then, I'll send you back.

221
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,000
Thank you.

222
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,980
Thank you.

223
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,870
I

224
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,930
haven't asked

225
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,310
your name yet.

226
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,550
May I ask

227
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,609
you name?

228
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,829
I'm just a passerby here.

229
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,160
A passerby?

230
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,349
Qingcheng.

231
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,030
Qingcheng.

232
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,680
Qingcheng.

233
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,490
Qingcheng.

234
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,440
You're awake.

235
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,030
Good.

236
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,750
Are you alright?

237
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,400
I...

238
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,590
Why am I here?

239
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,960
Just now...

240
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,830
Where's the Qionghua Twig?

241
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,310
What are you looking for?

242
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,640
What are you looking for?

243
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,680
So,

244
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,790
it was just a dream.

245
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,070
A dream?

246
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,110
I just dreamed of

247
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,160
a place that is warm.

248
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,880
It was the Cave Paradise with a flower fairy.

249
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,480
She gave me the Qionghua Twig.

250
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
It wasn't a dream.

251
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,030
Look.

252
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,550
Master,

253
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,280
I found the Qionghua Twig.

254
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,680
It's strange.

255
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,310
After I cracked the formation,

256
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,480
there was a blinding white light.

257
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,590
When I opened my eyes again,

258
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,590
I was back here.

259
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,680
Then, I discovered that this place

260
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,770
was the Mountain God's Mansion.

261
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,000
I can't believe such magical things happened.

262
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,490
So,

263
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,640
"By the cold pond"

264
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,590
refers to the Cold Pond Path.

265
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,920
"Seven-colored Moonlight Appears"

266
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,030
refers to the seven colors reflected by the snow.

267
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,060
"Drink all night in the Mountain God's Mansion"

268
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,650
refers to this Mountain God's Mansion.

269
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,200
So,

270
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,310
"You will meet a flower fairy"

271
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,280
refers to the goddess you encountered in your dream.

272
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,250
It was the flower fairy who gave you the Qionghua Twig.

273
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,790
I found it.

274
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,350
I got the Qionghua Twig.

275
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,200
I got it.

276
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,460
♫How can we predict the separation and reunion?♫

277
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,550
You seem to have a magical power,

278
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,590
♫I'm obsessed with you in every life♫

279
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,550

280
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,410
into possible.

281
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,600
♫Do you miss me?♫

282
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,110
I'm not that amazing.

283
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,010
♫How do you see through the means of fate?♫

284
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,680
At Bai's grave,

285
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,750
you said you didn't care about the fact that

286
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,350
♫The mortal world is our chess board and we have some regrets♫

287
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,880

♫Longings are blooming all over the lake again♫

289
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,240

♫I'm willing to use all my courage♫

the accounts.

328
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,790
There were several flower orders just now.

329
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,110
Mr. Zhang paid

330
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,880
three taels and five mace for his tea party.

331
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,200
It's better to record it right away.

332
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,830
Wushuang,

333
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,920
the night is long,

334
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,270
and sleep eludes us tonight.

335
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,750
Why don't

336
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,960
we...

337
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,160
You can help me

338
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,620
grind the ink stick.

339
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,030
Wushuang,

340
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,960
I've prepared a bottle of wine,

341
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,680
which is called "Yangtze River Water".

342
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,110
It's named after the lines

343
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,440
"Thinking of you daily but never have the chance to meet you,

344
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,310
Together we drink the Yangtze River water."

345
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,380
By the way,

346
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,400
these roses

347
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,000
should be delivered to Granny Zhang's house tomorrow.

348
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,720
We need to get them ready tonight.

349
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,830
It wouldn't be late to deliver the flowers tomorrow.

350
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,830
What do you want to do?

351
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,310
I

352
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,510
don't have any ulterior motives.

353
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,310
I just think

354
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,200
it's a beautiful evening.

355
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,880
I've prepared a delicacy for you.

356
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,960
It's called

357
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,830
"Spring Crisp Cake."

358
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,880
Do you know

359
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,610
why it has this name?

360
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,310
Why?

361
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,590
It's also named after a verse I like.

362
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,070
Hey,

363
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,100
do you still want the food and drink?

364
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,070
It's cold now.

365
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,480
Work first, then eat.

366
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,880
No.

367
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,680
The deep-fried crispy pork will be soggy if it gets cold.

368
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,750
It will taste bad.

369
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,880
Am I right, Mr. Sun?

370
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:18,920
Well,

371
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:19,880
you

372
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,270
can eat it.

373
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,110
Thank you.

374
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,880
It's nice of you.

375
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:35,640
It's soggy now.

376
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,350
I'll go reheat it.

377
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,440
What are you looking at?

378
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,400
Nothing.

379
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,400
Get to work.

380
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,960
My spiritual power is weak now.

381
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,160
I can't heal your anymore.

382
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,000
It's okay, Master.

383
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,880
I feel much better now.

384
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,350
I'm not cold at all.

385
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,010
There's actually something

386
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,310
I haven't told you.

387
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,350
What is it?

388
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,070
About Jiang Li, the Flower Goddess,

389
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,590
she is my mother.

390
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,400
So,

391
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,030
the flower fairy I met in the Cave Paradise

392
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,310
was her.

393
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,200
Then, the rumor that

394
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,440
Flower Goddess Jiang Li

395
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,890
and Demon King Bai Yu slaughtered the three realms...

396
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,960
It's fake.

397
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,750
My mother was the Flower Goddess

398
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,070
but she fell in love with the Demon King.

399
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,840
Naturally, she was not accepted by the Heavenly Realm.

400
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,920
Let's write a happy ending

401
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,920
for their story to make up for their regrets.

402
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,750
When the snow is lighter,

403
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,070
we can go down the mountain.

404
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,270
Have a rest for a while.

405
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,440
Red beans grow in the southern land.

406
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,790
How many branches will sprout in spring?

407
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,680
May you pick more of them.

408
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,350
Because these beans are symbols of longing.

409
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,350
God!

410
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,880
You must be working against me.

411
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,720
The line "Together we drink the Yangtze River water" is nonsense!

412
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,920
Wushuang,

413
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,310
do you understand my feelings?

414
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,150
What feelings?

415
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,550
Wushuang?

416
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:32,510
You...

417
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,110
Why are you here?

418
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,280
Wasn't this eaten by Ye You?

419
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,070
I stopped him.

420
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,830
He was not willing to give it to me.

421
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,670
I beat him, and he got angry.

422
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,030
Try it.

423
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,960
It is delicious.

424
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,510
Wushuang,

425
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,000
I didn't

426
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,160
finish my words.

427
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,110
It is

428
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,640
named after

429
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,000
my favorite poem.

430
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,160
Red beans grow in the southern land.

431
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,160
How many branches will sprout in spring?

432
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,160
May you pick more of them.

433
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,030
Because these beans are symbols of longing.

434
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,400
How did you know that?

435
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,720
You just recited the poem.

436
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,480
You heard it all?

437
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,750
It sounds beautiful.

438
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,920
Yes, it is very beautiful.

439
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,030
Teach me how to write poems.

440
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,710
Why do you suddenly want to learn poetry?

441
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:01,310
You always talk about poems, scriptures,

442
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:01,920
and so on.

443
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,110
I don't understand any of them.

444
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,750
Excellent.

445
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:06,960
Excellent.

446
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,240
Excellent?

447
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,720
It means "very good."

448
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,110
Very...

449
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,790
Very good.

450
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,640
Excellent.

451
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,110
Excellent.

452
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,290
Master,

453
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,960
let's take a break.

454
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:40,830
Master,

455
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,110
how can I give the Flower Spirit back to you?

456
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,000
How did you know

457
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,720
that my Flower Spirit was in your body?
