00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,190
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,920
Mr. Lyu, I'd like to become

4
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,410
sworn brothers with you.

5
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,590
What do you think?

6
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,070
Mr. Sun, you're an upright man.

7
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,870
It would be my honor to become sworn brothers

8
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,910
with you.

9
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,960
Wonderful.

10
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,120
That's great.

11
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,460
From today on,

12
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,240
we are sworn brothers.

13
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,240
Let's share joys

14
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,280
and hardships together.

15
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,470
Count me in.

16
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,200
Let's share joys and hardships together.

17
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,520
Let's share joys and hardships together.

18
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,030
Let's have a few more drinks to celebrate today.

19
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,960
We're out of wine.

20
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,710
I want more.

21
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,910
There's none left. I'll go get another jug.

22
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
Master,

23
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,930
I thought you didn't want to meddle in the mortal world affairs.

24
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,780
Why did you become sworn brothers with Pingkang?

25
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,630
By becoming sworn brothers with Sun Pingkang,

26
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,240
I'll have a reason

27
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,360
to legitimately stay at the Sun's Mansion.

28
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,190
And

29
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,750
find a way to retrieve the Flower Spirit.

30
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,840
Master,

31
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,120
you can teach me immortal cultivation

32
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,630
from now on.

33
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,680
You can be my legitimate master

34
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,560
-and teach me immortal magic.
-Her dream is full of Sun Pingkang now

35
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,680
because Sun Pingkang is in trouble now.

36
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,370
If you solve her problem

37
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,150
and guide her to recall her past,

38
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,160
then I'll have my chance.

39
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,910
I will definitely succeed in my cultivation!

40
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,230
Then you must practice diligently.

41
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,870
Don't disappoint me.

42
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,000
I will heed your teachings, Master.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,520
Master, let's have another drink.

44
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,470
Where's the wine?

45
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,840
So,

46
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,190
to find out whether her past

47
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,870
is reated to the Flower Spirit,

48
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,600
you need to get her drunk.

49
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,000
After you get her drunk,

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,560
leave the rest to me.

51
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,560
But remember,

52
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,400
she has to be completely drunk.

53
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,360
Pingkang went to get more wine.

54
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,150
Why hasn't he come back?

55
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,870
Actually,

56
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,520
I have...

57
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,800
Let's drink this one.

58
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
I'd like

59
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,470
to propose a toast to you.

60
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,680
Come on.

61
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,310
Cheers!

62
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,800
Cheers!

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,840
I'll drink.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,510
Father said we need to revive

65
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,480
999 flowers and plants.

66
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,720
Only then will the Flowers Immortal Lord come.

67
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,600
I didn't expect you

68
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,230
to arrive early.

69
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,070
Gu Qingcheng.

70
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,510
You're drunk?

71
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,540
I'm not drunk.

72
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,270
Then tell me,

73
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,760
besides seeing that Immortal Lord in your dreams,

74
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,190
what other

75
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,560
magical things have you encountered?

76
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,000
Meeting you,

77
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,680
is that

78
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,830
the most magical thing?

79
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,830
Same old story.

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,190
Think carefully.

81
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,480
Have you seen anything or

82
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,000
anyone strange?

83
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,310
Anything strange...

84
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,680
Anyone strange...

85
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,830
Strange...

86
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,560
Let's drink.

87
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,880
Unreliable Ye You.

88
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,920
I'll teach you a few sword moves.

89
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,800
Watch carefully.

90
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,020
Master, this move is really beautiful.

91
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,360
Don't just focus on the beauty of the moves.

92
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,910
Feel every move

93
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,490
with your heart.

94
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,570
♫A flower blooms, a thought arises♫

95
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,040
Yes, Master.

96
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
I'll remember that.

97
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,070
♫A thought descends into the dust of fate♫

98
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,560
♫Fate stirs, whose gaze lingers with longing?♫

99
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,820
♫Stirring dreams of joy deep within the heart♫

100
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,820
♫Light, still lingering♫

101
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,450
♫For the days and nights are too brief♫

102
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,610
♫Before we share the rain's refrain♫

103
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,610
♫A falling star, two eyes embrace♫

104
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,360
Gu Qingcheng.

105
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,230
♫In this world, blossoms fall like dreams, countless as the stars♫

106
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:58,700
♫Yet no radiant light compares to the grace of your gaze♫

107
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:58,720
Come here.

108
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,430
♫Through storm and snow, love carves its trace♫

109
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,510
Master.

110
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,360
♫Reluctantly, I take one last lingering look♫

111
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,870
Master.

112
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,390
♫I vow to stay, through time and tide♫

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,680
♫Like morning dew, unswayed, untried♫

114
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:20,430
♫A single tear, a thousand words♫

115
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,390
Why are you turning it off?

116
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,390
I told you to look into her dreams for clues about the Flower Spirit.

117
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,700
What exactly did you see?

118
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,700
I can't control what she dreams about.

119
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,170
Besides,

120
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,830
you two just now

121
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,360
sharing an umbrella in the rain,

122
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,950
dancing with swords in the peach grove,

123
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,159
locking eyes in the flower field.

124
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,630
Young girls nowadays love this kind of thing, huh?

125
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
What? What's wrong?

126
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,510
Can you shut up?

127
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:01,870
Yes.

128
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,120
But my silence won't change anything.

129
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,830
This girl's mind is full of you now.

130
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,430
Can you really bear to take the Flower Spirit from her?

131
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,360
Of course.

132
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,270
Well, if you really want to take it,

133
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,830
I have a more direct method.

134
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,920
It's just that you might need to

135
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,510
sacrifice yourself a bit.

136
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,120
Keep your silly ideas to yourself.

137
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,800
It's not silly. It'll work.

138
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,720
Just consider it, will you?

139
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,870
What's with those expressions?

140
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,100
Can't stand to see it.

141
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,030
Go away.

142
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
What's that?

143
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,080
Master.

144
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,430
I went to the back mountain and collected fresh dew.

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,840
Master,

146
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,630
here's the fresh dew I collected.

147
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,600
Master.

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Master.

149
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,310
Where did he go?

150
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,200
He's not outside,

151
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,840
nor inside.

152
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,150
Gu Qingcheng.

153
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,960
I heard you're about to

154
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,720
marry Pingkang.

155
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,310
Ma'am,

156
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,240
don't listen to their nonsense.

157
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,630
The Lord himself told me

158
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,000
and asked me to arrange your wedding.

159
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,750
But

160
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,000
if you want to be the daughter-in-law of the Sun family,

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,360
you still have a lot to learn from me.

162
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,670
You'll need my help and support in the future.

163
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,480
It seems the marriage with Pingkang

164
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,720
can't be delayed any longer.

165
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,670
Ye You didn't find anything useful from her dream,

166
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,790
but a bunch of frivolous thoughts.

167
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,720
I can't trust his silly ideas anymore.

168
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,600
I need to think of my own way.

169
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,030
I haven't had time to properly decorate the flower nursery lately.

170
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
When you're done,

171
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
you must help me take good care of the flower nursery.

172
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,630
Master, why are you here?

173
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,840
Master, why... why did you just show up like that?

174
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,630
Why are you here?

175
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,870
No, Master, I should be asking you.

176
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,960
Why did you suddenly appear here?

177
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,360
What exactly are you doing?

178
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,000
Why aren't you dressed?

179
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,630
I was taking a bath. You're peeking at me.

180
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,440
This is my room!

181
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,600
Who's in your...

182
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,150
But this is clearly my room!

183
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,360
I'm not even married yet!

184
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,910
How could you do this to me?

185
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,510
Stop shouting!

186
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,320
Why do I always end up in front of

187
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,750
Gu Qingcheng for no reason?

188
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,030
Why is it exactly?

189
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,480
Master, what are you doing?

190
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,670
Master.

191
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,480
What are you up to?

192
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,390
Could it be

193
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,560
that my Flower Spirit is connected to her bloodline?

194
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,700
So whenever she bleeds,

195
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,390
I get summoned over.

196
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,830
Turn around.

197
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,870
Gu Qingcheng.

198
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,320
I have a gift for you.

199
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,400
What's this?

200
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,590
Try it on.

201
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,840
Master, why are you

202
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,560
suddenly giving me a gift?

203
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,360
This bracelet

204
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,630
can protect your hands from harm.

205
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,240
You're a gardener.

206
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,940
You need to take good care of your hands.

207
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,270
Master,

208
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,270
how did you know that a gardener's hands

209
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,480
are always hurt and full of cuts?

210
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,520
So you won't cut yourself again

211
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,510
and summon me for no reason.

212
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,670
It's beautiful. Thank you, Master.

213
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,760
Master,

214
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,480
I've decided to gather my courage and do one thing tomorrow.

215
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,960
Master, do you think I'll succeed?

216
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,600
I will, right?

217
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,360
Will I?

218
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,480
No matter what it takes,

219
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,820
I have to succeed.

220
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,200
Father,

221
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,670
there's something

222
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,050
I hope you'll grant me.

223
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,550
Tell me whatever you need.

224
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,390
I'll

225
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,000
agree to anything.

226
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,200
What are you doing?

227
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,870
Father,

228
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,870
I hope

229
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,280
you'll agree

230
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,180
to cancel my engagement to Pingkang.

231
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,320
Are you here to speak for Pingkang?

232
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,750
No,

233
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,720
I'm here for myself.

234
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,840
Do you not like it here?

235
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,030
No, Father,

236
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,030
I like it here very much.

237
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,000
I grew up in the Sun's Mansion since I was little.

238
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,600
This place is already

239
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,510
a home to me.

240
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,200
Father and Mother love me,

241
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,120
and Pingkang takes good care of me.

242
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,860
It's just that, Father,

243
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,650
I see Pingkang

244
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,910
as a sibling,

245
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,670
not a lover.

246
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,000
Father,

247
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,860
can you understand?

248
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,720
Pingkang.

249
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,460
Pingkang.

250
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,320
Qingcheng.

251
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,320
What brings you here?

252
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,990
Mother asked the kitchen

253
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,390
to make your favorite sweet soup.

254
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,780
Try some.

255
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,910
What's wrong?

256
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
Why do you look so worried?

257
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,120
Is something bothering you?

258
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:54,960
Pingkang,

259
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,010
I came here today

260
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,340
because I have something to share with you.

261
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,320
Father...

262
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,670
has agreed to cancel our engagement.

263
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,090
W-what?

264
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,030
Father has agreed to cancel our engagement!

265
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,120
Father.

266
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,200
Pingkang will surely find

267
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,790
someone he truly loves.

268
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,000
Since neither of you

269
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,200
wants this marriage,

270
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,440
let's officially cancel it.

271
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,030
From now on,

272
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,870
you're no longer my daughter-in-law,

273
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,480
but

274
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,800
the young lady of our Sun family.

275
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,550
Qingcheng,

276
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,860
you're determined to participate in the Floral Competition

277
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,320
and win the championship.

278
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,960
I support you.

279
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,630
Go ahead and do it without worries.

280
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,790
Father.

281
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,390
You're always the one with the solutions.

282
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,670
From now on, we're no longer

283
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,870
bound by this engagement.

284
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,630
We're truly siblings now.

285
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,030
To siblings.

286
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,030
My painting.

287
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,349
I just knocked on the door several times

288
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,480
but you didn't answer.

289
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,440
So you were

290
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,510
painting...

291
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,750
It's not what you think.

292
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,349
I've been free recently,

293
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,200
and a client happened to ask for my help.

294
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,830
I thought I could earn a little money.

295
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,240
However,

296
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,510
the client requested

297
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,580
that I must not let anyone else see it.

298
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,480
I won't say a word.

299
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,150
Don't worry. Go on.

300
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,370
Remember to drink the sweet soup.

301
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,070
Your soup.

302
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,510
Both bowls are yours.

303
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,350
So your brilliant plan is

304
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,240
to have me stand here like a wooden statue?

305
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,110
How could you be a wooden statue?

306
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,200
In Miss Gu's eyes,

307
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,590
you are the most beautiful peony in the world.

308
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,070
This is the last time I trust you.

309
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
If it fails,

310
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,190
I'll pluck out your immortal root.

311
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,240
Here she comes.

312
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,450
Master, you look quite different today.

313
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,640
You look quite

314
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,090
different too.

315
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,720
Very happy?

316
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,590
Father

317
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,680
has agreed to annul

318
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,600
my marriage to Pingkang.

319
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,440
Breaking off the engagement?

320
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,880
Could it be because of me?

321
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,030
It's unexpected

322
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,980
you'd propose to break off the engagement.

323
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,070
Why?

324
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,310
This marriage

325
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,110
was arranged by our parents in the first place.

326
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,920
I didn't like it, but I didn't have the courage to speak up.

327
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,200
This time I mustered up a lot of courage to bring it up.

328
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,920
It wasn't

329
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,030
as hard as I imagined.

330
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,790
Was it?

331
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,200
Your courage is commendable.

332
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,110
To reward your bravery,

333
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,110
I'll

334
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,640
give you a gift.

335
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,160
Master, you have another gift for me?

336
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,030
What's this?

337
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,790
This is...

338
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,580
One-of-a-kind in the world—

339
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,550
the Truth Powder.

340
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,200
Pearl powder?

341
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,810
Yes, pearl powder.

342
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,790
Pearl powder is best for beauty and skin care.

343
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,820
You've been so tired taking care of me lately.

344
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,650
You really need it.

345
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
Find a good chance

346
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,960
to make Miss Gu inhale

347
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,160
this powder.

348
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,880
She'll open up to you and tell you

349
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,550
everything about her life.

350
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,060
At that time, getting the Flower Spirit

351
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,560
will be so easy.

352
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,920
How about

353
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,790
you come closer and take a sniff?

354
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,030
You're so indecisive.

355
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,550
Just blow it

356
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,550
onto her face.

357
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,740
Master,

358
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,600
both you and this powder

359
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,400
are a bit strange today.

360
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,720
The finest pearl powder.

361
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,030
Donkey.

362
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,440
How could there be a donkey in the Sun's Mansion?

363
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,960
Bad news, My Lady!

364
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,960
My Lady, bad news!

365
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,880
What's wrong?

366
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,480
It's the Young Master. The Young Master...

367
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,400
What happened to him?

368
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,750
Well...

369
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,070
You... I...

370
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,740
Zisu, are you alright?

371
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,930
It's not me. I didn't mean to--

372
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,400
What did you say about Pingkang just now?

373
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,720
He... he went to Tianxiang House.

374
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,750
Why would he go to Tianxiang House?

375
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,020
Pingkang isn't into women or alcohol.

376
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,980
There must be something wrong.

377
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,000
Let's go take a look.

378
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,750
Master, wait for me.

379
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,240
What...

380
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,310
Sir, you look unfamiliar.

381
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,960
When did you come in?

382
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,000
Oh no.

383
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,510
Its side effect is talking while hugging people.

384
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,440
Wait, wait, young lady.

385
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,830
Calm down, please calm down.

386
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,220
Get... get down!

387
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,880
Sir, I'm very calm.

388
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,830
Calm down.

389
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,400
Why is your grip so strong?

390
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,270
Help!

391
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,030
Help!

392
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,990
Sir, you've already had your third pot today.

393
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,800
Hurry up, bring another pot.

394
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,240
Please wait a moment, sir.

395
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,510
The Xiaoyao wine will be served soon.

396
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,410
Mr. Han, are you satisfied with the food and wine?

397
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,240
Master, the people in here are acting strange.

398
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,240
Why did Pingkang come here?

399
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,930
Has he forgotten about Si Shulun

400
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,990
who died mysteriously at Tianxiang House?

401
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,120
This is not a good place at all.

402
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,470
Don't worry, he won't recognize us.

403
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,030
I've temporarily cast a forgetting spell on him.

404
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,510
I suppose it's the first

405
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,200
time of you visiting here.

406
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,070
Would you like to drink or watch the dance?

407
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,550
We're just looking around.

408
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,590
Just looking around?

409
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,590
Bring me two pots of

410
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,270
your best wine.

411
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,470
We're here to drink... to drink.

412
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,200
You've come to the right place.

413
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,720
We have every kind of wine.

414
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,720
Which one would you like?

415
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,160
For my wife and I,

416
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,980
which one do you recommend?

417
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,240
There are private rooms upstairs.

418
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,160
Please.

419
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,480
This way, please.

420
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,350
If I catch Pingkang,

421
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,200
I'll teach him a lesson.

422
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,960
My dear.

423
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,440
This way, please.

424
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,030
Please, come in.

425
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,550
Master.

426
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,240
Please enjoy your meal.

427
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,720
Master,

428
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,400
shouldn't we

429
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,640
quickly go find Pingkang?

430
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,400
My dear,

431
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:29,740
now that we're here,

432
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,570
let's enjoy ourselves.

433
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,680
Please.

434
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,310
My dear.

435
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,440
Wuyuzi, what are you peeking at?

436
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,270
Last time I was beaten so badly by that Jade-Eyed Fox.

437
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,610
I don't want any more trouble.

438
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,750
Master,

439
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,670
I can't drink anymore. My alcohol tolerance is low.

440
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,680
We're being watched.

441
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,640
What?

442
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,000
What should we do?

443
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,350
Wuyuzi.

444
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,690
I think they're just here for some drinks and entertainment.

445
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,200
I have to make sure.

446
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,730
We have to...

447
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,920
Is this the only way, Master?

448
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,110
Alright, alright.

449
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,810
We've seen all kinds of customers.

450
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,560
Let me take another...

451
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,480
Let's go.

452
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,200
We shouldn't stay here long.

453
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,030
Once we find Sun Pingkang,

454
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,110
let's leave quickly.

455
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,270
Why are you still sitting there?

456
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,400
Stay close to me.

457
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,750
Oh no.

458
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,530
Gu Qingcheng.

459
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,110
Gu Qingcheng!

460
00:26:59,170 --> 00:26:59,940
Gu Qingcheng!

461
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,470
Gu Qingcheng!

462
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,270
This can't be.

463
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,000
You're back.

464
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,920
You haven't finished today's lessons yet.

465
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,640
You went out to play again.

466
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,790
Mother.

467
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:04,930
Look.

468
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,440
Why are you crying?

469
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,690
Did those little monsters

470
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,640
from Shouyang Mountain

471
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,590
bully you again?

472
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,130
I'll go and demand justice for you.

473
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,720
What exactly happened

474
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,920
on the night of lunar March 7th?

475
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,440
Why did you and Father

476
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,790
disappear overnight?

477
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,270
It's alright.

478
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,830
I'll tell you later.

479
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,730
Once someone enters Master's Illusory Realm,

480
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,630
it's not easy to get out.

481
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,590
But that Lyu Gengyun has powerful magic.

482
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,030
Can this Illusory Realm alone

483
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,200
really trap him?

484
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,430
Then let him see

485
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,380
something he desires but can never have.

486
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,590
When he's consumed by desire,

487
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,410
that's when we'll strike.

488
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,720
Qiansi,

489
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,880
hold back Sun Pingkang and that girl.

490
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,480
Make sure they don't meet up.

491
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,790
Understood.

492
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,720
Strange.

493
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,240
Shouldn't the Tianxiang House be bustling?

494
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,350
Why is there not a single person here today?

495
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,160
That girl only said

496
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,350
to deliver this painting to the entrance of Tianxiang House,

497
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,030
but didn't specify the exact location.

498
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,310
Where should I look for her?

499
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,510
Mr. Sun.

500
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,640
Miss,

501
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,200
here's the painting you asked.

502
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,710
I have finished it

503
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,240
and brought it here for you.

504
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,460
Thank you, Mr. Sun.

505
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,040
Why don't you come in and sit a while?

506
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,990
I'll treat you to

507
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,210
the best wine in our Tianxiang House.

508
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,000
Come on, Mr. Sun.

509
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,480
No, no.

510
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,680
I

511
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,290
have urgent matters at home.

512
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,080
I'll

513
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,380
take my leave now.

514
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,790
Sir, won't you come in for a drink?

515
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,460
I'll... I'll come another day.

516
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,890
Where are you going, sir?

517
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,030
Are you done with your act?

518
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,510
How dare you offend my mother!

519
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,640
I didn't expect you to see through it.

520
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,510
I'll kill you!

521
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,510
Master, help!
