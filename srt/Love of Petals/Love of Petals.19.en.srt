Don't blame yourself too much.

8
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,470
The demonic aura in your body is indeed too strong.

9
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,150
Without the support of spiritual power,

10
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,280
it's inevitable that you'll lose control and turn demonic.

11
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,240
No.

12
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,240
I cannot let myself lose control and become a demon.

13
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,280
My father fell into demonic corruption back then

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,240
and was falsely accused of slaughtering all the demons on Shouyang Mountain.

The poison hasn't reached her heart or lungs,

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,240
That means

it only harms those who already have spiritual energy.

37
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,470
Then why did others also lose consciousness?

38
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,860
Logically,

39
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,470
the people protecting the flower should be the guards from the Prince's Mansion.

00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,840
to trust our young lady one more time.

191
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,260
Please, I implore you all.

192
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,360
I also ask everyone

193
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,560
to consider that the Sun Family

194
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,550
has always been law-abiding.

195
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,270
Please give my daughter seven days.

196
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,790
Just seven days.

197
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,200
Seven days is too long.

198
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,320
Who can guarantee

199
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,750
that you're not just buying time

200
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,000
to call for reinforcements?

201
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,000
Exactly!

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,360
Yes!

203
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,390
Don't try to fool us!

204
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,840
Letting a demon run rampant

205
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
will bring disaster.

206
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,550
Master Sun,

207
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,960
you must think carefully.

208
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,960
Everyone, please hear me out.

209
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,790
Everyone, please hear me out.

210
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,670
Everyone, please hear me out.

211
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,630
My Lord.

212
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,360
My Lord!

213
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,080
Everyone,

214
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,440
please,

215
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,030
the Sun Family has been

216
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,270
a respected household in Pingcheng.

217
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,750
I am willing

218
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,440
to use the entire Sun Family

219
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,790
to vouch

220
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,150
for my daughter, Qingcheng.

221
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,000
Please

222
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,820
give us seven days.

223
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,390
Just seven days.

224
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,750
I appreciate it in advance.

225
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,150
I appreciate it in advance.

226
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,870
I believe in Master Sun.

227
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,960
Before, when the flowers in my shop had issues,

228
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,550
it was Qingcheng who saved them.

229
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,720
I trust Qingcheng.

230
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,790
Please, everyone, give her a chance.

231
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,550
Alright then,

232
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,550
for Master Sun's sake,

233
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,030
we will give her seven days.

234
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,030
Just seven days.

235
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,080
Thank you, everyone.

236
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,320
My Lord.

237
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,910
Thank you, everyone.

238
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,200
My Lord.

239
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,960
Thank you, everyone.

240
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,630
Thank you all.

241
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,870
Thank you all.

242
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,550
We'll get it done within seven days for sure.

243
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,080
We'll get it done.

244
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,000
Thank you, everyone.

245
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,200
Thank you, everyone.

246
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,670
All of this happened because of me.

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,790
Qingcheng,

248
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,270
I will protect you no matter what.

249
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,910
I will never let you be harmed again.

250
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,790
Heavenly Emperor's Decree:

251
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,360
The demon Lyu Gengyun,

252
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,390
having had his immortal roots severed, refused to repent.

253
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,360
His demonic nature has erupted,

254
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,550
bringing disaster to the mortal world.

255
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,240
He disrupted the Floral Competition

256
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,750
and destroyed the Moonlight Peony.

257
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,360
The Flower God, Yuxiao, is ordered

258
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,870
to capture Lyu Gengyun

259
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,870
and bring him to justice under the Heavenly Laws.

260
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,420
Yuxiao accepts the decree.

261
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,750
It must have been difficult for you

262
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,000
to personally deliver this decree.

263
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,040
I am merely a Qingluan bird of the heavens.

264
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,440
Delivering the Heavenly Emperor's decree is my duty.

265
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,150
Back then,

266
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,670
I couldn't save Jiang Li.

267
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,670
Now, I cannot save Lyu Gengyun either.

268
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,510
Do you wish to see him one last time?

269
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,000
No.

270
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,790
Officially,

271
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,320
I can do nothing;

272
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,630
personally,

273
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,630
I lack the strength.

274
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,030
I don't have the courage to see him.

275
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,180
[Quoted from Guo Pu: "The Qingluan birds serve as messengers for the Queen Mother of the West and dwell in this mountain."]

276
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,180
[Qingluan, also known as Cangluan, resides on Sanwei Mountain, located 220 li west of West Mountain]

277
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,750
Wushuang.

278
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,320
Mr. Lyu.

279
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,240
Why are you here?

280
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,320
You came at the right time.

281
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,150
Quick, take a look

282
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,240
What's wrong with Wushuang?

283
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,270
When did she lose consciousness?

284
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,600
I don't know either.

285
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,500
I knocked, but no one answered.

286
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,570
So I came in directly

287
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,840
and found her unconscious.

288
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,480
What should we do?

289
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,720
Could it be because

290
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,550
she sneaked into the Prince's Mansion at night?

291
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,320
Sneaking into the Prince's Mansion at night?

292
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,150
I can no longer enter the Prince's Mansion freely,

293
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,480
so I sent Wushuang

294
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,440
to investigate the Moonlight Peony.

295
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,630
And now,

296
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,120
she just happens to fall unconscious.

297
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,870
This must be related.

298
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,120
What should we do now?

299
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,480
Take good care of her.

300
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,720
As for this matter,

301
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,080
I will definitely get to the bottom of it.

302
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,540
At such a critical moment,

303
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,840
what brings you here?

304
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,050
I came to confirm something.

305
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,620
Do you know that

306
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,790
Immortal Qingluan personally delivered the decree?

307
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,600
The Heavenly Emperor has passed judgment,

308
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,200
and you will be punished according to Heavenly Law.

309
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,750
This time, both your soul and body

310
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,550
will be completely destroyed.

311
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,320
Are you the one carrying out the punishment?

312
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,150
That's right.

313
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,550
But since you are the son of an old friend,

314
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,200
I do not wish to harm you.

315
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,600
So,

316
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,660
I hope you won't force my hand.

317
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:09,910
Besides,

318
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,480
for you,

319
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
death is an easy way out.

320
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,790
But what about Gu Qingcheng?

321
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,390
Poor Gu Qingcheng…

322
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,200
She still dreams of sharing life and death with you.

323
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,550
There's no need to provoke me.

324
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,680
I will take responsibility for everything.

325
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,920
As long as I accept the punishment,

326
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,200
Gu Qingcheng's innocence

327
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,630
will be proven,

328
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,440
and her poison will be cured.

329
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,270
Isn't that right?

330
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,630
You deliberately made me break the barrier

331
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,670
for Gu Qingcheng,

332
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,200
creating this calamity,

333
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,150
just to push me

334
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,720
toward my own doom.

335
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,360
Immortal Yuxiao.

336
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,980
Aren't you being a little too impatient?

337
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,750
You're not even pretending anymore.

338
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,120
Pretend?

339
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,850
Since you're saying this,

340
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,440
it means you have some evidence.

341
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,770
Then take a guess.

342
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,790
Where did you slip up?

343
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
I am always careful in what I do.

344
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,270
If there was a flaw,

345
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,790
it must have been due to someone under me failing to cover it up properly,

346
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,440
allowing you to discover it.

347
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,240
Since she returned injured

348
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,440
from sneaking into the Prince's Mansion at night,

349
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,670
she hasn't woken up.

350
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,720
And her hands are getting colder and colder.

351
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,200
Is she really alright?

352
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,390
Yuxiao's Red Plum Seal?

353
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,270
Wushuang.

354
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,790
Wushuang.

355
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,120
Master.

356
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,120
Master.

357
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,960
Tiandong, he...

358
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,960
It was all

359
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,200
done by him and Immortal Yuxiao.

360
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,080
What I don't understand is,

361
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,330
if you wanted me dead so badly,

362
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,000
why did you save me back then?

363
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,440
Because what I seek

364
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,550
might only be unlocked by you.

365
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,670
Me?

366
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,320
Jiang Li sealed everything our master passed down

367
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,390
within the Moon-Gazing Well.

368
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,320
The ancestral Luowei Flower Seed

369
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,550
should be there as well.

370
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,390
But no one else could open it.

371
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,360
As her son,

372
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,870
your Flower Spirit

373
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,200
should be able to resonate with it.

374
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,120
But unexpectedly,

375
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,610
your Flower Spirit merged with

376
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,280
Gu Qingcheng's vessels and meridians.

377
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,840
So your search for the Red Spider Lily was just a cover.

378
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,910
In truth, you used her to break the seal.

379
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,440
Unfortunately,

380
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,550
I didn't find the Luo Wei Flower Seed

381
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,670
in the Moon-Gazing Well.

382
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,510
Not only did you fail to retrieve the seed,

383
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,080
but Wushuang also

384
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,030
uncovered your plan.

385
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,670
So Tiandong decided to kill her to keep her silent.

386
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,770
Qingcheng, stay close.

387
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,390
Let's go!

388
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,390
Fortunately, Tiandong failed in his task.

389
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,040
Not only did Wushuang survive,

390
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,480
but we also managed to save her.

391
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,750
You didn't want your plan to be exposed,

392
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,640
so you seized the chance to suppress her memory

393
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,069
under the pretense of transferring spiritual power.

394
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,069
Only realizing it now?

395
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,720
Isn't that a little too late?

396
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,350
Don't worry.

397
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,750
I won't let you die in my hands just yet.

398
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,400
If I did, Gu Qingcheng

399
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,480
would start to distrust me.

400
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,350
She shares my passion

401
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,790
and dedication to flowers.

402
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,440
I hope she can become a flower fairy under my guidance.

403
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,960
Her future

404
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,440
holds great promise.

405
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,110
Is it truly a bright future,

406
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,590
or are you just using her for your own gain?

407
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,000
You should be grateful

408
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,960
that I have plans for her.

409
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,720
Even more so,

410
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,960
be grateful that she still knows nothing.

411
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,400
Because if she were to find out,

412
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,000
no matter how talented she is,

413
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,750
she would be doomed.

414
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,030
Are you threatening me?

415
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,680
Yes, I am.

416
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,750
You'd better not touch her.

417
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,350
And you'd better not go against me.

418
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,960
Otherwise,

419
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,350
both of you are as good as dead.

420
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:04,000
[Qingcheng Flower Nursery]

421
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,270
Master, you're back.

422
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,030
Go ahead with your work.

423
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,780
Master has returned.

424
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,510
If I tell Qingcheng

425
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,080
that everything was Flowers Immortal Lord's doing,

426
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,440
her lifelong dream would shatter.

427
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,790
Perhaps it's better to let her discover the truth

428
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,880
on her own.

429
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,750
Qingcheng.

430
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,440
Master.

431
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,160
The demonic markings and blotches on your face are gone

432
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,830
I transferred the poison from my face

433
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,200
into the withering flower petals.

434
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,960
Earlier, when I pricked the poison spots with a silver needle,

435
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,200
the blood was bright red,

436
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
but the toxins wouldn't drain out.

437
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,920
Since they wouldn't leave through the blood,

438
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,400
I figured they might follow spiritual power instead.

439
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,220
So I used recently wilted petals,

440
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,350
ones that still retained some spiritual power, as a conduit.

441
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,590
I thought it might work.

442
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,030
Using flowers as a conduit?

443
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,070
I threaded flower petals onto the silver needle,

444
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,960
then pierced the poison spots again.

445
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,200
The poison reacted to the presence of spiritual power

446
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,000
and was absorbed into the petals.

447
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,030
This way,

448
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,550
once you extract the toxins from the petals,

449
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,310
you'll be able to track down whoever poisoned you.

450
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,200
Master, you had the same idea as me.

451
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,920
So,

452
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,270
you are boiling the poisoned petals in water.

453
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,640
As the water heats,

454
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,310
the steam condenses.

455
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,310
The filtration process leaves larger particles

456
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,350
on the filter.

457
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,750
After two filtrations,

458
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,960
the larger impurities stayed on the fine cloth,

459
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,240
while the smaller ones stuck to the kettle's inner wall.

460
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,960
That's right.

461
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,830
The filtered residue

462
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,750
is the toxin itself.

463
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,830
This method was something my father taught me.

464
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,440
It's used to extract key essences from flowers.

465
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,960
This poison has a scent similar to

466
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,790
that of the butterfly bush.

467
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,920
But while the butterfly bush is toxic,

468
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,830
on its own, it wouldn't be potent enough

469
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,070
to harm both the Moonlight Peony and you.

470
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,680
There must be other poisons mixed in.

471
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,680
Yes, there's another herbal scent.

472
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,030
It's cold in nature,

473
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,830
and slightly bitter

474
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,070
with a sweet aftertaste.

475
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,720
But there are many herbs that match these traits.

476
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,680
I can't identify it right away.

477
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,920
You knew it was poisonous.

478
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,030
Why did you taste it yourself?

479
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,240
It's fine.

480
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,480
Didn't I already figure out a way

481
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,680
to expel the poison?

482
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,310
What's going on?

483
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,830
Why is the poison powder disappearing

484
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,480
as soon as it falls onto the table?

485
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,970
Chinese asparagus, when combined with butterfly bush,

486
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,440
produces a bitter-tasting powder with a cold nature.

487
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,270
It scatters in the wind

488
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,400
and dissolves into the earth upon contact.

489
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,310
That's why the powder

490
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,030
on the table disappeared that day.

491
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,490
It was Chinese asparagus.

492
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,790
Your Excellency,

493
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,510
they will soon trace everything

494
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,960
back to us.

495
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,030
We must act swiftly

496
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,400
and wipe them all out.

497
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,750
We?

498
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,710
How dare you think you're worthy of being mentioned alongside me?

499
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,200
I spoke out of turn

500
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,070
in a moment of haste.

501
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,550
Please punish me, Your Excellency.

502
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,030
However,

503
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,640
Lyu Gengyun's body

504
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,680
is deteriorating.

505
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,070
There's no need for you to handle him personally.

506
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,590
Just give the word,

507
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,440
and I will deal with him for you.

508
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,590
Stop trying to act clever.

509
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,960
Lyu Gengyun

510
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,350
won't die by your hands.

511
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,030
Then what is your intention, Your Excellency?

512
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,110
I won't let him die

513
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,790
while Gu Qingcheng still loves him.

514
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,920
Otherwise,

515
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:34,850
he'll live forever

516
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,670
in Gu Qingcheng's heart.

517
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,790
I really never thought it would be Tiandong.

518
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,270
But thinking carefully,

519
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,510
it does make sense.

520
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:51,030
He was originally a thousand-year-old Chinese asparagus plant
that transformed into human form.

521
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,400
Besides him,

522
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,020
no one else could possess such potent toxicity from Chinese asparagus.

523
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,640
So it must have been him.

524
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,720
I just don't understand.

525
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,000
Why would he want to harm me?

526
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,960
Master,

527
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,960
are you listening to me?

528
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,070
I am listening.

529
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,510
All your questions

530
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,310
will be answered tomorrow.

531
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,160
You've been exhausted lately.

532
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,510
Rest well.

533
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,200
Master,

534
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,160
can you stay and talk with me for a while?

535
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,310
Okay, I'll stay until

536
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,400
you fall asleep.

537
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,480
Master.

538
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,480
Once the Moonlight Peony issue is resolved,

539
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,880
let's travel across the land together.

540
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,550
I don't want to care about

541
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,680
immortals or demons anymore.

542
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,830
I just want

543
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,960
a world with only the two of us,

544
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,720
witnessing all the beauty of this world.

545
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,240
Sounds good, Master?

546
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,400
Alright.

547
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,030
Once the Moonlight Peony matter is settled,

548
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,510
we'll set off immediately.

549
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,000
I'll take you to see every breathtaking landscape

550
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,880
in the land.

551
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,720
Master broke through the barrier to save Qingcheng,

552
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,030
causing the Red Spider Lily to wither.

553
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,830
Because of this, he can no longer

554
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,270
suppress his demonic aura.

555
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,110
It's only a matter of time

556
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,400
before he falls into madness,

557
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,440
or even dies.

558
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,440
Qingcheng asking Master

559
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,440
to travel the world with her now

560
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,550
is because...

561
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,030
She's trying to send him off on his final journey.

562
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,310
Perhaps,

563
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,270
Master already knows.

564
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,310
Why would

565
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,920
a common rosary pea

566
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,880
summon me

567
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,880
with such powerful force?

568
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,480
I don't know either.

569
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,400
It was once stained with your blood.

570
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,590
Could that be the reason?

571
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,000
What do you think?

572
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,270
That can't be.

573
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,200
My powers aren't that strong.

574
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,960
A few drops of blood wouldn't cause such a reaction.

575
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,830
Then perhaps

576
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,350
it's just a coincidence.

577
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,720
Or maybe

578
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,110
Heaven heard my prayers.

579
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,350
What matters now

580
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,550
is that you're awake.

581
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,160
All you need to do is

582
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,720
take your medicine properly

583
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,830
and nurse your body back to health.

584
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,110
Take your medicine properly.

585
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,160
It's sweet.

586
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,720
I added two spoonfuls of honey,

587
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,480
just in case

588
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,920
you couldn't bear the bitterness.

589
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:37,680
Here.

590
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,590
Be careful, it's hot.

591
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,220
♫Hey, baby♫

592
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,430
Your eyes are wide open.

593
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,010
♫It's already late♫

594
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,200
How can you fall asleep like that?

595
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,870
♫Don't say a word♫

596
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,240
Well,

597
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,200
Master, you should sing me a song.

598
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,430
♫I'll pat you to sleep♫

599
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,240
I don't know how to sing.

600
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,200
Liar.

601
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,790
You do.

602
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,830
I really don't.

603
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,400
Just sing one, please.

604
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,990
♫Hey, baby♫

605
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,930
♫You and I both know this world♫

606
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,240
Alright,

607
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,940
♫Is full of chaos♫

608
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,960
I'll sing you

609
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,680
♫Stay by my side, won't you?♫

610
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,270
a nursery rhyme

611
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,920
my mother used to sing when I was little.

612
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,240
♫I want, within the limited time of life♫

613
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,000
♫Sit cross-legged♫

614
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,580
♫To love you for every extra second and minute♫

615
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,750
♫For three years♫

616
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,590
♫Tame the dragon and subdue the tiger♫

617
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,300
♫There's so much to say♫

618
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,600
♫So much to do♫

619
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,350
♫Rein in the horse and calm the ape♫

620
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,060
♫I want to see what the future looks like♫

621
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,160
♫Heart like water♫

622
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,370
♫I want, in the infinite possibilities ahead♫

623
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,030
♫Breath like silk♫

624
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:40,510
♫Not a mere immortal, but a true sage♫

625
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,630
♫To hold you for another day, another year♫

626
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,960
♫Sit cross-legged♫

627

♫In our own way♫

628
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:50,330
♫We'll write our own story♫

629
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,200
♫For three years♫

630
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,550

♫Rein in the horse and calm the ape♫

632
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,590
♫Heart like water♫

633
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,110
Gu Qingcheng,

634
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,030
why have you come?

635
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,510
Your Highness,

636
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,030
I came today

637
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,240
to inform you

638
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,720
that the true culprit

639
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,070
behind the chaos

640
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,720
at the Floral Competition

641
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,940
has been found.

642
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,000
The Flowers Immortal Lord has already brought

643
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,920
his unruly disciple, Tiandong, to confess before me.

644
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,680
It was he who concocted the poison

645
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,920
that made you and the Moonlight Peony

646
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,110
appear as demonic creatures in front of everyone.

647
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,200
Then why was I the only one who transformed?

648
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,240
The other attendants in the Prince's Mansion merely fainted

649
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,200
but did not suffer the same symptoms as me.

650
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,550
Of course I

651
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,310
poisoned you differently.

652
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,550
Otherwise, how could I make you look like

653
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,030
the demon responsible for their collapse?

654
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,400
I have no grudge against you.

655
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,680
Why would you do this to me?

656
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,510
Because I was jealous of you.

657
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,790
You're so young, yet you were able to cultivate the Moonlight Peony

658
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,640
and gain the Immortal Lord's favor.

659
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,640
But despite my utmost effort,

660
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,650
I could only remain beneath others,

661
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,240
unseen and unnoticed.

662
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,350
Tiandong,

663
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,830
even now,

664
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,480
you still show no remorse.

665
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,750
Tiandong,

666
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,000
did anyone instruct you

667
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,000
to do this?

668
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,780
I take full responsibility for my actions.

669
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,720
Kill me or torture me

670
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,420
as you wish.

671
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,920
Your Highness,

672
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,640
I have no authority over mortal affairs.

673
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,960
According to human law,

674
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,920
how should he be punished?

675
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,640
By law,

676
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,000
he should be executed.

677
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,400
Then I ask Your Highness

678
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,750
to act justly.

679
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,160
As you wish, Immortal Lord.

680
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,160
Guards!

681
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,720
Take Tiandong away.

682
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,110
His execution shall be scheduled.
