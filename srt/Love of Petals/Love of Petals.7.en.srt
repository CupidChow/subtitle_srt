00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,170
[Love of Petals]

2
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,170
[Episode 7]

3
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,200
Lyu Gengyun, you're indeed capable.

4
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,590
You saw through it in such a short time.

5
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,510
Unfortunately,

6
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,930
you can't

7
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,560
crack it.

8
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,039
Ya Zi,

9
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,630
I'll avenge you

10
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,340
for what happened on the 7th day of March of the lunar calendar.

11
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,560
Master,

12
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,470
help!

13
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,280
Gu Qingcheng?

14
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,210
Why is there a mess?

15
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,530
Master.

16
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,840
Master.

17
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,360
Gu Qingcheng!

18
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,750
Master.

19
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,800
Master.

20
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,200
Without the Flower Spirit,

21
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,060
my spiritual power is increasingly unstable.

22
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,630
Master.

23
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,590
Master.

24
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,590
Master.

25
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,280
Where are we?

26
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,000
Where is this place?

27
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,430
This is...

28
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,030
What's going on here?

29
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,280
Why have all these people become like this?

30
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,400
Gu Qingcheng,

31
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,400
you need to leave here first.

32
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,520
Master,

33
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,870
why are there strange meridians appearing on your body?

34
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,750
Leave here.

35
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,920
I'll tell you what happened later.

36
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,250
Master, are you feeling unwell?

37
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,830
Were you injured just now?

38
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,460
Gu Qingcheng!

39
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,560
You can't help me.

40
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,940
Master,

41
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,510
leave with me.

42
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,070
Go.

43
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:47,950
Master.

44
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,110
Don't you understand?

45
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,920
Master, aren't you coming with me?

46
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,120
Leave now.

47
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,070
Go home.

48
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,160
Why was Master full of anger suddenly?

49
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,380
In addition, he was so...

50
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,070
Pingkang.

51
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,920
Qingcheng, what are you doing here?

52
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,310
I finally found you.

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,680
Why did you come to the Tianxiang House?

54
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,870
There is something strange here.

55
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,170
Stop talking. We need to leave quickly.

56
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,930
Lyu Gengyun has fallen into the trap.

57
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,430
I think you two mortals

58
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,159
won't be able to make any trouble.

59
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
I should go back and help Master.

60
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,560
Where are we?

61
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,270
I don't know.

62
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,140
Pingkang, what's that sound?

63
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,510
What's this?

64
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,430
Why is there blood?

65
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,920
Let's take a look.

66
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:14,600
Okay.

67
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,160
Miss.

68
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,950
It is cruel.

69
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,920
Pingkang, I can't open it.

70
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,830
She's dangerous.

71
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,630
What demon has lured me here?

72
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,159
Lyu Gengyun,

73
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,190
I shouldn't underestimate you.

74
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,030
What a pity!

75
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,990
Though you have broken through my illusion,

76
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,120
you can't resist the power of my Poisonous Spider Silk.

77
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,920
If you don't show up,

78
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,920
I'll destroy the Tianxiang House.

79
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,510
Lyu Gengyun,

80
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,000
your demonic aura can no longer be suppressed.

81
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,720
I was wondering why this Tianxiang House reeks of fox.

82
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,870
It turns out that the mastermind

83
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,890
is a Jade-Eyed Fox.

84
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,159
Naughty.

85
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,610
[Shan Xiao, ape demon ]

86
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,030
[It's called Shan Xiao. When people throw bamboo into the fire, bamboo will burst. The sound would scare Shanxiao, the ape demon. It would flee.]

87
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,030
[Shan Xiao is a kind of beast in the deep mountain in the west. He is not that tall. Shan Xiao is fearless of people. If people offend him, he will give them chills and fever.]

88
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This is a deer demon,

89
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,600
which is extremely dangerous.

90
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,750
She's badly injured.

91
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,960
How can she be dangerous?

92
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,240
Demon is also a living being.

93
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,040
Yes.

94
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,680
But we can't let her go.

95
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,440
You can do it.

96
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,940
[Shi Huai, a thousand-year-old bird demon]

97
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,360
Hurry.

98
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,390
Slow down.

99
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,790
Hold on, Miss.

100
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,200
Come on.

101
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,790
Open the door.

102
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,840
-Miss.
-Miss.

103
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,480
Miss, wake up.

104
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,600
Miss.

105
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,630
Miss.

106
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,360
Miss.

107
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,550
Let go.

108
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,630
We're not bad people.

109
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,910
We're not bad people.

110
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,240
We're not bad people.

111
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,510
We're here to help you.

112
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,530
We're here to help you.

113
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,140
Let go. Let go.

114
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,910
Pingkang, are you okay?

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,790
Master?

116
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,750
Why do you have the smell of Master?

117
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,720
What did you do to him?

118
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,720
Who's your master?

119
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,210
Her master is

120
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,500
Lyu Gengyun.

121
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,160
Say it!

122
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,670
I didn't do anything to him.

123
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,840
I came with Master to look for Pingkang.

124
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,150
Master is here too?

125
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,600
I was

126
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,670
trapped by spider silk just now.

127
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,670
Master arrived in time and saved me.

128
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,580
Spider silk?

129
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,390
Oh no!

130
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,360
What's wrong?

131
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,000
The spider silk is highly poisonous.

132
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,000
It's a trap

133
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,660
for Master.

134
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,090
What?

135
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:16,800
Miss.

136
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,790
Lyu Gengyun,

137
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,510
my Poisonous Spider Silk is powerful, right?

138
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,270
Every time you use your spiritual power,

139
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,200
you'll suffer like ants gnaw your bones and heart.

140
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,440
It feels bad, right?

141
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,050
By the way,

142
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,470
did your mother

143
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,980
tell you

144
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:47,120
what exactly happened on the 7th day of March of the lunar calendar?

145
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,150
Shut up!

146
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,670
Well, then,

147
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,390
let me tell you about it.

148
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,840
You, the Demon King's son, are indeed powerful.

149
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,320
Stop trying to escape.

150
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,390
The more you use your inner strength,

151
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,840
the more it will backfire on you.

152
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,670
Anyway,

153
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,170
you're doomed.

154
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,410
I can kill you

155
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,440
easily.

156
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,320
Master,

157
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,480
the spider silk is poisonous.

158
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,270
Flower Spirit?

159
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,000
How could this be?

160
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,240
Master.

161
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,000
Master.

162
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,240
How is it?

163
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,160
Master.

164
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,480
What happened to me?

165
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,440
What happened?

166
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,790
Lyu Gengyun's Flower Spirit

167
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,200
is in the body of that girl.

168
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,480
Master,

169
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,420
we can't kill them now.

170
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,790
We shouldn't linger in battle.

171
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,080
Leave here now.

172
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,260
Master.

173
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,890
You killed so many citizens of Pingcheng.

174
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,040
How could I let you go so easily?

175
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,800
Stop!

176
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,670
How dare you cross the line

177
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,600
to capture demons?

178
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,790
Lyu Gengyun,

179
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,360
don't celebrate too soon.

180
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,840
Many people died because of you.

181
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,560
Someone will kill you on our behalf.

182
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,920
Lyu Gengyun.

183
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,670
Immortal Qin Shan.

184
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,440
You came at just the right time, huh?

185
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,000
Lyu Gengyun,

186
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,630
do you

187
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,740
remember who you are?

188
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,840
Who am I?

189
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,050
You came here right after

190
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,790
I found out

191
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
the culprit of the Tianxiang House incident.

192
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,240
You're good at taking advantage of others' work.

193
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,840
You're a half-demon.

194
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,000
I didn't expect that you could survive

195
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,200
after your spiritual root was destroyed.

196
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,440
You don't repent

197
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,070
or focus on cultivation

198
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,620
but wander in the world of mortals.

199
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,070
What do you want to do?

200
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,670
None of your business.

201
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,670
Half-demon?

202
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,120
Isn't Master

203
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,680
the Flowers Immortal Lord?

204
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,990
Show some respect.

205
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,510
I have been ordered to guard the Heavenly Gate

206
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,390
for the peace of all worlds.

207
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,550
I will fulfill my duties diligently.

208
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,000
If there are any destabilizing factors,

209
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,550
I will intervene,

210
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,460
especially you

211
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,120
and these demons.

212
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,510
We didn't do anything evil.

213
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:17,840
We…

214
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,390
We were captured here.

215
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,290
Excuses.

216
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,840
Your Excellency,

217
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
I can testify for them.

218
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,080
They

219
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,510
do not have evil intentions.

220
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,750
Who are you?

221
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,360
I'm just a citizen of Pingcheng.

222
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,440
But I can testify that

223
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,120
these minor demons were all

224
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,240
captured by a powerful demon and imprisoned in the Tianxiang House.

225
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,870
They are innocent.

226
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,840
Nevertheless,

227
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,870
they followed the Jade-Eyed Fox

228
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,080
and made trouble in the area.

229
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,910
Shouldn't they be punished?

230
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,480
Is there a reward for

231
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,670
you immortals to catch demons?

232
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,800
Why do you make things difficult for them?

233
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,600
Nonsense!

234
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,630
I am carrying out Heaven's will

235
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,190
to eliminate threats to human beings.

236
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,950
I was a Lonely Bird.

237
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,790
I was captured and abused by the Jade-Eyed Fox.

238
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,480
He forced me to entertain others.

239
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,240
When we were suffering torment,

240
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,600
where were you immortals?

241
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,480
Qiansi controlled us with poison,

242
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,910
forcing us to nourish her with mortals' essence.

243
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,480
If we were the least bit careless,

244
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,790
she would beat us up,

245
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,270
almost killing us.

246
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,670
Your Excellency,

247
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:23,650
did you

248
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,030
ever think of coming to rescue us?

249
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,910
The Jade-Eyed Fox has been doing evil for so long,

250
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
why didn't you immortals

251
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,960
come to punish him?

252
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,630
Your Excellency,

253
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,720
please give them another chance.

254
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,030
They

255
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,570
won't do this again.

256
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,160
I will investigate what the Jade-Eyed Fox has done

257
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,190
and punish him severely.

258
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,830
But right now, you demons have no master.

259
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,670
Considering the safety of the people,

260
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,670
I will not have mercy on you.

261
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,000
Who says they do not have a master?

262
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,450
I, Lyu Gengyun,

263
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,609
will be their new master.

264
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,680
Are you determined to be my enemy?

265
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,750
I never want to be anyone's enemy.

266
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,350
Qin Shan,

267
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,650
it's widely known that you're upright and impartial,

268
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,790
and you are strict in enforcing the law.

269
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,700
They've been beaten and abused.

270
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,700
It could be considered as atonement for their sins.

271
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,010
What about handing them over to me?

272
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,940
If they commit any crimes,

273
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,950
you can punish them then.

274
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,870
Alright.

275
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,880
You offered to vouch for them.

276
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,240
If these demons

277
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,830
cause any trouble

278
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,020
and endanger the world of mortals,

279
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,170
you should bear the responsibility.

280
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,720
It's a deal.

281
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,460
Why did Master deceive me?

282
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,920
I trusted him so much.

283
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,400
He knew

how much I longed to meet the Flowers Immortal Lord.

I

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,400
had caught the eye of the Jade-Eyed Fox.

341
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,750
He knew that I love eating precious herbs.

342
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,110
So, he deliberately used the Black-jointed Grass as bait to trap me.

I noticed something was wrong

344
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,270

345
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,590

352
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,400

355

You can go back first.

379
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,680
Forget it, Pingkang.

380
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,280
He's now

381
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,750
the leader of demons.

382
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,640
Naturally, he looks down on

383
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,690
our flower garden.

384
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,000
Mr. Lyu is not that kind of person...

385
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,270
demon.

386
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,660
Then, let's take the lady back first.

387
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,200
Let's go.

388
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,400
Let's go.

389
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,450
Qingcheng.

390
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:42,990
I'm sorry.

391
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,720
It's all because of me

392
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,640
that you and Mr. Lyu

393
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,400
are in such an awkward situation.

394
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,100
If it weren't for me...

395
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,240
Pingkang,

396
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,640
what you said is wrong.

397
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,750
This isn't your fault.

398
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,830
What are you thinking about?

399
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,000
Are you thinking about Mr. Lyu?

400
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,030
No.

401
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,960
I'm not thinking about him.

402
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,880
Pingkang,

403
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,510
when do you think

404
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,310
I can meet the real Flowers Immortal Lord?

405
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,510
When will I...

406
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,830
You will.

407
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,720
Yes.

408
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,590
Her clothes are covered in blood.

409
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,790
What should we do?

410
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:32,590
Never mind.

411
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,110
I'll go to the Sun's Mansion later and get her new clothes.

412
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,070
They have left?

413
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,680
You just let her leave?

414
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,750
All my life,

415
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,200
I've never kept anyone.

416
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,640
You lost your Flower Spirit.

417
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,790
You must have lost a lot of energy in the intensive battle.

418
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,110
And you've been poisoned by the Spider Venom.

419
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,000
You should go to the flower garden at the Sun's Mansion to recover.

420
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,850
Why didn't you go with them?

421
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,830
I'm not the supreme immortal in her heart.

422
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,550
I'm just a despicable demon.

423
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,400
She surely doesn't want me to go back.

424
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,320
Women are soft-hearted.

425
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,510
Why don't you apologize?

426
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,270
Apologize?

427
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,270
Yes.

428
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,410
You hid the truth in the first place.

429
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,920
You should say sorry to her.

430
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,160
You think so highly of her.

431
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,000
Why don't you go back with her?

432
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,200
I have to follow you.

433
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,330
It has been five hundred years.

434
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,060
I've watched you bloom.

435
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,040
Then, you should follow her back to the Sun's Mansion

436
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,830
to keep an eye on her.

437
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,830
After all, my Flower Spirit is in her body.

438
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,550
To restore my immortal root,

439
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,220
the Flower Spirit is crucial.

440
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,680
There must be no mistakes.

441
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,070
Well...

442
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,680
You know,

443
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,060
it has been so long

444
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,750
but you haven't told me

445
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,000
what exactly you're restoring the immortal root for.

446
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,750
Do you want to fight back to Heaven?

447
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,480
I am curious.

448
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,400
I am just curious.

449
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,790
With

450
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,240
your cultivation,

451
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,270
not to mention the past,

452
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,350
even now,

453
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,350
few men could be your match.

454
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,400
And the minor demons of the Tianxiang House

455
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,030
are your subordinates.

456
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,830
Are you going to follow your father's path

457
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,920
to be the Demon King?

458
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,440
I just want

459
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,160
to know the truth.

460
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,790
By the way,

461
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,960
did your mother tell you

462
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,240
what exactly happened on the 7th day of March of the lunar calendar?

463
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,960
Let's go.

464
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,260
My Lord.

465
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,240
Why are you still here?

466
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,720
My Lord,

467
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,170
from now on,

468
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,480
you are our master.

469
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,680
I said I would be your master

470
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,920
in front of Qin Shan

471
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,210
just to save you guys.

472
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,830
Now you are free.

473
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,540
You can go wherever you want.

474
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,440
We'll

475
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,480
follow you.

476
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,400
Sir,

477
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,750
the Tianxiang House was destroyed.

478
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,590
We have no shelter,

479
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,030
and our lives are in danger.

480
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,880
Please let us follow you.

481
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,640
My Lord,

482
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,550
you are kind to us.

483
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,640
We'll follow you from now on.

484
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,720
If you disagree,

485
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,510
we won't get up.

486
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,550
Mr. Lyu said

487
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,200
he would come back to pick up this lady

488
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,480
after they find a new place to stay.

489
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,720
Should we

490
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,650
help them look for a place?

491
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,500
No.

492
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,400
Are you still angry with Mr. Lyu

493
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,720
as he deceived you?

494
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,550
Or are you still bothered

495
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,590
that he's a demon?

496
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,590
What he is has nothing to do with me.

497
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,920
He's

498
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,880
a liar.

499
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,400
Mr. Lyu and I were strangers.

500
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,160
His spiritual power is so high.

501
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,510
But

502
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
he was willing to do so many things

503
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,550
to prove my innocence.

504
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:45,990
I think

505
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,640
you know

506
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,310
him better than I do.

507
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,550
I...

508
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,350
Though he deceived you,

509
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,000
he was by your side.

510
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,440
I think

511
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,400
he must have some reasons.

512
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,160
How is it?

513
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,270
How much longer do we have to walk?

514
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,750
We're almost there.

515
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,820
Okay, okay.

516
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,920
Shi Huai,

517
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,310
you need to keep an eye on Hong.

518
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,830
Don't let it fall or get hurt.

519
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,790
You don't care about all this luggage

520
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,000
but a chicken?

521
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,070
It's my dude who accompanied me.

522
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,030
One day, it will also succeed in cultivation.

523
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,480
Okay.

524
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,960
Master, I don't understand

525
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,720
why we are moving to this place?

526
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,350
The Tianxiang House

527
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,200
was too conspicuous in the bustling city.

528
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,070
Your master

529
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,960
is afraid that you'll be exposed.

530
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,680
He found a quiet place

531
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,640
where everyone can relax.

532
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,680
Master is thoughtful.

533
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:09,920
Here we are.

534
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,510
Look to the right.

535
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:17,880
Great!

536
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,960
Great!

537
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,130
Good. That's wonderful!

538
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,330
There are so many flowers here!

539
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,130
Well done.

540
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,880
It took me a long time to find such a place.

541
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,350
Master, is...

542
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,680
Is this our new home?

543
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,750
It's a place

544
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,350
close to mountains and waters, having a mild climate.

545
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,840
It's very suitable for you.

546
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:55,790
Yes.

547
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,590
From now on,

548
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,960
we will dedicate our life

549
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,000
to serving you.

550
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,070
We will obey your every word from now on.

551
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,830
Thank you for giving us a home.

552
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,350
Please stand up.

553
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,680
There's a saying in the world of mortals.

554
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,830
A man's dignity is as valuable as gold.

555
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,110
It also can be applied to demons.

556
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,550
I saved you

557
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,790
because I want you

558
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,400
to live with dignity,

559
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,400
not to bow and scrape

560
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,960
to anyone.

561
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,960
Get up.

562
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,790
We will do as you say, Master.

563
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,640
I have only one requirement

564
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,380
for all of you.

565
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,720
Do no evil.

566
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,160
We will follow your words, Master.

567
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,830
