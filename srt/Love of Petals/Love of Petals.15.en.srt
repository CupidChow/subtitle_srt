00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,190
[Love of Petals]

2
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,150
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,420
How can I return the Flower Spirit to you?

4
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,430
How did you know that

5
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,120
my flower spirit is within you?

6
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,770
Drink this cup of tea,

7
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,240
and I'll escort you back.

8
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,540
That day in the Cave Paradise,

9
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,990
after I drank the tea given to me by the Flower Immortal,

10
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,840
I saw…

11
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,120
Master?

12
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,280
Wait a moment.

13
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,050
I'm not Lyu Gengyun.

14
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,190
I am the Flower Spirit.

15
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,680
But in your inner world,

16
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,840
I've taken his form, that's all.

17
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,560
Flower Spirit?

18
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,750
Is this within my inner world?

19
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,560
Have you forgotten?

20
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,650
Back when Lyu Gengyun was still a peony,

21
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,770
you absorbed me into your body.

22
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,910
So,

23
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,630
it was at that moment...

24
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,190
If you still can't remember,

25
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,630
he'll die.

26
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,960
What do you mean?

27
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,520
The Flower Spirit's function

28
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,150
is to absorb the spiritual energy of nature.

29
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,310
His immortal root was already damaged;

30
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,960
losing the Flower Spirit

31
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,150
would make it nearly impossible to replenish his spiritual energy.

32
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Once it is depleted,

33
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,800
he will surely die.

34
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,310
Master never told me about this.

35
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,079
Then,

36
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,030
did he tell you

37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,120
how to return you to him?

38
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,750
I am already bound to your bloodline.

39
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,910
If you forcibly remove me,

40
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,680
your essence will flow in reverse,

41
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,280
your five senses will be lost,

42
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,750
and you'll become a hollow body with only a heartbeat remaining.

43
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:48,800
Maybe he just

44
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,390
didn't want you to suffer a fate worse than death.

45
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,079
The Flower Spirit is inside me,

46
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,400
but I don't feel anything.

47
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,680
It has neither helped nor hindered me.

48
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
Why would removing it have such dire consequences?

49
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,480
How could it be useless?

50
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,520
Mortals struggle to cultivate immortality.

51
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,280
You searched for so many paths to cultivate immortality

52
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
and failed to take even the first step,

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,430
yet after meeting Lyu Gengyun,

54
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,280
your progress skyrocketed.

55
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,170
That's because I've been helping you.

56
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,510
Then…

57
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,690
Will growing the Moonlight Peony

58
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,560
save Master?

59
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,310
Qingcheng!

60
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,560
Qingcheng!

61
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,190
Enough.

62
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,630
You should go back now.

63
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,810
When I opened my eyes again,

64
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,000
I was already back at the Mountain God's Mansion.

65
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,560
I never expected

66
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
you to be able to communicate with my flower spirit.

67
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,600
It seems your connection to immortality

68
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,920
is deepening.

69
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,740
One day, you will surely fulfill your wish

70
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,100
and attain the path of the Flower Immortal.

71
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,000
Master,

72
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,360
if I achieve immortality sooner,

73
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,510
does that mean I can return the Flower Spirit

74
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,870
to you sooner?

75
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,220
Haven't you already obtained the Qionghua Twig?

76
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,510
If you successfully grow the Moonlight Peony

77
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,030
and transplant its roots to me, that will be enough.

78
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,260
Master,

79
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,630
I will make sure it grows.

80
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,820
I'll start planting it as soon as I return to the flower nursery.

81
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,270
Master,

82
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,950
let me fetch you some water first.

83
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,720
It seems

84
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,860
I don't have much time left.

85
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,390
[May the children be safe and everything goes as they wish.]

86
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,310
Look,

87
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,480
do you know this character?

88
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,430
It's "write."

89
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,720
Smart.

90
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,460
Take it over.

91
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,240
The rice cake is here.

92
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,980
This color looks really nice,

93
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,680
so vibrant and festive.

94
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,830
Master,

95
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,680
you're finally back.

96
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,380
Are you tired?

97
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,190
Put the wine on the side.

98
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,120
That's good enough.

99
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,390
Good.

100
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,270
Pingkang.

101
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,040
Let it get closer to you.

102
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,510
Put it here.

103
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,750
Qingcheng.

104
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,000
Master.

105
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,830
Master is back.

106
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,190
Master,

107
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,320
did you find the Qionghua Twig?

108
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Yes.

109
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,720
That's good.

110
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,630
I thought

111
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,430
you wouldn't make it back in time for the New Year celebration.

112
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,480
Why are there

113
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,830
so many red fabric strips here?

114
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,680
Young Master Sun arranged them.

115
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,790
He said that

116
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,740
if we write our New Year wishes on the red strips

117
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,770
and hang them on the tree,

118
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,970
they will all come true.

119
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,430
This is

120
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,390
the first New Year we're celebrating together;

121
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,040
we have to make it lively!

122
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,830
Yes!

123
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,600
So what are your

124
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,660
New Year wishes?

125
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,950
As for me,

126
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,240
I hope that

127
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,560
I can travel far and wide

128
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,360
with Lan An next year.

129
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,870
I just wish for

130
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,800
everyone to be safe and healthy.

131
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,360
What about you, Wuyuzi?

132
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,440
I hope that every New Year,

133
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,430
we

134
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,420
can all be together like this—happy and joyful.

135
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,800
The nine of us,

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,310
not one less.

137
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,820
What about you, Shan Xiao?

138
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,270
I...

139
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,920
I want to find a beautiful wife this year.

140
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,800
Shan Xiao has enlightened!

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,159
-That's a good wish.
-What about Pingkang?

142
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,360
Wushuang's wish

143
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,159
is my wish.

144
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,870
My wish

145
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,540
is

146
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,080
for my master to be safe and sound.

147
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,920
I also hope that Master

148
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
will overcome adversity and find good fortune.

149
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,040
We all hope Master stays safe

150
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,000
and sound.

151
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,240
I hope Master will be safe

152
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,560
and sound.

153
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,720
Well...

154
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,750
Isn't anyone going to ask about my wish?

155
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,310
I'll keep it simple.

156
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,510
My first wish

157
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,830
is for everyone to stay healthy

158
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,880
and live a long life—

159
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,360
uh, a thousand…

160
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,070
no, ten thousand years!

161
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,750
My second wish

162
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,870
is for less conflict in the Three Realms,

163
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,880
so fewer innocent lives will be lost.

164
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,430
My third wish

165
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,950
is for Immortal Qingluan

166
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,570
to give me more treasures

167
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,640
and more personal space.

168
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,080
I don't want to be summoned and dismissed at will all the time.

169
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,030
As for my fourth wish,

170
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,840
I want...

171
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,240
This is delicious too.

172
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,510
Here, try this. You should eat too.

173
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,150
Eat more.

174
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,790
I wasn't finished talking, why are you...

175
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,630
Try this.

176
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,120
It's delicious.

177
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,200
This is for you.

178
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
It's snowing!

179
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:07,960
It's said that

180
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,420
wishes made during the first snow

181
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,550
are more likely to come true.

182
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,250
Master,

183
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,600
what's your wish?

184
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,240
My wish

185
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,050
is right before my eyes.

186
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,150
I'm hanging up.

187
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,180
Alright, put me down.

188
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,600
Master,

189
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,030
I can see that

190
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,630
the spiritual energy within you is faint,

191
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,270
and I fear it may be difficult for you to maintain your human form.

192
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,160

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,560
It can isolate all the heat.

378
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,790
Your body hasn't fully recovered yet,

379
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,070
and you used your spiritual power again.

380
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,400
Don't worry.

381
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,650
As the Moonlight Peony gradually recovers,

382
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,510
so will I.

383
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,920
Really?

384
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,810
Stop overthinking.

385
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,310
Come with me

386
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,950
to the swing and let's talk.

387
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,480
Master,

388
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,510
after I

389
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,200
win first place in the Floral Competition,

390
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,110
I'll be able to transplant

391
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,160
the Moonlight Peony's roots to you!

392
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,680
Then,

393
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,070
we can travel the world.

394
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,350
I want to watch the sunrise over the sea

395
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,590
and

396
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,330
see the aurora in the desert.

397
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,880
Or we could stay close

398
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,720
and go to West Lake

399
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,310
to listen to the rain—that sounds nice too.

400
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,960
Okay,

401
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,220
then let's go to West Lake first

402
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,630
to listen to the rain,

403
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,950
then watch the sunrise.

404
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,200
And then head to the desert.

405
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,150
I want to plant the Azure Cloud Flower

406
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,440
in every place we visit.

407
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,110
Master,

408
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,830
I also want to learn

409
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,160
how to cook the local delicacies from every place we visit

410
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,240
and make them for you.

411
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,020
Though I don't know if I can learn them all.

412
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,000
Master,

413
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,590
which dish do you like the most?

414
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,410
Master.

415
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,770
Master?

416
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,240
What's wrong with you?

417
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,790
I'm fine.

418
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,550
It seems that

419
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,890
I won't be able to go to the desert with you.

420
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,840
Then we won't go to the desert.

421
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,750
The desert isn't a place where the Azure Cloud Flower can grow.

422
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,880
We won't go.

423
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,720

Don't cry.

427
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,370
I'm alright.

428
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,640
I'm not crying, Master.

429
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,000
Is it that the Moonlight Peony cannot save you,

430
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,440
or is it that I failed to grow it properly?

431
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,020
Or is it the flower of the Ice Barrier...

432
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,760
You grew the Moonlight Peony very well.

433

as long as Qingcheng wishes,

438

439
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,150

441
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,030
without you, there would be no Azure Cloud Flower.

442
