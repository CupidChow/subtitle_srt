00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,140
[Love of Petals]

2
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,130
[Episode 23]

3
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,840
Is this an auspicious cloud?

4
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:27,810
That's right.

5
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,190
Pingkang?

6
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,710
Qingcheng.

7
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,680
The appearance of an auspicious cloud above your head

8
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,470
indicates that

9
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,170
you are about to ascend to immortality.

10
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,310
Congratulations.

11
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,560
Why are you here?

12
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,960
I'm here

13
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,630
to announce that you'll become an immortal.

14
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,470
Just now,

15
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,970
the spiritual energy gathered inside your body,

16
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,630
and your inner mind

17
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,079
generated an exquisite blossom.

18
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,620
An auspicious cloud gathered above your head.

19
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,030
This indicates that

20
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,430
you have reached

21
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,590
the level of immortality.

22
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,590
Really?

23
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,800
I've reached

24
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,750
the Exquisite Bloom Stage?

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,360
That purple auspicious cloud

26
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,680
is the best proof.

27
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,110
Is it the same for everyone?

28
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
Everyone has it,

29
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,800
but the colors may vary.

30
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:14,960
For instance, mine

31
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,020
is golden.

32
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,150
Immortal Yuxiao's

33
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,100
is red.

34
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,030
So mine is purple?

35
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,120
Come on.

36
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,910
Listen to the celestial decree.

37
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,890
Yes.

38
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,910
Gu Qingcheng, a mortal woman from Pingcheng,

39
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,310
with her exceptional talent

40
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,470
and extraordinary innate qualities,

41
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,310
has now

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,079
reached the Exquisite Bloom Stage,

43
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,630
which can be heard in Heaven

44
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,000
and can comfort all creatures in the mortal world.

45
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,910
The Heavenly Emperor

46
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,190
has sensed her sincerity.

47
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,560
With the divine power manifested in front of mortals,

48
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,000
this florist will ascend to immortality.

49
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:44,950
His Majesty hereby appoints

50
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,680
Gu Qingcheng of the Human Realm

51
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,190
as a flower fairy in the Heavenly Realm

52
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,870
with the title of

53
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,480
Fairy Cailu.

54
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,720
I, Qingcheng, accept this decree.

55
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,390
Now that you have become a flower fairy,

56
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,800
you are naturally under the supervision of

57
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,700
the Flower God, Yuxiao.

58
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,630
From now on,

59
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,790
you have to obey his orders.

60
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,920
Alright.

61
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,120
I got it.

62
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,190
Pingkang.

63
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,920
Since you are the son of the Heavenly Emperor,

64
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,720
could you help me find out about

65
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,240
the storage location of my master's immortal root,

66
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,480
which was cut off back then?

67
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,800
Is there any chance that I can see it?

68
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,630
To be honest with you,

69
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,560
Both our Sun Family and I

70
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,480
are indebted to Mr. Lyu.

71
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,720
The first thing I did after I returned to my position

72
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,800
was to search for the whereabouts of his immortal root.

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,280
However,

74
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,510
his immortal root has been completely destroyed.

75
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,190
There are no clues at all.

76
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,190
The Celestial Court didn't keep it in storage, either.

77
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,680
Alright.

78
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,040
Don't be sad.

79
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,040
Today,

80
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,210
it's the big day of your ascension to immortality.

81
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,180
Mr. Lyu wouldn't want you to be sad, either.

82
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's not give up.

83
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,120
Okay?

84
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,320
Qingcheng.

85
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,100
Congratulations on your successful ascension!

86
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,090
Thank you.

87
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,630
Ascending to immortality is just the first step.

88
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,830
How to save my master in our next step

89
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,130
is what we need to plan in detail.

90
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,940
I've been away from the Heavenly Realm for so long that I forgot this.

91
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,450
You're still one step away from becoming an immortal.

92
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,990
When the morning bell rings tomorrow,

93
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,830
the Flower God's Mansion

94
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,390
will send someone down to the mortal world

95
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,000
to bestow the flower fairy's token upon you.

96
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,350
Qingcheng.

97
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,160
I have an important task for you.

98
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,080
What's the important task?

99
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,240
Go to the Heavenly Realm

100
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,410
and bring me some Weak Water from the Source of All Water.

101
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,600
It'll be of great use to me.

102
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,510
You'll use it to wash your several hairs?

103
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,890
Those are my dragon feathers.

104
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,070
Right?

105
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,040
Yes, yes, yes.

106
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,720
Dragon feathers, dragon feathers.

107
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,390
Cheers!

108
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,270
Let's drink to the dragon feathers!

109
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,950
Cheers.

[Leisure House]

111
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,870
Master.

112
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,870
I have successfully ascended to immortality.

113
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,240
Congratulations.

114
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,830
Qingcheng.

115
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,310
Next,

116
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,630
I want to give it a try again

117
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,360
to see if I can remove the restrictions in the Fairy Cave.

118
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,720
Master.

119
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,000
I remember everything you've said.

120
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,720
You've said that

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,360
as long as the longing still exists,

122
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,600
your beloved one will never disappear.

123
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,630
So,

124
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,920
you've never disappeared, right?

125
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,040
You've never left me, have you?

126
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,950
I've always been by your side,

127
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,159
I've never left you.

128
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,070
Master.

129
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,720
I miss you so much.

130
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,800
I really

131
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,200
miss you so much.

132
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,260
The morning bell has just rung.

133
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,220
Why hasn't anyone come yet?

134
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,950
Which one of you is Gu Qingcheng?

135
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,680
This is Fairy Nanxing.

136
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,120
With her position

137
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,600
as the personal celestial attendant of Immortal Yuxiao,

138
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
she's so arrogant.

139
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,870
I'm asking which one of you is Gu Qingcheng.

140
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,520
[Fairy Nanxing, Celestial Attendant in the Heavenly Realm]

141
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,870
Stop putting on airs!

142
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,630
There are only two people here.

143
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,720
It's not like you don't know me.

144
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,030
Can't you tell which of us is Gu Qingcheng?

145
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,960
Immortals in the lower realm are indeed noisy.

146
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,840
Do you have any right to speak here?

147
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,720
You...

148
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,240
Longque, Longque.

149
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,909
Now it's not the time to argue.

150
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,870
I'm Gu Qingcheng.

151
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,240
Greetings, Fairy.

152
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,550
I was wondering what kind of person

153
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,870
could be looked after by Immortal Yuxiao himself.

154
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,120
But now that I'm looking at you,

155
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,570
you're so ordinary.

156
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,240
I am ignorant of proper etiquette.

157
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,550
I hope that you can guide me more, Fairy.

158
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Prepare to receive the token of the Flower God.

159
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,440
Yes.

160
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,910
By putting on this plum blossom pendant,

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,910
you'll officially become a flower fairy

162
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,390
under Immortal Yuxiao's supervision.

163
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,200
From now on, match your words and deeds with your own status.

164
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,720
Don't slack off.

165
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,870
Yes.

166
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,870
Before going to the Celestial Court,

167
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,720
I need to seize the time

168
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,070
and go to the Fairy Cave.

169
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,000
I've become an immortal.

170
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,910
I'm about to enter the Heavenly Realm.

171
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,440
Flower Goddess.

172
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,860
I want to try one last time.

173
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,360
On an auspicious day,

174
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,360
Junior Yuxiao and I both ascended to immortality.

175
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,240
I turned the color of the auspicious clouds into orange pink.

176
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,870
Streams converged,

177
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,510
and thousands of trees blossomed.

178
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,200
Junior Yuxiao turned the color of the auspicious clouds into red.

179
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,860
The clouds gathered to decorate the moon.

180
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,340
The moon became blood-red.

181
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,490
On the night of the Blood Moon,

182
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,200
Ya Zi's temperament changed greatly.

183
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,550
I suspect that someone

184
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,370
used an extremely advanced mind technique on him

185
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,300
and controlled him.

186
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,360
The auspicious clouds became red.

187
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,910
Everyone has it,

188
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,960
but the colors may vary.

189
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,210
Immortal Yuxiao's is red.

190
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,720
Was he the one

191
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,650
who did it?

192
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,390
Miss.

193
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,810
We've met again.

194
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,690
So you're the flower fairy of the Cave Paradise?

195
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,670
Are you Flower Goddess Jiang Li?

196
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,500
It seems to be a reunion,

197
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,170
but it's not exactly a reunion.

198
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,670
This is a mind technique called Flower and Moon Reflections,

199
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,270
which can record past events

200
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,120
and create a scroll from them.

201
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,480
When a destined person triggers it,

202
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,600
the scroll

203
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,790
will be opened.

204
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,320
Both past and present events

205
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,630
can be marked.

206
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,000
So,

207
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,720
you recorded your past self in the scroll?

208
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,720
Will I be recorded in it too?

209
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,910
That's right.

210
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
The time wasn't right before.

211
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,000
So,

212
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,480
I couldn't reveal my identity.

213
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,440
I'm sorry.

214
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,120
You

215
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,510
said that

216
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,790
you and Lyu Gengyun

217
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,390
were old acquaintances.

218
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,960
It turns out that

219
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,200
you are his mother.

220
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,150
Since

221
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,320
my husband and I died for love,

222
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,430
I've always wanted to prevent Gengyun

223
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,200
from lingering on our past conflicts

224
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,320
and being obsessed with the idea

225
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,870
of taking revenge for us.

226
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,440
So,

227
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,550
when we were in the Cave Paradise,

228
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,720
due to this reason,

229
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,080
I avoided

230
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,430
meeting him.

231
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,120
Flower Goddess.

232
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,010
Now my master's

233
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,240
immortal root has been destroyed.

234
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,480
His original form has withered and decayed.

235
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,890
I've tried countless methods,

236
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,070
but they were all useless.

237
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,960
I beg you.

238
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,820
Could you help me with it?

239
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,370
This is the flower seed of Bedcurtains.

240
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,970
It's been passed down through generations of Flower God.

241
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,150
It can help to regenerate the immortal root.

242
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,480
Its effects are miraculous.

243
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,390
As Yuxiao also wants to become a Flower God,

244
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,620
he has been scheming to obtain it.

245
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,150
He even practiced a heterodox technique for this purpose.

246
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,320
It seems

247
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,750
related to inner demons.

248
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,720
When he cast the spell,

249
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,670
red clouds obscured the moon,

250
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,830
and he even almost hurt the Primordial Lord.

251
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,870
You have to be extremely wary of this person.

252
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,270
Qingcheng.

253
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,200
You are a good girl.

254
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,120
This seed

255
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,790
is now entrusted to you.

256
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,480
Use it well.

257
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,280
Thank you, Flower Goddess.

258
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,790
The method of cultivating Bedcurtains

259
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,240
is recorded in the ancient books.

260
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,020
Qingcheng,

261
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,070
the path ahead is arduous.

262
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,980
I hope you will cherish it greatly.

263
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,050
Yes.

264
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,030
The Top of the Dangerous Moon.

265
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,320
The Ringing of Morning Bells.

266
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,550
The Source of All Water.

267
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,790
The destined person

268
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,250
should remember it well.

269
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,080
Burn it after you read it.

270
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,900
Immortal Yuxiao.

271
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,750
Why are you here?

272
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,960
Back then, Senior Jiang Li

273
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,670
mostly resided on Shouyang Mountain.

274
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,960
I often come here to explore, too.

275
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,390
I didn't expect that

276
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,030
this place would have such hidden wonders.

277
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,870
Yes.

278
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,910
In this place, there are many precious classic books

279
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,360
collected by Flower Goddess Jiang Li.

280
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,080
Is it true that

281
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,480
there are only classic books here?

282
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,790
Yes.

283
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,510
What else do you think

284
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,670
there should be, Your Excellency?

285
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,870
I was indeed right about her.

286
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,440
She is the destined person.

287
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,510
Please take your time to look around.

288
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,420
I'll leave now.

289
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,840
This is the place Lyu Gengyun mentioned.

290
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,540
So she didn't find it?

291
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,010
Or it isn't here at all?

292
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,910
That's impossible.

293
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,810
Go to hell!

294
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,400
So it's here?

295
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,510
I found it.

296
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,960
I am now the rightful Flower God.

297
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,440
Why can't I awaken the flower seed?

298
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,350
Is it due to insufficient spiritual energy?

299
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,110
That's impossible.

300
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,230
It's absolutely impossible.

301
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,680
Junior.

302
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,780
Our master said that you had been learning unorthodox techniques

303
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,930
to forcibly make a breakthrough.

304
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,030
Heaven cannot tolerate such actions.

305
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
I knew you would steal the flower seed,

306
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,720
so I deliberately set up the barrier of Flower and Moon Reflections

307
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,660
and left a fake flower seed to deceive you.

308
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,410
Junior.

309
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,510
Please stop.

310
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,020
Master,

311
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,440
this is what Yuxiao has always wanted to obtain.

312
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,440
It's the flower seed passed down through generations of Flower God.

313
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,000
I've found that the Lunar March 7 Incident

314
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,380
seems to be related to him.

315
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,270
Master.

316
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,640
The Flower God Banquet will be held in the Celestial Court tomorrow.

317
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Immortal Yuxiao

318
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,070
will inevitably have to entertain many immortals.

319
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
I want to take this opportunity

320
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,320
to check his mansion.

321
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,830
Maybe I can find some clues.

322
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,340
Master.

323
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,050
Thank you, Qingcheng.

324
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,860
Master.

325
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,470
I don't know why

326
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,750
I can always feel you,

327
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,920
as if you were right beside me

328
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,490
and had never left me.

329
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,790
A toast to Immortal Yuheng.

330
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,440
A toast to Immortal Yuheng.

331
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,350
Yes.

332
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,680
Let's congratulate Immortal Yuheng

333
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,440
on his return after the tribulations.

334
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,190
Immortal Yuheng.

335
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:23,880
Please.

336
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,350
The paths in the Heavenly Realm are truly hard to identify.

337
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,790
I need to find a way to get familiar with them soon.

338
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,240
Immortal Yuxiao never allows anyone

339
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,550
to enter his study room.

340
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,530
I'm afraid there are some secrets hidden here.

341
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,550
Why is there a foul smell of sludge?

342
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,750
Immortal Yuxiao has always emphasized hygiene.

343
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,120
How could there be sludge in the room?

344
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,480
Pingkang.

345
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,110
Qingcheng?

346
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,250
What's wrong?

347
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,040
Why are you in such a panic?

348
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Immortal Yuheng.

349
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,900
Immortal Yuxiao.

350
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,480
Fairy Cailu, why are you here

351
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,160
instead of looking after the flowers and plants

352
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,700
in the celestial mansion's garden?

353
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,520
I just happened to run into Pingkang...

354
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,000
I happened to be passing by

355
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,790
and met Immortal Yuheng.

356
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,680
Then where were you just now?

357
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,470
I...

358
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,880
Just now, I...

359
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,530
Well...

360
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,960
I went...

361
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,050
Just now,

362
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,240
I asked her to get some flower seeds for me.

363
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,260
What are you holding in your hands?

364
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,160
Immortal Yuxiao.

365
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,130
Is there anything else you want to look for?

366
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,040
Well,

367
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,030
may I chat with Immortal Yuheng

368
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,240
about our old days?

369
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,190
You still need to nurture the flowers in the celestial mansion's garden.

370
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,270
After you finish chatting with him, go back at once.

371
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:25,800
Yes.

372
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,200
Just now, someone took advantage of the chaos

373
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,820
and slipped this thing into my sleeve.

374
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,510
You acted quite fast.

375
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,240
Here you are.

376
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,400
Tell me.

377
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,070
What's wrong?

378
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,160
May I have a copy of

379
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,200
the Heavenly Realm's Celestial Map?

380
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,360
The Celestial Map shows the locations of all the important places in each palace.

381
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,200
There's only one copy in the entire Heavenly Realm.

382
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,440
Why do you need it?

383
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,880
I need to use it.

384
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,500
Just let me use it for one day.

385
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,350
Return it to me after you use it.

386
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,720
Don't lose it.

387
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,110
Qingcheng.

388
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,720
Immortal Yuxiao.

389
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,750
Why are you in such a hurry?

390
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,940
Where are you going?

391
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,760
I chatted with Immortal Yuheng about our old days just now.

392
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,960
We talked about some past events in Pingcheng.

393
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,830
He asked me to fetch some wine from Pingcheng.

394
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,140
You don't need to do these things.

395
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,680
You only need to practice with me to...

396
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,590
Immortal Yuxiao.

397
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,730
Immortal Yuheng asked me to do this.

398
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,350
As your master, I order you

399
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,830
to practice with me from tomorrow onwards.

400
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,890
My status is so low that

401
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,310
I dare not practice with the Flower God.

402
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,750
Moreover,

403
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,140
I have only one master.

404
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,310
From today onwards,

405
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,720
I will be your only master!

406
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,830
My master is

407
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,160
Lyu

408
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:01,720
Geng

409
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,230
Yun.

410
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,110
Your Excellency, if there's nothing else,

411
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,960
I, Qingcheng...

412
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,710
I, Fairy Cailu, will go fetch the wine first.

413
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,000
Gu Qingcheng!

414
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,240
Your Excellency,

415
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,640
do you have any other instructions?

416
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,920
If there's nothing else,

417
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,480
I'll leave now.

418
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,100
The paths in the Heavenly Realm are intricate and complex.

419
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,980
Without the Celestial Map,

420
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,520
I would have gotten lost.

421
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,170
Oh, right.

422
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,950
Now that I have this map,

423
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,960
I can also figure out where the Top of the Dangerous Moon is.

424
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,440
The Top of the Dangerous Moon

425
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,200
is the first star of the northern Dangerous Moon Constellation.

426
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,270
On the Celestial Map, it corresponds to...

427
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,320
Qin Shan.

428
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,900
The location of Immortal Qin Shan

429
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,200
also happens to pass through the Weak Water.

430
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,230
That must be the place.

431
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,750
I always feel that there's something wrong with this plum blossom pendant.

432
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,000
It flickers occasionally.

433
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,840
It would flicker?

434
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,490
Yes.

435
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,310
Take a look.

436
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,820
This is just an ordinary plum blossom pendant.

437
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,030
Give it to me.

438
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,070
How can you examine a celestial object

439
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,350
with your eyes?

440
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,960
You need to sense it with spiritual energy.

441
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,160
This plum blossom pendant contains a tracking magic weapon from the Heavenly Realm.

442
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,480
No matter where you go,

443
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,310
the owner of this plum blossom pendant will know it.

444
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,400
All the flower fairies under Yuxiao's supervision

445
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,920
have a plum blossom pendant like this.

446
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,720
Its owner is surely Yuxiao.

447
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,640
Oh, no.

448
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,310
I thought this secret chamber in the cave was safe.

449
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,070
What should we do now?

450
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,360
The most important thing now

451
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,620
is to find a new place for my master as soon as possible.

452
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,200
Can you two help him find a place that is full of

453
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,000
spiritual energy so that he can settle down?

454
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,790
Okay.

455
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,960
Master.

456
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,970
When I solve the mystery left by the Flower Goddess

457
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,200
and find out what happened

458
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,490
on Lunar March 7,

459
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,570
I'll go find you.

460
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,570
You've arranged

461
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,400
everything so meticulously.

462
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,550
You don't look like a gardener at all.

463
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,690
Instead, you look like

464
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,090
a Flower Goddess who rules over thousands of blooms.
