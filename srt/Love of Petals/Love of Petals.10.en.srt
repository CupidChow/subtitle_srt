[Qingcheng Flower Nursery]

4
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,760
How fragrant.

5
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,510
The subtle fragrance fills the air,

6
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,280
soothing and refreshing!

7
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,530
This pot of Green Butterfly smells good too.

8
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,120
This pot of Four Seasons Begonia smells wonderful.

9
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,710
Even the ones I grow at home aren't nearly as fragrant.

10
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,680
Good taste!

11
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,000
That's right!

12
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,280
It's not just fragrant.

13
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,079
It's absolutely divine!

14
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,030
Furthermore, all of our flower varieties

15
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,800
have been carefully selected.

16
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,240
Not only do they fill the room with fragrance,

17
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,630
but they can even calm the mind and help with sleep.

18
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,400
Well,

19
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,079
that beautiful friend there must be wondering,

20
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,630
"Where can we buy these flowers of yours?"

21
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,000
So where can we buy them?

22
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,150
Qingcheng Flower Nursery.

23
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,910

25

Don't rush.

32
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,079
Move in a bit.

33
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't push, don't push!

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,360
There's enough for everyone! One at a time!

35
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,190
You're quite something,

36
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,760
getting me to help draw in customers.

37
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,540
Or what?

38
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,840
Please, come in.

39
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,470
You've got serious matters to do, man.

40
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,040
You're starting a business here?

41
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Look, there are so many customers,

42
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,000
right?

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,030
Yes, there are a lot of customers.

44
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,120
But what about your Flower Spirit?

45
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,190
Well, you need to get your Flower Spirit.

46
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,680
-Gu, you're here.
-So many customers!

47
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,120
How did you do it?

48
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,360
Isn't business much better

49
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,329
than yours last time?

50
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,470
As your master,

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,240
either I don't do it at all,

52
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,240
or if I do it,

53
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,430
I must succeed.

54
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,960
What are you laughing at?

55
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,550
Mr. Bai?

56
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,360
You're here.

57
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,310
You're right on time.

58
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,079
All 100 flowers have been prepared for you.

59
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,430
Thank you, miss.

60
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,910
It's all part of our job.

61
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,910
Please follow me to the backyard to collect them, sir.

62
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,470
Alright.

63
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,079
Over here!

64
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,190
This way.

65
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Every single stem has been handpicked with great care.

66
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,910
So, that is the buyer?

67
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,750
I hope they'll meet your standards, sir.

68
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,280
He's quite the handsome fellow, right?

69
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,750
Aren't you going to take a look?

70
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,830
What's it got to do with me?

71
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,190
Pretending not to care, aren't we?

72
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,519
If you won't go take a look,

73
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,130
then I'll go.

74
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,520
Everyone.

75
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,240
I'm truly sorry.

76
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,560
I usually do some small business.

77
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,070
But recently, I've been short on funds.

78
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,390
I need a few days to turn things around.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,720
I had planned to come back in a few days,

80
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,150
but I urgently need these flowers.

81
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,120
Could I perhaps leave this ancestral jade pendant

82
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,000
with you as collateral?

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,920
Once I receive the payment,

84
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,270
I'll come back to redeem it.

85
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,830
Well...

86
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,520
This is valuable enough for you to marry two wives.

87
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,360
Miss Gu,

88
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,900
we can't tell if this jade pendant is genuine or fake.

89
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,070
If he's a con artist...

90
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,550
wouldn't we end up losing more than we gain?

91
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,870
But...

92
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,920
this young man

93
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,240
has handsome features with righteous bearing.

94
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,040
He doesn't seem to be lying.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,600
It's the first time I've seen someone do business

96
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,050
based on looks.

97
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,750
This type of fair-skinned young gentleman

98
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,780
specifically targets young girls like you.

99
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,010
I think you look even fairer.

100
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,480
You are quite fair-skinned.

101
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,630
You're even fairer.

102
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,360
Grandpa,

103
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,800
give it to me.

104
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,430
Sir...

105
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,510
I'll trust you this once.

106
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,430
Thank you again, miss.

107
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,310
Shan Xiao.

108
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,680
Give them to him.

109
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:57,950
It's alright.

110
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,600
Go ahead, give them to him.

111
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,240
Give them to him.

112
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,870
Hurry, give them to him.

113
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,950
It's quite heavy.

114
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,510
Thank you. Thank you.

115
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,510
Take care, sir.

116
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,510
Why did he cast a glance at you?

117
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,560
Miss Gu,

118
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,510
you agreed just like that?

119
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,970
Mr. Lyu has brought in so many customers.

120
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,390
He is so arrogant.

121
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,680
We need to step up our game.

122
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,040
How about

123
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,870
we verify if it's genuine or not?

124
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,390
Might as well.

125
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,500
For peace of mind.

126
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,560
Someone with his looks

127
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,920
couldn't possibly offer fake jade.

128
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,159
Master.

129
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,720
I've come to visit you again.

130
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,750
I've brought your favorite

131
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,750
purple balloon flower for you.

132
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,870
They're especially fresh this year.

133
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,620
[Xiao Cao]

134
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,390
Nobody likes me.

135
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,870
Why do you always help me?

136
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,920
Because you are...

137
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,800
the best girl in the whole world.

138
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,750
Would you like to buy some flowers?

139
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,070
They're just picked and very fresh.

140
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,040
I'll take this bouquet. Here.

141
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,210
You didn't pay enough.

142
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,560
Do you know...

143
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,160
what the balloon flower symbolizes?

144
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,190
What is it?

145
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
"Eternal love."

146
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,510
It's been 1,000 years.

147
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,030
I've been waiting for you for 1,000 years.

148
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,790
Didn't you promise me

149
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,990
that after 1,000 years...

150
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,130
you would come and find me?

151
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,150
I can help you reunite with your master.

152
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,840
Who are you?

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,720
Who I am is not important.

154
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,390
What's important is

155
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,510
that I can help you revive her.

156
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,030
But you...

157
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,720
need to do something for me in return.

158
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,910
Master, look,

159
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,270
Miss Wang's

160
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,790
order of flowers has been delivered.

161
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,440
As for the flowers ordered by Mr. Li,

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,510
the payment has been settled.

163
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,150
Welcome back next time.

164
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,960
These are the flowers ordered by Mrs. Sun.

165
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,270
Miss Gu has returned.

166
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,720
How did it go?

167
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,110
Got scammed, right?

168
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,360
I've never seen

169
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,360
such a clever scammer.

170
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,600
Is it possible...

171
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,640
that it's not the scammer who's clever,

172
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,440
but that the seller

173
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:25,840
is not very smart?

174
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,240
You...

175
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,810
Just you wait!

176
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,630
I will definitely give everyone an explanation!

177
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,120
I'll find this scammer, even if it means turning the world upside down,

178
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,440
and make him pay back double.

179
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,670
I'll await your good news.

180
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,430
Don't be angry, Miss Gu!

181
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,630
We'll just earn this money back!

182
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,480
Yes, yes, we'll just earn it back.

183
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:43,750
No.

184
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,100
I must find him!

185
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,840
Do you still remember what that villain looks like?

186
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,550
Of course, I do.

187
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:51,390
Pingkang,

188
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,630
could you help me draw a portrait?

189
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,080
I want to post it all over the city.

190
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,200
I don't believe I can't catch that scammer.

191
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,240
The Floral Competition is about to begin.

192
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,870
You

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
should prepare well for it.

194
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,960
I will definitely prepare well for the Floral Competition.

195
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,550
But I also need to catch that scammer.

196
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,440
He's so bad.

197
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,840
What if he goes and cheats

198
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,630
other gardeners too?

199
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,960
I'm just looking out for others.

200
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,720
Please.

201
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:17,750
Fine.

202
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,960
I'll draw it for you.

203
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:23,960
Go ahead.

204
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,250
What does that person look like?

205
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,480
He looks...

206
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,940
repulsive, with a green face and protruding fangs.

207
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,210
His eyes are only this small,

208
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,620
yet his lips are that thick.

209
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,910
Hold on, hold on.

210
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,750
You must describe him truthfully.

211
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,320
Don't let your personal feelings affect it.

212
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,270
Otherwise, the portrait wouldn't look like him,

213
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,390
so we wouldn't be able to find the person.

214
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,030
Fine.

215
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,840
To be honest,

216
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,120
he looks

217
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,270
quite decent.

218
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:51,910
Refined.

219
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,390
More handsome than Lyu Gengyun.

220
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,870
Dressed all in white.

221
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,360
He's a refined gentleman, gentle as jade,

222
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,320
with rather large eyes too.

223
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,030
And also...

224
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,920
[Looking For This Person]

225
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,790
How about

226
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,560
we post a few more of these elsewhere?

227
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,840
Look.

228
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,240
Doesn't he look a bit like the man on it?

229
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,150
Yeah.

230
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,030
Miss Gu?

231
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,670
Looks like you haven't found him yet.

232
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,910
His portrait is all over the city now.

233
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,270
It's only a matter of time before I find him.

234
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,150
It's your first time doing business,

235
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,000
so getting scammed is almost inevitable.

236
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,970
Just consider it as paying for a lesson.

237
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,120
Don't take it to heart.

238
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,790
How can I not take it to heart?

239
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,390
I single-handedly caused such a huge loss

240
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,790
to the entire flower nursery.

241
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,020
That was 100 stems of purple balloon flowers.

242
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,480
I'll cover this loss.

243
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,760
-You don't need to...
-No need.

244
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,260
Even if it's paying for a lesson,

245
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,320
it should be me who teaches that scammer a lesson!

246
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm so pissed.

247
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,690
It should be me who teaches that scammer a lesson.

248
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,030
How dare you scam me.

249
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,910
I will definitely find you.

250
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,550
Once I find you,

251
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,320
I'll make you pay back thirty taels of silver.

252
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,960
It's him.

253
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,910
I'm a night-walking immortal.

254
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,880
Why did you drag me out here to sunbathe with you?

255
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,030
The weather is nice today.

256
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,480
Let's have a drink.

257
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,860
Aren't you a peony flower?

258
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,520
How come you're not afraid of the sun?

259
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,390
But I brought a parasol with me.

260
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,790
Gu, welcome back.

261
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,480
I knew it!

262
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,960
You're just holding onto me,

263
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,550
keeping me here to wait for Gu with you!

264
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,440
Are you tired of living?

265
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,080
I...

266
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,750
Qingcheng?

267
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,200
Young Master Sun is here.

268
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,200
You can keep him company for a while.

269
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,680
Have you seen Qingcheng?

270
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,440
No.

271
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,440
Have you seen Qingcheng?

272
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,270
Didn't she go find you?

273
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,790
Why are you here looking for her?

274
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,600
We agreed to meet at noon,

275
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
but she didn't come.

276
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,080
I was worried, so I came to check.

277
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,120
Have you seen her?

278
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,960
Gu Qingcheng is not one to break promises.

279
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,960
Disappearing without reason...

280
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,240
Could something have happened to her?

281
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,870
You're all here!

282
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,790
Where have you been?

283
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,790
I went to get the money, of course.

284
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,910
Now that I've got the payment,

285
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,630
this business deal is considered done.

286
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,360
You found him

287
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,530
and got the money back?

288
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,240
Well, he

289
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,500
is not really that bad of a person.

290
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,290
He really did need time to turn around his funds.

291
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,790
From now on, you're not allowed to act alone.

292
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,310
He didn't give you a hard time, did he?

293
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,790
No.

294
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,150
I'm tired. I've been busy all day.

295
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,200
I'm going to take a nap.

296
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,550
You guys chat among yourselves.

297
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,550
Master.

298
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,240
You're here.

299
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,960
Apricot blossom wine.

300
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,360
Isn't this your treasured collection?

301
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,840
You're willing to share it with me?

302
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,120
Indeed.

303
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,120
Well...

304
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
only by doing so can I show my sincerity.

305
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,510
You're being so nice today.

306
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,670
Of course...

307
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,910
I have a favor to ask of you, Master.

308
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,790
Out with it.

309
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,000
Master...

310
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,640
could you accompany me to

311
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,920
Shouyang Mountain?

312
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,069
Shouyang Mountain?

313
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,680
That's a place where many demons gather.

314
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,880
Why do you want to go there?

315
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,960
I heard that Shouyang Mountain is rich in spiritual energy.

316
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,590
The Floral Competition is approaching,

317
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,400
so I was thinking of finding some spring water

318
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,750
to water my flowers for the competition.

319
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,640
The area around Shouyang Mountain

320
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,380
is full of miasma and swamps.

321
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,200
It's too dangerous.

322
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,640
Master,

323
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,790
that's why I need you to go with me.

324
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,880
Master.

325
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,720
Just come with me...

326
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,240
please?

327
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,790
I...

328
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,720
will consider it.

329
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,640
Take your time.

330
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,200
Try it.

331
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,400
My apricot blossom wine.

332
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,400
Okay.

333
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,160
Apricot blossom wine...

334
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,790
Aren't you joining me?

335
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,050
I'll drink from this.

336
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,920
You're going back to Shouyang Mountain? That's so sudden.

337
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:32,680
Yes.

338
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
That's why I called you back to help me watch over the little demons.

339
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,150
Master, you are the son of the Demon King.

340
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,790
Once the Heavenly Realm notices, they will surely think

341
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,640
that you're returning to Shouyang Mountain to take charge of these little demons

342
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,750
and plan a comeback.

343
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,880
Didn't you leave because you didn't want to

344
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
take your position?

345
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,000
I will conceal my aura.

346
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,510
The Heavenly Realm won't know.

347
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:48,830
No.

348
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,480
I'm going with you.

349
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,510
No!

350
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:53,830
You...

351
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,880
Why are you here?

352
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,240
I... I...

353
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,480
I brought...

354
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,750
a few of

355
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,590
my mother's signature pastries for you.

356
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,350
Wushuang,

357
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,200
you haven't fully recovered from your injuries.

358
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,400
You shouldn't travel far.

359
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,920
Wherever my master goes, I go.

360
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,830
Then I'll go too.

361
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,350
What are you going for?

362
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,830
You're just a mortal. Why are you going there?

363
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,960
Qingcheng is also a mortal.

364
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,350
Why can she go and I can't?

365
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,830
Alright, alright, alright.

366
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,830
This time, we're going there

367
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,700
just to collect spring water.

368
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,350
Pingkang can come with us

369
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,510
if he wants to.

370
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,070
Come on,

371
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,840
try this.

372
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,160
Who did this?

373
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,100
Let go of me!

374
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,510
Who did this?

375
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,480
Let go of me!

376
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,840
Stop struggling.

377
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,930
This rope is called the Golden Lock.

378
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,960
Miss Gu, you're just a mortal.

379
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
You can't break free from it.

380
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,240
It's you.

381
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Who are you really?

382
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,920
What have you done to me?

383
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,880
It's the Soul-Transferring Technique.

384
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,550
You want me to use the Soul-Transferring Technique on her?

385
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,440
That's right.

386
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:49,530
[Ya Zi]

387
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,350
Only your cat demon clan's

388
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,510
unique soul-transferring technique

389
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,280
can exchange the souls

390
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,780
of two people.

391
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,910
[Millennia-Old Cat Demon; Bai]

392
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,590
But I promised my master

393
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,240
that I wouldn't use magic to harm others.

394
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,680
After this year,

395
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,200
I'm afraid

396
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,830
you'll never see her again, am I right?

397
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,270
Wait.

398
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,110
If you come around,

399
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,440
then take this Marrow-Refining Pill.

400
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Marrow-Refining Pill?

401
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,680
Once you take it,

402
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,640
you'll need my blood regularly

403
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,070
to survive.

404
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,670
So, you deliberately lured me here.

405
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,510
You're really here,

406
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,480
you scammer.

407
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,370
Give me back my flowers!

408
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,200
Cast the spell!

409
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,200
For 100 flowers,

410
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,030
you just...

411
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,640
This is not just about 100 flowers.

412
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,350
But still,

413
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,700
you shouldn't do such an evil deed.

414
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,480
Every Qingming Festival...

415
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,480
I bring her 100 purple balloon flowers.

416
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,420
I thought these were her favorite flowers,

417
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,200
so would she smell their fragrance

418
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,310
and come back?

419
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,870
Your...

420
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,440
master?

421
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,920
I've been waiting for my master for these thousand years.

422
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,870
Counting each balloon flower...

423
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,000
like counting down the days until I might see her again.

424
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,790
Another year has passed.

425
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,220
This year,

426
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,410
will you come back?

427
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,270
Qingcheng,

428
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,550
do you remember

429
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,960
what I told you?

430
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,070
I remember. Save 9,999 plants,

431
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,960
and I'll be able to see the Flowers Immortal Lord

432
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,030
and become a flower fairy,

433
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,230
just like Mom.

434
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,110
I understand how you feel.

435
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,350
I'm also counting the flowers,

436
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,750
wondering when...

437
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,920
I can see the person I want to see.

438
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,920
But no matter what you're up to,

439
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,240
you won't succeed!

440
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,640
My master is Lyu Gengyun.

441
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,070
If he finds out you've deceived us,

442
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,440
he'll come after you soon!

443
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,000
I know his reputation.

444
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,350
No demon doesn't know of him.

445
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,680
Unfortunately,

446
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,290
he can barely protect himself now.

447
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,750
No...

448
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,070
This way.

449
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,340
Everyone, keep up.

450
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,790
You must be overheated.

451
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,110
Here.

452
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,920
I'm not hot.

453
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,590
Fan for yourself.

454
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,680
You're sweating.

455
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,070
Everyone, can we walk a bit faster?

456
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,480
Master,

457
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,440
are you alright?

458
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,730
Perhaps it's the hot weather.

459
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,470
I might have a mild heatstroke.

460
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:27,830
There's water ahead.

461
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,160
Why don't we take a break there?

462
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,160
Master,

463
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,550
we're almost at the foot of the mountain.

464
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,920
Can you hold on a little longer?

465
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,680
Can't you see that Master is unwell?

466
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,210
Mr. Lyu has been injured before.

467
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,640
He might not have fully recovered yet.

468
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,840
Qingcheng,

469
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,480
why don't we

470
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,640
take a break there first?

471
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,640
Come on.

472
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,170
Easy.

473
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,680
This man...

474
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,400
is so weak.

475
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,270
Come on, Wushuang.

476
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,240
You must be tired.

477
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,000
Have some water.

478
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,270
Thank you.

479
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,790
Master, have some water.

480
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,680
Don't stay in the sun.

481
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,310
No need.

482
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,400
I'm sorry, Qingcheng.

483
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,310
I've delayed our journey.

484
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,800
Master, your health comes first.

485
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,120
There's a hair.

486
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,040
What's wrong with you?

487
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,030
It's the Marrow-Refining Pill.

488
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,240
The Marrow-Refining Pill is starting to take its toll.

489
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,960
What's really going on with you?

490
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,680
I took the Marrow-Refining Pill.

491
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,200
I need Ya Zi's blood.

492
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,700
His... his blood?

493
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,880
Didn't you say

494
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,550
that this blood could save your life?

495
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,790
Bite me then.

496
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,160
Miss Gu.

497
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,440
I've put you in this state...

498
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,680
and you're still willing to help me?

499
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,000
Hurry up.

500
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,350
No.

501
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,880
It's not my body anyway.

502
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,790
No.

503
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,640
Why do you say "no"?

504
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
Just hurry up and bite me!

505
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,250
Bite me!

506
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,710
It hurts so much!

507
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,550
Master, are you feeling better?

508
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,140
Much better.

509
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,480
I've had some water.

510
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,030
Then, let's hurry.

511
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,400
Still hot?

512
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,110
Watch your step.

513
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,070
Wushuang?

514
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:20,960
Look.

515
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
How beautiful the flower is.

516
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,110
Here.

517
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:32,960
Take it.

518
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,480
Wushuang.

519
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,440
Do you know

520
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,240
what this flower is called?

521
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,000
No.

522
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,790
The name of this flower

523
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
is the bellflower.

524
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,070
Its flower language...

525
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,640
means "infinite longing."

526
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,720
Originally,

527
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,920
I was thinking

528
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,480
of picking it for you.

529
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:56,830
But I didn't expect

530
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,830
that you'd pick it and give it to me first.

531
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,240
Wushuang,

532
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,340
I thought you knew...

533
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,000
Wushuang?

534
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,640
Wushuang.

535
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,790
Qingcheng!

536
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,070
Look!

537
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,400
Wushuang gave it to me.

538
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,030
It's nice.

539
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,400
Beautiful.

540
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,240
Qingcheng takes the greatest care in protecting flowers and plants.

541
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,410
I'm afraid she'll have to find a way to save it again.

542
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,680
Let's wait until we get to Shouyang Mountain.

543
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,530
This flower probably won't last until we reach Shouyang Mountain, right?

544
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,590
Why don't we think of a way

545
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,250
for Qingcheng to preserve it well?

546
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,400
Qingcheng,

547
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:36,880
do you have a way?

548
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,510
Of course,

549
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,000
I have a way.

550
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,310
The dense forest ahead

551
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,440
is filled with poisonous miasma.

552
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,920
As a mere mortal...

553
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,000
I might not be able to withstand it.

554
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,240
In that case...

555
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,480
should we just forget it?

556
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,060
What if you come with me, Master?

557
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,060
Of course, I will go.

558
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,160
I'd like to see

559
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,790
what you're really

560
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,400
up to.

561
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,830
No rush.

562
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,160
You'll find out soon enough,

563
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,750
Master.
