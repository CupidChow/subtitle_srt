00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,140
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,229
Let's not wait anymore.

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,920
Let's begin the proceedings.

5
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,200
The top litigator in the capital, Mr. Lyu, has arrived.

6
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,340
So this is Mr. Lyu.

7
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,520
♫You effortlessly♫

8
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,640
♫Shatter the world's beauty♫

9
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,860
♫Your eyes hold endless tenderness♫

10
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,870
♫I write only for you, thoughts folded into a letter♫

11
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,970
♫The prologue begins with love at first sight♫

12
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,310
Mr. Lyu.

13
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,810
He is truly deserving of the title of the capital's top litigator.

14
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,720
Such presence,

15
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
it's truly something extraordinary.

16
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,800
Indeed.

17
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,870
Master, you're here.

18
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,829
[Unparalleled]

19
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
What does this mean?

20
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,310
Let me tell you,

21
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,280
with my 500 years of experience wandering the mortal world,

22
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,710
there's an unwritten rule in this world.

23
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,460
You may lose the battle, but never lose morale.

24
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,580
It doesn't matter if you don't know how to handle a case.

25
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,130
You must remember,

26
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,200
you are a litigator,

27
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,680
the most renowned litigator in the capital.

28
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,000
You must intimidate the magistrate with your presence alone.

29
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,079
Whatever grand entrance you can muster,

30
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,079
just go for it.

31
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,870
You just...

32
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,400
You just act magnificently.

33
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,870
Why is he drinking tea now?

34
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,190
What does this mean?

35
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,360
Master,

36
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,910
what are you doing?

37
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,560
We may lose the battle, but not our morale.

38
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,520
What are you doing? Take it away immediately!

39
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,030
You think I'll just take it away because you say so?

40
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,870
Where's the dignity of the top litigator in the capital?

41
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,840
Are you taking it away or not?

42
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:48,960
Honorable Magistrate.

43
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,180
Mr. Lyu has just arrived from the capital.

44
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,210
He's not yet familiar with our local customs.

45
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,390
I'll have him take it away right away.

46
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:55,720
Master,

47
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,750
you've just arrived in the mortal world.

48
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,310
There are many things you don't quite understand.

49
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,120
No one would have a tea ceremony in the courtroom.

50
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,080
Will you listen to me?

51
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,190
Ye You.

52
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,110
Next time, I'll strangle him.

53
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,310
Someone come here!

54
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,430
Take it away, please.

55
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,470
Someone come!

56
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,840
Hurry, hurry!

57
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,950
Thank you for your hard work.

58
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,920
So-called top litigator in the capital,

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,360
it's not a big deal to make a fool

60
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,560
of yourself.

61
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,830
Just don't

62
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,290
delay the important business of the trial.

63
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,120
Master,

64
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,600
we don't argue with mortal people.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,310
Today we will hear

66
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,360
the case of the murders of Si Shulun and Lai.

67
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,480
The Si family accuses the suspect Sun Pingkang

68
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,159
of poisoning the page boy Lai,

69
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,630
and conspiring with others to kill Si Shulun.

70
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,510
Bring the suspect Sun Pingkang to the court.

71
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,310
Sun Pingkang.

72
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,070
Did you poison the page boy Lai?

73
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,870
Honorable Magistrate.

74
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,740
I have never poisoned anyone.

75
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,270
Please investigate thoroughly.

76
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,870
The coroner found

77
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,800
firefly mushroom in Lai's stomach.

78
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,310
Was that firefly mushroom

79
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,120
given by you?

80
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,720
I did give firefly mushroom,

81
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,630
but I...

82
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,190
Honorable Magistrate.

83
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,430
the coroner examined Lai's stomach.

84
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,510
Did they examine other organs

85
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,870
in his abdomen?

86
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,430
Lai died of poisoning.

87
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,210
Why examine anything other than his stomach?

88
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,570
We all know that firefly mushrooms aren't lethal.

89
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,200
But Lai died from poison.

90
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,360
What was the poison?

91
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,740
And where was it administered?

92
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,830
I've examined Lai's body.

93
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,950
His death was horrific.

94
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,430
His body was covered in frost.

95
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,120
It looked like he was poisoned with some kind of cold toxin.

96
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,600
But firefly mushrooms are known for their heat.

97
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,860
How could it present

98
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,710
symptoms of cold poisoning?

99
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,480
Firefly mushrooms are heat-producing.

100
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,830
How could it be cold poison?

101
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,690
It's impossible.

102
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,240
Otherwise, why couldn't it be detected?

103
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,190
Honorable Magistrate.

104
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,890
Lai ingested an extremely cold substance.

105
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,630
What kind of extremely cold substance?

106
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,920
It's

107
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,600
water hemlock.

108
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,720
Water hemlock?

109
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,150
They've discovered the matter of the water hemlock.

110
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,920
Is this what you call

111
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,870
closing the case quickly?

112
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,070
I clearly drained all their blood.

113
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,160
How could this happen?

114
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,360
That little girl, Gu Qingcheng,

115
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,720
is well-versed in all kinds of herbs.

116
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,000
How could she not know

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,680
the nature of the water hemlock?

118
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,730
If because of you,

119
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,000
that person's grand plan is ruined,

120
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,870
do you know the consequences?

121
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,560
Master.

122
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,830
Master.

123
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,310
Please, give me one more chance.

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,070
Nonsense!

125
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,360
The magistrate just said

126
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,830
there was only firefly mushroom in Lai's stomach.

127
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,310
Where did this water hemlock come from?

128
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,720
Who says that just because it's not in his stomach,

129
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,800
he hasn't eaten it?

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It it's not in his stomach,

131
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,159
where else could it be?

132
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,800
When water hemlock is made into medicinal powder,

133
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,870
it dissolves very easily.

134
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,950
It can be traceless and invisible in the stomach.

135
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,190
How can you prove it?

136
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,220
It's simple.

137
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,630
Autopsy.

138
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,830
Last night,

139
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,410
there was a fire in the morgue.

140
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,800
The body was burned to ashes.

141
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,830
How can we perform an autopsy?

142
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,580
Lord Si, you seem so calm about this.

143
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,270
I'm afraid this fire

144
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,160
was set by you, wasn't it?

145
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,040
Nonsense!

146
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,750
Don't you dare slander me!

147
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,600
How could I burn my own son's body?

148
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,390
How dare you spout such nonsense

149
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,720
and waste time here?

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,920
Without a body,

151
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,950
how can an autopsy be performed?

152
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,310
Since Mr. Lyu has said so,

153
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,190
I am also very curious

154
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,310
to see what can be discovered from the autopsy.

155
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,400
Lord Si, you've lost your beloved son.

156
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,920
I will ensure you receive a fair explanation.

157
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,070
Since it has come to this,

158
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,510
let's allow Mr. Lyu to perform the autopsy.

159
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,480
Please, everyone,

160
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,630
let's move to the front courtyard.

161
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,500
Lord Si,

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,800
please.

163
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,680
Mr. Lyu,

164
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,070
where is the body?

165
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:00,920
Rest assured, My Lord.

166
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,800
Everything has been handled as you instructed.

167
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,430
Lord Si.

168
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,830
This is what I call "repairing the road in the open,

169
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,310
while secretly moving troops through Chencang."

170
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,230
Move.

171
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,520
-Quick, this way.
-Someone's coming.

172
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,100
Take Lai's body away from the ground.

173
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,360
Hurry!

174
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,720
What about the other one?

175
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,200
The one you burned last night

176
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,150
was just a piece of wood.

177
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,080
You dare to steal bodies from the county office?

178
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,390
This is utterly lawless.

179
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,360
Honorable Magistrate.

180
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,570
You interrogate prisoners in the dead of night,

181
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,960
without a proper trial,

182
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,030
attempting to extract false confessions.

183
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,700
Isn't this disregard for the law?

184
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,820
Sun Pingkang, a man of scholarly merit,

185
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:55,890
subjected to torture.

186
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,240
Isn't this also a blatant disregard for the law?

187
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,570
Everyone, please look.

188
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,350
Look at the injuries on Sun Pingkang's body.

189
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,030
Do you see them?

190
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,360
This is too much.

191
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,270
Isn't this forced confession?

192
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,960
They're forcing confessions.

193
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,120
Does it hurt?

194
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,750
Yes, indeed.

195
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,870
This is a disregard for human life.

196
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,440
I had the body detained.

197
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,840
The magistrate said last night that he wanted to interrogate the suspect.

198
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,200
I was afraid the evidence might be destroyed.

199
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,420
That's why I arranged for the body to be kept.

200
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,720
Sir, please continue with the interrogation.

201
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,790
Very well.

202
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,630
I'd like to see

203
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,030
how you're going to find

204
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,010
from this corpse

205
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,430
the water hemlock.

206
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,870
Miss Gu from the Sun Family

207
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,010
has been well-versed in the nature of plants since childhood.

208
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,200
I would like to invite Miss Gu

209
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,670
to explain to everyone.

210
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,270
The powder of water hemlock dissolves easily,

211
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,840
but it's not easily absorbed by the body.

212
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,750
Although it's not in the stomach,

213
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,000
it remains in other parts of the body.

214
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,510
So before the court session,

215
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,360
I performed a steam bone autopsy.

216
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,790
Steam bone autopsy?

217
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,440
Using hot steam

218
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,080
to expel impurities from the body,

219
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,930
then wrapping it with a cold straw mat

220
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,280
to condense into dew,

221
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,480
forming the medicinal powder.

222
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,390
This is the powder of the water hemlock.

223
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,440
So,

224
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,270
the real cause of Lai's death

225
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,360
was eating

226
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,270
the incompatible firefly mushroom and water hemlock together,

227
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,240
which amplified the cold nature of the water hemlock,

228
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,500
leading to death from cold poison attacking the heart.

229
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,600
Moreover, according to our investigation,

230
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,000
you, Lord Si, never brought

231
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,440
firefly mushroom from the capital to Si Shulun.

232
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,670
That day,

233
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,680
Sun Pingkang on the road

234
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,320
didn't knock over firefly mushroom,

235
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,870
but rather what Si Shulun takes daily,

236
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,230
the water hemlock.

237
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,630
The water hemlock?

238
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
I understand now.

239
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,280
That day,

240
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,580
they were deliberately giving me a hard time.

241
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,830
They wanted to use water hemlock to trick me out of my firefly mushroom

242
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,360
to help him pass the imperial examination.

243
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,080
That day, Lai

244
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,720
picked up the powder,

245
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,390
which was water hemlock.

246
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,080
The maid at Si's Mansion said

247
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,270
that Lai has always been unclean

248
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,840
and has a habit of sucking his fingers.

249
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,030
So I deduce

250
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,550
that Lai that day, out of pity

251
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,690
for the herbs fallen on the ground,

252
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,830
wanted to pick them up.

253
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,800
Combined with his habit of sucking his fingers,

254
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,730
he ended up licking

255
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,070
the water hemlock powder off his fingertips.

256
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,680
Although the water hemlock is an extremely cold substance,

257
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,190
if its toxicity is suppressed,

258
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,440
it becomes an excellent herbal medicine.

259
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,020
I just don't know

260
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,360
why Young Master Si would take this medicine.

261
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,100
Because the effect of this medicine is...

262
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,320
What's its effect?

263
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,510
Specifically treating

264
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,490
stagnation of yang energy in the body

265
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,200
which leads to

266
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,910
impotence.

267
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,630
Shut up!

268
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,200
Young Master Si needed this medicine?

269
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,200
This is such a disgrace to the family.

270
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,200
No wonder he pretended to be taking firefly mushroom.

271
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,030
Our Si family is a scholarly family.

272
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,260
Our family rules are strict.

273
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,840
My son died tragically.

274
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,390
The murderer is unknown.

275
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,720
And yet, people still spread rumors about him.

276
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,510
You framed him for taking

277
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,120
water hemlock and dying from it.

278
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,750
But

279
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,670
why are there no signs of cold poison in him?

280
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,960
This is clearly a conspiracy to tarnish his reputation.

281
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,360
Such malicious intent deserves punishment.

282
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,070
Is that so?

283
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,300
Then, Lord Si, please take a sniff

284
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,550
to see what this is.

285
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:13,870
My Lord.

286
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:16,960
Blood.

287
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,620
That's right, deer blood.

288
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,390
Just as Miss Gu said,

289
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,350
the water hemlock has remarkable medicinal properties.

290
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,910
It contains an extremely cold poison.

291
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,240
But this deer blood is an excellent substance for suppressing the toxicity.

292
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,870
Stop beating around the bush.

293
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,390
What exactly are you up to?

294
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,870
Young Master Si goes to Tianxiang House every day.

295
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,120
Surely you must know, Lord Si.

296
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,750
The signature Xiaoyao wine at Tianxiang House

297
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,200
is mixed with deer blood.

298
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,960
It's written on Tianxiang House's menu.

299
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,750
Lord Si, feel free to investigate.

300
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,670
Lord Si,

301
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,360
you hold an esteemed position as an imperial official,

302
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,830
yet your eldest son frequents brothels,

303
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,430
indulges in aphrodisiacs,

304
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,650
and revels in debauchery.

305
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,630
Lord Si.

306
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,120
I'm afraid you need to discipline your household.

307
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,750
You...

308
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,120
So,

309
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,910
the true cause of Young Master Si's death

310
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,030
is nothing else.

311
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,600
It's due to his daily consumption of

312
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,860
the Xiaoyao wine with deer blood in it and water hemlock,

313
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,750
which led to the depletion of his yang energy,

314
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,840
excessive indulgence,

315
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,390
and ultimately, his death from physical exhaustion.

316
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,000
The Si family, known for their scholarly tradition,

317
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,680
has encountered a great disgrace.

318
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,030
Lord Si,

319
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,910
you fear the truth coming to light,

320
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,960
affecting your family's official prospects and reputation.

321
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,200
You even went to the county office at midnight to steal the corpse.

322
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,630
You're talking nonsense!

323
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
If we were to go to the Si family ancestral grave now,

324
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,560
we might still be able to see

325
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,320
the newly buried Young Master Si, I suppose.

326
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,150
How dare you!

327
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,720
In this court,

328
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,910
you've repeatedly insulted us,

329
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,080
and now you even want to dig up our family grave?

330
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,080
Lord Si,

331
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,270
if we find Young Master Si's body,

332
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,150
we can conclude

333
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,200
that the arson case is undeniably linked to the Si family.

334
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,320
Ridiculous.

335
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,480
This is slander.

336
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,910
Your Highness,

337
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,630
please do not believe

338
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,380
the words of these villains.

339
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,150
My son died tragically.

340
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,870
I have already become

341
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,390
an old man burying the young.

342
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,510
And now

343
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,730
I suffer such a great insult.

344
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,540
Lord Si,

345
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,660
no one will disturb your family's graves.

346
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,520
But to prove your innocence,

347
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,000
with the magistrate and me present,

348
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,600
we only need to check if there are any new graves.

349
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:09,910
What do you think?

350
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,420
This...

351
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,840
Lord Si.

352
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,910
Do you dare or not?

353
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,670
Sir,

354
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,150
I believe the truth of this case has come to light.

355
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,240
Can we close the case now?

356
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:35,810
Yes.

357
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,600
Your Highness.

358
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,870
Do you really want us to dig up your family's graves

359
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,840
to find your son's body

360
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,550
before you'll let this go?

361
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,090
After the trial in this court,

362
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,280
it has been confirmed that

363
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,960
the cause of Lai's death

364
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,070
was due to accidentally consuming water hemlock,

365
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,380
followed by ingesting firefly mushroom.

366
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,720
The incompatibility of these foods

367
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,670
led to accidental poisoning and death.

368
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,320
As for Si Shulun's death,

369
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,030
it was caused by excessive indulgence leading to weakened qi and blood,

370
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,720
resulting in death from exhaustion of vital energy.

371
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,960
Sun Pingkang is innocent

372
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,770
and is hereby released in court.

373
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,120
At least we didn't wrongly accuse an innocent person.

374
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,670
Thank you, Honorable Magistrate.

375
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,720
Thank you, Your Highness.

376
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,820
Pingkang,

377
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,630
are you alright?

378
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,440
We owe a great deal to Mr. Lyu this time.

379
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,480
Thank you very much, Mr. Lyu.

380
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,760
You must be the impressive friend

381
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,240
Qingcheng mentioned, right?

382
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,670
[Eating one grants inner clarity; seven make the heart fully transparent. One can then read in the dark.]

383
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,670
[It actually tastes like grass. It is as small as a bean and has purple flowers. At night, it glows.]

384
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,670
[Firefly mushroom]

385
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,270
Mr. Lyu, welcome to my residence.

386
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,360
I have prepared some modest wine

387
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,000
to express my gratitude.

388
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,870
Please don't stand on ceremony, Mr. Lyu.

389
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
Make yourself at home.

390
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,040
Yes, Mr. Lyu.

391
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,600
Please make yourself at home at our mansion today.

392
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,550
Be sure to enjoy the food and drinks.

393
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,080
Eat well

394
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,790
and drink well.

395
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,910
Mr. Lyu, I am grateful for your kindness in saving my son Pingkang.

396
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,870
I will always remember this.

397
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,120
This glass of wine

398
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,840
is to toast to your noble character.

399
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:26,670
Father,

400
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,900
I'd like to toast you with this glass of wine.

401
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,870
You've been working so hard lately.

402
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,870
Good, good, good.

403
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,850
In the future,

404
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,680
if there's anything I can do for you,

405
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,480
please don't hesitate to ask, Mr. Lyu.

406
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,200
What can you do for me?

407
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,720
Father,

408
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,870
Mr. Lyu is from the capital.

409
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,660
His lifestyle and way of expression

410
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,430
are quite different from ours.

411
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,910
I see.

412
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,390
I apologize for not greeting you from afar today, esteemed guest.

413
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,180
Mr. Lyu,

414
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,170
I'd like to propose a toast to you.

415
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,270
Mr. Lyu, your great kindness to our family

416
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,880
deserves a generous reward.

417
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,270
But Qingcheng said you don't care for gold and silver,

418
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,710
so I offer this wine to express my gratitude.

419
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,050
Mr. Lyu.

420
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,790
I will never forget the kindness of saving my life.

421
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,510
Come on, have a seat.

422
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,480
Qingcheng,

423
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,810
serve some dishes for Mr. Lyu.

424
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,880
Having a drink in the mortal world

425
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,590
is not an easy task, is it?

426
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,590
Qingcheng.

427
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,270
This time, why would the Princess

428
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,920
intervene on our behalf?

429
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,200
My brother's case is indeed a miscarriage of justice.

430
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,810
Your Highness, I implore you to investigate thoroughly.

431
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,750
I beg you to look into this matter.

432
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,680
My brother has truly been wrongly accused.

433
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,160
I beg you to investigate.

434
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,080
I beg you to investigate.

435
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,160
Your Highness, please help me.

436
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,700
Your Highness.

437
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,160
Your Highness,

438
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,250
did you really help Gu Qingcheng

439
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,680
just for a pot of flowers?

440
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,920
She's just an ordinary commoner,

441
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,750
yet for the sake of seeking justice for her family,

442
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,210
she dared to risk her life

443
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,830
and trespass through three gates of my mansion.

444
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,920
This shows she has courage

445
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,510
and is a person of loyalty and righteousness.

446
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,000
If Sun Pingkang's case

447
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,550
truly involves an injustice,

448
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,550
how could I stand by and do nothing?

449
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,640
Very well, very well.

450
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,720
I see now.

451
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,750
Our Qingcheng has really grown up.

452
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,160
Father, after this incident,

453
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,920
everyone in our mansion will be safe from now on.

454
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,350
Let's toast to the safety of our Sun family.

455
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,680
Come, let's drink to that.

456
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,830
Cheers! Cheers!

457
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,920
At this point,

458
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,920
the matter of Tianxiang House harvesting Yang energy

459
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,310
will be exposed sooner or later.

460
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,200
Now that person is in seclusion for cultivation,

461
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,510
we can't stop supplying Yang energy.

462
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,000
Since we can't stop Lyu Gengyun,

463
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,000
we might as well eliminate him

464
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,750
to prevent future troubles

465
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,510
and also avenge

466
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,200
the 500-year-old grudge for that person.

467
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,450
But,

468
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,270
Master has said

469
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,820
that Lyu Gengyun's magical powers are strong.

470
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,080
I'm afraid he won't be easy to deal with.

471
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,090
No matter how powerful his magic is, he must have a weakness.

472
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,090
And you

473
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,860
need to discover it.

474
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,080
Master,

475
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,030
I know Lyu Gengyun's weakness.

476
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,640
It's been a long time since you came back.

477
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,200
Here.

478
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,240
Have some more dishes.

479
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,400
These are all your favorites.

480
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,370
As expected, my mother's cooking is excellent.

481
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,470
You all eat too.

482
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,510
This one seems to be your favorite.

483
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,400
If you want, I'll make it for you every day.

484
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,070
Thank you, Mother.

485
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,240
Master,

486
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,160
just treat today as if you're dining with family.

487
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,410
Don't be so formal.

488
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,530
I forgot.

489
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,000
You can't eat these things.

490
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,110
How about later, after the banquet is over,

491
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,770
I'll help you gather some fresh dew.

492
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,560
It's alright.

493
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,560
It's just

494
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,750
it's been a long time since I sat together with family.

495
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,090
I miss it a bit.

496
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:51,830
Mr. Lyu,

497
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,230
from now on, the Sun's Mansion is your home.

498
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,890
Come anytime you want to eat something.

499
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,720
Mr. Lyu, don't be polite, eat more.

500
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,480
Try this dried tofu.

501
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,000
Come, Mr. Lyu, try everything.

502
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,720
This will be your new home from now on.

503
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,030
Eat more.

504
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,550
Make yourself at home.

505
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,030
May we all have days like this every year

506
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,160
and moments like this every day.

507
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,160
Good, good, good.

508
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:18,860
[Sun's Mansion]

509
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,480
Let's have a toast.

510
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,640
Cheers!

511
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,790
Come, cheers!

512
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,250
Cheers!

513
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,680
As you said,

514
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,240
Lyu Gengyun's interference in mortal world affairs

515
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,510
must bring him weaknesses.

516
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,550
He has close dealings with the people of the Sun's Mansion.

517
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,590
If we want to deal with him,

518
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,960
we just need to make use of the people from the Sun's Mansion.

519
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,200
This time,

520
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,890
we can't let it be like the Black-jointed Grass incident.

521
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,880

[Peace and Clarity]

Sir,

526
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,000
so many people with swords and guns,

527
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,750
what is this about?

528
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:01,730
[Arrest]

529
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,350
There's a report saying

530
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,080
that someone in your mansion

531
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,400
has been seen wearing

532
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,920
an item with this Liuli grass mark.

533
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,160
Mr. Sun,

534
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,310
Mrs. Sun,

535
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,590
have you ever seen it?

536
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,240
We really haven't seen this before...

537
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,070
I have seen it.

538
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,630
I'm very familiar with it.

539
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,880
This is the mark on Gu Qingcheng's

540
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,350
cloth bag.

541
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,680
She just likes this kind of

542
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,160
unsightly wild grass.

543
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:25,880
Really?

544
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,510
This mark belongs to the notorious floral thief.

545
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,480
What?

546
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,590
What?

547
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,350
My Lady, something terrible has happened!

548
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,790
My Lady, something terrible has happened!

549
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,510
The officials are here to arrest you!

550
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,830
Why do they want to arrest me?

551
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,670
They say

552
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,200
that you're the Floral Thief.

553
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,220

560
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,350
Sir,

561
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,590
there's no

562
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,010
Gu Qingcheng here.

563
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:46,960
Right?

564
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,290
Master...

565
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,260
It's

566
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,440
me.

567
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,850
I am the Commander of the Prince's Guard.

568
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,260
I'm here on orders to arrest

569
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,460
the thief who stole the tribute.

570
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,510
If you dare to resist,

571
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,070
don't blame me for being merciless.

572
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,070
Honey.

573
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,010
Sir.

574
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,070
This must be a misunderstanding.

575
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,970
Bring the suspect to me.

576
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,200
Father!

577
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,200
Qingcheng!

578
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,350
Qingcheng!

579
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,240
Qingcheng!

580
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,030
You, young lady,

581
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,180
are the one who snuck into the prince's mansion

582
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,150
and stole the Black-jointed Grass,

583
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,920
the Floral Thief?

584
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,570
Impossible!

585
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,440
That's impossible!

586
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,240
I... I didn't steal any tribute.

587
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,920
I've never even seen Black-jointed Grass.

588
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,830
It wasn't me.

589
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,590
This is the night suit

590
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,960
found in your room.

591
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,740
What do you have to say for yourself?

592
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,200
Commander,

593
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,830
this isn't a night suit.

594
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,030
It's the work clothes I wear when gardening.

595
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,670
That's right.

596
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,040
Yes,

597
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,650
it's just work clothes.

598
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,440
The evidence is irrefutable.

599
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,590
You still dare to quibble?

600
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:04,960
Guards!

601
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,750
Seize her!

602
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,550
Take her back to the prince's mansion for rigorous interrogation.

603
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,200
Yes, sir.

604
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,260
I didn't do it, Commander.

605
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,310
It really wasn't me.

606
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,270
There's a misunderstanding.

607
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,440
I'm truly innocent.

608
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,160
Commander,

609
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,640
I'm really being wrongly accused.

610
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,110
You can't arrest Qingcheng. No way!

611
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,240
Master.

612
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,600
The Flower Spirit is still inside her.

613
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,750
I can't let anything happen to her.

614
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,440
What's going on?

615
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,430
What's happening here?

616
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:57,780
Boss,

617
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,830
we found in the Sun family's greenhouse

618
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,830
the flowers reported missing in the city,

619
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,880
and damaged Black-jointed Grass.

620
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,200
Impossible.

621
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,320
Everyone knows that Black-jointed Grass is a tribute item.

622
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,950
How could I possibly damage it?

623
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:10,640
Right.

624
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,270
Moreover,

625
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,810
I couldn't even steal it.

626
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,950
This young lady is quite something,

627
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,230
stealing all the precious plants for herself.

628
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,510
These bite marks are clearly the work of a demon beast.

629
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,550
Could it be...

630
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,130
The Commander wants the Black-jointed Grass taken out.

631
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,200
Yes.

632
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,960
Take everyone from the Sun's Mansion into custody.

633
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,940
Qingcheng, quickly explain everything to them.

634
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:04,830
If you don't explain soon,

635
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,030
our whole family will be dragged down because of you, Qingcheng.

636
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,880
I'm truly innocent.

637
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,270
Think of something quickly!

638
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,110
Qingcheng!

639
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,800
Let me go!

640
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,480
Don't touch my father! Don't touch my father!

641
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,080
Stop

642
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:36,630
it!

643
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:39,920
What?

644
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,560
You shouted so loudly.

645
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,060
Are you confessing to the crime?

646
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,500
Commander,

647
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,440
this matter arose solely because of me.

648
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,510
It has nothing to do with anyone else in the Sun's Mansion.

649
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,480
But now that the tribute has been stolen,

650
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,920
and the time for presenting it is approaching,

651
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,200
if we miss the deadline,

652
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,550
we may be guilty of deceiving the emperor.

653
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,520
Do you think

654
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,440
what the princess is most concerned about now

655
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,360
is the thief who stole the tribute,

656
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,150
or the tribute itself, the Black-jointed Grass?

657
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,960
The little girl has found the key to the problem.

658
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,790
What the princess wants right now

659
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,880
is naturally

660
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,680
the Black-jointed Grass.

661
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:16,480
Alright.

662
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,480
Commander,

663
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,790
please give me three days.

664
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,030
Within three days,

665
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,550
I will surely revive the black knotgrass.

666
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,480
You'll also be able to give the princess an explanation.

667
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,770
As for the thief who stole the tribute,

668
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,190
we can search for them later.

669
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,400
What do you think?

670
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:29,920
Very well.

671
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,240
Then I'll give you three...

672
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,580
Three days.

673
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,000
If you can't resurrect the Black-jointed Grass,

674
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,200
I'll hold the entire Sun's Mansion accountable.

675
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,400
Guards!

676
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,680
Surround the Sun's Mansion.

677
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,640
Until the Black-jointed Grass is resurrected,

678
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,440
no one from the Sun's Mansion

679
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,310
is allowed to leave.

680
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:51,450
Yes, sir.

681
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,000
Well...

682
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:54,830
Mother.

683
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,680
Qingcheng.

684
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,160
Father.

685
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,830
Are you alright?

686
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,470
My Lady, I was so scared.

687
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,540
It's okay now, it's okay.

688
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,280
Qingcheng.

689
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,350
Can three days really be enough?

690
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,310
Father.

691
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,480
I will do my best.

692
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,240
Don't worry.

693
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,960
[Peace and Clarity]

694
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,320
Young generals,

695
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,240
our lady can't fly,

696
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,380
you've surrounded the Sun's Mansion completely.

697
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,270
Are you afraid we'll run away?

698
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,880
We are ordered to guard.

699
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,180
If we delay reviving the Black Jiecao,

700
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,540
we'll all be in big trouble.

701
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,990
How about

702
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,090
you guard outside the courtyard gate?

703
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,070
What do you think?

704
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,530
Let's go.

705
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,160
It's all turned black.

706
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,200
You want to revive it?

707
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,440
Isn't that just a fool's dream?

708
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,660
Shut your mouth!

709
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,610
I'll do my best.

710
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,550
Qingcheng,

711
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,930
if you need anything,

712
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,890
just say it.

713
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,280
We'll all cooperate with you.

714
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,600
Yes, Qingcheng,

715
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,990
everyone in the Sun's Mansion,

716
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,640
all their lives

717
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,550
are in your hands now.

718
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,160
That's right, Gu Qingcheng.

719
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,120
Please hurry and fix it.

720
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,700
Stop making such a racket.

721
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,410
Everyone, disperse now, disperse.

722
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,440
Qingcheng,

723
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,790
we're heading down now.

724
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:22,920
Don't worry, Father.

725
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,230
My Lady.

726
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,080
Can you really revive this Black-jointed Grass?

727
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,390
Zisu,

728
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,800
don't you believe in me anymore?

729
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,850
No, no,

730
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,880
of course I believe in you, My Lady.

731
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,410
It's just...

732
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,750
This concerns everyone in the entire household,

733
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,980
everyone's lives.

734
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,380
I'm a bit scared.

735
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,330
Don't be afraid.

736
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,540
Let's do our best and get to work right away.

737
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,830
Hand me that shovel.

738
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,560
Here, be careful.

739
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,610
The rhizome of this Black-jointed Grass is damaged,

740
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:18,260
♫Wind follows water, asking the flower spirit♫

741
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,450
nutrients can't be transported to the flowers and leaves.

742
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,750
We need to nourish the roots first,

743
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:26,460
♫Years pass, yet we are fortunate to reunite♫

744
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,240
then graft new flower stems at the damaged areas

745
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,000
to supply nutrients to the main stem.

746
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:33,200
♫A blessed land, moonlight shines on two shadows♫

747
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:39,560
♫Love fills the city, inseparable like shadows♫

748
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:46,250
♫Evergreen like the bond we share♫

749
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:53,860
♫Liuli grass sways, carrying my longing♫

750
00:30:54,190 --> 00:31:00,860
♫Fate turns, time flows like a waterwheel♫

751
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:06,600
♫Peonies bloom, stars shine deep in the clouds♫

752
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:14,190
♫Seasons change, but my love for you stays♫

753
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:21,360
♫A gentle smile binds our hearts forever♫

754
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,210
This Black-jointed Grass was destroyed by a monster.

755
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:28,650
♫Cicadas in summer, snow in winter, our souls rest in dawn and dusk♫

756
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,880
It's not that easy to save.

757
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:34,010
♫Through countless journeys, we cherish each other still♫

758
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,020
I'd better go check on it for this foolish disciple.

759
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,680
Fortunately, the places bitten by the monster

760
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,720
will all retain its aura.
