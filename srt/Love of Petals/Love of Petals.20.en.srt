Tiandong has already become a celestial attendant,

383
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,270
Is there any?

384
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:04,960
No.

385
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,680
Be careful.

386
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,480
Thank you.

387
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,640
The Soul-Calling Flowers on the mountain

388
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,350
have been destroyed by someone already.

389
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,030
Could it be that someone is targeting your family?

390
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,440
Our family has always been kind to others.

391
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,030
We've never made enemies with anyone.

392
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,160
Who would want to harm us?

393
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,550
It's alright.

394
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
There must be new

395
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,350
Soul-Calling Flowers somewhere on the mountain.

396
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,590
Let's keep looking.

397
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,240
Soul-Calling Flower.

398
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,550
Here.

399
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,440
This is the last Soul-Calling Flower.

400
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,880
Give it to me.

401
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,400
Another old acquaintance.

402
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,510
Wushuang!

403
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,160
It's you.

404
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,310
You're the one trying to harm our family, aren't you?

405
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,590
Those who stand in my way shall die.

406
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,160
Blame

407
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,240
your own bad luck.

408
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,160
Take it out

409
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,310
on me!

410
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,440
Wushuang.

411
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,750
Wushuang.

412
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,830
Wushuang.

413
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,640
Wushuang.

414
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,310
Wushuang.

415
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,030
Are you alright?

416
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,110
Wushuang.

417
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:52,830
Wushuang!

418
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:53,830
Wushuang!

419
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,440
I'm sorry.

420
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,310
I failed to protect the Soul-Calling Flower.

421
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,550
Wushuang.

422
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,160
Wushuang.

423
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,010
♫How can we predict the separation and reunion?♫

424
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,590
Let's hold on a little longer.

425
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,520
I... I'll take you back to Qingcheng Flower Nursery.

426
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,240
They'll surely find a way to save you.

427
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,040
♫I'm obsessed with you in every life♫

428
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,030
Wushuang.

429
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,510
Wushuang.

430
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,640
Wushuang!

431
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,860
♫Can you recall the traces of our bond?♫

432
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,690
♫How do you see through the means of fate?♫

433
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,480
I remember

434
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,750
♫The mortal world is our chess board and we have some regrets♫

435
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,110
this is how you held me

436
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:30,090
♫Longings are blooming all over the lake again♫

437
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,750
the first time

438
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,960
when you took me out of the cage.

439
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:33,760
♫Time can solve all problems♫

440
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,450
♫But it just stands by♫

441
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,720
Miss.

442
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,540
♫I'm willing to use all my courage♫

443
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,020
♫For the happiness of the next life♫

444
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,510
I know

445
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,750
you've always been good to me.

446
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,100
♫For you♫

447
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Confucius said,

448
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,640
♫I'm willing to keep searching with joy and sorrow♫

449
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,880
"Born and grown,

450
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,830
peerless in beauty."

451
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,790
How about I call you Wushuang (as in peerless)?

452
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,490
♫With you♫

453
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:57,930
♫It's never too late as long as we are together♫

454
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,510
Wushuang's wish

455
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,440
is my wish.

456
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,000
If there's an afterlife,

457
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,310
♫In dreams, fleeting as flowers, may we turn and look back♫

458
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,600
♫Spring returns, and our reunion shining bright at last♫

459
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,070
I'll give you...

460
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,700
♫A path home, paved with petals so grand♫

461
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,180
♫I know you're waiting on the other end♫

462
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,160
♫Just as I have wished♫

463
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,790
Wushuang.

464
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,260
Wushuang!

465
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,680
Wushuang, look at me.

466
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,750
Look at me, Wushuang!

467
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,790
Wushuang, look at me! Wushuang!

468
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,720
Wushuang!

469
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,990
♫Just as I have wished♫

470
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,440
Wushuang!

471
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,000
Wushuang!

472
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,110
The poem says that

473
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,510
♫For you♫

474
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,030
red beans are the most symbolic of longing.

475
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,470
♫I'm willing to keep searching with joy and sorrow♫

476
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,480
It must be a precious gift.

477
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,790
I picked these in the Misty Forest.

478
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,250
♫With you♫

479
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,680
For you.

480

♫It's never too late as long as we are together♫

481
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,310
Red beans grow in the southern land.

482
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,200
How many branches will sprout in spring?

483
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,170
♫In dreams, fleeting as flowers, may we turn and look back♫

484
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,310
May you pick more of them.

485
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,200
Because these beans are symbols of longing.

486
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,270
♫Spring returns, and our reunion shining bright at last♫

487
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,590
♫A path home, paved with petals so grand♫

♫Spring returns, and our reunion shining bright at last♫

[Longing Beans, From the Tang Dynasty]

494
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,010
[Red beans are symbols of longing; Every inch of longing turns to ash.]

495
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,010
[In the southern land, a few branches sprout in spring; Pick some to send your longing.]
