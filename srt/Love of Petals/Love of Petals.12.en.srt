[Episode 12]

3
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,590
Master,

4
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,590
I

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,950
have something

6
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,430
to tell you tomorrow.

7
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,200
Alright.

8
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
I also

9
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,220
have something to tell you.

10
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,710
Then,

11
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,840
see you tomorrow, Master.

12
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,150
Alright,

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,400
see you tomorrow.

14
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,590
Master,

15
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,560
isn't this quite poetic?

16
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,280
What do you want to tell me?

17
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,430
No need to rush into talking.

18
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,560
Look at the warm spring sun

19
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,560
and the shimmering lake.

20
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,430
The scenery is so beautiful.

21
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,000
Miss Gu just said,

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,630
I blow the wind first, then you scatter the petals, right?

23
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,030
No,

24
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,030
I scatter the petals first, then you blow the wind.

25
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,710
Impossible.

26
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,630
I'm sure I go first.

27
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,870
I remember she said it like that.

28
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,240
If I don't scatter the petals,

29
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:27,980
what are you going to blow?

30
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,960
What are you two arguing about?

31
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,310
You two fools.

32
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,150
How is that possible?

33
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,240
I definitely go first.

34
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,150
I scatter the petals first.

35
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,430
Master.

36
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,280
Master.

37
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,870
What are you doing?

38
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,120
You...

39
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,079
Don't look at the sky.

40
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,310
Look at me.

41
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,079
Do I look good today?

42
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,430
Do I?

43
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,520
I heard a sound from the tree.

44
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,670
It might be a bird.

45
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,910
Birds have been

46
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,890
chirping a lot lately.

47
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,000
They're just birds.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,840
Master,

49
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,870
I brought a jar of good wine today.

50
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,590
Let's have a taste.

51
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,710
Sure.

52
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,120
Alright.

53
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,190
I'll go get it.

54
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Hurry up.

55
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,240
Come on.

56
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,870
She's ready.

57
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,070
Now get ready.

58
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,510
Hurry.

59
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,430
Here it comes.

60
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,630
You!

61
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,120
Oh no!

62
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,390
I messed it up.

63
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,160
This...

64
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,390
This...

65
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,430
The flower pollen went up my nose.

66
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,310
How did it even end up on the watermelon?

67
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,630
How do we fix this?

68
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,560
I...

69
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,480
I forgot.

70
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,360
I...

71
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,310
Wait a moment.

72
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,070
Let me think.

73
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,870
Let me think.

74
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,270
Master,

75
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,720
are you alright?

76
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,920
I'm fine.

77
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,750
It's just a bit windy.

78
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,430
Yes.

79
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,510
Why is the wind so strong?

80
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,360
Master, do you want some watermelon?

81
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,040
Let me cut it for you.

82
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:18,720
No need.

83
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,630
Don't be shy.

84
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,160
No need, really.

85
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,120
No need, really.

86
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,450
Give it to me.

87
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,270
-Give it to me.
-My watermelon!

88
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,800
I know. I'll cut it for you.

89
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,940
My watermelon!

90
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,950
Master,

91
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,630
do you really like this watermelon that much?

92
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,720
I usually

93
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,040
like to hold watermelons in my arms.

94
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,920
You like to

95
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:42,680
hold them?

96
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,330
Is it really that fun?

97
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:48,040
Let me try holding one.

98
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,430
What...

99
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,750
What is this?

100
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
This...

101
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,920
This is a gift

102
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,300
I prepared for you.

103
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,750
A gift?

104
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,430
Master, you're giving me a gift?

105
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,020
Then, amidst the shower of flower petals,

106
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,800
I want to tell you that...

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,720
Miss Gu, oh Miss Gu.

108
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,300
A friend in need is a friend indeed.

109
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,000
Let me, this old turtle, help you one last time.

110
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
I want...

111
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,430
Be careful!

112
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,190
I remember now!

113
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,800
I remember how to fix it now.

114
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,070
Qingcheng.

115
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,430
What happened?

116
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,480
I just wanted to stand up

117
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,190
and say those words to Master.

118
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,920
How did I

119
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,950
end up in the water myself?

120
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,669
Hurry!

121
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,080
You...

122
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,840
How could I fall into the water?

123
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,480
Once a teacher, always a father.

124
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,910
You are now my master.

125
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,280
Master,

126
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,030
I can handle this scorching sun,

127
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,170
but you can't.

128
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,150
What, do you want to take care of me now?

129
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,570
I wouldn't say no to that.

130
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,080
Do you really want to become an immortal that badly?

131
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,750
The person I wish to see

132
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,390
is in the heavens.

133
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,840
Sooner or later,

134
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,840
you'll be just like your demon father,

135
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,720
unable to suppress your demonic nature.

136
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,870
Once I remove the Flower Spirit,

137
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,270
you can return to your original life.

138
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,510
I should also go and do what I must do.

139
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,000
Are you alright?

140
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,600
Qingcheng!

141
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,790
Master.

142
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,080
Are you alright?

143
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,200
I'm fine.

144
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,270
I felt

145
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,670
a sudden pull

146
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,510
in my chest just now.

147
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,960
It's nothing.

148
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:17,840
I'm fine.

149
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,010
I don't know what happened.

150
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,910
I must have crushed it just now.

151
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,320
It's alright.

152
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,150
It was just an ordinary cup.

153
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,880
I'll buy you a new one.

154
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,700
But this was your gift to me.

155
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,120
Now the gift is gone,

156
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,990
with no more spring water

157
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,980
or flower petals.

158
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,470
The gentle breeze has turned into a storm.

159
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,670
At least there's still a bonfire

160
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,000
to dry our clothes.

161
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,450
You've got to be kidding me.

162
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,750
Oh god,

163
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,770
are you targeting me?

164
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,320
Master,

165
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,550
I was trying to create

166
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,720
a romantic atmosphere,

167
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,240
but I completely messed it up.

168
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,960
Qingcheng.

169
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,870
Look.

170
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,870
A rainbow.

171
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,030
A rainbow

Only by crossing the rainbow

175
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,750

prepare well for the Floral Competition.

179
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,320
Perhaps winning the competition

180
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,390
will help you cultivate immortality

Then...

184
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,480

There's a big rainbow

199

and a small rainbow.

Perhaps winning the competition

204
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,630
will help you cultivate immortality

Master is right.

209
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,150
I must work harder

210
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,000
and confess my feelings

211
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,790

213

Winning first place in the Floral Competition

214
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,720
is the most important thing right now.

215
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,910
You were so close to succeeding.

216
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,600
Why did you give up halfway?

217
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,360
You brought this backlash upon yourself.

218
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,200
Didn't you say the crystal cup wouldn't harm anyone?

219
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,500
When extracting the Flower Spirit,

220
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,960
Gu Qingcheng was clearly in distress.

221
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,240
Well, uh...

222
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,270
That crystal cup was never meant to harm anyone.

223
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,670
No one has ever used it to extract the Flower Spirit before.

224
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,320
How was I supposed to know?

225
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,750
Since the crystal cup is already broken,

226
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,490
there's no point in dwelling on it.

227
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,320
Master,

228
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,820
what do you plan to do next?

229
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,360
You're not actually developing feelings for that girl, are you?

230
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,030
You are a unique being, half-immortal and half-demon.

231
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,130
Without your mother's Flower Spirit protecting you,

232
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
you could risk being consumed by your demonic aura

233
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,320
and losing control.

234
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
Yes, Master.

235
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,790
During your battle

236
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,030
with the Jade-Eyed Fox at Tianxiang House,

237
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,600
your demonic aura...

238
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,240
I can balance the spiritual energy within me.

239
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,870
As for the Flower Spirit,

240
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
I'll find another way.

What letter? Let me see.

249
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,000
The letter is here!

250
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,240
Quick, look!

251
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,510
Wait.

252
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,200
Let me guess.

253
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,750
Is it an invitation

254
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,840
to the Floral Competition?

255
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,240
Yes!

256
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,270

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,480

Shi Huai,

260
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,790
can you read it for me?

261
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,730
Sure.

262
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,040
Dear contestant,

263
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,910
the Floral Competition is about to begin.

264
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,120
All registered participants must go through

265
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,200
a preliminary selection process,

266
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,080
which involves cultivating

267
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,150
a new flower seed.

268
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,120
A new flower seed?

269
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,320
Once the flowers bloom,

270
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,600
the top three will be selected by vote

271
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,910
to advance to

272
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,910
the fi... fi...

273
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,690
The final round.

274
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,000
To advance to the final round,

275
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,840
where they will further

276
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
cultivate their skills

277
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,120
to reach the Vital Sprout Stage.

278
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,480
Looks like this year's Floral Competition

279
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,970
is harder than ever.

280
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,470
It's hard as it should be.

281
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,320
Wasn't it already mentioned above?

282
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,480
Whoever

283
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,750
takes the championship

284
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,120
in the Floral Competition

285
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,200
will reach the Mystic Branch Stage.

286
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
By then,

287
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,150
one would be just a step away

288
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,810
from becoming a flower fairy.

289
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,630
But Miss Gu,

290
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,150
this doesn't sound easy.

291
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,320
Growing flowers...

292
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,510
That shouldn't be a problem for me.

293
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,320
As for

294
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,390
cultivation...

295
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,240
I have a master

296
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,730
who is one of a kind in this world.

297
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,010
That's right.

298
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,200
With Master here,

299
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,510
there won't be any problems at all.

300
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,349
Rest assured.

301
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,310
Keep a low profile.

302
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,160
There won't be any problems at all.

303
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,310
In this world,

304
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,260
trust is the one thing that must never be betrayed.

305
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,310
I'm glad you understand.

306
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,440
But no matter what,

307
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,310
you don't have the Flower Spirit right now.

308
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,480
If you recklessly use your power again,

309
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,440
you might lose your life.

310
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,070
Don't say I didn't warn you.

311
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,920
Qingcheng!

312
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,550
Qingcheng!

313
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,200
Qingcheng!

314
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,030
Pingkang.

315
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,720
Why are you here?

316
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,920
Young Master.

317
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,440
Where should I put all this luggage?

318
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,920
Where's Wushuang?

319
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,310
Mr. Lyu.

320
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:58,880
Wushuang.

321
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,960
Why are you here?

322
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,270
Well.

323
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,400
Isn't the Floral Competition about to start?

324
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,480
I figured

325
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,000
you'd all be too busy to handle everything,

326
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,640
so I came to help out.

327
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,000
From today on,

328
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,160
I'll be staying here and helping you grow flowers.

329
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,310
You?

330
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,030
Help her?

331
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,180
Grow flowers?

332
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,160
I even brought your favorite salted fish.

333
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,720
Salted fish is great!

334
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,070
I love it the most.

335
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,480
I love it the most.

336
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,030
Miss Gu actually likes salted fish?

337
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,920
Before the final round of the Floral Competition,

338
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,510
you must cultivate yourself to the Vital Sprout Stage.

339
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,200
That means using spiritual energy

340
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,550
to nourish your five organs and six viscera,

341
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,200
cultivating a small universe within your body.

342
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,310
You must sense the flow of natural spiritual energy

343
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,270
and allow the Vital Sprout to grow within you.

344
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,070
Watch me do it.

345
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,790
Now you try.

346
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,720
Don't use too much force.

347
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,480
You must learn to relax.

348
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,830
Feel the spiritual energy

349
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,910
flowing through your body.

350
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,960
Try it again.

351
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,310
Master,

352
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,440
what's happening to me?

353
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,070
If your heart is not calm,

354
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,920
and you forcibly control the flow of spiritual energy,

355
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,350
it will only leave your body, wasting twice the effort for half the result.

356
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,830
So if your mind is distracted,

357
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,680
you won't be able to enter the right state.

358
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,200
Is something troubling you?

359
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,200
I'm thinking about my flower seed.

360
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,350
Flower seed?

361
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,550
Master,

362
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,490
can you be the first person

363
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,580
to see my flower bloom?

364
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,030
Focus your mind.

365
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,770
I'll help guide your spiritual energy.

366
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,400
You don't have the Flower Spirit right now.

367
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,790
If you recklessly use your power again,

368
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,590
you might lose your life.

369
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,720
This is...

370
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,200
demonic aura.

371
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,510
Oh no!

372
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,150
The master's spiritual energy is too weak

373
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,680
to control the demonic aura from leaking.

374
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,940
It's me. Ouch!

375
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,550
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,160
Next time, don't pat me on the back like that.

377
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,480
You're quite aware of defense.

378
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,440
But

379
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,550
you don't seem to understand human interactions.

380
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,350
I'm not human.

381
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,480
How would I understand?

382
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,750
Then you should at least understand your master.

383
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:37,900
I understand him.

384
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,930
That's exactly why I have to go in.

385
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,240
You'd better not.

386
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,160
Trust me.

387
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,550
If you go in now,

388
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,830
you'll disrupt their cultivation.

389
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,640
Wushuang.

[Qingcheng Flower Nursery]

391
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,200
I've told you so many times.

392
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,440
You must stop using your power.

393
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,070
Why don't you ever listen?

394
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,110
I don't understand.

395
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,290
Why are you helping Gu Qingcheng compete in the Floral Competition?

396
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,830
The Flower Spirit is now connected to her bloodline.

397
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,110
It can't be forcibly removed.

398
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,830
If she wins the Floral Competition,

399
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,750
and ascends to immortality,

400
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,790
she may willingly return the Flower Spirit to me.

401
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,350
Even if

402
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,330
she could release the Flower Spirit,

403
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,770
still...

404
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,480
With your current physical condition,

405
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,030
can you hold out until then?

406
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,470
Master.

407
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,000
Master, are you there?

408
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,590
Master?

409
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:11,770
Master.

410
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,790
I want to tell you

411
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,240
I've chosen the flower seed for the preliminary round

412
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,270
of the Floral Competition.

413
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,400
But

414
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,310
it needs some pine needle mulch

415
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,400
to grow more securely.

416
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,510
Master,

417
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,160
could you

418
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,840
come with me to the pine forest later?

419
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,550
Alright,

420
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,550
see you in a bit.

421
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,440
Then I'll go pack now.

422
00:23:59,310 --> 00:23:59,750
What?

423
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,790
Why are you two still here?

424
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,790
Master,

425
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,300
we'll go with you.

426
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,440
You two stay here and watch over the nursery.

427
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,830
There are plenty of people

428
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,030
to watch the nursery.

429
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,550
I've guarded you for five hundred years.

430
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,340
I must go with you!

431
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,170
I said,

432
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,070
you're not going.

433
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,750
Wait,

434
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,440
don't you know

435
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,720
your own physical condition?

436
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,550
Master,

437
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,200
sorry to keep you waiting.

438
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,550
Morning.

439
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,720
Everyone's here.

440
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,550
Are we all going together?

441
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,720
They're here to see us off.

442
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,350
Let's go.

443
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:35,830
Come on.

444
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,480
Let's bring back a lot of pine needle mulch.

445
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,440
Alright.

446
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,080
[Pine Forest]

447
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,960
What kind of flower are you planting

448
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,480
that you have to come all the way here for special fertilizer?

449
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,590
Last time, my confession was a mess.

450
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,960
This time, I want to do it my way.

451
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,240
So,

452
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,290
from planting to blooming,

453
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,750
I want you to witness the entire process.

454
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,160
Why do these little flowers look so withered?

455
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,960
Someone as kind and pure as she

456
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,070
deserves to ascend to immortality,

457
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,330
bringing blessings to countless flowers and plants.

458
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,130
Master, look, there's a flower on this rock.

459
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,920
This is a chrysanthemum stone.

460
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,170
It's quite rare.

461
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,110
You know about this type of stone?

462
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,550
Legend has it that there was a man named Black Ox

463
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,200
and his beloved wife named Chrysanthemum.

464
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,350
But later, Chrysanthemum was accidentally injured,

465
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,820
which left her unable to bear children.

466
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,240
She was then despised by her in-laws

467
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,160
and sold off.

468
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,140
Black Ox went through countless hardships to find Chrysanthemum

469
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,550
but still couldn't gain his parents' understanding.

470
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,640
In the end,

471
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,850
they both drowned themselves in the river,

472
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,770
vowing to stay together in life and death.

473
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,110
Years later,

474
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,070
when people were building a waterway,

475
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,750
they unearthed these black stones

476
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,720
with chrysanthemum patterns on them.

477
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,830
People then said

478
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,030
that it was the reincarnation of Black Ox and Chrysanthemum.

479
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,790
In this way, they finally

480
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,720
achieved eternity together.

481
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,440
Master,

482
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,460
this chrysanthemum stone

483
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,000
has such a touching story.

484
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,030
So,

485
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,720
what's the moral of this story?

486
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,310
I only heard the tale.

487
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,110
I don't know its moral.

488
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,640
Here, for you.

489
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,950
Didn't you give me a bracelet before?

490
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I should return the favor.

491
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,000
Consider this

492
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,330
a borrowed gift.

493
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:32,550
Thank you.

494
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,680
Don't overthink it.

495
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,960
I just don't like seeing things dirty.

496
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,200
I...

497
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,880
I'm not overthinking at all.

498
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,550
Hang in there a little longer.

499
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,350
Once Mr. Lyu comes back, it'll be fine.

500
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,830
I'll go get you some water.

501
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,440
What if they get hungry?

502
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,030
What if they get thirsty?

503
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,000
What if they need to

504
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,110
use the bathroom?

505
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,880
It's too hot.

506
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,200
There's nothing we can do.

507
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,250
We have to wait for Master to return.

508
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,210
Have a sip.

509
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,160
Why hasn't Master come back yet?

510
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,110
The customers have arrived.

511
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,000
The customers have arrived.

512
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,790
It's not hot.

513
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,920
Let's go.

514
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,270
Come this way, please.

515
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,070
What is this?

516
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,790
These are our shop's

517
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,740
newest dolls.

518
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,880
Please, come in.

519
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,790
This way, please.

520
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,660
Here.

521
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,350
Have some water.

522
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,570
You must be very thirsty.

523
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,900
Drink it slowly.

524
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,590
I like the blue one inside the most.

525
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,790
Then, plant it into the soil.

526
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,720
Does this mortal world of love and longing

527
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,780
still have a place for me?

528
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,000
I can't stand watching this.

529
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,200
Master,

530
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,710
can you fit this in?

531
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,110
Why don't we try another one?

532
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
You need to spread it evenly like this.

533
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,920
Master, wait a moment.

534
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:57,780
Don't move.

535
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,550
Now it's symmetrical.

536
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,880
Where is your seed?

537
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,070
This is it.

538
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,010
I'm counting on this for the Floral Competition.

539
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,000
Let's bury it.

540
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,550
Then, scatter the moss over it.
