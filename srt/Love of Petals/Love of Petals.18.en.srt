00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,180
[Love of Petals]

2
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,180
[Episode 18]

3
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,829
It's raining.

4
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,120
Qingcheng?

5
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,930
Why isn't she using an umbrella?

6
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,310
Immortal Lord,

7
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,190
what brings you here?

8
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,280
-Let me.
-Let me.

9
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,360
You go about your business.

10
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,240
Thank you.

11
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,680
Your Excellency.

12
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,040
I will surely repay

13
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,390
your great kindness in the future.

14
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,240
These are snacks I made myself.

15
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,800
No need to be so formal.

16
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,390
My name is Yuxiao.

17
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,950
You can just call me Yuxiao.

18
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,480
Yuxiao, meaning Jade Heaven?

19
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,290
From the clouds descends a celestial being from the Jade Heaven,

20
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,630
exuding an ethereal grace, delicate and beautiful like a true fairy.

21
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,320
That's a lovely name.

22
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,210
Please, try some.

23
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,310
Thank you.

24
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,220
Are you

25
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,760
the Flowers Immortal Lord?

26
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,920
What did you say?

27
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,510
Your Excellency,

28
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,870
please accept my bow.

29
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,720
My name is Gu Qingcheng.

30
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,080
I am a florist from Pingcheng.

31
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Lyu Gengyun.

32
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,160
Why are you feeling uncomfortable?

33
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,000
He is the real Flowers Immortal Lord.

34
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,120
If one day,

35
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,800
you're not by Qingcheng's side,

36
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,190
wouldn't it be good if someone else takes care of her?

37
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,510
Is it delicious?

38
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,480
It's delicious.

39
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,270
I've searched through all the ancient texts recently.

40
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,430
I've also conducted experiments.

41
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,950
Transplanting roots of flowers from the same family

42
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,240
can be successful.

43
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,600
However,

44
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,510
it's difficult to disperse the spiritual energy from the roots

45
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,070
throughout the entire flower.

46
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,390
You've been researching lately

47
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,390
how to make the Moonlight Peony bloom without withering.

48
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,310
It's still for the purpose of using its roots

49
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,480
to exchange for Lyu Gengyun's life.

50
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,190
The Moonlight Peony

51
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,830
is a unique treasure in this world.

52
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Once it's destroyed,

53
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,480
your dream of ascending to immortality

54
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,680
will also be ruined.

55
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,240
If

56
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,680
using the roots of the Moonlight Peony

57
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,560
to save my master

58
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,870
would cause it to wither,

59
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,950
I'll find a way to revive it again.

60
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,630
Why must it be an either-or choice?

61
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,800
I once knew a woman

62
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,360
who went through countless hardships

63
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,800
to cultivate and become an immortal.

64
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Step by step, she ascended to the position of Flower Goddess.

65
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,870
But because she developed delusional thoughts,

66
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,800
her cultivation was completely destroyed.

67
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,120
In the end, she gained nothing.

68
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,560
I don't want you to end up like her.

69
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,680
Don't worry, Your Excellency.

70
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,560
I know what I'm doing.

71
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,070
I won't give up on immortal cultivation easily either.

72
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,600
Since you're so determined,

73
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,560
why don't you cultivate the Buhua Stone with me?

74
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,950
Buhua Stone?

75
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,560
I think I've heard of it before.

76
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,190
Is it about transforming the patterns cultivated on stones

77
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,360
into flower stems?

78
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,070
That's correct.

79
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,560
This way,

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,600
it can solve the problem of

81
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,070
spiritual energy not being able to reach all parts of the flower after grafting.

82
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,950
Forgive my directness, Your Excellency,

83
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,310
but if your immortal technique is so advanced,

84
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,870
why can't you directly save my master yourself?

85
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,830
Wouldn't that be faster than teaching me?

86
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,040
This technique

87
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,240
requires the balance of yin and yang,

88
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,240
a man and a woman,

89
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,480
to be successfully cultivated.

90
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,980
With just one person's effort,

91
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,430
it's difficult to master.

92
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,950
I see.

93
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,040
Thank you, Your Excellency,

94
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,530
for offering your help again.

95
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,000
No need to thank me.

96
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,700
I can teach you this immortal magic,

97
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,630
but you must promise me

98
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,680
that no matter what happens in the future,

99
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,360
you will not give up on your bright future.

100
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,510
I understand.

101
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,830
Thank you for your reminder, Your Excellency.

102
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,510
Remember,

103
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,190
don't have any distracting thoughts,

104
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,630
and don't be influenced by any external disturbances.

105
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,390
Rest assured, Your Excellency.

106
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,750
Coming to this secluded place

107
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,560
is to avoid disturbances from the outside world.

108
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,800
How is it?

109
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:14,950
Do you feel

110
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,040
your internal organs

111
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,430
being cleansed by spiritual power?

112
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,950
Yes.

113
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,430
This woman

114
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,510
has excellent innate qualities,

115
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,070
exceptional talent,

116
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,360
and a passionate love for flowers and plants.

117
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,160
She is truly a rare find.

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,480
If unencumbered by love and affection,

119
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,080
she would surely become an excellent flower fairy.

120
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,669
Immortal Yuxiao,

121
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,390
I feel my palm burning.

122
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,270
Is there something I'm doing wrong?

123
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,250
No,

124
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,840
this is a normal phenomenon.

125
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,130
Now, channel the spiritual power cultivated in your palm

126
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,000
and transfer it to the Buhua Stone,

127
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,600
forming meridians.

128
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
Why can't I calm down today?

129
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,120
She hasn't come all day.

130
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,390
Master.

131
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,440
Master.

132
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,600
I went to see the Flowers Immortal Lord today

133
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,130
to cultivate the Buhua Stone.

134
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,950
She went to cultivate Buhua Stone with Yuxiao?

135
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,630
I want to become more powerful,

136
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,670
stronger.

137
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,270
Then,

138
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,870
maybe I'll be able to protect you.

139
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,000
You've always been protecting me.

140
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,320
Are you alright?

141
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,390
You've just acquired immortal power.

142
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,600
Your use of spiritual energy is

143
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,120
not yet effortless enough.

144
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,360
But look,

145
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
there's already a circle of meridians on the Buhua Stone.

146
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,480
Your Excellency.

147
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,550
Is it done?

148
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,750
It's not quite done yet.

149
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,440
Only when the meridians

150
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,790
cover the entire Buhua Stone in circles,

151
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,910
can it be considered complete.

152
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,670
So it will get more difficult as you progress.

153
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,080
Qingcheng is like me,

154
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,600
without parents,

155
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,910
living under someone else's roof.

156
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,320
I must help her sever her emotional attachments,

157
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,320
and protect her on the path of immortality.

158
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,030
I can't let her go through

159
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,720
the same struggles and hardships I did.

160
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,870
Immortal Yuxiao,

161
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,240
I will work twice as hard.

162
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,000
As long as you're humble and willing to learn,

163
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,030
not just about the Buhua Stone,

164
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,240
but also other things,

165
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,730
I will teach you everything I know.

166
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,720
Thank you for your guidance, Your Excellency.

167
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,670
This is good news.

168
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,080
I must quickly tell my master.

169
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,360
Qingcheng,

170
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,240
I teach you immortal magic

171
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,390
to help you ascend to immortality.

172
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,720
Will you then also call me master?

173
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,030
Master,

174
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,750
today I have already

175
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,910
cultivated a meridian on the Buhua Stone.

176
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,960
Impressive.

177
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,870
Little gardener.

178
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,000
Are you complimenting me?

179
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,630
Master,

180
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,320
tomorrow is the Floral Competition.

181
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,270
Will you

182
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,600
cheer for me?

183
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,080
I believe

184
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,960
you will definitely win first place.

185
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,200
Tomorrow is the Floral Competition.

186
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
Inject this into the Moonlight Peony.

187
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,500
Don't leave any traces.

188
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,510
Yes.

189
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,030
Contestants of the final round of the Floral Competition,

190
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,480
Pingcheng,

191
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,150
blessed by the Flower God,

192
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,550
enjoys spring-like weather all year round,

193
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,030
with flowers blooming throughout the city.

194
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,670
Therefore, the winner of this final round

195
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,910
will directly receive the spirit pill

196
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,670
to reach the Mystic Branch Stage.

197
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,550
Only three flowers have been selected for the final round.

198
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,150
We will showcase them one by one,

199
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
and the one with the most votes will win.

200
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,960
Great!

201
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,240
Everyone has a flower in their hand.

202
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,910
After the three flowers are displayed,

203
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,710
everyone will put their flower

204
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,340
into the corresponding basket.

205
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,390
The one with the most flowers wins.

206
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,960
Great!

207
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,750
Let the display begin.

208
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,480
The first one,

209
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,720
Starlight Rose.

210
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,000
I heard that

211
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,660
this Starlight Rose was

212
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,810
the first one cultivated by the Plum Blossom Fairy.

213
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,270
Is that so?

214
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,010
It's indeed a divine creation.

215
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,080
Beautiful, beautiful.

216
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
The second one,

217
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Jade Begonia.

218
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,270
Let me tell you about the Jade Begonia,

219
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,510
it's a divine creation from the Begonia Fairy's heart and soul.

220
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,000
It's a once-in-a-century sight.

221
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,630
The third plant.

222
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,840
Moonlight Peony.

223
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,240
It truly lives up to its name as the Moonlight Peony.

224
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,550
I've heard it's a masterpiece.

225
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,510
The last one who grew it was the Flower Goddess.

226
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,000
Could it be that this Gu Qingcheng is

227
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,390
the reincarnation of the Flower Goddess?

228
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,080
Everyone, you can start voting now.

229
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,390
What's that?

230
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,290
Look quickly!

231
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,280
What's going on here?

232
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,630
Guards!

233
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,670
You two,

234
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,910
go check what's happening.

235
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,590
It's a demon!

236
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,550
It's a demon!

237
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,000
It's a demon!

238
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:19,920
Qingcheng.

239
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,640
My Lady!

240
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,400
Qingcheng

241
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,780
My Lady!

242
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,109
My Lady!

243
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,400
What's going on?

244
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,270
My Lady!

245
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,030
Qingcheng!

246
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,480
Qingcheng!

247
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,680
My Lady!

248
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,110
Qingcheng!

249
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,160
My Lady!

250
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,000
Lyu Gengyun.

251
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,440
Tiandong?

252
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,960
Why are you here?

253
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,200
Something happened to Gu Qingcheng.

254
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,070
Qingcheng.

255
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,660
What happened to her?

256
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,240
Gu Qingcheng's Moonlight Peony emits toxins,

257
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,350
causing people to faint.

258
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,000
Everyone thinks she's a demon.

259
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,310
She planted poisonous flowers

260
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,310
to absorb the spiritual power of Pingcheng's flora.

261
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,380
How could she possibly be a demon?

262
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,350
Immortal Yuxiao,

263
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,880
as the Flower God,

264
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,720
cannot interfere in mortal affairs.

265
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,350
I had no choice but to come here

266
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,640
to inform you.

267
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,110
Let me out!

268
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,110
What you dare not handle,

269
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,830
I will take care of it.

270
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,550
You heard everything, didn't you?

271
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,510
As immortals,

272
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,440
we cannot make an exception for Gu Qingcheng,

273
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,520
nor can we stand by and watch Gu Qingcheng

274
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,590
be wrongly accused.

275
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,160
I

276
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,960
can help you

277
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,880
escape from this Red Spider Lily barrier,

278
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,000
and I can guarantee

279
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,240
that these Red Spider Lilies will not wither

280
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,440
within the next two hours.

281
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,830
You

282
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,440
go and save her.

283
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,480
Kill her!

284
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,200
Demon!

285
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,400
Kill her.

286
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,350
I'm not.

287
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,110
Kill her.

288
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,030
I'm not.

289
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,790
My lady is not a demon.

290
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,790
Kill her.

291
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,030
I'm not.

292
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,160
Kill her.

293
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,070
Let her go.

294
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,400
She's not a demon.

295
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,960
She's not.

296
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,880
My lady is not a demon.

297
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,550
Kill her. Kill the demon.

298
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,350
I'm not.

299
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,240
Let her go.

300
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,830
She's not a demon,

301
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,720
Let her go.

302
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,480
My Lady.

303
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,000
Father.

304
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,200
Kill the demon.

305
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,830
Everyone, everyone.

306
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,000
Please calm down, please calm down.

307
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,680
Qingcheng is my daughter.

308
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,440
She grew up in Pingcheng.

309
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,330
She can't possibly be a demon.

310
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,920
Nonsense, Master Sun.

311
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,750
Your surname is Sun.

312
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,720
Your daughter's surname is Gu.

313
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,110
She's not your daughter at all.

314
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,510
That's right.

315
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,160
Maybe

316
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,350
she really is a demon.

317
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,830
Kill the demon!

318
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,400
My lady is not a demon,

319
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,790
Many of you have watched her grow up.

320
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,440
How could she possibly be a demon?

321
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,310
She can't be a demon.

322
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,550
This demon, isn't she about to reveal her true form?

323
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,640
My Lady.

324
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,240
We humbly request Your Highness to make a decision.

325
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,680
Kill this demon woman.

326
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,240
To restore peace for the people of Pingcheng.

327
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,350
Your Highness, please investigate carefully.

328
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,110
You must investigate thoroughly.

329
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,880
Please investigate carefully, Your Highness.

330
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,400
Your Highness.

331
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,270
Your Highness.

332
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,150
Please investigate carefully.

333
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,650
Please have mercy, Your Highness.

334
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,480
Guards.

335
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,270
Execute Gu Qingcheng

336
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,510
on the spot.

337
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,640
This...

338
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,310
Execute her! Execute her! Execute her!

339
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,550
Your Highness, please show mercy.

340
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,680
Execute her! Execute her! Execute her!

341
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Execute her! Execute her! Execute her!

342
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,680
No!

343
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,590
Your Highness.

344
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,000
My Lady!

345
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,680
Your Highness.

346
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,440
Please have mercy, Your Highness!

347
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,200
Please release my lady, Your Highness.

348
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,880
You're here.

349
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,160
Qingcheng.

350
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,440
Wait.

351
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,000
Can you hand Qingcheng over to me?

352
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,580
I think she probably wants to go home now.

353
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:24,980
You're finally back.

354
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,960
On the way back

355
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,480
to Qingcheng Flower Nursery, the Red Spider Lily

356
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,160
has already suffered significant damage.

357
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,200
I tried my best,

358
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,510
but couldn't make it last even for two hours.

359
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,920
I'm sorry.

360
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,920
You're back at last.

361
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,310
You all talk amongst yourselves.

362
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,620
I'll take my leave first.

363
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,510
Where's the Gu girl?

364
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,510
She's in the safest place.

365
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,270
This...

366
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,000
Master.

367
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,640
This...

368
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,790
The demonic aura has started to consume Master's heart meridian.

369
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:09,920
Master.

370
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,640
-Let me share your demonic aura with you.
-No.

371
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,640
If you absorb the demonic aura,

372
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,880
and can't control it,

373
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,400
you'll become a demon yourself.

374
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,750
I'm sorry, Master.

375
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,350
Ye You,

376
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,310
help me.

377
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:36,790
I...

378
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,920
I can try.

379
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,640
No.

380
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,640
You're a celestial attendant.

381
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,400
Only demons can help other demons share demonic aura.

382
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,630
Assist me.

383
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,590
Wushuang.

384
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,350
Rise.

385
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,070
No, Wushuang.

386
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:42,920
Wushuang.

387
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,380
Wushuang.

388
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,350
He's the son of the Demon King,

389
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,030
the one with the most potent demonic aura in the world.

390
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,310
On your own,

391
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,640
not only can you not help him,

392
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,270
but you'll also destroy yourself.

393
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,020
-Let’s try again.
-Wushuang.

394
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,350
Wushuang.

395
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,160
Wushuang, listen to me.

396
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,240
I know.

397
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,110
For five hundred years,

398
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,240
these five hundred years, it's only been

399
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,480
the three of us together.

400
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,200
I want to save him, I want to save him.

401
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:15,960
I'm sorry.

402
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,750
Wushuang.

403
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,480
You can't do it alone.

404
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,400
I can.

405
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,550
Wushuang.

406
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,110
I'm sorry.

407
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,320
I'm sorry.

408
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,680
I'm sorry.

409
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,790
I'm sorry.

410
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,960
I'm sorry.

411
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,110
Master.

412
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,200
Master.

413
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,750
You have me too.

414
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,310
You have me too.

415
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,720
That's right.

416
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,960
You have us too.

417
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,830
Master,

418
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,350
even though I'm old,

419
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,030
these old bones of mine

420
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,880
can still bear some demonic aura.

421
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
Let's work together.

422
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,000
We'll definitely help you overcome this crisis, Master.

423
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,070
Master,

424
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,400
you brought us from the ends of the earth,

425
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,790
gave us a home.

426
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,310
You must live, you must!

427
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,480
I don't want to live without a home anymore.

428
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,310
Without you,

429
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,640
we wouldn't have the life we have now.

430
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,160
Yes.

431
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,750
Together, we can surely overcome any difficulties.

432
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,550
Master,

433
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,240
if you live,

434
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,550
we can live too.

435
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,030
