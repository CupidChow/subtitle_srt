♫A flower blooms, a thought arises♫

192
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,330
♫A thought descends into the dust of fate♫

193
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,820
♫Fate stirs, whose gaze lingers with longing?♫

194
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,080
♫Stirring dreams of joy deep within the heart♫

195
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,080
♫Light, still lingering♫

196
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,710
♫For the days and nights are too brief♫

197
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,390
How did

198
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,870
♫Before we share the rain's refrain♫

199
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:35,840
this peony

200
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,440
grow so big?

201
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,870
♫A falling star, two eyes embrace♫

202
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,490
♫In this world, blossoms fall like dreams, countless as the stars♫

203
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,960
♫Yet no radiant light compares to the grace of your gaze♫

204
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,690
♫Through storm and snow, love carves its trace♫

205
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,620
♫Reluctantly, I take one last lingering look♫

206
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,600
Oh no!

207
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,650
♫I vow to stay, through time and tide♫

208
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,320
He's awake.

209
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,940
♫Like morning dew, unswayed, untried♫

210
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,690
♫A single tear, a thousand words♫

211
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,960
♫I vow to stay, through time and tide♫

212

♫Like morning dew, unswayed, untried♫

00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:37,860
♫Never forget this eternal bond, for all time♫

214
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:47,750
♫Never forget this eternal bond, for all time♫

215
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,420
Could this really be

216
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,220
the legendary

217
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,030
Flowers Immortal Lord?

218
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,840
Little Ye You,

219
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,790
how dare you act so recklessly before me?

220
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,600
My Lord,

221
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,750
I have guarded you for 500 years;

222
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,390
you have finally awakened!

223
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,640
Explain clearly.

224
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,980
What exactly is going on?

225
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,000
It's all because of this girl.

226
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,320
She was bold enough

227
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,790
to pick you and plant you here.

228
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,670
I thought she possessed spiritual power,

229
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,480
so I tried to absorb it to awaken you.

230
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,600
Who would have thought she was just a mere mortal?

231
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,960
How dare you deceive me!

232
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,120
My Lord,

233
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,310
I wouldn't dare utter a single falsehood.

234
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,510
He...

235
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,720
He is not lying.

236
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,440
It was I who picked you.

237
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,200
Flower Spirit?

238
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,510
How did it end up on her?

239
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,910
Gu Qingcheng,

240
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,960
you've finally met the Flowers Immortal Lord

241
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,440
after 15 years of planting flowers and saving plants.

242
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,550
You must seize this opportunity.

243
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
You can do it,

244
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,310
Gu Qingcheng.

245
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,240
You are the Flowers Immortal Lord?

246
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,480
What did you say?

247
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,550
Your Highness,

248
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,920
please accept my bow.

249
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,590
My name is Gu Qingcheng.

250
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,200
I am a florist from Pingcheng

251
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,960
and have been cultivating flowers for over 10 years.

252
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,070
So much nonsense.

253
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,680
My father taught me to recognize and distinguish plants since I was little...

254
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,640
Your Highness,

255
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,350
what are you doing?

256
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,590
What's going on?

257
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,480
I can't move her.

258
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,640
Your Highness, are you testing me?

259
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,920
I should have a natural gift for this.

260
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,960
I'm very skilled at growing flowers.

261
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,480
How about you try again?

262
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,110
Could it be that my flower spirit is inside her?

263
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,790
If I hurt her,

264
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,790
I would suffer

265
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,750
the backlash myself.

266
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,200
Your Highness!

267
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,880
Your Highness!

268
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,640
Legend has it that

269
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,790
a thousand years ago, a florist

270
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,070
ascended to a flower fairy

271
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,230
[Flower Market]

272
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,200
after cultivating the perfect Moonlight Peony.

273
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,310
Since then, people have followed suit,

274
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,310
making flower cultivation a revered practice.

275
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,360
[Sun Family's maid, Zisu]

276
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,750
My Lady, wait for me!

277
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,110
Shortly after that,

278
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,270
Pingcheng became renowned far and wide

279
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,750
for its rare and exotic flowers.

280
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,310
Every spring and autumn,

281
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,350
it bore the responsibility of

282
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,680
offering precious blooms to the imperial court.

283
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,960
Sixth Brother,

284
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,720
are you really throwing away all these flowers?

285
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,440
They've dried up like this;

286
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,240
should I keep them as firewood?

287
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,550
Sixth Brother,

288
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,350
these flowers just need more water.

289
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,720
I can still save them.

290
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,590
If you don't want them, then give them to me.

291
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,110
No way!

292
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,750
Step aside!

293
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,020
You're always picking up my withered flowers.

294
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,030
Well,

295
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,770
you think you can revive them when I can't?

296
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,420
It seems that you're so great.

297
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,330
Fine.

298
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,030
Get lost!

299
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,310
The 7891th.

300
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,480
What?

301
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,510
The next flower I save

302
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,140
will be the 7,891st one.

303
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,510
My Lady,

304
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,200
you're still thinking about that?

305
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,070
Zisu,

306
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,020
I'm sure I can save it.

307
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,270
The Immortal Lord has arrived.

308
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,110
Who?

309
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,640
What, My Lady?

310
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,110
You've met the Immortal Lord again?

311
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,830
If you really know the Immortal Lord,

312
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,400
ask him to stop this rain.

313
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,830
It's soaking us.

314
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,070
How could we trouble the Immortal Lord over such a small matter?

315
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,030
It's simple.

316
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,000
My Lady,

317
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,830
how much are you planning to get scammed for this time?

318
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,590
You can't talk like that.

319
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,680
The Immortal Lord will hear you.

320
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,320
The Immortal Lord takes medicine? Never heard of that.

321
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,590
You don't...

322
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,880
You don't understand.

323
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,470
Hurry up and bring me that medicine.

324
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,240
Which one?

325
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
That one.

326
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,790
The medicine this time

327
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,270
will definitely work.

328
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,680
My Lady,

329
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,110
are you sure this is drinkable?

330
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,030
Bitter medicine is good for the illness.

331
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,000
It will definitely be fine this time.

332
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,440
Immortal Lord,

333
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,000
you must wake up quickly.

334
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,510
Take me to cultivate immortality soon.

335
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,680
I want to become the most beautiful

336
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,160
flower

337
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,590
fairy

338
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,000
!

339
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,270
I heard that music therapy is especially effective.

340
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,240
Let me try.

341
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,310
You've gone crazy.

342
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,350
There's no hope left!

343
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,260
[Prince Ning's Mansion]

344
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,880
What on earth is going on?

345
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,510
Black-jointed Grass is an incredibly important sacred herb.

346
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,880
It took the entire city

347
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,920
nearly 30 years to find just one.

348
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,680
It was meant as a tribute for the emperor's birthday.

349
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,160
If anything happens to it,

350
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,100
[Princess Ning]

351
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,590
the status of Pingcheng's tribute flowers

352
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,790
will be shaken.

353
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,070
Your Highness,

354
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,400
the palace is heavily guarded.

355
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,720
For the Black-jointed Grass

356
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,240
to disappear under the eyes of the sentries;

357
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,790
this is no ordinary theft.

358
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,030
Based on the bite marks found at the scene,

359
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,880
it might be...

360
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,070
Might be what?

361
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,110
It might be a fierce beast

362
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,610
or the work of some evil spirit.

363
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,720
Nonsense!

364
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,440
It's probably just a trick

365
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,480
to draw attention.

366
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,440
Yes, yes.

367
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,310
It's my fault

368
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,790
for failing to protect the Black-jointed Grass.

369
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,550
Your Highness,

370
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,160
rumors in the Pingcheng speak of

371
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,680
a notorious floral thief striking frequently in recent days.

372
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,030
Perhaps the disappearance of the Black-jointed Grass

373
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,880
is related to him.

374
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,060
No matter what,

375
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,650
you must retrieve the Black-jointed Grass

376
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,630
before His Majesty's birthday.

377
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,550
Capture this thief immediately—

378
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,880
better to err on the side of excess than to let a single culprit slip away.

379
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,000
Yes!

380
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,640
This is the emblem on the floral thief's backpack.

381
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,550
If you see this person,

382
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,240
be sure to deliver him to the authorities.

383
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,480
Withdraw!

384
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,240
Yes.

385
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:33,790
Yes.

386
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:37,960
If this thief

387
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,030
had only stolen flowers, that would have been one thing.

388
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:40,830
But now,

389
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,720
he's dared to steal a tribute meant for the imperial court!

390
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
This Black-jointed Grass

391
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,030
is tied to the safety of the entire city.

392
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,070
I've heard that the Black-jointed Grass possesses the power to cleanse one's meridians

393
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,200
and can aid in cultivation.

394
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,400
Could the floral thief

395
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,790
really be a monster seeking to cultivate?

396
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,750
A monster?

397
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,310
This... This is outrageous!

398
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,640
If he truly succeeds in his cultivation,

399
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,440
no one will be able to stop him!

400
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,980
We must capture him as soon as possible.

401
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,160
Subjecting him to all 108 tortures

402
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,590
wouldn't even be excessive!

403
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,590
It's not too much. We must catch him!

404
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,070
[Arrest]

405
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,070
That's right, catch him!

406
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,030
Catch him!

407
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,200
Immortal Lord,

408
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,400
you're awake!

409
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,160
Speak.

410
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,880
Who are you exactly?

411
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,440
My name is Gu Qingcheng,

412
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,550
a florist from Pingcheng.

413
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,070
The white peony flower you rested inside last night

414
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,000
was the 7,890th one

415
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,790
I cultivated.

416
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,070
Since childhood, I swore to

417
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,750
nurture 9,999 flowers—

418
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,510
only then could I earn the chance to cultivate immortality alongside you.

419
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,440
How can someone talk so much?

420
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,680
Did you hear my wish

421
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,400
and descend to the mortal realm ahead of time?

422
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,920
What nonsense are you spouting?

423
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,200
I want to cultivate immortality with you!

424
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,910
Would you be willing to take me as your disciple?

425
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,360
Cultivate immortality?

426
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,240
Yes.

427
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,000
Immortal Lord,

428
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,030
as long as you agree,

429
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,790
whatever request or task you have,

430
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,270
I'll do it!

431
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,440
Immortal Lord?

432
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,820
Do you know who I am?

433
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,240
Flowers Immortal Lord,

434
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,440
please take me as your disciple.

435
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,350
My name is Lyu Gengyun.

436
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,600
Immortal Gengyun,

437
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,530
please take me as your disciple.

438
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,830
This gesture again.

439
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,310
Could it be that the last test wasn't finished?

440
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,070
Master,

441
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,830
was the last test not completed?

442
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,680
Does that mean I have great immortal potential

443
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,880
and wisdom?

444
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,510
Master.

445
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,240
Don't call me that!

446
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,200
Could it be that in such a short time,

447
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,720
the Flower Spirit has bonded with her bloodline?

448
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,030
I can't forcefully extract it.

449
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,510
I have to stay and watch over her.

450
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,610
Think about how to take it out.

451
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,510
If you truly want to learn,

452
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,240
it's not impossible.

453
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,030
Really, Master?

454
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,400
But becoming my disciple won't be easy.

455
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,060
I have high

456
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,470
standards...

457
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,550
I'm sorry, Master.

458
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,030
I have high standards

459
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,060
and a bad temper.

460
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,680
Everything depends on your performance.

461
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,750
Don't worry, Master.

462
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,640
Hard work, courage,

463
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,310
and perseverance

464
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,590
are my best qualities.

465
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,270
I will definitely pass the test

466
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,510
and complete the task.

467
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,960
Then let's pinky swear on it.

468
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,030
Once we lock pinkies, the promise is sealed.

469
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,920
The white peony is the most elegant,

470
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,550
pure,

471
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,510
noble, and a symbol of honesty and integrity.

472
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,110
A teacher for a day

473
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,880
is a father for a lifetime.

474
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,160
You are now my master.

475
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,270
Master.

476
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,550
what kind of foolish disciple is she?

477
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,590
Master,

478
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,920
what exactly are we training for?

479
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,240
To temper your mind and spirit,

480
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,590
you need to start by standing under the sun for a whole day.

481
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:43,880
Master,

482
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,790
my mind is already strong!

483
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,480
I work in the flower nursery every day, enduring the sun and rain.

484
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,270
I can handle hardship.

485
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,550
Master,

486
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,440
how about

487
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,310
you teach me sooner

488
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,720
so I can repay you sooner?

489
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,350
Since I can't extract the Flower Spirit,

490
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,940
why not teach her the art of condensation

491
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,270
so she willingly gives it to me?

492
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,590
Master,

493
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,680
you looked so cool flying just now.

494
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,920
Master, wait a moment.

495
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,270
What are you doing?

496
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,070
I can endure the sun,

497
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,310
but you can't.

498
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,590
Peonies love light but can't handle too much sun.

499
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,480
I'll follow your lead when it comes to cultivation,

500
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,120
but for growing flowers, you listen to me, okay?

501
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,200
Listen to you?

502
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,210
Well, do you want me to take care of you too?

503
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,640
It's not impossible.

504
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,510
Master,

505
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,180
I'll keep holding it.

506
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,640
[Young Madam of the Sun Family]

507
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,310
What are you doing?

508
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,310
What's wrong?

509
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,440
Why are you acting so strange?

510
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,510
Can dew really sustain Master?

511
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,200
Why is Young Madam here?

512
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,810
Why didn't you tell me she was coming?

513
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,470
Gu Qingcheng!

514
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,830
You didn't greet anyone

515
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,110
and didn't show up this morning;

516
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,750
do you really think you're the lady of the house now?

517
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,640
Ma'am,

518
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,640
why are you here so early in the morning

519
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,180
without sending a word?

520
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,030
What's that in your hand?

521
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,200
It's dew I just collected.

522
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,680
I was planning to use it to wash my face.

523
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,960
I'm always busy

524
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,830
managing the household affairs

525
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,790
and hardly have time to take care of my face.

526
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,920
Since you like it so much,

527
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,590
then take it.

528
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,310
Qingcheng,

529
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,400
you grew up

530
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,640
in this household.

531
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,030
Once Pingkang achieves the top rank in the imperial exam,

532
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,270
Lord Sun

533
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,750
will naturally arrange your marriage.

534
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,920
Got it?

535
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,400
Alright then.

536
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,790
But remember,

537
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,880
don't forget your status.

538
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,400
Yes.

539
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,830
I'm leaving.

540
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,920
Um...

541
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,270
Take care, Ma'am.

542
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,160
My Lady,

543
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,200
she took all the food with her!

544
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,510
It's fine.

545
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,200
Haven't you gotten used to it after all these years?

546
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,720
My Lady,

547
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,160
the Young Madam

548
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,790
comes around every few days to make trouble.

549
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,350
She keeps taking our things

550
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,190
and even treats you like a servant.

551
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,160
It doesn't matter.

552
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,110
After all,

553
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,490
I'm never really the proper young lady of the Sun Family.

554
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,960
I'm just

555
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,350
a child bride

556
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,200
temporarily staying in the flower nursery.

557
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,850
Once the Young Master returns,

558
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,070
he'll surely stand up for you.

559
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,590
There was no need for you to summon me;

560
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,760
I was already on my way.

561
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,240
You've seen Qingluan?

562
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,510
What did he say?

563
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,310
You knew I went to see the Master?

564
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,680
Indeed,

565
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,510
the Master ordered me to watch over you all these years...

566
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,480
No, he ordered me to guard you.

567
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,160
Now that you've suddenly awakened,

568
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,920
I naturally had to report it.

569
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,440
I was afraid he would worry.

570
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,590
I don't have many friends in the Heavenly Realm.

571
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,070
I was planning to visit him another day.

572
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,790
But how could you...

573
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,310
Say what you want to say.

574
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,510
You are Qingluan's celestial attendant.

575
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,000
I won't make things difficult for you.

576
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,350
Let me do it.

577
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,960
My Lord, is this okay?

578
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,680
Well...

579
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,440
My Lord,

580
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,790
were you

581
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,440
awakened by that girl, Gu Qingcheng?

582
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,030
I haven't figured out the whole story yet.

583
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,830
She is determined to cultivate immortality

584
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,350
and insists on taking me as her master.

585
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,680
Taking you as her master?

586
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,350
You're not even an immortal.

587
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,830
She might as well just learn from me.

588
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,070
That's not what I meant.

589
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,710
What I mean is that

590
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,830
your spiritual power surpasses all three realms,

591
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
and you don't even care about being an immortal.

592
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,750
But this girl's background

593
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,920
is actually quite pitiful.

594
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,680
How so?

595
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,110
You see,

596
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,960
this girl

597
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,510
is annoying.

598
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,240
But ever since she was little,

599
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,640
she's had an unbreakable bond with plants and flowers.

600
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,720
Her father was a gardener at the Sun's Mansion

601
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,070
for half his life.

602
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,920
Growing up by his side,

603
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,720
she picked up

604
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,110
quite a lot of skills.

605
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,590
If any difficult plant-related ailments

606
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,750
are in her hands,

607
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,890
she can cure them all.

608
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,640
It's a pity.

609
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,790
Her mother died

610
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,000
in childbirth.

611
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,440
Then, when she was 8,

612
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,880
her father drowned.

613
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,030
So,

614
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,590
she's a young lady of the Sun Family in name,

615
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,680
but in reality,

616
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,830
she was born a servant.

617
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,350
She's just a child bride

618
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,440
raised in the flower nursery.

619
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,240
What does any of this

620
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,590
have to do with me?

621
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,480
If it truly had nothing to do with you,

622
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,830
you wouldn't still be here.

623
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,640
What do you know?

624
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:42,830
Speak!

625
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,750
M... Master,

626
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,640
Master said

627
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,070
your roots were severed,

628
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,510
that you shouldn't have been able to wake again.

629
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,310
But she managed to wake you up,

630
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,160
so I figured...

631
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,350
Whatever you figured, keep it to yourself.

632
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,640
Yes.

633
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,550
Yes.

634
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,960
If the flower spirit is lost,

635
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,480
your

636
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,200
life will be in danger.

637
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,710
Lyu Gengyun,

638
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,760
are you planning to slaughter all living beings

639
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,110
like your demon father?

640
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,150
What exactly happened

641
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,800
on the seventh day of the third month?
