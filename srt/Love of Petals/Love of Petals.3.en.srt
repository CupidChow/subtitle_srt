[Love of Petals]

00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,120
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,100
So,

4
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,509
the real cause of Lai's death

5
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,759
wasn't the firefly mushroom,

6
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,100
but the water hemlock someone gave him.

7
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,470
It was...

8
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,450
Si Shulun?

9
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,790
Whether it was him or not,

10
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,840
let's go ask first.

11
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,960
Boss, it's just inside.

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,190
What ghost?

13
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,280
Don't panic!

14
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,590
Where is the ghost?

15
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,120
Boss.

16
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,190
Over there, Boss.

17
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,560
G-Go quickly!

18
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,079
G-Go take a look,

19
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,360
Boss.

20
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,560
Boss.

21
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,680
Go take a look quickly!

22
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,940
H-H-He just sat up.

23
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,380
Look!

24
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,630
One lazybones

25
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,900
and one scaredy-cat!

26
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,880
Putting on this whole ghost act for me!

27
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,970
Master,

28
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:00,470
do I really have to dress like this?

29
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,310
Master.

30
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,150
I've heard that Si Shulun

31
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,870
indulges in revelry at Tianxiang House every night.

32
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,840
The beauty's charm is the hardest to resist.

33
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,590
Only this way

34
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,400
can we get information the fastest.

35
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,960
But I still

36
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,140
feel uncomfortable all over.

37
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,160
Master,

38
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,840
why don't you use the illusion technique

39
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,079
to make me invisible instead?

40
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:32,630
No.

41
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,430
There's a heavy

42
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,590
demonic aura in Tianxiang House.

43
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,760
There are demons?

44
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,470
You haven't mastered any magical power yet,

45
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,310
so your true identity could easily be exposed.

46
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,470
It's safest to disguise yourself as a dancing girl.

47
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,240
However...

48
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,360
since you'll be posing as a dancing girl...

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,240
do you know how to dance?

50
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,750
I...

51
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,560
give it a try.

52
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,080
Is it like this, Master?

53
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,910
Ye You.

54
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,360
Stop messing around here.

55
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,240
No,

56
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,430
I really didn't mean to laugh.

57
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,070
It's just that...

58
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,430
even a possessed stick would dance better than you.

59
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,570
If you're so good, why don't you show us how it's done?

60
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,870
Are you convinced now?

61
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,010
You've forgotten the dream-making spell

62
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,830
but managed to learn dancing instead.

63
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,930
Now I finally know what you've been doing

64
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,190
these past 500 years.

65
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,950
You two go together.

66
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,000
I...

67
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,040
That's final.

68
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,450
Pry out information about the water hemlock,

69
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,710
but don't alert our target.

70
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,950
Put this on.

71
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,600
Si Shulun knows you.

72
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,790
It suits you quite well.

73
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,600
Master,

74
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,920
do I really have to go with him?

75
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,360
I don't even want to go with you.

76
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,920
I don't want to go with you either.

77
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,750
Is the dancing girl for the west chamber here yet?

78
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,750
The dancing girl for the western chamber!

79
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,040
Go quickly.

80
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,740
I'm here!

81
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,150
Okay, okay, okay.

82
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,510
Be careful.

83
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,480
First time here, right?

84
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:39,710
Don't be nervous.

85
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,870
Let's go.

86
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,120
Why aren't you getting ready?

87
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,190
The guest is already waiting.

88
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,590
Go in and start dancing.

89
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,730
Sir,

90
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,310
I am the dancing girl for tonight.

91
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,390
Why hasn't Ye You

92
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,870
come over yet?

93
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,790
Sir?

94
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,950
Sir!

95
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
We are the dancing girls

96
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,270
performing for you tonight!

97
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,920
She does the dancing,

98
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,660
and I am...

99
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,510
I... I... I am...

100
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,040
But we have prepared you

101
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,480
a very beautiful dance today.

102
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,159
We hope you'll like it.

103
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,630
What are you doing?

104
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,620
Sir?

105
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,920
Sir, would you like to join us?

106
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,820
Why isn't he paying attention to me?

107
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,960
Do you want to be...

108
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,890
A bit more flirtatious?

109
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,190
Sir?

110
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,360
Do you like it?

111
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,960
Sir, look at me.

112
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Give me some response.

113
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,110
[Tianxiang House]

114
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,480
Sir, sir,

115
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,630
give me some response.

116
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,450
Sir?

117
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,070
Sir won't pay any attention to me.

118
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,360
You've danced so well.

119
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,070
Yes, indeed.

120
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,830
Let me give it a try.

121
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,270
Sir,

122
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,920
are you satisfied

123
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,150
with our performance just now?

124
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,040
Sir?

125
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,040
Let me pour you a drink?

126
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:07,890
What's wrong?

127
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,440
What should we do now?

128
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,750
Si Shulun?

129
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,390
Si Shulun, say something.

130
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,680
Wake up.

131
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,380
Come on, wake up!

132
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,290
How could he wake up when his face had already turned black as coal?

133
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,240
Si Shulun,

134
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,870
was it you who gave the water hemlock to Lai?

135
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,120
Official investigation!

136
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,360
All unauthorized personnel, clear out!

137
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,669
Si Shulun!

138
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,480
I need you to prove my brother's innocence!

139
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,960
Wake up, please wake up!

140
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,669
Otherwise, what should my brother do?

141
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,750
Si Shulun, wake up!

142
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,270
Let's go.

143
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:45,840
Master,

144
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,630
Si Shulun is dead now.

145
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,000
Who will prove Pingkang's innocence?

146
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,460
How can I save Pingkang?

147
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,050
He's now my only hope.

148
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,120
I can't leave.

149
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,080
I need to think of another way.

150
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,320
If the officials come in here,

151
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,240
you won't be able to explain this.

152
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,150
Go first.

153
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,360
I'll figure something out.

154
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,450
Official investigation!

155
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,120
Search the place!

156
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,670
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

157
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,600
Seal off the scene!

158
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,720
Don't let anyone leave!

159
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,600
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

160
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,620
Qiansi, oh Qiansi.

161
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,600
You actually let a mortal die in Tianxiang House.

162
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,190
Do you know you're almost draining me dry?

163
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,030
This kind of mistake

164
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,810
is just too amateurish, isn't it?

165
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,390
I know I was wrong.

166
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,090
Please punish me, Master.

167
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,350
Fortunately, Wuyuzi is muddle-headed,

168
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,670
[Wuyuzi; Turtle Demon]

169
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,720
letting Lyu Gengyun and his foolish disciple in.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,020
First time here, right?

171
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,790
Otherwise...

172
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,540
who else could be our scapegoat?

173
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,280
Mas...

174
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,860
Please spare me, Master!

175
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,570
Spare you?

176
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,370
Wuyuzi,

177
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,990
you've been of great help to Qiansi.

178
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,440
I know I was wrong.

179
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,550
Where did you do wrong?

180
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,960
I shouldn't have brought the people who shouldn't have entered

181
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,980
into the Tianxiang House.

182
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,710
I've already taken care of things

183
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,100
with the county magistrate.

184
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,510
Si Shulun's case will be concluded by dawn.

185
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,960
Please rest assured, Master.

186
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,080
Very good.

187
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,510
Wuyuzi failed in his duties.

188
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,320
All minor demons will be punished with 300 strikes of the killing rod.

189
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,790
Qiansi will make amends for her mistakes

190
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,220
by supervising the punishment.

191
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,030
Enough.

192
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,440
Do you want

193
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,920
to confess voluntarily?

194
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,480
My Lord, I don't know

195
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,720
what you want me to confess.

196
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,150
Even now, you're still playing dumb with me.

197
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
Confess honestly!

198
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,300
Which of

199
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,680
your accomplices killed Si Shulun?

200
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,950
Si Shulun is dead?

201
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,120
No, My Lord.

202
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,120
I've been in jail this whole time.

203
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,440
I know nothing about it.

204
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,600
Let's see how long you,

205
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,000
a mere scholar, can hold out.

206
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,870
When someone is set on framing another, they can always find an excuse.

207
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,150
As a local official, you'd make such a judgment!

208
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,440
How can you convince the people?

209
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,390
It seems I need to add another charge against you—

210
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,120
unrepentant!

211
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,960
Guards!

212
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,510
Yes, sir!

213
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,390
Make him sign the confession!

214
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,080
Yes, sir!

215
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,120
I didn't do it.

216
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,790
My Lord, do you still have any sense of law in your heart?

217
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,390
Once you sign,

218
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,720
these words in black and white are the law!

219
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,630
No! No!

220
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,870
We can close the case now!

221
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,050
This is the irrefutable evidence!

222
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,670
Wait!

223
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,550
Manager Wang,

224
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,910
what brings you here?

225
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,630
The Princess has ordered

226
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,910
that Sun Pingkang has passed the imperial examination.

227
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,000
He's a scholar from Pingcheng

228
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,440
and also the pride of the county.

229
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,360
If he has committed any crimes,

230
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,810
of course, we shouldn't shield him.

231
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,200
But if he

232
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,750
has truly been wronged,

233
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,630
we must certainly clear his name.

234
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,840
I understand

235
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,550
the Princess's order, Manager Wang.

236
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,870
I will thoroughly investigate this case.

237
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,440
Then I'll trouble you with this matter.

238
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,360
I bid you farewell, Manager Wang.

239
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,670
Is the money still there?

240
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,360
Yes, it is.

241
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,360
Return it, return it, return it.

242
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,240
Yes, yes, yes.

243
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,930
How did the Princess find out about this?

244
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,100
[Pingcheng County Government Office]

245
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,630
Hurry up and make it quick.

246
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,030
Pingkang.

247
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,980
They tortured you.

248
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,200
Come on.

249
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,020
Pingkang.

250
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,030
These are the snacks that Mother made for you.

251
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
Hurry up and eat.

252
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,550
After noon,

253
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,010
it will be the joint trial.

254
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,750
Don't worry.

255
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,240
I have a very powerful mas...

256
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,390
friend.

257
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,110
He is also helping us think of ways.

258
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,600
We won't let anyone wrongly accuse you.

259
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,500
I did give Lai the firefly mushroom.

260
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,760
Si Shulun is also dead and couldn't testify.

261
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,630
This time...

262
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,870
I'm afraid I'm doomed.

263
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,480
In the future,

264
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,750
please take care of our parents.

265
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,430
He died from excessive blood loss,

266
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,120
yet there's not a drop of blood left in his body.

267
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,360
This wasn't done by humans.

268
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,790
You, the noble son of the Demon King,

269
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,160
a figure feared by gods and ghosts across the three realms,

270
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,630
yet you've come to the mortal world to be a coroner?

271
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,390
If you can't help, keep your mouth shut.

272
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,320
I-I will definitely help.

273
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,160
I'll possess the county magistrate right now,

274
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,090
write an order

275
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,720
declaring Sun Pingkang innocent, and have him released.

276
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,870
After all this, I'll still have time

277
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,720
to grab some wontons at the street corner...

278
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,910
Matters of the mortal world

279
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,000
should naturally be solved in mortal ways.

280
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,750
Otherwise, there will be endless troubles.

281
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,790
This corpse doesn't look like something mortals could do either.

282
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,240
If it were a demon,

283
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,600
there are many simple

284
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,510
and effective ways to kill a mortal.

285
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,200
Why go to such great lengths?

286
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,840
The reason they drained Si Shulun's blood...

287
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,980
Is because

288
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,030
there are important clues in the blood.

289
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,200
And despite all the blood being drained from his body,

290
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,510
his expression is still so peaceful.

291
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,390
It's indeed strange.

292
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,790
Heaven bless us.

293
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,030
Bless Pingkang to be safe and sound.

294
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
Heaven bless us.

295
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,130
Bless my son, Pingkang.

296
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,480
Hope Pingkang can be safe and sound.

297
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,550
May he return soon.

298
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,120
Please bless us.

299
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,030
Father.

300
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,510
Mother.

301
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,720
Qingcheng.

302
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,870
I'm back.

303
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,270
Qingcheng.

304
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,150
How is it?

305
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,480
Is Pingkang alright?

306
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,550
Pingkang

307
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,440
is doing well.

308
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,150
That's good.

309
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,030
That's good.

310
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,790
That's good.

311
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,510
Mother,

312
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,140
the magistrate will hold a joint trial soon.

313
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,630
I've already asked someone to find a way.

314
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,240
There will be a chance

315
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,600
for Pingkang to appeal.

316
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,440
That's good.

317
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,510
Qingcheng.

318
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,550
What are Pingkang's

319
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,870
chances in this lawsuit?

320
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,910
Father,

321
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,870
Mother.

322
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,390
I dare not deceive you two.

323
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,600
The only breakthrough in this case

324
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,630
is Si Shulun.

325
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,510
But he's already dead now.

326
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,390
Dead?

327
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,080
What?

328
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,200
Mother.

329
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,510
Mother.

330
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,200
Don't worry too much.

331
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,320
We can't give up

332
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,030
until the very last moment.

333
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,000
There's always a way,

334
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,750
right?

335
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,200
Okay.

336
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,200
Father.

337
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,960
Take good care of Mother.

338
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,310
Leave the rest

339
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,190
to me.

340
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,550
This corpse doesn't look like something mortals could do either.

341
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,030
Why is there a fox demon's scent?

342
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,440
All the calamities

343
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,100
seem to be related to demons.

344
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,730
If demons are really behind this,

345
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,560
they must also know my identity.

346
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,300
Si Shulun died mysteriously at Tianxiang House...

347
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,470
The truth behind Lai's inexplicable death...

348
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:11,140
I need to go check again.

349
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:16,829
Lai and Si Shulun's deaths appear similar,

350
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,750
but their ways of dying are completely different.

351
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,680
What was the purpose of killing them both?

352
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,680
Did they see something at Tianxiang House,

353
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,300
so they were silenced?

354
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,270
Quick, this way.

355
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,790
Someone's coming.

356
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,750
Hurry, let's go.

357
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,120
I'll never come to Pingcheng's morgue again.

358
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,110
Too smelly.

359
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,200
Fire!

360
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,590
Fire!

361
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,640
Let's get out of here!

362
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,110
Looks like we're on the right track.

363
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,070
Wait, what should we do about this?

364
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,990
The mortal world is truly wonderful.

365
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,800
Look at that one.

366
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,070
Smiling just like that Si Shulun.

367
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,960
Go knock him out.

368
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,750
Why?

369
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,880
Why don't you go?

370
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,250
Because I'm a good demon.

371
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,780
Well, I'm an immortal then.

372
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,720
Fine, I'll go.

373
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,200
Sir.

374
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,480
Let's have a drink?

375
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,320
Look over there first.

376
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,000
Why did you drink so much?

377
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,440
Come on, are you alright?

378
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,550
He almost kissed me just now.

379
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,070
I guessed it right.

380
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,000
There's something wrong with his blood.

381
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,000
Really?

382
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,070
Let's go.

383
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,270
You... I... He...

384
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:40,950
Officer,

385
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,590
please make an exception for me.

386
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,720
Go away, go away!

387
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,240
Allowing you to see Sun Pingkang

388
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,920
was already an act of mercy beyond the law,

389
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,880
done for the Princess's sake.

390
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,640
If you dare to trespass on the county office again

391
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,640
and disturb the magistrate,

392
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,640
I'll arrest you too!

393
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,510
I just want to see the magistrate...

394
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,310
Go away, go away, go away!

395
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,990
Isn't that the child bride of the Sun Family?

396
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,540
Master Sun built his fortune selling medicinal herbs.

397
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,430
It's not easy for a merchant family.

398
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,110
Their only son has finally passed the imperial examination, becoming a scholar.

399
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,310
But who would have thought he'd make such a grave mistake?

400
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,000
Lord Si was a high-ranking official from the prefecture.

401
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,470
I think Master Sun is in trouble.

402
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,270
Master!

403
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,950
Master.

404
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,160
How's it going?

405
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,640
I have good news

406
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,830
and bad news.

407
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,680
Which one do you want to hear first?

408
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,640
The good news, please.

409
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,920
There's been too much bad news lately.

410
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,350
I've re-examined the bodies

411
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,830
and uncovered the conspiracy behind Tianxiang House,

412
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,450
as well as the true causes of death of Lai and Si Shulun.

413
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,030
That's good news, indeed.

414
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,110
So, what's the bad news?

415
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,240
Yesterday, there was a fire in the morgue.

416
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,020
Both Lai's and Si Shulun's bodies

417
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,160
were burned.

418
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,440
We no longer have any evidence.

419
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,080
How are things on your end?

420
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,970
Mother fainted last night after hearing the news.

421
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,790
She was taken to the clinic

422
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,110
and only returned after a night there.

423
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,040
You should also make sure to get some rest.

424
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,510
I told you to rest,

425
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,690
but I didn't mean for you to rest on me now.

426
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,000
People are watching.

427
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,880
Gu Qingcheng?

428
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,030
Gu Qingcheng!

429
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,250
You... are really out of line this time.

430
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
You look so ugly.

431
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,720
Master.

432
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,160
I really don't know what to do anymore.

433
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,920
The evidence is gone,

434
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,510
and the leads have all been cut off.

435
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,240
How am I supposed to save Pingkang?

436
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,440
Then keep crying.

437
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,030
Look.

438
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,520
What's wrong with that girl over there?

439
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,350
Her crying is even louder than the rain.

440
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,270
I'm afraid she's been hurt by a heartless man.

441
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,550
You don't understand this.

442
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,960
They're enjoying themselves here.

443
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,680
Let's go, let's go.

444
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,920
Stop looking.

445
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,740
[Flower Market Street]

446
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,920
What are you looking at?

447
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,730
Why do you look so gloomy?

448
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,000
You've been in the mortal world longer than me.

449
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,460
Do you know what a litigator should do?

450
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,550
Litigator?

451
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,240
You're quite something.

452
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,310
Being a coroner isn't enough for you.

453
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,400
You want to be a litigator now

454
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,400
to clear the name of your disciple's fiancé?

455
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
I didn't agree to that.

456
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,310
It's just that the puddle on the ground

457
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,850
is too terrifying.

458
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,480
There's water all over the ground.

459
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,950
What puddle are you talking about?

460
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,850
Master,

461
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,930
can you agree to be my litigator?

462
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,110
Si Shulun's father is a high-ranking official in the prefecture government.

463
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,280
Without a litigator from the capital to handle the case,

464
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,980
Pingkang is doomed!

465
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,520
Master, I'm begging you.

466
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,550
I'll be your disciple again in the next life, okay?

467
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,270
Could emotions affect the power of the Flower Spirit?

468
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm begging you!

469
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,750
Please stop crying.

470
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,880
Master, please agree to this...

471
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,680
Stop crying!

472
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,960
So, this big puddle is

473
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,440
Gu's tears.

474
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,750
You know, this is quite interesting.

475
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,110
As for Gu,

476
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,320
she's practically willing to die

477
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,790
for that bookworm.

478
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:49,960
And you?

479
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,240
You're racking your brains for that girl.

480
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,480
Isn't your little triangle getting a bit crowded?

481
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,640
Are you done talking?

482
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,270
Yes, I'm done.

483
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,550
Let me warn you:

484
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,640
you should keep a low profile in the mortal world.

485
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,880
If those above

486
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
know you've lost your Flower Spirit,

487
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,550
whether you're an immortal or demon,

488
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,790
plenty of enemies of yours want to see you destroyed.

489
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,310
I have my own judgment.

490
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,830
Judgment?

491
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,110
Fine, fine, fine.

492
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,480
Go ahead and judge away, you.

493
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,640
You

494
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,220
and your disciple are now like two branches of the same tree.

495
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,970
Her emotions are starting to affect you.

496
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,240
I just want my Flower Spirit to be safe and secure.

497
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,400
Of course, of course.

498
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,200
Whether you want to become an immortal or a demon,

499
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,640
you need to get your Flower Spirit back.

500
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,950
You need to stay alive first.

501
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,880
I need to help Gu Qingcheng resolve this matter quickly

502
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,880
and get my Flower Spirit as soon as possible

503
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,920
to do what I should do.

504
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,640
My Lord,

505
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,850
this is the child bride of the Sun Family,

506
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,480
[Justice Mirror Hangs High]

507
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,900
Gu Qingcheng.

508
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,440
Will my master

509
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,780
come?

510
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,590
Lord Si has arrived!

511
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,480
Bring the seat of honor over.

512
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,310
Quickly, quickly.

513
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,590
I think the Sun Family is in dire straits now.

514
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,590
Lord Si,

515
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,110
you shouldn't have come in person.

516
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,720
Come on, please have a seat, have a seat.

517
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,600
[Master Si]

518
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,110
In the case of my son

519
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,720
and his page boy's death,

520
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,270
I

521
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,550
am just the aggrieved party.

522
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,440
You need not treat me as an official.

523
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,510
You must handle the case based on the facts.

524
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,680
Yes, yes, yes.

525
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,070
Please accept my condolences, Your Excellency.

526
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,880
I will do everything in my power

527
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,350
to seek justice for your son.

528
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,370
Magistrate, please investigate thoroughly.

529
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,720
Murder

530
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,630
must be dealt with according to the law.

531
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,750
My Lord,

532
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,880
whether this is murder is still undetermined.

533
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,750
As an esteemed official of the imperial court,

534
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,410
how could you speak so recklessly?

535
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,550
My son is dead!

536
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,960
How is this not murder?

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,000
don't mind

543
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,940

544
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,270
Magistrate,

545
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,270
what do you say?

546
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,190
That's right!

547
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,440
Sun Pingkang's accomplice is still at large!

548
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,440
Indeed!

You, young lady,

00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,200
are indeed not simple.

554
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,000
However,

555
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,790
the evidence is irrefutable.

556
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,440
Not even the Princess

557
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,480
can help you.

558
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,310
My Lord,

559
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,070
the Princess is wise, impartial,

560
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,110
fair, and just.

561
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,880
Those who are guilty

562
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,610
cannot escape her sharp eyes.

563
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,790
Please rise.

564
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,600
I am here today only to observe.

565
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,790
Everything will be decided by the Magistrate.

566
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,720
Magistrate,

567
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,010
please begin.

568
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,750
Okay, okay.

569
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,000
Come on.

570
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,270
My Lord!

571
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,510
The person I'm waiting for hasn't arrived yet.

572
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,200
Even the Princess is here.

573
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,550
Who else are you waiting for?

574
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:30,020
It's none other than Lyu Gengyun, the top litigator in the capital,

575
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:30,880
Mr. Lyu.

576
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
Litigator Lyu?

577
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,450
I've served as an official for so many years,

578
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,960
but I've never heard of such a person in the capital.

579
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,000
Mr. Lyu's intelligence and strategies are unparalleled.

580
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,460
He's been living in seclusion

581
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,860
and has just started to move about in the capital,

582
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,170
yet his reputation is already remarkable.

583
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,640
You are usually busy with official duties,

584
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,840
so it's natural that you haven't heard

585
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,780
of this rising star in the capital.

586
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,110
Since he's a litigator,

587
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,310
how can he be late?

588
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,410
We won't wait any longer!

589
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,050
Let's begin handling the case!

590
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,400
The capital's top litigator, Mr. Lyu, has arrived.
