[Episode 13]

3
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,960
Look.

4
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,510
Master, it's blooming.

5
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,500
Are you the first one to see it?

6
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,400
Of course.

7
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,280
This is the flower you planted.

8
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,240
Have you thought of a name for it?

9
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,750
Just call it

10
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,960
Qing Yun Flower.

11
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,710
It means even a wildflower can have high aspirations,

12
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,180
just like how I, a mortal,

13
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,640
still want to cultivate and become a flower fairy.

14
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,270
That's great.

15
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,240
It has another meaning.

16
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,240
What is it?

17
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,990
It's a secret.

18
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,120
I'll tell you after the

19
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,840
Floral Competition.

20
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,630
Alright.

21
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,680
This round

22
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,790
tests the originality of the flower species.

23
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,590
Next,

24
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,400
the flowers will be handed over to me for inspection.

25
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,360
Once confirmed non-toxic,

26
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,190
harmless,

27
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,560
and free of prohibited items,

28
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,840
I will personally present them to Princess Ning for evaluation.

29
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,000
The quality of the Zilan grass is average.

30
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,630
Pass.

31
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Next,

32
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,310
Gu Qingcheng, please come forward.

33
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,920
Did you smell that?

34
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,360
Yes, such a fragrance.

35
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,720
It smells so good.

36
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,270
What's the name of your flower?

37
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,560
Your Highness,

38
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
this flower is called

39
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,630
Qing Yun Flower.

40
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,070
Just a light sniff,

41
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,070
I can feel the fragrance filling my clothes.

42
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,390
It's truly wonderful.

43
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,270
Your Highness,

44
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,240
this small blue flower may look plain,

45
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,720
but I've used a unique potion

46
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,830
to water it

47
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,190
so that the flower emits a distinctive scent

48
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,590
that can calm the mind and refresh the spirit.

49
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,270
That's true.

50
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,680
But

51
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,000
the petals are badly damaged.

52
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,120
It will lose

53
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,800
a lot of points for its appearance.

54
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,159
What a pity.

55
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,830
What a pity.

56
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,880
It smells good. I can smell it from here.

57
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,560
Look at this flower, it's so well-tended.

58
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,190
Yes, indeed.

59
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,310
Your Highness,

60
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,750
could you

61
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,480
give the Qing Yun Flower another chance?

62
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,360
Can you restore it?

63
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,950
No, I can't.

64
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,630
But the damaged petal

65
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,870
reminds me that

66
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,600
flowers don't stay fresh forever.

67
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,800
The outcome is always regrettable.

68
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,120
So,

69
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,270
I've thought of a way

70
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,510
to preserve the beauty of the Qing Yun Flower forever.

71
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,720
What way?

72
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,390
Your Highness,

73
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,950
could you give me some ice crystal?

74
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,190
This is...

75
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,800
Your Highness,

76
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,270
these are the special potions I made.

77
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,070
By soaking the flowers in this,

78
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,480
they can be quickly air-dried

79
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,560
and their colors will be permanent.

80
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,040
Your Highness, please take a look.

81
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,430
This way, the Qing Yun Flower can maintain its vibrant beauty

82
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,430
and achieve eternal life.

83
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,680
Eternal flower?

84
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,190
That's truly amazing.

85
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,240
How did you come up with this idea?

86
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,510
It's...

87
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,310
inspired by a story

88
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,870
my master told me about chrysanthemum stones.

89
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,480
I've heard a little about the story

90
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,360
of chrysanthemum stones.

91
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,669
The name "Qing Yun" actually comes from

92
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,030
one character each of my name

93
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,960
and my master's name.

94
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,150
It means even a wildflower can have high aspirations.

95
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,080
Although

96
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,240
there's a world of difference,

97
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,790
it can still bloom freely

98
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,870
and live forever.

99
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,080
In this way,

100
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,630
it won't just be a fleeting beauty.

101
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,870
Miss Gu,

102
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,510
you're truly a genius.

103
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,630
Thank you, Your Highness.

104
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
The Qing Yun planted by Gu Qingcheng

105
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,000
is the best flower

106
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,510
to win first place!

107
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,670
Bravo!

108
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,630
Thank you, Your Highness.

109
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,000
Master.

110
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,120
Master!

[Qingcheng Flower Nursery]

112
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,790
Master.

113
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,360
Take it easy.

114
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,030
It's alright.

115
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,320
I just need to adjust myself with my inner energy.

116
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,480
Be careful.

117
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,630
What exactly happened?

118
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,550
After the Floral Competition,

119
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,720
Master suddenly became like this.

120
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,600
He even fainted.

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,910
What exactly is wrong

122
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,080
with Master?

123
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,720
I'll go find a doctor.

124
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,750
No, no, no.

125
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,080
Your master is a flower demon.

126
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,870
What good would a doctor do?

127
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,200
I'll take a look at him.

128
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,120
You?

129
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,080
Do you know what's wrong with Master?

130
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,200
It's just that...

131
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,390
his roots are damaged,

132
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,360
causing poor circulation in his body.

133
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,790
Didn't you know that

134
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,670
when you dug him up

135
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,550
from the mass grave?

136
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,240
Oh, right.

137
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,200
That peony flower...

138
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,440
So,

139
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,200
how can we repair his flower roots?

140
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,600
He needs to...

141
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,630
use his powers to heal himself.

142
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,150
Then he'll be fine.

143
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,630
I still want to check on him.

144
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,480
No, there's no need.

145
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,550
He just needs to absorb some spiritual power.

146
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,080
He's now healing himself

147
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,750
and must not be disturbed.

148
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,910
I...

149
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,200
Don't you want your master to get better?

150
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,910
Well,

151
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,270
how is he doing now?

152
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,600
Is it serious?

153
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,270
Master,

154
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,510
your spiritual power is now depleted.

155
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,630
If you don't retrieve the Flower Spirit soon,

156
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

157
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,550
Well,

158
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,550
you care so much about Miss Gu.

159
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,200
You wouldn't want her

160
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,080
to be heartbroken seeing you die, would you?

161
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,960
I'm not that easy to die.

162
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,930
My parents' grievance has yet to be cleared.

163
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,750
I still have many things to do.

164
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,550
Ye You.

165
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,510
Help me deliver a message.

166
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,600
Deliver a message?

167
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,600
To whom?

168
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,750
An old friend.

169
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,510
Miss Gu,

170
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,150
Master is just feeling unwell.

171
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,480
He will recover soon.

172
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,360
Yes, yes,

173
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,700
don't worry.

174
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,670
Let's think about

175
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,000
what to plant for the second round of the Floral Competition.

176
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,670
That's right, Miss Gu.

177
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,630
Have you decided?

178
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,910
I want to plant...

179
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,000
the Moonlight Peony.

180
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,360
You want to plant the Moonlight Peony?

181
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,790
But in all three realms,

182
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,150
only the former Flower Goddess,

183
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,600
Jiang Li, has ever grown it.

184
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,600
If you fail,

185
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,270
wouldn't all the efforts be in vain?

186
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,380
Yes,

187
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,030
I've heard

188
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,080
there's a variety called the Iridescent Peony.

189
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,750
It's easier to grow

190
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,440
and rare in the mortal world too.

191
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,490
We could choose this one.

192
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,560
It's a safer choice.

193
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,320
Right.

194
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,970
Actually, winning isn't my only goal now.

195
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,720
The Moonlight Peony is the flower with the strongest spiritual energy in the world.

196
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,360
Master's flower root is damaged now.

197
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,150
If I can grow it,

198
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,040
it might replenish his spiritual power

199
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,100
and help him recover.

200
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,360
Master told us

201
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,330
he's doing fine.

202
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,670
With some rest and care,

203
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,240
he will naturally recover.

204
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,480
Miss Gu,

205
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,200
there's no need to take such a big risk

206
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,600
to grow the Moonlight Peony,

207
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,080
right?

208
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,510
Yeah.

209
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,910
It's great that Master

210
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,480
is not seriously hurt.

211
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,790
But he's the kind of person

212
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,320
who always likes to act tough.

213
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,630
If I don't do something now,

214
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,080
I won't be able to rest easy.

215
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,550
Yes.

216
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,670
Since

217
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,320
someone has grown it before,

218
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,840
it means there's a way to do it.

219
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:25,880
I believe

220
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,510
you can do it, Qingcheng.

221
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,440
Pingkang,

222
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,390
did Father leave

223
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,030
some related ancient books for me?

224
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,030
There might be some records in them.

225
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,910
I'll go back and check.

226
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,440
I happen to know it.

227
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,320
To grow the Moonlight Peony,

228
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,670
you must first find a herb called

229
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,390
the Qionghua Twig.

230
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,000
Qionghua Twig?

231
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,910
It's extremely precious and rare.

232
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,360
I heard it grows in a place called...

233
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,840
called...

234
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,670
a place called Cave Paradise.

235
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,750
Cave Paradise?

236
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,030
What kind of place is that?

237
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,230
It's an extremely secluded

238
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,960
and hidden place,

239
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,000
like a paradise on earth.

240
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,480
For thousands of years,

241
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,000
there are many legends about it.

242
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,870
However,

243
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,390
no one has ever

244
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,910
truly found that place.

245
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,120
Why?

246
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,960
I've also heard of this Cave Paradise.

247
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,670
It's covered in ice and snow year-round,

248
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,740
with treacherous paths.

249
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,800
It's perilous going there.

250
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:31,720
Moreover,

251
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,920
only those who are destined

252
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,020
can find the entrance.

253
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,330
Miss Gu,

254
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,640
you should consider it carefully.

255
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,870
Yeah.

256
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Let's eat.

257
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,880
Everyone, please eat.

258
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,480
Alright.

259
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:51,870
Yes.

260
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,390
Let's eat.

261
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,480
This is a celebration banquet.

262
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,120
That's right.

263
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,150
Why the long faces?

264
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,790
Let's celebrate!

265
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,390
I'm starving.

266
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:56,910
Come on.

267
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,200
Let's eat.

268
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,670
Come on.

269
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,270
Eat.

270
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,550
Help yourselves.

271
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:00,870
Here.

272
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,750
Try this.

273
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,120
Here.

274
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:02,960
Eat more.

275
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,910
Miss Lan,

276
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,080
what is

277
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,720
the name of this dish?

278
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,720
Squirrel-shaped Mandarin fish.

279
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,870
You should make it for Master next time.

280
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,320
It's delicious.

281
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,630
Delicious.

282
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,510
Qionghua Twig.

283
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,150
Qionghua Twig.

284
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,670
Encyclopedia of Celestial Herbs.

285
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,750
Cave Paradise?

286
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,630
My Lord.

287
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,390
I really didn't expect

288
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,440
the environment here is quite nice.

289
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,080
Long time no see.

290
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,030
Qingluan.

291
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,200
Well, well, Lyu Gengyun.

292
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,960
[Immortal Qingluan, Envoy of Heavenly Realm]

293
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,200
I can't believe these 500 years

294
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,240
have passed in the blink of an eye.

295
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,390
For... these 500 years,

296
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,000
I've been taking good care of him.

297
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,270
Thank you for your hard work,

298
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,000
Ye You.

299
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,120
As your attendant,

300
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,120
of course I'll do my utmost

301
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,750
to complete the tasks you assigned.

302
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,480
It's just that some people

303
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,200
are too stubborn.

304
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,910
Your spiritual power is depleted.

305
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,870
How did this happen?

306
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,720
Where is your Flower Spirit?

307
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,960
It's a long story.

308
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,480
I see.

309
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,510
You used your inner energy to help me,

310
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,240
but it was like a clay ox sinking into the sea—gone forever.

311
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,510
And you don't even feel bad about it.

312
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,590
I'll consider it payment for this drink.

313
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,240
It's been a while since I last came to the mortal world.

314
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,880
The wine in the Immortal Realm

315
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,720
really isn't that great.

316
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,590
So,

317
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,440
your Flower Spirit was accidentally planted

318
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,110
inside that Gu Qingcheng

319
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,000
and has merged with her.

320
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,480
This is exactly why

321
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,550
I called you here.

322
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,920
If I forcibly take out the Flower Spirit,

323
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,590
could her life be in danger?

324
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,590
She's blood-linked to the Flower Spirit.

325
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,960
Forcing it out

326
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,300
won't kill her.

327
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,350
Then what?

328
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,310
She'll gradually lose her five senses,

329
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,720
become like a plant, slowly withering

330
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,110
until she's

331
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,830
just a living corpse with only

332
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,880
breath and heartbeat.

333
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,350
You shouldn't have hesitated back then.

334
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,750
You've taken such a roundabout way,

335
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,100
becoming her master,

336
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,480
helping with lawsuits,

337
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,880
even opening a flower nursery!

338
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,400
Now,

339
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,750
you've cost your heart,

340
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,200
and you're risking your life too!

341
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,920
Ye You.

342
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,720
I'll go get some wine.

343
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,350
Save yourself or protect Gu Qingcheng,

344
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,070
you better think it through.

345
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,720
I can just

346
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,200
give up this body

347
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,680
and start over.

348
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,620
You've cultivated for thousands of years as a peony.

349
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,270
Are you really not going back to the Celestial Court?

350
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,440
What's so good about the Heavenly Realm?

351
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,960
My mother,

352
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,550
who was once the Flower Goddess,

353
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,200
would rather die than stay there.

354
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,070
She returned to Shouyang Mountain to reunite with my father.

355
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,400
Aren't you the same?

356
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,330
Indulging in the fine wines of the mortal world.

357
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,240
I'll just assume you're not sacrificing yourself

358
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,590
for someone.

359
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,000
I suppose

360
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,400
you not only inherited

361
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,550
your parents' powerful spiritual cultivation,

362
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,120
but also their deeply rooted sentiments.

363
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,200
What's this?

364
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,580
This is the King Grass I won

365
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,200
in a bet with the Immortal of Fortune and Longevity.

366
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,110
I was planning to use it to enhance my own cultivation,

367
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,240
but unfortunately,

368
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,710
I have a poor friend.

369
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,590
You should take it instead.

370
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,240
Although it can't save your life,

371
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,310
it can help you hold on for a while longer.

372
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,310
If you give this to me,

373
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,000
won't it be wasted?

374
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,510
It's better than nothing.

375
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,480
You want more?

376
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,850
This is all

377
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,830
I can do for you.

378
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,880
Thank you.

379
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,920
And,

380
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,830
your spiritual power is depleted.

381
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,030
You must not force yourself to use magic anymore,

382
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,200
otherwise...

383
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,350

384
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,350
Come on,

385
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,070
let's drink.

386
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,510
I need to make some nutritious soup for Master

387
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,070
so that he'll recover sooner.

388
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,920
Qingcheng.

389
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,480
Master.

390
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,480

feeling any better?

394
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,310
Much better.

395
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,480
You don't need to worry.

396
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:57,520
♫Listen to the words of flowers through the years♫

397
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,920
I've prepared some medicine for you.

398
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,110
Drink it while it's hot.

399
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,810
I need to go out for a while.

♫Having eye contact with you, it's like we've gone back to the moment we first met♫

Where are you going?

403
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,960
To the market.

404
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,400
The market?

405
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,950
♫I fell in love with you at first glance. I've been looking for you for thousands of years♫

I'm going on a long journey.

407
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,200
Need to get some supplies.

408
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,750
Where are you going?

409
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,030

Cave Paradise is freezing cold

416
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,510
and lifeless.

417
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,790
It's not a place for a young lady like you to go.

419

I've already made up my mind.

421
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,640

♫Love fills the city, inseparable like shadows♫

423
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,000
left me a book called

424
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,440
"Encyclopedia of Celestial Herbs."

425
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,270
It records that

426
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,640

and can't tolerate sunlight.

430
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,720

Qingcheng,

434
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,830
is it because Ye You told you

435
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:59,740
♫Fate turns, time flows like a waterwheel♫

436
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,030

437

so you want to find the Qionghua Twig

438
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,750

439
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,490
♫Peonies bloom, stars shine deep in the clouds♫

440
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,920
What are you saying, Master?

441
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,240
I just want to challenge myself.

442
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,590
The existence of the Qionghua Twig

443
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,400
is just a legend.

444
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,920
Even myths and legends can be unreliable at times.

445
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,400
But I believe in it.

446
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,920
Master,

447
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,030
before I met you,

448
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,400
many things were just legends.

449
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,590
After meeting you,

450
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,110
haven't they all become reality?

451
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:33,820

456
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,000

Eight taels?

466
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,310
Doesn't seem like a price for regular customers.

467
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,880
Well, you need to come more often.

468
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,480

I've

00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,480
drafted a commitment letter.

498
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,590

499
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,270
Commit to what?

500
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,410
You're not taking the Flower Spirit,

501
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,880
yet you're still going to Cave Paradise to die.

502
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,350
It's such a big deal.

503
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,000
How can I bear the responsibility?

504
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,110
You just need to state

505
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,400
that all these actions

506
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,720
are your own decisions,

507
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,210
and have nothing to do with me.

508
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,140
This way,

509
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,240
I can explain it

510
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,160
to the Lord.

511
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
Your sarcasm is getting

512
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,680
better.

513
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,750
So you can tell that's sarcasm?

514
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,590
Cave Paradise is called "Bone-Chilling Cold"

515
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,590
for a reason.

516
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,070
It's freezing all year round,

517
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,830
with frosty winds

518
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,160
like steel knives.

519
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,960
They'll cut through your skin

520
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,660
and feel like they're freezing your bones.

521
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,780
With your frail body,

522
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,190
won't you freeze to death there?

523
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,420
Qingcheng is going to Cave Paradise

524
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,250
to find the Qionghua Twig to grow the Moonlight Peony.

525
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,110
My mother

526
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,290
was the only one who ever grew the Moonlight Peony.

527
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,530
Even if it's just to see the place where she stayed,

528
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,230
I should go there once.

529
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,160
Fine.

530
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,140
Good words can't persuade someone destined to die.

531
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,400
Do whatever you want.

532
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,720
If Gu Qingcheng really finds the Qionghua Twig,

533
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,160
maybe I should...

534
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,430
Alright.

535
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,420
Forget it.

536
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,110
I really don't know what I owed you in my past life.

537
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,440
Look at you, so down and out.

538
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,640
Are you still the Demon King?

539
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,620
What are you looking for?

540
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,590
Wait a moment.

541
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,310
What's this?

542
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,060
I can't just stand by and let you freeze to death.

543
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,440
Here are Sanchun Pills.

544
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,050
Remember to take them.

545
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,120
Sanchun Pills?

546
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,990
Stop, stop knocking.

547
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,050
They might have been stored for a while.

548
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,790
But they're still effective.

549
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,110
Are these even real pills?

550
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:02,640
What...

551
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,240
When you're about to freeze,

552
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,920
you'll be glad to have them.

553
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,790
What else do you have in your sleeve?

554
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:10,960
Take it all out.

555
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,720
That's all.

556
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,920
No matter how many good things I have,

557
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,510
it's not enough for you to waste like this.

558
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,010
You spendthrift!

559
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,170
Why are you so stingy?

560
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:18,670
None!

561
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,510
Nothing left!

562
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,440
Not a single one!

563
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,640
Qingcheng,

564
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,310
I heard from this nerd

565
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,550
that you're going to Cave Paradise.

566
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:40,500
Wushuang,

567
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,520
these flowers shouldn't be watered too much.

568
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,470
These too.

569
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,400
Take care of them

570
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,370
while I'm gone.

571
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,790
That's an extremely cold place.

572
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,330
Why are you, a mortal, going there?

573
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,830
To get the Qionghua Twig

574
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,230
and grow the Moonlight Peony.

575
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,150
Do you even know where Cave Paradise is?

576
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,880
In Father's "Encyclopedia of Celestial Herbs,"

577
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,240
there's a passage.

578
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,590
Let me show you.

579
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,880
It's here.

580
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,110
Look.

581
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,360
By the cold pond's edge,

582
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,910
Seven-colored Moonlight Appears.

583
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,160
Drink all night in the Mountain God's Mansion,

584
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,560
You will find a flower fairy.

585
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,590
This is clearly a riddle.

586
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,000
Do you know what it means?

587
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,550
No.

588
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,140
I'll think about it on the way.

589
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,510
You're being too hasty.

590
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,480
It's fine.

591
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,360
Master will

592
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,700
go with me.

593
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,720
We'll figure it out together.

594
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,130
Master is going too?

595
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,310
Don't worry.

596
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,840
I'll definitely find that Qionghua Twig

597
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,150
and grow the Moonlight Peony.

598
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,480
The Moonlight Peony has the strongest spiritual energy.

599
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,750
When the time comes,

600
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,520
it'll definitely help Master.

601
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,280
Alright then.

602
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,110
But you must be very careful

603
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,300
on your journey.

604
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,860
Leave the Qingcheng Flower Nursery

605
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,650
to Wushuang and me.

606
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,270
I'll leave these flowers to you then.

607
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,300
Take good care of them.

608
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,750
You may stop here.

609
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,680
Master,

610
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,920
are you sure you don't want me to accompany you?

611
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,350
You two stay here and watch over the flower nursery.

612
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,510
Master,

613
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,480
don't worry.

614
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,110
We'll take good care of it.

615
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,750
Bye.

616
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,480
Bye.

617
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,720
-Go back now.
-Let's go.
