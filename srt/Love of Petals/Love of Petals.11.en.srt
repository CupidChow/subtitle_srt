[Love of Petals]

00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,100
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,080
Master, I'll go with you.

4
00:01:59,229 --> 00:01:59,710
No need.

5
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,840
You all rest here for a moment.

6
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Alright.

7
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,790
We'll be right back.

8
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,120
Be careful.

9
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,560
Let me take it.

10
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,910
Wushuang.

11
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,190
Wushuang.

12
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,190
Where are you going?

13
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,240
Wushuang.

14
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,240
Wushuang, it's dangerous ahead.

15
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:51,750
Wushuang.

16
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,430
It's dangerous ahead.

17
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,120
Wushuang!

18
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,800
Wushuang.

19
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,400
Wushuang!

20
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,000
Stop! There's a cliff ahead.

21
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,590
Wushuang, wake up!

22
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,630
Wushuang.

23
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,360
There's a dangerous cliff ahead.

24
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,360
Wushuang!

25
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,079
Where are you?

26
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,730
Master.

27
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,310
Master, why don't you come closer?

28
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,430
It seems I'm not

29
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,920
that important to you after all.

30
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,970
It's just you and me here.

31
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,120
Stop pretending.

32
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,870
Who are you really?

33
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,400
And where is Gu Qingcheng?

34
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,190
I am Gu Qingcheng.

35
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,400
I'm right here.

36
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,240
It's not an illusion.

37
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,710
That is Qingcheng's body.

38
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,160
Master,

39
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:00,160
aren't you going to save Gu Qingcheng?

40
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,829
It seems I made the right bet

41
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,360
on this girl.

42
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,160
Even knowing this is a deadly poisonous gas,

43
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,390
you still came.

44
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,630
You're hiding in

45
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,310
a mortal's body.

46
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,159
What kind of hero is that?

47
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,270
It's not for you to decide whether I'm a hero or not.

48
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,870
You may have seen through me,

49
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,430
but you don't dare to harm

50
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,800
Gu Qingcheng's body in the slightest.

51
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,750
What kind of hero are you?

52
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,750
Don't waste your energy.

53
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,560
Even your parents back then

54
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,680
couldn't do it,

55
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,920
let alone you.

56
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,680
Haven't you remembered

57
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,630
who I am yet?

58
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,720
Wushuang.

59
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:13,830
Wushuang.

60
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,870
What's wrong with you, Wushuang?

61
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,510
Wushuang, wake up!

62
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,510
Wushuang.

63
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,490
Wushuang.

64
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,159
Wushuang.

65
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,120
Wushuang, wake up.

66
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,750
Wushuang.

67
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,520
Are you alright?

68
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,070
Are you okay?

69
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,600
How did we end up here?

70
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,600
What happened to the master?

71
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,630
Just now, you

72
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,360
were walking forward with the flowers in your hand,

73
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,040
and then you jumped off the cliff.

74
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,350
I don't know what happened either.

75
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,160
You...

76
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,410
You're hurt.

77
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,040
I'm fine.

78
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,180
I'm glad you're okay.

79
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,750
These flowers have been drugged.

80
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,070
Oh no.

81
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,120
Master!

82
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,320
The bond between master and disciple is indeed deep.

83
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,910
Master!

84
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,170
Qingcheng.

85
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,920
You treacherous cat!

86
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,310
How dare you betray me!

87
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,570
Undo her Golden Lock.

88
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,090
Ya Zi.

89
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,650
I can't make the same mistake again.

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,920
Please stop.

91
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,300
All of you,

92
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,670
just

93
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,190
die!

94
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,630
Mr. Bai,

95
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,160
can you

96
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,680
use the Soul-Transferring Technique again to switch us back?

97
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,870
Ya Zi's magical powers far exceed mine.

98
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,310
If she doesn't cooperate by looking into my eyes,

99
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,760
there's nothing I can do.

100
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,120
Unless...

101
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,720
Miss Gu,

102
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,909
from now on, every year during the Qingming Festival,

103
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,800
could you offer my master

104
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,560
one hundred stems of purple balloon flowers?

105
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,750
Of... of course.

106
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,160
I beg you.

107
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,260
Miss Gu,

108
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,350
there's something

109
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,030
which took me a thousand years to understand.

110
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,870
If you want to see someone,

111
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,800
you shouldn't just wait for them.

112
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,050
I should go find her.

113
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,560
What are you going to do, Mr. Bai?

114
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,620
If I die,

115
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,520
the spells I've cast will disappear as well.

116
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,010
Your souls will automatically return to their rightful bodies.

117
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,750
What are you saying?

118
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,190
No, Mr. Bai, don't!

119
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,730
There must be another way.

120
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,870
From now on,

121
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,240
when you wear it.

122
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,990
You'll have a family.

123
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,660
Because you are

124
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,730
the best girl in the whole world.

125
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,030
But why

126
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,360
didn't you tell me earlier?

127
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,390
You made me

128
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,360
sad for so long.

129
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,110
Some words,

130
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,840
though missed for a thousand years...

131
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,670
Mr. Bai.

132
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,000
Mr. Bai.

133
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,960
I still want to say to you in person.

134
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,200
Qingcheng.

135
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,510
I have already destroyed your cultivation.

136
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,000
Ya Zi.

137
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,010
You're behind all this, aren't you?

138
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,930
Ya Zi is now in seclusion for cultivation.

139
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,540
We can't let the Yang energy be cut off.

140
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Send the high-quality deer blood

141
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,320
and the freshly extracted Yang energy

142
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,130
to Ya Zi.

143
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,240
Apply this medicine to her feet daily,

144
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,220
then soak them in this spring water.

145
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,390
Within three days,

146
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,670
she will surely recover.

147
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,440
Although that girl is a mortal,

148
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,890
the Lyu Gengyun beside her has boundless magical powers.

149
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,690
I can help you.

150
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,120
I have no grudge against you.

151
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,960
Why are you plotting against me like this?

152
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,790
No grudge?

153
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,200
Lyu Gengyun, oh Lyu Gengyun,

154
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,080
you really are

155
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,790
a noble person who forgets things easily.

156
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,200
On the seventh day of the third month,

157
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,960
under the blood moon,

158
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,390
the Bai Yu's demonic aura ran rampant, driving it into a frenzy.

159
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,440
It slaughtered countless minor demons on Shouyang Mountain.

160
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,420
My parents were among those who died tragically.

161
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,670
Father!

162
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:07,750
Mother!

163
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,360
I was also severely injured.

164
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,120
Fortunately, I had saved a Jade-Eyed Fox before.

165
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,790
It transferred its spiritual power to me,

166
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,240
allowing me to survive.

167
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:21,940
Ya Zi.

168
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,480
But you caused him to be captured by the Celestial Court.

169
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,200
Ya Zi.

170
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,080
Lyu Gengyun.

171
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,390
Not only do I have the vengeance for my parents against you,

172
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,790
but also the hatred for my comrade.

173
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,080
How can I not seek revenge?

174
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,360
You mean on the seventh day of the third month,

175
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,550
you saw the blood moon rise

176
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,720
and my father killed your entire family?

177
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,440
That's right.

178
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,840
I saw it with my own eyes.

179
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,720
Impossible.

180
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,390
My father has always

181
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,120
treated all the minor demons like family.

182
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,840
There must be more to this sudden madness.

183
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,910
I saw him with my own eyes

184
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,200
that he killed my parents.

185
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,270
What other

186
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,320
hidden truth could there be?

187
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,270
Let me ask you,

188
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,200
on the seventh day of the third month,

189
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,960
did you witness the descent of immortals from the Heavenly Realm?

190
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,320
Why should I tell you anything?

191
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,910
If you want to live, answer my question!

192
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,240
That day,

193
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,670
I did sense the arrival of immortals.

194
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,240
But with the blood moon in the sky,

195
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,870
I was afraid.

196
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,030
I curled up in my cave, too scared to come out.

197
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,630
It wasn't until I heard my parents' screams

198
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,910
that I dared to take a look outside.

199
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,630
Behave yourself.

200
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,840
Lyu Gengyun.

201
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,960
I don't want your charity.

202
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,120
What has kept me alive all these years

203
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,840
is hatred.

204
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,240
Now,

205
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,630
all my people have been killed by you.

206
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,790
I don't want to live on alone either.

207
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,910
But don't celebrate too soon.

208
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,870
Sooner or later,

209
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,480
you'll end up like your demon father,

210
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,840
unable to suppress your demonic nature.

211
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,550
You'll harm others and yourself.

212
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,510
I deeply regret.

213
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,320
I failed to eliminate the threat to our people.

214
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,270
Inner demon.

215
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,480
The inner demon should perish with the death of the monster.

216
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,120
Why did his leave the body instead?

217
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,480
Could it be that his inner demon

218
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,670
was planted by someone?

219
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,870
Master.

220
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,000
What's going on?

221
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,390
It's nothing.

222
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,100
[Ya Zi, the second son of the Loong, resembles a jackal in appearance. He is fond of blood and killing. He must repay any kindness with food, and will exact revenge for even the slightest grievance.]

223
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,730
[Mr. Bai]

224
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,080
On the way here with Bai,

225
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,150
he told me

226
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,870
he was originally a little white cat.

227
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,550
A thousand years ago,

228
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,320
he fell in love with a human girl named Xiao Cao.

229
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,950
At that time,

230
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,720
he had not yet transformed into human form.

231
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,240
He was accidentally injured

232
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,560
and was saved by Xiao Cao,

233
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,200
who kept him by her side

234
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,440
and named him Bai.

235
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,360
How dare you bite me?

236
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,570
How dare you bite me?

237
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,930
You darn cat, I'll beat you to death!

238
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,960
I'll kick you to death!

239
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,030
I caught you, didn't I?

240
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,150
That's what you get for biting me!

241
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,000
That's what you get for biting me!

242
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,550
I'll kick you to death!

243
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,320
What are you doing?

244
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,230
Ugly freak!

245
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,670
It's you again, you ugly freak!

246
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,960
Run, run, run!

247
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,270
Little white cat?

248
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,270
There's a spot on Xiao Cao's face.

249
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,240
Let me see.

250
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,870
She was always mocked by the villagers.

251
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,550
Does it hurt?

252
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,440
But in Bai's eyes,

253
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,200
she is the most

254
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,510
beautiful girl in the world.

255
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,030
From now on,

256
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,550
when you wear it,

257
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,080
you'll have a family.

258
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,440
Bai and Xiao Cao

259
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,320
became each other's best companions.

260
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,870
Or perhaps,

261
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,240
they had already become family.

262
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,120
Bai.

263
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,720
I only earned two copper coins today.

264
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,630
I'm afraid you'll have to make do with steamed buns.

265
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,080
Is it good?

266
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,680
The money you gave isn't enough.

267
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,550
Could you please return the flowers to me?

268
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,000
You're so ugly.

269
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,829
You should be grateful I'm even buying your flowers.

270
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,880
And you're still complaining it's not enough?

271
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,960
Please, mister, can you just give them back to me?

272
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
-Go away.
-Please.

273
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,920
Move aside.

274
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,310
Let's not have her sell flowers anymore.

275
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,830
Look at those spots on her face.

276
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,550
She's really ugly, isn't she?

277
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,070
Bai couldn't stand seeing Xiao Cao always being bullied.

278
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,720
He transformed into human form.

279
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,160
Here, take this.

280
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,160
Xiao Cao thought the white kitten had run away.

281
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,720
She was heartbroken.

282
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,400
But little did she know,

283
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,270
the white kitten had been by her side all along.

284
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,750
What's wrong?

285
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,630
You seem to have something on your mind.

286
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,000
I used to have a little white cat.

287
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,440
but recently,

288
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,350
I can't find it anymore.

289
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,960
Maybe

290
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,880
it has already settled down somewhere else.

291
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,350
Don't worry.

292
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,090
The way you wipe your face

293
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,570
is exactly the same as my little white cat used to do.

294
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,310
Actually,

295
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,920
there are some things

296
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,510
Xiao Cao has been waiting for Bai to say to her.

297
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,640
A-actually,

298
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,640
actually,

299
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,990
it's quite cold today.

300
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,350
I'll take this bouquet.

301
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:23,960
Here.

302
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,790
You didn't pay enough.

303
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,720
What money?

304
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,200
When have I ever paid for anything?

305
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,310
Pay up.

306
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,350
Do you know

307
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,680
what the balloon flower symbolizes?

308
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,480
What is it?

309
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,440
Eternal love.

310
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,480
That's a beautiful flower language.

311
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,880
And my

312
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,840
unwavering wait for you.

313
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,680
The doctor said Xiao Cao has spots on her face

314
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,200
and a heart condition.

315
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,960
She won't live past twenty.

316
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,110
Bai never expected

317
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,400
that his farewell with Xiao Cao

318
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,510
would come so suddenly.

319
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,400
You are the only one

320
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,440
in this world who has been kind to me,

321
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,240
and you are also

322
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,800
the person I like the most.

323
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,200
Please remember

324
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,480
our promise.

325
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,590
After a thousand years,

326
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,960
we will

327
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,510
definitely

328
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,400
meet

329
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,240
again.

330
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,400
Xiao Cao.

331
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,790
I'm Bai, Xiao Cao.

332
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,590
Xiao Cao.

333
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,350
Xiao Cao!

334
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,960
Actually,

335
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,070
there's no such thing as a thousand-year promise.

336
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,830
Xiao Cao just wanted Bai

337
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,310
to live on well,

338
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,510
so she made this

339
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,200
impossible promise.

340
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,730
[There is a beast, its shape resembles a raccoon with a white head, named Tian Gou. Its sound is like "liu liu" and it can ward off evil.]

341
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,730
[Cat Demon.
Three hundred miles west lies the Yin Mountain. The muddy bathwater flows out from there, flowing south into the Fanze. It is rich in patterned shells.]

342
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Ya Zi

343
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,400
guards the belief of hatred,

344
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,510
while Bai guards the belief of love.

345
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,640
But some tragedies

346
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,750
are destined from the very beginning.

347
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,680
Humans and demons walk different paths.

348
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,830
Even if none of this had happened,

349
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,070
Bai and Xiao Cao

350
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,200
might not have ended up together anyway.

351
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,880
That's not true.

352
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,350
Forgetting is more terrifying than separation by life or death.

353
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,070
But

354
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,290
no matter how many difficulties one experiences,

355
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,510
as long as there's someone you like in your heart,

356
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,680
you'll ultimately find happiness.

357
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,550
Do you really believe that?

358
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,960
Maybe so.

359
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,640
What's going on?

360
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,880
I seem to

361
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,920
feel a bit...

362
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,270
What?

363
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,550
You seem to like the master a bit?

364
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,590
Sit, sit, sit.

365
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,830
Master is upstairs having tea.

366
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,400
It's safe, it's safe.

367
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
Everyone, please enjoy the food.

368
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,230
Lan An has prepared several of his signature dishes.

369
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,310
Miss Gu,

370
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,030
do you want

371
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,510
all of us

372
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,200
to help you?

373
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,220
Grandpa Wuyuzi.

374
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,570
Don't call me grandpa.

375
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,440
Advisor Wuyuzi.

376
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:53,900
What

377
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,070
do Master

00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,960
In these few days,

564
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,550
we'll definitely get the Flower Spirit.

565
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,350
Don't just say "these few days".

566
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,270
Which specific day?

567
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:26,880
Tell me.

568
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,030
Within three days.

569
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,680
Let's not say "within three days" either.

570
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,030
Why wait when we can do it now?

571
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,440
You go ask her today and leave the city with her tomorrow.

572
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,240
Then extract the Flower Spirit, and everything will be perfect.

573
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,000
Good.

574
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,920
What's the matter?

575
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,030
You're reluctant, aren't you?

576
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,280
Who's reluctant?

577
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,350
Let's just go and do it.

578
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,440
It's so late.

579
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,260
She's probably already asleep.

580
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,030
Maybe I should come back tomorrow.

581
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,160
If I go back now,

582
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,960
Ye You will definitely nag at me again.

583
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,430
What about...

584
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,990
Master.

585
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,260
Master, you haven't gone to bed yet?

586
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,860
I was... I was just about to rest.

587
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,750
Tomorrow, I...

588
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,400
I have something to tell you.

589
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,960
You... have something to tell me?

590
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,680
What is it?

591
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,070
Why don't we go out of the city tomorrow?

592
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,920
We can go to...

593
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,400
Bishui Pool to talk.

594
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,680
Alright.

595
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,830
As it happens, I

596
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,960
also have something to tell you.

597
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,350
Then...

598
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,400
See you tomorrow, Master.

599
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,590
Okay,

600
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,830
see you tomorrow.

601
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,790
I made a wrong turn.

602
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,800
See you tomorrow.

603
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,400
Good night.
