1
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,500
Shit!

2
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,875
Sleep well, Mr. Joe?

3
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,875
CHAT

4
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:12,541
I just went to rest my eyes.
Shall we continue?

5
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:16,500
Because our Mr. Suradech
has been waiting for a while.

6
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,500
Stay still or we'll attract the Baba Yaga.

7
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:23,083
Here she comes. Go away!

8
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,041
Go away from me!

9
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,750
Come on! Guys, I'm free!

10
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,291
Hey, everyone! She's near!

11
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,583
Don't touch me! Run…

12
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,041
- Evade! Evade, everyone.
- Joe.

13
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,458
- Yeah, I'm out.
- Joe.

14
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:36,375
Joe.

15
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,541
Joe.

16
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,041
Aren't you dressed yet? It's late.

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,833
Late for what, Mom?

18
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:42,875
For what?

19
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,041
I, Amnaj Techamahapaisarnkij,

20
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,375
shall declare my will of inheritance.

21
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,416
For Mr. Akepaitool,

22
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,250
Ake Techamahapaisarnkij,

23
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,375
I hereby give you
the Paisarnkijsiri factory,

24
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,125
along with land in Ayutthaya Province.

25
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,625
As for Mrs. Trichada,

26
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:10,833
I give you 99 acres of durian plantations
in Nonthaburi Province.

27
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:15,750
For Miss Benjamas, I hereby give you
a vacation home in Hua Hin District,

28
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,333
Prachuap Khiri Khan Province.

29
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,041
Mr. Patcharawat, Top,

30
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,625
shall inherit the frozen seafood business
in Rayong Province

31
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,083
and a house in Pathum Thani Province.

32
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,291
For Mr. Wisarut Techamahapaisarnkij,

33
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,583
whom I shall hereby call Joe,
my beloved grandson…

34
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,750
The will ends here, sir.

35
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,250
Meaning, there is no further writing?

36
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,583
He probably took his last breath
while dragging the pen.

37
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,416
Vacation home? The one we visited?

38
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,166
- The resort?
- Yes.

39
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,083
Grandpa!

40
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,458
What? Stressed?

41
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:28,208
Why the stress? Wealth is just a delusion.

42
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,041
Hey, listen to me, Joe.

43
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,500
You and I have been
buddies forever, right?

44
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,083
How about…

45
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,083
the house?

46
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:40,875
The one in Pathum Thani.

47
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,750
I'll give it to you.

48
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,541
Really?

49
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,541
Yeah, I wouldn't go there anyway.

50
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,416
Seriously?

51
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:52,916
Of course!

52
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,583
That is Pathum Thani.

53
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,041
I can't even drive to Siam
without getting a cramp.

54
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,666
Come on, brother! Are you joking?

55
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,166
Of course not!

56
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,291
Have I ever fooled you? Just take it!

57
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,000
- Take care of it.
- Thank you very much, bro.

58
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,916
- Yeah.
- You're awesome.

59
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,875
Thank you very much, Mr. Joe,
for choosing our service.

60
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,250
Simple steps…

61
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,583
Quick cash…

62
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,291
Come to Mha Jai Dee!

63
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,958
If Mr. Joe has a friend
who wants to use the loan service,

64
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,541
please introduce them to us,
Mha Jai Dee, sir.

65
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:39,833
Deal.

66
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,666
Awesome!

67
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,208
TOTAL: 200,000 BAHT

68
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,458
All things real estate, you can trust me.

69
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,916
Not long ago, the one on 13th Street.
You know that one?

70
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,208
- Yeah, I do
- That's right.

71
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,583
The owner's been selling for three years.
Couldn't close a deal.

72
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,291
Contacted me.

73
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,791
So, I called my colleagues just once.
You know what happened, right?

74
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,541
- What happened?
- Thirteen million.

75
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,375
The transaction was transferred
the next day. Done.

76
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,750
If you don't mind me bragging.
But let me brag.

77
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:19,875
I think we should hurry up.
It's afternoon.

78
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,375
We must get there before it gets dark.

79
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,125
Come on. Take it easy.

80
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,333
I’ve already sold a few around there.
I know the routes.

81
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,833
Land?

82
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,791
- Yeah, of course. What?
- I don't know.

83
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,166
- We'll get there shortly.
- You seem to do lots of things.

84
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,541
Twenty-nine kilometers to the destination.

85
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,916
In one hour and two minutes.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Please make a U-turn.

87
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,500
In 100 meters, turn left.

88
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,291
This left?

89
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,500
- This left, bro.
- Turn left.

90
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,708
- Turn left.
- Turn left.

91
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,375
Turn left.

92
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,583
I can't turn left anymore, ma'am. Damn.

93
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:01,083
Hey brother. I'm thinking.
Should we go back today?

94
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,250
Let's come back another day.

95
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,250
What do you mean go back?
We're almost there!

96
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:05,875
Hey!

97
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,208
You said you've been around here, right?

98
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,500
- Why are you lost?
- Well…

99
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,750
I think we can walk
to our left here, brother.

100
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,750
Probably not. Let's go back.

101
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,083
Hey, wait a minute!

102
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,416
If you can sell the house this week,

103
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,958
I'll increase your cut from three to five.

104
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,041
Let's go. I think
we can walk through that.

105
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:24,958
Let's go.

106
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,291
Hey, slow down. Slow.

107
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,041
Dude! We're almost there. Come on!

108
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,291
Do you think this is the right path?

109
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,000
- Hey!
- What!?

110
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,083
We're turning back, right?

111
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,041
- This is the right path.
- Oh…

112
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,916
Of course I know. This way.

113
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,708
Hey! Slow down!

114
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:09,625
Where is it?

115
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,166
This one?

116
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,291
Let me evaluate for a moment.

117
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,250
Got it. I think we can go back.

118
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,416
- Hey, wait a moment!
- Huh?

119
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,833
Go take a look inside first!

120
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,166
This is enough. This kind of property…

121
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,833
I’ve sold many like this.

122
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,291
Alright. So, how much do you say?

123
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,166
No more than two million, maximum.

124
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:37,916
Just two million?

125
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,208
Unless there's an antique inside,

126
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:45,291
- then you'd get another four or five…
- Well, let's take a look, then.

127
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,041
…hundred! Hey!

128
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,458
You'd take just a few hundred?

129
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,125
Anything counts right now.

130
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:28,750
Let's check out this room.

131
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:47,833
Come on.

132
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,250
Uh-huh.

133
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,333
This house is high-key dusty. Look.

134
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,708
What exactly does that mean?

135
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,375
Highly. Highly dusty.

136
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,375
Kids these days…

137
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,583
I've found something!

138
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,541
Me too.

139
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,250
How much do you think?

140
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:20,666
Hey!

141
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,916
That one looks out of this world!

142
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,916
Certainly not of this world.

143
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,000
It's pretty heavy.

144
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,041
Hey!

145
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,000
Dude, I think we've struck gold!

146
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,083
Now we're talking.

147
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,416
- Bro.
- Whoa.

148
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,791
Looks antique, very vintage.
Don't you think?

149
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,625
Look.

150
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,750
I think it is.

151
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,541
But I say, vintage stuff has a price.

152
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,416
There it is. Classic.

153
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,083
Yuth!

154
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,750
Yuth!

155
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,583
I don't care! I'm leaving!

156
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,666
I'm lost!

157
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,208
No, that's where I ran from. Dammit!

158
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,625
Is that a person?

159
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,208
Of course.

160
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,333
You, though. Who are you?

161
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,291
I am Joe,

162
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,458
the owner of this house.
I'm putting it on the market,

163
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,375
so I've come to see the property.

164
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,625
Yeah, Uncle.

165
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,375
For real, what do you know
about this house?

166
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,875
- This house?
- Yes.

167
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,500
Uncle?

168
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,208
Uncle! Uncle…

169
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,958
That's what you call a professional.

170
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,125
Wherever there is a frog,
there is Uncle Pom!

171
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,041
Take a look!

172
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,458
Hey! The rain is coming.
I need to find more frogs.

173
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,625
Got the first one already.
This is my lucky night!

174
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,166
Sh…

175
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,208
Shit!

176
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,625
Argh…

177
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,250
Could you please recite
the repelling of evil spirits, Father?

178
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,541
That was twice already.
You should be fine, son.

179
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,208
With all this decor,
ghosts can't enter for sure, right?

180
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,250
No, they can't.

181
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,458
Nor can they leave.

182
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,916
I'm joking, son.

183
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,750
Make it more pronounced.

184
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,583
Father, this one is still a bit faded.

185
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:22,000
Father, here. Please
get this area soaking wet.

186
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,583
Is that enough, son?

187
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,375
- Yes.
- Prepare for the blessing.

188
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,458
You asked for too much.

189
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,625
Oh!

190
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,500
Thank you, Father.

191
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,458
Travel safely.

192
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,958
Thank you.

193
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,333
- Hey, Uncle.
- Huh?

194
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,416
Thought you were one of the monks.

195
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,583
What?

196
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,041
Please stay with me.

197
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,125
Hey, I can't. I have a meeting
at the district center.

198
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,125
- The drinks are on me.
- Hey!

199
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,666
I don't indulge myself in such pleasures.

200
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,916
Hey! Kid.

201
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,416
It's raining! I'm leaving!

202
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,083
- Huh, Uncle?
- Have to catch some frogs!

203
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,000
Uncle, wait! Uncle!

204
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,416
Catching frogs! Catch some frogs!

205
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,000
Uncle, wait!

206
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,041
Thank you very much.

207
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,375
If it weren't for you, I'd be terrified.

208
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:17,583
The Lord,
the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One,

209
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:22,083
I pay homage to the Buddha,
the Awakened One, the Blessed One.

210
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,708
Prostrate once.

211
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,750
The Teaching
is well expounded by the Blessed One,

212
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,291
I pay homage to the Dhamma.

213
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:39,750
Prostrate once.

214
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:50,083
The Sangha, the Blessed One's disciples
have practiced well,

215
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,916
I pay homage to the Sangha.

216
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:54,791
Prostrate once.

217
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,250
- Sadhu.
- Sadhu.

218
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,458
Shit!

219
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,708
Hey!

220
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,791
Hey!

221
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,625
Please help me, Father!

222
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,958
I've brought the monks
to get rid of you guys, haven't I?

223
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,708
Why are you still standing in front of me?

224
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,083
And why are you getting rid of me?

225
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,500
This is my house.

226
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,125
I won't let you guys stay here!

227
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,416
Well, it is mine, too.

228
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,000
I've been living here since I was born.

229
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,083
Yes, sir.

230
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,083
We've been here a long time.

231
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:41,125
I don't know since
when you have been here,

232
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,000
but as of now, this is my house.

233
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,208
You guys must leave!

234
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,708
You're the one who must leave.

235
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,583
We can't go anywhere else.

236
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,166
Kid!

237
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,125
Uncle Pom!

238
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,791
- Huh?
- Did you see that?

239
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,583
Obviously.

240
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,750
Hey!

241
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,708
Whoa!

242
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,125
There's still almost a pint left.

243
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,500
I'll handle it myself.

244
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,208
Or else it'd go bad.

245
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,333
Uncle! Wait for me!

246
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,666
Uncle Pom!

247
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,208
Wait for me, Uncle!

248
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,875
Last Tuesday, on the 14th of September,

249
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,333
a robbery occurred at the residence
of Lord Damrongyothanarong,

250
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:53,125
who was on a trip
to the capital with his wife.

251
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,041
CAPITAL STAR NEWS

252
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,333
Anong Yothanarong, his daughter,

253
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,666
and the servants
went missing without a trace.

254
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,208
I'm opening right now…

255
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,625
There you go.

256
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,500
This feeling.

257
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,375
The moment I turn, I'm done.

258
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,958
Above? No.

259
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:42,208
I need to get my back to safety first.

260
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,500
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

261
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,416
Well, I found this.

262
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,166
SIAM PRACHA NEWS

263
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:27,083
Does this mean nobody knew
that we were dead?

264
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:32,291
Or is this the reason why
we have not been able to reincarnate?

265
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,458
And if you wanted to do so, how?

266
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,166
I guess we'd have to find
our remains first.

267
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,125
So, where are they?

268
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:49,750
Oh, we were long dead by then.
What a silly question!

269
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:52,708
That's true.

270
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,083
Hmm…

271
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,916
How about this?

272
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,083
I'll help you find them.

273
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,958
Then we'd help you too.

274
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,916
I found this photo, Anong.

275
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,000
Do you happen to know…

276
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,458
how my parents got along?

277
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,583
After your parents came home
and didn't find you,

278
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,541
they tried to search for you.

279
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,125
They searched for many years.

280
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,541
Still, they couldn't find you.

281
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,125
But they didn't stop trying.

282
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:05,916
They set out to find you
wherever they thought you would be.

283
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:12,375
But when they failed,
they were so devastated…

284
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:16,791
that they couldn't handle
living in this house anymore.

285
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:26,791
DEATH SENTENCE

286
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:31,625
After the court sentenced
Lord Damrongyothanarong to death

287
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,041
for wrongfully ordering
the killing of all suspects

288
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:38,125
related to the disappearance
of his daughter Anong,

289
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:43,083
a week later, it was found that
his wife, Rumpai Yothanarong,

290
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:47,125
died of a broken heart,
following her husband.

291
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:57,416
So, they asked to be relocated
to another province.

292
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:04,791
And after that, around the age of 80,

293
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:10,375
the two of them passed away peacefully.

294
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,166
Thank you very much.

295
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,458
My name is Joe.

296
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,416
Thank you very much, Joe.

297
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:42,666
Hurry! Vacation house,
nice view, not far from Thonglor.

298
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,166
Three and a half million baht only!

299
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,041
The price is negotiable. I'm the broker.

300
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:50,125
This one's familiar! Is this
from American Horror Story?

301
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,708
Definitely comes with a surprise!

302
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,000
There's some dark energy, for sure!

303
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,416
Has Sam Raimi ever filmed here?

304
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:00,250
With the house looking so scary,
I'd rather set up a haunted house!

305
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:18,041
- Mom?
- What are you doing?

306
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,375
Why didn't you answer the phone?

307
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:22,458
A guy named Mha said
he tried to call you multiple times.

308
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:23,958
Now, he's at our place.

309
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:24,875
Huh?

310
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,125
What did you tell him?

311
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:31,916
Oh, I told him to just go see you there
if he wants to talk so much.

312
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:35,000
Dammit.

314
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:02,875
Come! Bring your friends, too.

315
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,833
That was so scary!

316
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:06,666
I told you not to enter!

00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:11,041
Look, look.

319
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,458
Well, look who dressed up
so nice to see me.

320
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,041
I dress up every day, no matter what.

321
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:19,833
Owen, can I share that?

322
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:22,625
Whoa…

323
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:24,875
Do you have a ticket?

324
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:27,791
Go.

325
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:29,750
Wait… Hey, where are you going?

326
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:32,541
- The haunted house.
- Hey, I haven't said I wanted to enter!

327
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:33,541
HAUNTED HOUSE

328
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:39,500
One ticket, please.

329
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,000
Come here, Mr. Panda, quick!

330
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,416
What even is this?

331
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,416
Brr…

332
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,791
Quick! Come closer!

333
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,416
What?

334
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,541
- My leg! Something touched my leg!
- Where is it?

335
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,250
It held on to me like this!

336
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,458
Bullshit! You're delusional. Come on.

337
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:00,875
Let's go! I'm scared.

338
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,375
I'm not scared unless you start dancing!

339
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:27,208
Go!

340
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:47,666
Hey, look!

341
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,791
Dragon egg.

342
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,791
Argh. Hurry!

343
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,458
- Argh.
- What is it?

344
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:19,708
Hey, what are you doing?

345
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:21,083
What?

346
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,833
This is my girl. Get off her.

347
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:26,125
I think you should tell her first
to let go of me.

348
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:29,625
Don't mess around or I'll mess you up.

349
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,541
This one's my girl.

350
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:33,208
Wait. Who's your girlfriend?

351
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,416
By the way, what's your name?

352
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,916
My name is Soda.

353
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,666
Is this your first time
at this haunted house?

354
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,166
I'm sorry for pulling your arms.

355
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,958
I was so scared. My heart was pounding.

356
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:52,041
Miss. Please let go.
I don't want to get in trouble.

357
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:53,708
What did you say?

358
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:55,875
Want a match?

359
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,000
Want a match, is that right?

360
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,041
How about matching my fist with your face?

361
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,458
I told you to fix my pouch.

362
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,750
Yet here you are at the fair!

363
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:06,250
I just stopped in the area for a moment.

364
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:09,458
Greetings, Uncle Pom.

365
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,541
Greetings, son.

366
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,500
Where have you been? What's with the dirt?

367
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:16,083
Well, I was coming to your place…

368
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:17,541
Dammit.

369
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:28,541
Where did he go?

370
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't know who dug a hole.

371
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,708
Be careful when you return there.

372
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:41,416
Yes, Uncle.

373
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,458
Leave! Kong!

374
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,625
Just wait for me to get home.

375
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:49,250
Mess around?

376
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,291
Whoa.

377
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,833
Who's messing around?

378
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:04,458
062 346 5-- SODA.

379
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:07,166
Oh, what the hell?
Whoa, higher than a kite, you guys.

380
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:10,500
Oh! Mr. Mha.

381
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:12,958
Hi, Mister.

382
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:14,916
Yeah.

383
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:16,791
Ouch!

384
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:23,041
Let me guess.

385
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:24,833
You went to my house, right?

386
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,500
How did you know, Mr. Joe?

387
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:44,708
You should be careful when you walk home.

388
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:45,791
Okay.

389
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:50,375
What brings you here, Mr. Mha?

390
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,416
When one owes money,

391
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,708
one has to make
every effort to pay off the debt.

392
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,250
There's no such thing as staying still
and having money given to us.

393
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:09,625
Like us, we need to work hard.

394
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,458
Regarding your debt, Mr. Joe…

395
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:19,416
Mr. Mha!

396
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:22,375
I'd like to ask for an additional 50,000.

397
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,333
You're taking more?

398
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,333
Your previous debt
hasn't even been cleared.

399
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:29,875
But this time, I'll definitely pay.

400
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:34,125
How about this?
I'll let you charge even more interest.

401
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,958
Mr. Joe.

402
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,291
Will you take cash or a transfer instead?

403
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:57,375
What are you doing, Mr. Joe?

404
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:01,083
I'm starting a haunted house business.

405
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:04,416
I'd like all of you,
Anong, Thong Yip, Thong Gon,

406
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,750
to be my performers.

407
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:10,875
If there are visitors,
I can pay off my debt.

408
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:13,625
Then I'll have time
to search for your remains.

409
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,791
So, if we refuse, you're not digging?

410
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,083
It's not like that. Well…

411
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:23,125
If you all have gone to the next life,
how else would I pay?

412
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,000
Even-steven, is that what you're saying?

413
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:29,833
Are you in a lot of debt?

414
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:32,125
Two hundred thousand.

415
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:35,625
Oh, I guess we're stuck here forever!

416
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:39,750
Actually, I've always
been interested in performing.

417
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,458
Really?

418
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:45,750
We'll be your performers, Joe.

419
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:49,916
We can leave this world
after you've collected all you need.

420
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,083
Noice.

421
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:56,208
What's "noice"?

422
00:32:57,083 --> 00:33:00,208
"Noice" means… nice!

423
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:02,166
Very, very nice!

424
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:05,000
How about this?

425
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,541
Let's try to practice
performing with each other.

426
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:13,041
Try to come up
with what you think is the scariest

427
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:15,166
and then shout it out.

428
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,791
Was that scary?

429
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,833
I think… just some tiny tweaks.
You'll be great.

430
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:45,625
Is that enough?

431
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:46,666
That's enough, sis.

432
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:53,666
- Are you ready, Anong?
- I'm ready.

433
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:56,958
If ready, go ahead.

434
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,041
Boo!

435
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:27,583
Was that scary?

436
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:30,750
Noice.

437
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:35,625
Okay, everybody.

438
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:38,541
If everyone is ready, I'll count to three.

439
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:41,708
One, two…

440
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:45,625
three!

441
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:07,458
I'm dead. Let us continue.

442
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:12,625
ANONG'S HOUSE

443
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:33,375
I offer these belongings to Anong,

444
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:35,750
Thong Yip, Thong Gon.

445
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:47,458
Wait! Wait a moment!

446
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:52,666
Hey! Do you want to die?

447
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,750
Why? Aren't you over it yet?

448
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:55,708
Want another round?

449
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:57,208
Nah, bro. I just…

450
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:58,916
I'm sorry.

451
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,833
Right now, I'm… setting up
a haunted house here, so…

452
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:03,208
if you're interested in trying.

453
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:05,416
Don't tell me it's that house.

454
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,208
Why would you tell me?

455
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:12,291
I see you are not afraid of ghosts.

456
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:14,416
Just in case you're interested
and want to check it out.

457
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,625
Nope.

458
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,458
But I will.

459
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,625
Let's go.

460
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:23,458
Let the cowards stay here.

461
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:30,875
What now?

462
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:33,500
True.

463
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:34,833
If you're scared, don't go.

464
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:36,833
- What?
- What?

465
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:39,083
Come on.

466
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:41,833
What a pretty staircase.

467
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:45,666
Ugh.

468
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:52,291
Who is this grandma?

469
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:54,000
Hey, don't call her grandma!

470
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,041
How bad is it going to be? Let's go.

471
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:00,208
Wait for me.

472
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:01,250
Hurry up.

473
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,666
You go first.

474
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:15,666
Hey! Be careful!

475
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:21,166
Looks pretty legit so far. Here.

476
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:26,041
This chair will definitely move.
How formulaic. Believe me.

477
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:28,541
- Really?
- For sure.

478
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:30,291
Let me see.

479
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:54,458
Calm down!

480
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:56,166
Calm down.

481
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:58,375
Ouch!

482
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:08,333
You stupid! My head is stuck
in a tree. Don't you see?

483
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:12,208
You brainless freak!
Why haven't you unstuck me?

484
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:23,250
What are you guys so afraid of?

485
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:28,916
I'm not easily scared.

486
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,291
Dancer ghosts are an exception.

487
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:09,541
Yam! Run!

488
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,041
I can't go.

489
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:34,125
You guys were awesome!

490
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:39,125
But I think I made a mistake.

491
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:43,166
Next time, me and this fool
will be more coordinated.

492
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:45,541
Got it, asshole?

493
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:51,708
But I think this is only the first time
and we already did so well.

494
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:56,708
The next time, people will be so scared,
they’ll pee their pants!

495
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:57,708
True!

496
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,291
But I think both of you…
should have a partnered trick.

497
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:03,666
More?

498
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,833
Yes!

499
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:07,458
The visitors who came today
really liked it.

500
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:09,666
Give it some time.
I think you'll definitely be a star.

501
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,458
Like the Capital Star.

502
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:14,500
Come, Gon.

503
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:15,875
Practice.

504
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:23,833
I'm still not sure
whether I was good enough.

505
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,250
I don't know if I was scary.

506
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:29,791
Yes, you were.

507
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:32,833
Thinking about it
still gives me goosebumps.

508
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:35,250
Really.

509
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:39,625
And is fooling people a sin?

510
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,291
Of course not, Anong.

511
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:44,833
Everybody that comes does so
because they want to be scared.

512
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:48,083
Then, when they are scared,
they are entertained.

513
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:54,000
By the way, what do you
actually do for a living?

514
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:58,583
I'm a… video game streamer.

515
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:07,000
Here, we got all dressed up.

516
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:08,833
Does she resemble you?

517
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:12,916
Well, she might be a bit bulky, but…

518
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,333
close enough, I guess.

519
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:16,125
Yeah.

520
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:21,541
Then, after we get dressed up, right,
we can head out on a mission.

521
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,208
Okay, everyone. Now,
I'm starting a new mission.

522
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:30,250
It's a new map, so we have to start over.

523
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,250
Which way to go?

524
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:35,916
Go straight.

525
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:37,666
Done.

526
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:41,458
Hello, Mr. Joe. A new character today?

527
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:43,166
Yes, sir.

528
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,458
I've changed to a new character
to give you guys a new experience.

529
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:50,791
Because when playing a female character,
it gives a softer feeling.

530
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:53,208
Whose voice was that?

531
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:58,375
Oh, this is an automatic sound
that this device speaks with to me.

532
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,166
Whose voice was that?

533
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,583
N-No! Which voice? Who?

534
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:09,708
Your pitch has gotten high.
Is that your girlfriend?

535
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:18,250
It seems the computer's lagging today.
I should end the stream first. It lags.

536
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:19,916
Thank you very much.
I'll see you guys later.

537
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,666
Well, that's how
you livestream a video game.

538
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:28,875
What is a "girlfriend"?

539
00:43:33,833 --> 00:43:38,083
G-Girlfriend is… a friend!

540
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,166
That's right. A friend.

541
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:44,291
So, am I now your girlfriend?

542
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:47,083
Ah…

543
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:51,166
Yes! Yes, of course.

544
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:54,333
You are smart.

545
00:43:57,583 --> 00:44:02,250
And so are Thong Gon and Thong Yip, right?

546
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:06,500
Well… of course.

547
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:10,291
One, two, three!

548
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:21,833
And when you were alive,
what did you do for a living?

549
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:26,458
- I was a teacher.
- What subject did you teach?

550
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:28,875
Dancing.

551
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,625
Whoa! Dancing?

552
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:32,791
Noice, right?

553
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:34,375
Very noice.

554
00:44:36,916 --> 00:44:38,333
Can you dance?

555
00:44:38,416 --> 00:44:39,666
Not at all.

556
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:41,583
Negative, even.

557
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:46,458
Come on. Just a bit.

558
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:50,291
I want to know how people dance nowadays.

559
00:44:53,416 --> 00:44:54,375
Yes.

560
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:11,791
- One ticket, sir?
- Yes.

561
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:12,916
Sure, sir.

562
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,875
TICKET

563
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:31,000
NEW HAUNTED LANDMARK, SO SPOOKY
#ANONGHOUSE

564
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:33,166
You're back with me, Kanye East.

565
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,333
I visited Anong's House.

566
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,791
So scary!

567
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:39,541
This one's a must.
The ghosts are so scary.

568
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:42,708
Welcome to Anong's House!

569
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:27,291
My ears almost bled.

570
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:30,208
Hot and fresh!

571
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:33,833
You can twist the head, too.

572
00:47:33,916 --> 00:47:36,458
Here! There is another one. Look.

573
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:38,166
- Look at her intestines.
- Want some ice cream?

574
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:40,541
The filling is flowing. It is flowing.

575
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,125
This!

576
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:45,583
Want some?

577
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:50,958
Grilled frog. Freshly grilled.
Please come this way.

578
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,000
Ah.

579
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:56,125
- Ouch!
- Shit!

580
00:48:08,916 --> 00:48:11,375
Argh!

581
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:23,125
That's enough for me. Only once.

582
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:26,833
Honestly, that was so realistic!

583
00:48:26,916 --> 00:48:28,416
I'm still shaking right now.

584
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,375
Not because I'm peeing.
I'm really shocked.

585
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:34,291
Anong's Haunted House is the scariest!

586
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:36,166
Let's go home. I can't take it anymore.

587
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:47,625
I would like to offer
this belonging to Anong.

588
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:50,541
Sadhu.

589
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:55,708
Yeah, 20 baht. Twenty baht?

590
00:48:55,791 --> 00:48:57,500
- Help this poor lady out--
- Hey.

591
00:48:58,166 --> 00:48:59,291
Who is Joe talking to?

592
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:01,375
- Where?
- Right there.

593
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:03,041
Here's how.

594
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:06,375
Is he stressed? He looks sleep-deprived.

595
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:08,833
Sadhu.

596
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:10,166
FLOWING-FILLING ICE CREAM

597
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,458
- Huh?
- Anong? Taste it!

598
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:13,500
Very yummy!

599
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:18,708
- Right?
- Yeah, it's yummy.

600
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:35,333
ANONG'S HOUSE

601
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:42,250
Is the money lacking?

602
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:44,666
- Money problems, come to Mr. Mha.
- Is the money lacking?

603
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,833
- Is the money lacking?
- Mha is generous.

604
00:49:46,916 --> 00:49:50,583
- Easy loans, fast transfer, no limits.
- Mha is generous.

605
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:52,041
Call us if you need money.

606
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:54,708
If there is a financial problem,
call Mr. Mha.

607
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:57,083
Easy loans. No limits.

608
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:00,291
Greetings, Mr. Joe.

609
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:01,375
Greetings, Mr. Mha.

610
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,708
Long time no see.

611
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:06,916
I see your business is doing well.

612
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:08,791
I guess so.

613
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:11,625
Are you interested in trying it out?

614
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,166
The ticket's on me.

615
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:16,416
Maybe a bit, sir?

616
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,416
Hey!

617
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,125
Or are you…

618
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:28,416
afraid of ghosts?

619
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:34,750
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

620
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:38,875
I'm more afraid
of my customers not paying.

621
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:43,458
How about, after your round,

622
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,125
I'll have the cash ready by the exit.

623
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,791
- Mr. Joe.
- Mr. Mha.

624
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:49,708
- Mr. Joe.
- Mr. Mha.

625
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:50,791
You…

626
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:53,583
challenged the wrong person.

627
00:50:57,208 --> 00:50:58,750
Are you willing to test that?

628
00:50:59,958 --> 00:51:02,458
Mr. Mha has never been afraid of ghosts.

629
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,208
ANONG'S HOUSE

630
00:51:14,291 --> 00:51:15,458
Sir, are you okay?

631
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:16,875
Mr. Mha! I'm scared.

632
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:21,000
What will happen to us
if you don't make it? Sir!

633
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:26,583
I'm cleared. Interest included.

634
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:30,416
- Go! Go, quickly!
- Go. Go!

635
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,958
Don't you think
that was longer than usual?

636
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:04,083
I think so, too.

637
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:32,333
Mistress, do you have a sore throat?

638
00:52:34,958 --> 00:52:36,375
Want some water?

639
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:48,833
Anong?

640
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:51,625
How are you?

641
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:54,125
Are you digging again?

642
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:56,791
I paid off all the debts.

643
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:58,375
So, you can finally be reborn.

644
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:10,041
I'm still having fun
with this haunted house.

645
00:53:10,125 --> 00:53:12,833
Yeah. Do you know that our house

646
00:53:12,916 --> 00:53:16,208
is one of the top five scariest
haunted houses in the country?

647
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:17,625
Yeah?

648
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,083
And when will it become the first?

649
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:25,583
I don't know.

650
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:30,958
Then…

651
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:35,083
I'll wait for you to get to first place,

652
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:37,250
then I'll be reborn.

653
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:41,208
I'm not in a hurry.

654
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:44,166
I've been here for over seven decades.

655
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:47,833
A bit longer should be fine.

656
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:50,958
What about my opinion?

657
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:54,750
Yeah.

658
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,291
Stay a little longer.

659
00:53:57,875 --> 00:53:59,166
That should be fine.

660
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:01,250
Yeah.

661
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:03,583
By the way,

662
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:06,666
are you free tomorrow?

663
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:13,375
Aside from being a ghost hovering around,

664
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:15,208
I'm not doing much of anything else.

665
00:54:20,875 --> 00:54:23,916
Thong Gon, are you free tomorrow?

666
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,583
Aside from hovering my head around,

667
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:30,041
I'm not doing much else either.

668
00:54:31,416 --> 00:54:33,750
ANONG'S HOUSE

669
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:39,291
CLOSED FOR ONE DAY

670
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:45,583
May I offer food and drink to Anong,

671
00:54:45,666 --> 00:54:46,875
Thong Yip,

672
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:48,000
Thong Gon,

673
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:49,708
Sadhu?

674
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:51,666
Ouch!

675
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:54,250
- Another glass.
- Nice?

676
00:54:56,083 --> 00:54:58,416
Can this compete with moonshine?

677
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,375
Great.

678
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:00,583
Everyone.

679
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:04,000
Cheers!

680
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:06,375
Whoo!

681
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:14,250
Another glass.

682
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:16,291
Take the whole bottle.

683
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:20,541
Hey!

684
00:55:20,625 --> 00:55:21,583
Hey!

685
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:23,666
Whoa…

686
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:27,291
Practicing even on a holiday.
How hardworking.

687
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:29,916
Hey, I've only met you at work,
but not in daily life.

688
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:33,583
Come on. You're throwing a party
without inviting us.

689
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:34,750
True.

690
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,958
Hey, take a seat. Quick!

691
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:41,375
- Chair, sit.
- Sit. Sit.

692
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:43,875
Yeah. Has the party
been going on for long?

693
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:46,166
How are you doing?

694
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:51,666
Hey, guys, get comfortable. Chill.

695
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:53,916
Are you tired?

696
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,250
My friends are tired.
Let them go to rest first. Right?

697
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:58,708
What is it?

698
00:55:59,458 --> 00:56:00,416
I'll tell you what.

699
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,791
I've gone to a hundred haunted houses.

700
00:56:02,875 --> 00:56:04,458
This is the scariest one yet.

701
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:06,416
- By far.
- Yeah.

702
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,791
Are you just flattering me?

703
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:13,166
No, I mean it. You, especially,
are the most realistic. Right, Owen?

704
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,875
Of course. I saw her.
I was scared shitless.

705
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:20,625
By the way,
could you perform for us again?

706
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:23,625
Is there an exclusive secret trick for us?

707
00:56:24,291 --> 00:56:25,625
Right!

708
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:27,333
I told you.

709
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:28,250
Would that be good?

710
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:30,791
Scare me until I'm sober, ma'am.

711
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:32,250
Let me see.

712
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:33,750
Yeah.

713
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:36,875
Go ahead!

714
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:39,625
Go ahead!

715
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:41,208
Go ahead!

716
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:42,333
Go ahead!

717
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:44,416
Here we go!

718
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,916
Do it! Do it!

719
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,875
- Are you ready?
- We are!

720
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:54,541
Wow! Awesome!

721
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,583
What's that?

722
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:01,916
Eh!

723
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:03,791
Holy shit!

724
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:06,708
Applause!

725
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:10,083
- Terrific! Looks so real!
- So cool!

726
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:12,833
So real!

727
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:14,083
You look sleepy, right?

728
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:16,625
Get some rest first.
You've been practicing all day.

729
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:19,416
Alright, I'll let my friends
go rest first. They're sleepy.

730
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,250
Fine.

731
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:24,375
We're leaving.

732
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:31,666
Oh, they left.

733
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,416
- Bummer.
- Not fun at all.

734
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,375
No joy at all.

735
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:35,625
Let's dance instead.

736
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:38,083
Hey, that song. That song.

737
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,291
TEST ME

738
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:40,333
Come on.

739
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:41,458
Yeah.

740
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:43,666
Oh, this one!

741
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:45,375
Go.

742
00:57:51,291 --> 00:57:54,000
Don't be afraid I'm not original

743
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:56,000
I'm different

744
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:59,000
And I'm definitely not like her

745
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:02,666
I heard that she was good

746
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,000
But wouldn't you look at me first?

747
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:08,958
I'll reserve you as my number one

748
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:13,125
I know you're not sure who deserves you

749
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:15,375
Come on! I'm just having fun.

750
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:18,583
Stop looking out for me so much.
What am I, a superstar?

751
00:58:18,666 --> 00:58:20,125
But if you just try and think

752
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:22,458
And open-heartedly get to know me, yeah

753
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:28,291
And you'll see
who your heart is looking for

754
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:33,583
However much she loves you
I love you more

755
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:38,166
I don't know it either,
But I love you more

756
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:42,375
How much she gives you
I will give you more

757
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:45,000
- Hey, give me your hand.
- Let's challenge--

758
00:58:45,083 --> 00:58:46,666
This.

759
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:48,833
As you requested.

760
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:52,000
I fixed your pouch, Gramps!

761
00:58:52,083 --> 00:58:53,583
Help me catch some frogs!

762
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:54,541
Come!

763
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:59,625
How's that for joy?

764
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:20,375
Mad?

765
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:23,625
Who's mad?

766
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,333
Ms. Anong?

767
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:37,166
Please teach me how to dance.

768
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,166
Will you?

769
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:49,958
I am delighted to see

770
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:55,208
My heart beating
From the sight of your face

771
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:56,916
I could only look

772
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,875
- To your left.
- Not letting you of sight

773
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:04,916
- So delighted as love gives me joy
- Yes, teacher.

774
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:09,083
But if only seeing was enough

775
01:00:09,166 --> 01:00:14,250
Oh alas, never have we touched

776
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:18,291
For in my dreams, both of us

777
01:00:18,375 --> 01:00:24,291
Caressed one another
Making love all night

778
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:27,958
Wish I'd see you in my dreams

779
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:32,750
As in there together, we'd be happy

780
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:37,000
- Again, again. You got it. Enough.
- Which I'd dream seeing you every night

781
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:43,708
As I prefer to dream, so delighted

782
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:56,958
Thank you for planting all these flowers.

783
01:00:57,833 --> 01:00:59,625
This is exactly how my home looked.

784
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:08,708
You are so kind.

785
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:15,208
Don't you know,
when I first bought this plumeria plant,

786
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:18,208
I compared it to the photo of your home.

787
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:21,000
I counted every branch
and flower, everything,

788
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:23,333
to get it as identical
as the actual one as possible.

789
01:01:23,416 --> 01:01:24,666
Especially this.

790
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:28,666
The flower. At first,
when it arrived, it was like this.

791
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,958
Really sad-looking.

792
01:01:30,041 --> 01:01:34,875
But now. look at this,
bright and blooming.

793
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:39,083
Tell your friends to bloom
just like you, son.

794
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:49,958
What are you doing?

795
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,500
This…

796
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,375
is called IG.

797
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:01,250
We use this for storing
our favorite photos as memories.

798
01:02:04,875 --> 01:02:06,041
Yeah.

799
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:10,250
Do you want to have one, too?

800
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:14,000
I do.

801
01:02:14,583 --> 01:02:16,583
One, two, three!

802
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:28,500
How come your photo doesn't include me?

803
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:32,458
Even though I can't see,
I still know you're by my side.

804
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:08,708
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU FALL IN LOVE
WITH A GHOST?

805
01:03:08,791 --> 01:03:11,458
MAKING LOVE WITH A GHOST
IS THAT ACTUALLY A THING?

806
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:17,666
LOVING A GHOST IS LETHAL! I LOST A FRIEND
LAST YEAR. THE GHOST TOOK HIM WITH IT

807
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:18,833
I ALMOST DIED.
A FEMALE GHOST WANTED TO TAKE ME.

808
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:20,291
DON'T PLAY WITH GHOST.
A BEAUTIFUL GHOSE TRIED TO KILL ME.

809
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:21,208
A GHOST JUST TOOK MY SISTER'S LIFE.

810
01:03:21,291 --> 01:03:25,041
HUMAN AND GHOST
DEFINITELY CAN'T BE TOGETHER.

811
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:57,291
Anong?

812
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:01,625
Thong Yip?

813
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:06,875
Thong Gon?

814
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:18,958
Anong?

815
01:04:27,625 --> 01:04:28,583
Anong?

816
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,541
- Joe.
- Whoa! Ouch!

817
01:04:33,625 --> 01:04:35,041
ANONG'S HOUSE

818
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,458
Joe?

819
01:04:59,291 --> 01:05:02,625
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

820
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:10,125
Joe!

821
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:14,041
Joe!

822
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:02,041
Anong?

823
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:08,333
Anong!

824
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:20,666
Hey!

825
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:21,666
Damn, who are you?

826
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:23,291
What the hell?

827
01:06:56,916 --> 01:06:58,125
Hey, go look. Anything left?

828
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,291
Go.

829
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:19,666
Anong?

830
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:24,625
Ouch!

831
01:08:38,666 --> 01:08:39,666
What happened, Anong?

832
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:46,875
The robbers hit your head
and you passed out.

833
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:49,000
So, I came to help.

834
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:51,333
How did you do that?

835
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:59,500
I possessed your body…

836
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,166
and took care of those people.

837
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,125
You are not looking
to take me with you, right?

838
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:14,875
I've never thought of doing that.

839
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:17,625
I was just…

840
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,583
bringing you some flowers.

841
01:09:52,541 --> 01:09:55,833
SAM KHOK

842
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:56,916
Thank you.

843
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:04,708
Hey, punk!

844
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:07,333
- Where are you guys going?
- What's up, bro?

845
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:08,375
Where are you going?

846
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:09,875
Taking my girlfriend to the temple.

847
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:11,625
Who's your girlfriend?

848
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,583
My main job is to make her mad.

849
01:10:13,666 --> 01:10:15,291
But my favorite job is to make her love.

850
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:16,916
Ouch!

851
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:18,791
I'll see you later.

852
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:20,000
See you later.

853
01:10:28,541 --> 01:10:31,250
‪ANONG'S HOUSE

854
01:10:48,833 --> 01:10:50,666
How's the head wound?

855
01:10:51,583 --> 01:10:54,666
It's much better.

856
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:56,541
Thank you, Anong.

857
01:11:00,666 --> 01:11:04,375
How's the neck wound, Thong Gon?

858
01:11:05,083 --> 01:11:06,625
It's getting better.

859
01:11:07,166 --> 01:11:09,250
Thank you, Thong Yip.

860
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:23,875
Wassup?

861
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:26,583
Yeah.

862
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:29,125
New year?

863
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:31,625
Hmm…

864
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:33,291
Not sure. Talk later?

865
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:35,916
Yeah, sure.

866
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:40,125
Girlfriend?

867
01:11:41,666 --> 01:11:42,750
Ah, yes.

868
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:45,833
My girlfriend called to invite me
to the New Year's festival.

869
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:50,208
Will you go?

870
01:11:54,666 --> 01:11:57,583
I want to go with this girlfriend more.

871
01:12:00,583 --> 01:12:02,166
Do you want to go
to the New Year's festival together?

872
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,541
What are you doing?

873
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:17,083
Hey! One moment.

874
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:27,041
SLEEPING PILL INSTRUCTIONS

875
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:29,916
Shit.

876
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:33,041
SLEEPING PILL INSTRUCTIONS

877
01:12:42,416 --> 01:12:46,416
Left, Joe. Right, Kong.

878
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,375
- Yeah, the path to your house.
- Left, Joe.

879
01:12:48,458 --> 01:12:49,416
A new road has been paved.

880
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,208
It takes me to the right and then left.

881
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:53,291
Then, at the intersection,
I have to turn right and then left.

882
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:55,125
Left, Joe. Right, Kong.

883
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:56,458
And then another left!

884
01:12:56,541 --> 01:13:00,625
Left, Joe. Right, Kong.

885
01:13:04,166 --> 01:13:05,458
Hey, here.

886
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:07,291
Have a drink. You must be tired.

887
01:13:08,833 --> 01:13:10,041
Why did you call me?

888
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:11,625
Huh? No…

889
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:14,000
Nothing? I just thought
you drove all the way here,

890
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:15,875
you must be thirsty. Have a drink.

891
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:18,500
Ah, I see.

892
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:24,500
Let me fix the table.
The drink is spilling.

893
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:27,250
Hey, that's fine!
It's ancient. Take a sip first.

894
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:29,250
It's okay, chill. Just a little lift.

895
01:13:29,333 --> 01:13:30,208
Come on.

896
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:32,250
Help me.

897
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:36,500
Your table…

898
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:39,083
Damn, your desk is quite heavy.

899
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,083
I think that fixed it.

900
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:43,458
I don't think so. Look.

901
01:13:43,541 --> 01:13:44,500
Just take a sip or else it will spill.

902
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:45,583
Let's fix it later.

903
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:47,250
It's so we could talk
without interruptions.

904
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:48,583
Just a tiny nudge. I'll help you.

905
01:13:48,666 --> 01:13:50,125
Below. Come here.

906
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:54,041
Come on. Help me. It's heavy.

907
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,708
- Did that do it?
- But the floor is old.

908
01:13:59,791 --> 01:14:00,625
I have to fix it.

909
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:01,750
Still not it. Let's go again.

910
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,375
Still no. Again.

911
01:14:06,958 --> 01:14:09,125
More…

912
01:14:09,208 --> 01:14:11,708
Further. Right.

913
01:14:11,791 --> 01:14:12,750
Got it.

914
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:14,208
Reverse a little.

915
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:15,208
Reverse?

916
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:19,125
- Is it straight now?
- You have to pull your ears on your side.

917
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:20,500
A little bit more.

918
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:25,375
I think that did it.

919
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:27,750
Okay.

920
01:14:28,583 --> 01:14:29,875
Oh, better.

921
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:32,291
Come, bro.

922
01:14:35,541 --> 01:14:39,166
Bro. I think today,
I'll ask Soda to be my girlfriend.

923
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,416
What do you think?

924
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,000
That's… great!

925
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:43,708
I'm going to ask during the countdown.

926
01:14:43,791 --> 01:14:46,375
Like three, two, one.
Once the fireworks are lit, bang!

927
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,291
I'll say…

928
01:14:49,416 --> 01:14:50,291
"Soda.

929
01:14:51,291 --> 01:14:52,208
Will you be my girlfriend?"

930
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:53,666
Damn!

931
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:55,416
Damn cool! How was that?

932
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,083
- Yeah.
- Give me a toast.

933
01:14:58,041 --> 01:14:59,041
Cheers.

934
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:00,000
The whole glass.

935
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:05,916
The whole glass. Come on.

936
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,125
Do you know?

937
01:15:25,416 --> 01:15:27,125
When I first saw her,

938
01:15:27,208 --> 01:15:31,000
I knew that she would
definitely be the mother of my kids.

939
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:34,083
We've known each other for a long time.

940
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,958
I still fall for her every time.

941
01:15:38,666 --> 01:15:40,916
Striking. Elegant.

942
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,083
So adorable.

943
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:45,500
I like her very much

944
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,208
Kong.

945
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:49,500
- Sup, brother?
- I have something to tell you.

946
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:57,125
That night you…

947
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:04,708
Kong? Kong?

948
01:16:18,291 --> 01:16:23,708
You are there, standing beside me

949
01:16:23,791 --> 01:16:29,416
I've never even dreamt of meeting you

950
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:32,500
In the city of millions

951
01:16:32,583 --> 01:16:37,458
Without having to look

952
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:40,875
You've already got me

953
01:16:49,916 --> 01:16:53,750
I used to be just another man

954
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:58,833
In the city of loneliness

955
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:04,583
I was a nobody

956
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:10,625
- Until you entered my heart
- Beautiful?

957
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:16,791
- Then my room changed in color
- Anong!

958
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:21,708
It was beautiful
More than I could find anywhere else

959
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:25,375
It's like time is standing still

960
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:30,750
- One hundred, sir.
- And this city won't be lonely anymore

961
01:17:30,833 --> 01:17:34,416
If today I have you

962
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:40,083
- So cute, Anong!
- You are there, standing beside me

963
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:45,708
I've never even dreamt of meeting you

964
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:48,000
- In the city of millions
- Anong. Let's take a selfie.

965
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:51,666
- Yeah.
- Without having to look

966
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:54,333
One, two, three!

967
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:57,750
You already got me

968
01:18:11,375 --> 01:18:13,958
Anong! Here's how you do it.

969
01:18:14,583 --> 01:18:17,833
Put the noodles onto the spoon,

970
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:21,166
and twist it around like this.

971
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:29,458
Yes. Then it'll be like this.
Then you can eat it.

972
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,375
Yeah.

973
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:45,583
Seems to be very delicious.

974
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:50,125
This is great.

975
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:52,666
I haven't left the house
in a very long time.

976
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:55,375
How many years?

977
01:18:56,208 --> 01:18:58,041
Probably about…

978
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:00,541
eighty years.

979
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:01,541
What did he say?

980
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,041
And back then,
when couples went on a date,

981
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:09,791
where did they go?

982
01:19:12,291 --> 01:19:14,833
To watch a film at the city hall.

983
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:17,375
If there was a fair, to Wat Phra Kaew

984
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:19,208
or to Sao Ching Cha.

985
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,708
And where are we going next?

986
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:01,000
How are you doing? Are you having fun?

987
01:20:01,083 --> 01:20:02,125
So much fun!

988
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:48,333
Thank you for taking me on a trip.

989
01:20:49,041 --> 01:20:50,208
Let's do it again.

990
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:55,708
But I also feel bad for Kong.

991
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:58,750
Come on. Don't feel bad for him.

992
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:01,375
How about,

993
01:21:01,458 --> 01:21:03,166
next time, you could possess Soda instead?

994
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:13,458
Or maybe… Uncle Pom? That's fine…

995
01:21:13,541 --> 01:21:14,375
Yeah.

996
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:26,583
Let's think about that later.
Who it is going to be.

997
01:21:27,333 --> 01:21:28,458
Yeah.

998
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:31,458
Right now, the vibes
of the 2024 New Year Party

999
01:21:31,541 --> 01:21:33,541
at Khao San Road are so energetic!

1000
01:21:33,625 --> 01:21:34,583
The time has come.

1001
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:36,833
Let us count down together!

1002
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:38,666
Ten, nine,

1003
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:40,416
eight, seven,

1004
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,833
six, five,

1005
01:21:41,916 --> 01:21:42,916
four,…

1006
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,791
- Three, two, one!
- Three, two, one!

1007
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,333
I love you, Anong.

1008
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:41,375
I love you too, Joe.

1009
01:23:06,916 --> 01:23:07,958
Shit!

1010
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,416
What?

1011
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:19,083
- Shit! Hey!
- What are you doing?

1012
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:20,666
Hey, calm down. Hey…

1013
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:21,666
Listen to me first.

1014
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,166
About last night…

1015
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,500
- Last night…
- Yeah.

1016
01:23:27,583 --> 01:23:28,500
Cheers.

1017
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,958
Let's celebrate. The whole glass.

1018
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,041
The whole glass. Come on.

1019
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:40,666
- How could you do this to me!?
- Calm down. Listen to me.

1020
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,208
No, I won't!

1021
01:23:42,291 --> 01:23:43,958
I always thought
you were not a good person.

1022
01:23:44,041 --> 01:23:45,291
Christ…

1023
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:52,750
And don't you dare tell anyone.

1024
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:36,500
- Oh, hey.
- What exactly did you do to me?

1025
01:24:36,583 --> 01:24:37,625
What do you mean?

1026
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:40,166
Why am I here?

1027
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:42,958
AT KHAO SAN. THIS COUPLE IS SO CUTE!

1028
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:45,125
- Shit!
- What sorcery is this?

1029
01:24:45,208 --> 01:24:46,875
- Hey!
- Tell me what you did to me!

1030
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:49,208
- Listen to me first.
- What the hell? Speak!

1031
01:24:49,291 --> 01:24:50,250
- Listen to me.
- Speak!

1032
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:52,541
- Calm down!
- What the hell did you do? Speak!

1033
01:24:52,625 --> 01:24:54,041
- Well…
- Why are you stuttering? Speak!

1034
01:24:54,125 --> 01:24:55,708
- Listen!
- Listen to me first.

1035
01:24:56,375 --> 01:24:57,791
Speak, why don't you!?

1036
01:24:57,875 --> 01:24:59,375
- Speak…
- You were possessed!

1037
01:25:00,916 --> 01:25:01,750
What the hell are you saying?

1038
01:25:20,125 --> 01:25:21,000
Here.

1039
01:25:22,708 --> 01:25:23,708
Ghosts.

1040
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:27,666
Bullshit. Gibberish.

1041
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:28,625
These are all your people.

1042
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:31,708
What did you do to me? Say it.

1043
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:33,208
Hey, are you crazy?

1044
01:25:37,583 --> 01:25:38,500
Hey.

1045
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:48,291
A human and a ghost?

1046
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:49,875
You can't even touch!

1047
01:25:49,958 --> 01:25:51,791
Are you okay with that?
I think it's a dead end.

1048
01:25:51,875 --> 01:25:54,291
I think you should rather find
someone in the flesh.

1049
01:25:54,375 --> 01:25:55,458
Just think about it.

1050
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:56,583
Before you can meet each other,

1051
01:25:56,666 --> 01:25:57,916
you must die first.

1052
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:01,000
And when you die, she's already reborn.

1053
01:26:01,625 --> 01:26:03,833
Then you wait for her to reincarnate.
And you do so after her.

1054
01:26:03,916 --> 01:26:06,166
Which means she's long dead by then.
And you do so after her,

1055
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:07,875
then you die again.

1056
01:26:07,958 --> 01:26:09,000
And so does she.

1057
01:26:09,583 --> 01:26:11,958
Let's just say you are
then reborn at the same time.

1058
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:14,208
Maybe you won't be
born a human, isn't that true?

1059
01:26:15,875 --> 01:26:16,916
A man and an animal…

1060
01:26:17,791 --> 01:26:18,791
That wouldn't work either!

1061
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:29,750
ANONG'S HOUSE

1062
01:26:48,666 --> 01:26:50,083
I talked to Kong.

1063
01:26:50,166 --> 01:26:52,041
He promised not to tell anyone.

1064
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:55,583
That's good.

1065
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:12,208
Thank you so much, kid.

1066
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:17,000
- Kiddo.
- Yes, Gramps?

1067
01:27:17,083 --> 01:27:18,708
- Are you selling well?
- Well enough, Gramps.

1068
01:27:21,916 --> 01:27:23,333
Which one hits the hardest?

1069
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:26,125
For you, this one.

1070
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:28,000
The Elephant's Might.

1071
01:27:28,583 --> 01:27:32,625
It gives you energy
and clenches your thirst.

1072
01:27:32,708 --> 01:27:36,500
Would it be appropriate? I need to sell--

1073
01:27:36,583 --> 01:27:37,875
I consider that a refusal--

1074
01:27:38,541 --> 01:27:40,416
Hey… But I'm thirsty, son. Very thirsty.

1075
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:43,083
Not too much. I need to work.

1076
01:27:43,166 --> 01:27:44,041
Are you sure?

1077
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,666
Yeah. The Elephant's Might.

1078
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,500
How was that?

1079
01:27:58,958 --> 01:28:00,333
Lives up to its name.

1080
01:28:01,375 --> 01:28:03,375
With this energy,
I'm grilling all night long.

1081
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:07,166
Kid, is there anything else?

1082
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:08,875
What else?

1083
01:28:21,541 --> 01:28:22,708
Joe?

1084
01:28:23,375 --> 01:28:25,916
- Miw?
- Miw, wait for me!

1085
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,541
This ghost just twisted her neck!

1086
01:28:27,625 --> 01:28:28,916
Why the hell would you do that?

1087
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,083
Hey!

1088
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:33,208
Joe?

1089
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:34,875
Asia.

1090
01:28:38,416 --> 01:28:41,041
Hey, how was that? Fun? I did it myself.

1091
01:28:41,708 --> 01:28:44,166
Very scary. We almost died. Look.

1092
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:45,333
Or maybe I am dead, Miw?

1093
01:28:47,916 --> 01:28:49,750
So, how are things? Are you doing well?

1094
01:28:49,833 --> 01:28:50,791
Haven't seen you for a long time.

1095
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:54,166
Things are… going great, so far.

1096
01:28:55,833 --> 01:28:57,083
You?

1097
01:28:58,208 --> 01:28:59,083
Fine.

1098
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:04,375
Well…

1099
01:29:04,916 --> 01:29:07,208
I saw a grilled frog stall there.
See you guys in a moment.

1100
01:29:07,291 --> 01:29:08,458
Yeah, the famous one.

1101
01:29:13,833 --> 01:29:14,875
A little walk?

1102
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:15,791
Sure.

1103
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:25,666
Took you only two drinks.

1104
01:29:28,416 --> 01:29:29,416
Weak old man.

1105
01:29:29,958 --> 01:29:31,500
Hi. Where did the frog stall vendor go?

1106
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:33,541
He's lying over here.

1107
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:36,375
How many sticks would you like?

1108
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:39,041
- You're the one?
- Yeah.

1109
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:41,291
Sure, let me check them out.

1110
01:29:42,791 --> 01:29:46,166
Damn! Looks so delicious!

1111
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:48,791
You know Joe?

1112
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:50,166
Joe?

1113
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:53,250
Oh, that's my friend's ex-boyfriend.

1114
01:29:54,291 --> 01:29:55,375
Ex-boyfriend?

1115
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,375
Like, an old friend?

1116
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,166
Uncle.

1117
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:02,041
A boyfriend is a boyfriend.
A friend is a friend.

1118
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:03,750
Are you from, like,
a century ago or something?

1119
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:05,666
Boyfriends and girlfriends are in love.

1120
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:09,291
And when it gets a bit
too comfy, they'd be like…

1121
01:30:09,875 --> 01:30:11,250
That, too. You know?

1122
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:16,291
I'll take these two sticks,
Gramps. Please warm them for me.

1123
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:17,250
Yeah.

1124
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:23,291
You got that?

1125
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:26,208
Oh, what a slut!

1126
01:30:26,291 --> 01:30:29,666
With a man, your hands got so weak,
you can't even open a damn bottle.

1127
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:33,083
With me, you pry soda cans
open with your teeth.

1128
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:35,291
Right?

1129
01:30:35,375 --> 01:30:38,625
With your man, you're
so lively, giggling, and all that.

1130
01:30:38,708 --> 01:30:41,000
With me, your face
is as crooked as a foot.

1131
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:42,833
Want a shot at this?

1132
01:30:42,916 --> 01:30:44,500
Look, Gramps.

1133
01:30:44,583 --> 01:30:45,875
Is this what you call a slut?

1134
01:30:45,958 --> 01:30:48,458
Figure it out, Gramps.
You're so old after all.

1135
01:30:48,541 --> 01:30:53,083
Shocking! He just held her waist!

1136
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:55,583
Is this igniting an old flame?
Don't you think?

1137
01:30:55,666 --> 01:31:00,208
Do you think they'll make a return? Look!

1138
01:31:00,291 --> 01:31:01,875
What a proud slut my friend is!

1139
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:11,958
No! You burned my frogs!

1140
01:31:15,125 --> 01:31:16,291
I said warm them!

1141
01:31:16,791 --> 01:31:17,708
Gramps!

1142
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:19,791
Do you know what warm is?

1143
01:31:20,958 --> 01:31:21,875
Go home?

1144
01:31:24,666 --> 01:31:26,083
Who do you think I'm waiting for?

1145
01:31:26,166 --> 01:31:27,250
The frog.

1146
01:31:27,333 --> 01:31:28,333
I'm waiting for you, sis.

1147
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:29,541
Then go, sis.

1148
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:31,333
Pay up.

1149
01:31:31,416 --> 01:31:32,500
ANONG'S HOUSE

1150
01:31:32,583 --> 01:31:34,666
You burned it, Gramps. Give me a discount.

1151
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:36,250
Here it is.

1152
01:31:36,333 --> 01:31:37,500
Thank you.

1153
01:31:38,875 --> 01:31:40,750
Let's go. We're leaving.

1154
01:31:42,375 --> 01:31:43,291
See you later, Asia.

1155
01:31:44,458 --> 01:31:46,291
Hey, corn!

1156
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:47,750
- Wait for me.
- You're eating again?

1157
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:49,916
Again. Gotta eat again.

1158
01:32:01,458 --> 01:32:03,500
Are you free tomorrow?
Will you come see my exhibition?

1159
01:32:05,166 --> 01:32:06,083
Tomorrow?

1160
01:32:06,166 --> 01:32:07,916
Yeah. It's the last day.

1161
01:32:11,791 --> 01:32:12,625
Sure.

1162
01:32:15,208 --> 01:32:16,125
See you there.

1163
01:32:17,083 --> 01:32:18,000
See you there.

1164
01:32:20,625 --> 01:32:22,625
ANONG'S HOUSE

1165
01:32:37,875 --> 01:32:40,750
MIW THE MOMENT

1166
01:32:40,833 --> 01:32:43,916
THE IMPORTANT MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE

1167
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,125
Do you remember that day?

1168
01:33:12,208 --> 01:33:13,833
Who could forget?

1169
01:33:14,458 --> 01:33:15,791
We got drunk at Khao San,

1170
01:33:15,875 --> 01:33:17,625
then drove to Bang Saen.

1171
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:20,000
How did we make it out alive?

1172
01:33:20,791 --> 01:33:21,708
Who made the dare?

1173
01:33:21,791 --> 01:33:24,000
Who? You're really asking who?

1174
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:27,750
Who was the one that took
three tequila shots and shouted,

1175
01:33:27,833 --> 01:33:29,541
"Sea, Sea, Sea!"

1176
01:33:29,625 --> 01:33:30,750
for the whole restaurant to hear?

1177
01:33:31,916 --> 01:33:33,041
Was it worth it?

1178
01:33:36,916 --> 01:33:37,750
More than worth it.

1179
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,125
I won't get a chance
to do those things again.

1180
01:33:46,958 --> 01:33:49,333
We won't see the moon that large.

1181
01:33:54,583 --> 01:33:56,000
It was great, actually, back then.

1182
01:34:02,375 --> 01:34:03,416
Umm.

1183
01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:16,458
So, how are things? Any girlfriend?

1184
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:34,708
ANONG'S HOUSE

1185
01:34:47,791 --> 01:34:49,500
We can't take this anymore.

1186
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:51,333
What is going on?

1187
01:34:52,041 --> 01:34:55,166
If she could get this scary,
you wouldn't have needed us.

1188
01:34:55,958 --> 01:34:56,916
Huh?

1189
01:34:59,833 --> 01:35:00,916
I'm leaving!

1190
01:35:10,375 --> 01:35:13,125
Anong! Why are you doing this?

1191
01:35:15,541 --> 01:35:16,666
Isn't that how you scare?

1192
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:18,666
You told me to scare.

1193
01:35:19,708 --> 01:35:21,083
And by doing this, if…

1194
01:35:21,166 --> 01:35:22,291
other people actually find out
that you're a ghost,

1195
01:35:22,375 --> 01:35:23,625
what would you do?

1196
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:26,166
Well, I am a ghost.

1197
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:29,500
This is how ghosts are.
I can't be like a human.

1198
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,625
Can we talk calmly?

1199
01:35:51,833 --> 01:35:53,041
What's wrong?

1200
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:59,166
I'm a friend, not a girlfriend.

1201
01:36:03,083 --> 01:36:04,041
That's right.

1202
01:36:04,666 --> 01:36:07,208
How can a person and a ghost
be in a relationship?

1203
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:10,500
We can only meet when it's dark.

1204
01:36:10,583 --> 01:36:12,333
We can't go anywhere together.

1205
01:36:12,416 --> 01:36:14,458
We can't feed each other.

1206
01:36:14,541 --> 01:36:18,791
Can't touch. Can't marry. Can't have kids.

1207
01:36:18,875 --> 01:36:21,583
Can't do anything.
Everything is impossible.

1208
01:36:21,666 --> 01:36:24,250
Don't you understand? It's impossible!

1209
01:36:43,166 --> 01:36:44,416
Why can't it be possible?

1210
01:37:05,791 --> 01:37:09,708
I, Mr. Wisarut Techamahapaisarnkij,

1211
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:15,375
shall take an oath to be faithful
and respectful to Ms. Anong.

1212
01:37:16,958 --> 01:37:19,666
In times of happiness and hardship.

1213
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:24,625
In times of illness and wellness.

1214
01:37:31,541 --> 01:37:34,333
I, Miss Anong Yothanarong,

1215
01:37:35,708 --> 01:37:37,416
shall take an oath

1216
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,375
to be faithful to Mr. Wisarut.

1217
01:37:42,458 --> 01:37:44,958
In times of happiness and hardship.

1218
01:37:45,541 --> 01:37:47,791
In times of illness and wellness.

1219
01:37:50,416 --> 01:37:51,791
I shall love Ms. Anong

1220
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,125
for as long as I live.

1221
01:37:58,083 --> 01:37:59,250
And I…

1222
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:03,833
shall love Mr. Wisarut.

1223
01:38:08,208 --> 01:38:10,875
Even if my life has been parted from me.

1224
01:38:22,708 --> 01:38:24,708
Do you have anything
you wanted to do when you were alive

1225
01:38:24,791 --> 01:38:26,291
but didn't get the chance to do?

1226
01:38:26,375 --> 01:38:27,791
Many things.

1227
01:38:28,833 --> 01:38:30,125
Don't you regret it?

1228
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,958
In the past, I did.

1229
01:38:38,416 --> 01:38:39,958
But now, I don't.

1230
01:40:50,291 --> 01:40:55,750
There's no need to know
How our love works

1231
01:40:55,833 --> 01:41:01,541
There's no need
For the words that could explain

1232
01:41:01,625 --> 01:41:07,958
There's no need
To love like lovers, it's fine

1233
01:41:08,041 --> 01:41:10,583
As long as we understand each other

1234
01:41:10,666 --> 01:41:16,166
it's already beyond any words in the world

1235
01:41:19,125 --> 01:41:21,458
Eat, my sweet child.

1236
01:41:21,541 --> 01:41:23,541
Thank you, dear mother.

1237
01:41:32,291 --> 01:41:34,041
How unbelievable, speaking of it.

1238
01:41:34,125 --> 01:41:35,916
A loser like you

1239
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,041
finally ends up with a job like others.

1240
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:39,750
I'll take that as a compliment.

1241
01:41:39,833 --> 01:41:40,833
Of course!

1242
01:41:40,916 --> 01:41:43,750
My child is successful.
Any mom would be happy.

1243
01:41:44,291 --> 01:41:45,458
There's one more thing.

1244
01:41:45,541 --> 01:41:47,791
When will you get married?

1245
01:41:48,625 --> 01:41:50,041
Do you have a girlfriend?

1246
01:41:52,541 --> 01:41:53,750
- Huh?
- I do.

1247
01:41:53,833 --> 01:41:56,166
Hey, really? Who? Tell me!

1248
01:41:56,250 --> 01:41:58,583
Do I know her?
You've never brought her here.

1249
01:41:58,666 --> 01:41:59,583
A ghost.

1250
01:42:02,625 --> 01:42:05,208
Ah, the girl who plays the ghost, right?

1251
01:42:05,833 --> 01:42:07,083
But not the one with the intestine?

1252
01:42:07,166 --> 01:42:12,041
- What? No, Mom!
- Hey, she seems great!

1253
01:42:12,125 --> 01:42:14,250
A little makeup,

1254
01:42:14,333 --> 01:42:17,125
a little more smiling. Damn! Cute.

1255
01:42:17,208 --> 01:42:19,208
Good catch!

1256
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:25,541
Oh, Joe, are you into that crypto stuff?

1257
01:42:25,625 --> 01:42:27,458
Oh, Mom, that's too advanced for me.

1258
01:42:27,541 --> 01:42:28,791
I can't even count numbers properly.

1259
01:42:30,333 --> 01:42:33,125
Good, good.
Good thing my son is so stupid.

1260
01:42:33,958 --> 01:42:35,458
Did you see who they bankrupted?

1261
01:42:35,541 --> 01:42:36,708
Your brother, too.

1262
01:42:38,125 --> 01:42:38,958
Which one?

1263
01:42:39,041 --> 01:42:40,833
Who's it going to be? Top, of course!

1264
01:42:40,916 --> 01:42:43,208
Good thing he gave you that house.

1265
01:42:43,291 --> 01:42:45,250
Otherwise, crypto
would take that house, too.

1266
01:42:45,333 --> 01:42:46,458
Huh?

1267
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:48,291
You know a lot!

1268
01:42:48,375 --> 01:42:49,583
About the crypto market?

1269
01:42:49,666 --> 01:42:50,625
About gossip.

1270
01:42:54,708 --> 01:42:56,208
Start from the second floor…

1271
01:42:56,291 --> 01:42:58,291
Down to the first floor.

1272
01:42:58,375 --> 01:43:00,416
- Clear from the top, down to the bottom.
- That's right.

1273
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:01,541
How long does it take?

1274
01:43:01,625 --> 01:43:02,791
Not long, sir. Not long.

1275
01:43:03,541 --> 01:43:05,666
- Bro!
- What?

1276
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:06,958
What are you doing?

1277
01:43:07,041 --> 01:43:09,625
Well, I'm bulldozing this house.

1278
01:43:10,208 --> 01:43:11,791
And then I'll install a new building.

1279
01:43:11,875 --> 01:43:15,166
But the problem is that the soil
is very soft!

1280
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:16,208
It will take some time

1281
01:43:16,291 --> 01:43:17,750
because you have to install
a foundation pile deep underground, right?

1282
01:43:17,833 --> 01:43:18,791
Yes, sir.

1283
01:43:19,875 --> 01:43:22,833
But isn't this my house?
Didn't you give it to me?

1284
01:43:23,875 --> 01:43:25,125
Oh, yeah.

1285
01:43:26,166 --> 01:43:27,500
Gramps' will declaration day?

1286
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:35,125
Joe! An entire house!

1287
01:43:35,208 --> 01:43:36,416
Did you really think so?

1288
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:39,125
The deed is still in my name, Joe!

1289
01:43:40,083 --> 01:43:41,500
To the right.

1290
01:43:41,583 --> 01:43:43,500
Fast…

1291
01:43:44,375 --> 01:43:46,083
- Go get him!
- Let go!

1292
01:43:46,166 --> 01:43:47,083
You can't go in, sir!

1293
01:43:47,166 --> 01:43:48,083
Stop!

1294
01:43:48,791 --> 01:43:50,208
ANONG'S HOUSE

1295
01:43:55,791 --> 01:44:00,791
Stop! Damn you! Stop!

1296
01:44:02,458 --> 01:44:04,666
Bro! Tell them to stop!

1297
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:05,666
Brother!

1298
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:06,958
Tell them to stop!

1299
01:44:31,666 --> 01:44:37,166
TICKET

1300
01:45:19,583 --> 01:45:20,625
Thong Yip?

1301
01:45:22,833 --> 01:45:23,750
Thong Gon?

1302
01:45:27,041 --> 01:45:28,000
Anong!

1303
01:45:30,375 --> 01:45:31,333
Thong Yip?

1304
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:28,708
Can you hear me? Anong?

1305
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,541
I'm sorry.

1306
01:46:34,625 --> 01:46:36,333
I'm sorry!

1307
01:46:37,833 --> 01:46:39,666
Anong, can you hear me?

1308
01:46:41,666 --> 01:46:42,666
Anong!

1309
01:46:46,583 --> 01:46:47,833
I'm sorry!

1310
01:48:35,625 --> 01:48:37,083
Mistress!

1311
01:48:37,166 --> 01:48:39,166
Let go of her hands!

1312
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:40,916
- Hey!
- Let Anong go!

1313
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,250
Let go of her hands!

1314
01:48:42,333 --> 01:48:45,750
Let go! Let go of her hands!

1315
01:48:45,833 --> 01:48:48,791
Let go!

1316
01:48:50,166 --> 01:48:52,500
Anong! Let go of her!

1317
01:49:04,041 --> 01:49:05,583
Let go!

1318
01:51:24,166 --> 01:51:25,166
Anong.

1319
01:51:26,333 --> 01:51:27,666
I'm sorry, Anong.

1320
01:51:30,541 --> 01:51:32,500
Why does it have to be like this?

1321
01:51:33,791 --> 01:51:35,041
I'm sorry.

1322
01:51:35,708 --> 01:51:36,875
I'm sorry, Anong.

1323
01:51:47,083 --> 01:51:48,208
It's okay.

1324
01:51:53,916 --> 01:51:56,625
I'm glad to have met you.

1325
01:52:07,208 --> 01:52:09,708
I thank you very much.

1326
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:19,958
Thank you for not being afraid of me.

1327
01:52:25,625 --> 01:52:27,875
Thank you for being so kind to me.

1328
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:34,750
Thank you for making me…

1329
01:52:37,375 --> 01:52:39,125
feel alive again.

1330
01:52:44,541 --> 01:52:46,875
Thank you for making me…

1331
01:52:49,041 --> 01:52:51,250
not forget what love feels like.

1332
01:53:03,541 --> 01:53:06,000
You have to take good care of yourself.

1333
01:53:12,166 --> 01:53:13,708
Goodbye, Joe.

1334
01:53:13,791 --> 01:53:15,166
Anong!

1335
01:53:16,041 --> 01:53:19,166
Anong, I'm sorry! Anong!

1336
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:21,750
Anong, don't go! I'm sorry!

1337
01:53:22,541 --> 01:53:24,916
Come on, Anong! I'm sorry!
Please don't go, Anong.

1338
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,708
Anong, I'm sorry!

1339
01:54:08,625 --> 01:54:11,541
I took your remains
for a proper cremation.

1340
01:54:17,791 --> 01:54:21,166
This area is the nicest
in the whole temple, Anong.

1341
01:54:21,791 --> 01:54:24,083
Thong Yip and Thong Gon would love it too.

1342
01:54:27,291 --> 01:54:28,500
Oh yeah.

1343
01:54:29,166 --> 01:54:31,708
I brought some plumeria flowers
for decoration.

1344
01:54:32,708 --> 01:54:34,125
And don't worry about them withering.

1345
01:54:34,208 --> 01:54:36,458
I'll keep returning with fresh ones.

1346
01:54:51,125 --> 01:54:56,083
ANONG YOTHANARONG

1347
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,458
By the way, Anong!

1348
01:55:07,541 --> 01:55:10,541
I pitched the story of your house
to a gaming company.

1349
01:55:11,416 --> 01:55:13,541
ANONG

1350
01:55:14,583 --> 01:55:16,958
There are kind people
who are also interested.

1351
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:22,958
Actually, the game doesn't matter.

1352
01:55:26,791 --> 01:55:30,666
It's just a way for me
to see your face every day.

1353
01:55:48,083 --> 01:55:51,041
I'm rich now, Anong.

1354
01:55:51,125 --> 01:55:52,000
ANONG'S HOUSE
SHINING STAR HORROR GAME

1355
01:55:52,083 --> 01:55:54,833
Lots of people are buying the game.

1356
01:55:54,916 --> 01:55:57,666
Right now, you have fans
from around the world.

1357
01:55:58,541 --> 01:56:03,375
Thong Yip and Thong Gon are now
superstars, like they'd always wanted.

1358
01:56:03,958 --> 01:56:06,791
I can picture you smiling.

1359
01:56:08,958 --> 01:56:10,291
I miss you.

1360
01:56:12,333 --> 01:56:16,875
SIXTY YEARS LATER.

1361
01:57:03,041 --> 01:57:05,875
I'm dead. Let us continue.

1362
01:57:10,208 --> 01:57:11,291
Boo!

1363
01:59:37,166 --> 01:59:41,083
Even if I can't see you

1364
01:59:41,166 --> 01:59:46,041
I'd still wish to meet you in my dreams

1365
01:59:46,125 --> 01:59:50,083
So we could make love

1366
01:59:50,166 --> 01:59:52,791
It may be more joyful

1367
01:59:52,875 --> 01:59:55,375
Actually being with you in real life

1368
01:59:56,458 --> 02:00:00,125
But if only seeing was enough

1369
02:00:00,208 --> 02:00:05,000
Oh alas, never have we touched

1370
02:00:05,083 --> 02:00:09,333
For in my dreams, both of us

1371
02:00:09,416 --> 02:00:14,875
Caressed one another
Making love all night

1372
02:00:14,958 --> 02:00:18,041
Wish I'd see you in my dreams

1373
02:00:18,750 --> 02:00:23,291
As in there together, we'd be happy

1374
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,916
Which I'd dream seeing you every night

1375
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:34,500
As I prefer to dream, so delighted

1376
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:04,375
