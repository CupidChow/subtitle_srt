I thought someone here would know what it is.

182
00:18:07,603 --> 00:18:08,943
I've never seen this before.

183
00:18:08,943 --> 00:18:10,023
Where's Mochizuki?

184
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:11,573
They're all here.

185
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,533
He's not here.

186
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:28,883
Stop it.

187
00:18:31,713 --> 00:18:32,923
Stop panicking!

188
00:18:33,803 --> 00:18:36,633
Idiot! Don't use your fire powers in the room!

189
00:18:58,913 --> 00:19:00,453
2nd squad moving out.

190
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:02,083
3rd squad moving out.

191
00:19:03,002 --> 00:19:06,808
[Army General Staff Headquarters - Director General]
[Sudou Tsuguji]

192
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:07,963
Lord Sudou.

193
00:19:10,623 --> 00:19:14,253
If I got this, it means
we've a serious situation on our hands.

194
00:19:16,973 --> 00:19:19,093
Thank you for your time.

195
00:19:19,843 --> 00:19:20,933
I have something to show you.

196
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:26,578
[Ministry of the Imperial Household - Grand Steward]
[Kamomura Norio]

197
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:28,443
- Take Mr. Tsuruki to his room.
- Yes.

198
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:36,443
The insects who sleep in the Burial Grounds,

199
00:19:37,283 --> 00:19:39,493
all of them died agonizing deaths in battle.

200
00:19:39,493 --> 00:19:42,413
They're rebels who use their powers for evil.

201
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,743
They still hold a lingering attachment
and hatred for this world.

202
00:19:45,743 --> 00:19:48,543
Even after death, they retain tremendous power.

203
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:50,373
In other words, this insect

204
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:52,963
is a Grotesquerie that's unable to rest in peace.

205
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,633
You're right.

206
00:19:56,923 --> 00:20:00,763
It was predicted that the insects
would appear in the capital city.

207
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:07,143
I don't think this insect just appears by chance.

208
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,063
I think...

209
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:14,773
someone has exposed the Burial Grounds.

210
00:20:15,443 --> 00:20:18,403
Well, breaking the seal on purpose

211
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:21,653
has caused so many insects to be released.

212
00:20:22,363 --> 00:20:26,083
The Imperial Household Army has been
deployed to catch the insects.

213
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,203
But we still don't know who did it.

214
00:20:35,593 --> 00:20:37,503
We're conducting everything quietly

215
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,843
to prevent public confusion.

216
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:44,843
But we don't have enough manpower on our side.

217
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:47,183
I understand.

218
00:20:48,393 --> 00:20:50,983
As for the insects in the capital city,

219
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:54,193
the Anti-Grotesquerie Special Unit
will deal with them.

220
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,483
Pardon the intrusion.

221
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:03,153
This is Mr. Tsuruki from Tsuruki Trading.

222
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:05,823
It's an old trading company.

223
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,411
It's a trading company that's been
around since the beginning of the country.

224
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:10,833
He's a civilian with
no ties to government organizations

225
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,873
so he can move freely and collect information.

226
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:21,673
I'm Tsuruki Arata.

227
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:28,263
He doesn't have any 'gift'.

228
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:30,523
But he became president at a young age.

229
00:21:30,763 --> 00:21:35,193
His negotiating skills could help us a lot.

230
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:38,323
I look forward to working with you, Captain Kudou.

231
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:45,113
Thank you.

232
00:22:00,213 --> 00:22:01,803
Welcome home.

233
00:22:04,246 --> 00:22:07,053
I'm really sorry about this morning.

234
00:22:09,473 --> 00:22:10,893
My Lord...

235
00:22:13,643 --> 00:22:15,023
If I were to put myself in my Lord's position

236
00:22:16,273 --> 00:22:18,023
I wouldn't eat food made

237
00:22:18,023 --> 00:22:19,903
by someone you don't trust.

238
00:22:20,983 --> 00:22:22,653
I overstepped my boundaries.

239
00:22:23,403 --> 00:22:25,323
It feels like I'm forcing you to make amends.

240
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:26,573
It's not like that.

241
00:22:27,203 --> 00:22:28,533
It's because I'm not being thorough.

242
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:34,873
<i>The kimono is so tattered
that it can't even be called old.</i>

243
00:22:34,873 --> 00:22:36,713
<i>Her hands are covered in cracks</i>

244
00:22:37,463 --> 00:22:39,753
<i>It's hard to think of her as a
daughter of a prominent family.</i>

245
00:22:41,713 --> 00:22:44,883
<i>A really odd girl has arrived.</i>

246
00:22:47,053 --> 00:22:48,933
I'm going to take a bath before dinner.

247
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:51,013
I'm terribly sorry,
I haven't prepared the hot water...

248
00:22:51,013 --> 00:22:53,103
It's fine, no one else can prepare it.

249
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:02,733
The Saimori family posses
the gift to control the wind, right?

250
00:23:03,443 --> 00:23:04,693
Yes.

251
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:09,663
Then you've never seen
a bath like this before, have you?

252
00:23:38,523 --> 00:23:39,443
Inside the water?

253
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:43,903
It's a skill only the gifted can pull off.

254
00:23:45,983 --> 00:23:48,573
Yesterday's hot water was also from you?

255
00:23:50,203 --> 00:23:52,663
I'm sorry I didn't get to thank you.

256
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,873
Now is not the time to apologize.

257
00:23:56,873 --> 00:23:58,373
Why do you immediately apologize?

258
00:23:58,373 --> 00:24:00,043
- I'm sor...
- Stop apologizing.

259
00:24:01,213 --> 00:24:03,503
Excessive apologizing only cheapens it.

260
00:24:11,843 --> 00:24:16,223
I was just trying to be cautious this morning.

261
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:19,733
You can make breakfast tomorrow.

262
00:24:26,153 --> 00:24:27,073
But,

263
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:30,203
if you poison me, I won't let you off.

264
00:24:36,413 --> 00:24:37,293
Yes.

265
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:47,343
What's this?

266
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:51,723
There are herbs inside,
you have to add them every day.

267
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:55,643
Yes, my Lord.

268
00:25:01,983 --> 00:25:03,603
Call me when it's ready.

269
00:25:13,663 --> 00:25:16,703
<i>When you say you're a daughter from
the Saimori family,</i>

270
00:25:16,703 --> 00:25:20,083
<i>my Lord would surely think I have a gift.</i>

271
00:25:23,753 --> 00:25:26,463
<i>I'm not good enough for Lord Kudou.</i>

272
00:25:28,532 --> 00:25:30,539
<i>If Lord Kudou knows I don't have a gift</i>

273
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:34,473
<i>I'd probably be kicked out right away.</i>

274
00:25:40,723 --> 00:25:43,063
Kaya's Spirit-Sight gift has manifested.

275
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:46,273
Kaya, you were terrified of seeing
the Grotesqueries, weren't you?

276
00:25:46,273 --> 00:25:50,363
<i>Both of her parents have gifts, poor thing.</i>

277
00:25:50,823 --> 00:25:54,153
<i>You don't even have a gift.
You don't even have a gift.</i>

278
00:26:28,403 --> 00:26:31,023
<i>Up until now, unless I prepared it myself,</i>

279
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,113
Excuse me.

280
00:26:32,113 --> 00:26:34,113
<i>I wouldn't have any meal.</i>

281
00:26:34,863 --> 00:26:37,153
It's a nice day.

282
00:26:38,783 --> 00:26:41,873
<i>I've been doing it just to live every day.</i>

283
00:26:45,873 --> 00:26:48,753
<i>It might not be to Lord Kudou's taste.</i>

284
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:02,973
Good morning.

285
00:27:09,523 --> 00:27:10,903
Good morning.

286
00:27:34,173 --> 00:27:35,423
Let's eat.

287
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:38,843
Let's eat.

288
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:57,693
It's good.

289
00:28:01,743 --> 00:28:05,283
It's taste a little different from Yurie's.

290
00:28:25,183 --> 00:28:27,049
Thank you...

291
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:28,482
very much.

292
00:28:37,113 --> 00:28:38,993
Why are you crying?

293
00:28:42,203 --> 00:28:43,243
I'm really sorry.

294
00:28:48,163 --> 00:28:49,503
I told you, stop apologizing.

295
00:29:03,303 --> 00:29:06,013
It's the first time someone

296
00:29:09,103 --> 00:29:10,603
has praised my cooking.

297
00:29:14,313 --> 00:29:16,063
It made me so happy.

298
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:23,243
I'm sorry.

299
00:29:38,014 --> 00:29:40,368
Yurie I have a favour to ask.

300
00:29:40,763 --> 00:29:43,343
When I come back,
report to me on her day's routine.

301
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:47,683
I'll try to investigate the
Saimori family from the outside.

302
00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:50,813
Yes.

303
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:56,023
Have a nice trip.

304
00:29:57,903 --> 00:29:59,073
What?

305
00:30:06,203 --> 00:30:10,243
To the royal family,
who are the head of the gifted family,

306
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:12,493
a bloodline is a matter of great importance.

307
00:30:13,203 --> 00:30:16,833
The Tatsuishi family inherited
the gift to manipulate objects

308
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:20,093
and the Saimori family who can control the wind

309
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:23,513
are planning to form a marriage.

310
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:27,803
Mr. Kouji, which one do you like?

311
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:30,263
Mr. Kouji.

312
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:32,813
Which one do you like?

313
00:30:33,063 --> 00:30:36,443
I think both of them are great.

314
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:38,153
Is this one too bold?

315
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:42,863
That's not what we talked of before.

316
00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:46,363
We agreed that Kouji would marry Kaya.

317
00:30:46,363 --> 00:30:48,873
And Miyo was promised to our eldest son.

318
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:51,896
The day when the Kudou family abandons Miyo, I'll...

319
00:30:51,953 --> 00:30:55,083
Miyo's mother was a woman with a powerful gift.

320
00:30:55,663 --> 00:30:59,173
It's not certain that Miyo's child will not have any gift.

321
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:04,673
That's why you'll have to pay a
little more for the betrothal money.

322
00:31:05,553 --> 00:31:08,433
The money I paid to marry that girl's mother...

323
00:31:15,983 --> 00:31:17,433
I have to get it back.

324
00:31:21,153 --> 00:31:26,693
So, she was abused
because she didn't have a 'gift'.

325
00:31:27,443 --> 00:31:29,323
I guess it can't be help,
it's a family that inherits gifts.

326
00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:30,573
Please sign here.

327
00:31:30,873 --> 00:31:31,841
- Godou...
- Yes?

328
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:33,203
I didn't ask you to do any of this.

329
00:31:33,373 --> 00:31:35,913
I'm faster and more capable than an informer.

330
00:31:36,873 --> 00:31:37,713
Look.

331
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:38,713
Have you seen this?

332
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:43,593
[Mother - Usuba Sumi]

333
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:46,963
Come here.

334
00:31:49,013 --> 00:31:51,223
Usuba Sumi is Miyo's mother?

335
00:31:52,223 --> 00:31:53,853
She's from the Usuba family.

336
00:31:54,263 --> 00:31:56,183
I also did some research on the Usuba family.

337
00:31:56,183 --> 00:31:58,183
But I couldn't find anything.

338
00:31:59,393 --> 00:32:01,393
The whole family has gone into hiding.

339
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:05,653
They all have the gift that interferes with people's minds.

340
00:32:06,323 --> 00:32:07,613
Mr. Tsuruki.

341
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:11,613
I heard you've completed a
security plan for the capital city.

342
00:32:12,993 --> 00:32:14,953
Please wait at the information desk.

343
00:32:21,543 --> 00:32:23,753
Why do you know about the Usuba family?

344
00:32:24,003 --> 00:32:25,293
Because of my work,

345
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:27,906
I had a lot of opportunities to talk to
people locally and from around the world.

346
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:30,513
Whether it's rumours or truths,

347
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:32,053
I've heard everything.

348
00:32:33,803 --> 00:32:35,513
What do you mean by interfering with people's minds?

349
00:32:36,313 --> 00:32:39,813
They can make you hallucinate, a clairvoyant,

350
00:32:39,813 --> 00:32:41,393
manipulate consciousness and memory.

351
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:44,403
It's a gift that has an effect on the human mind.

352
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,823
I've never heard of such a strange gift.

353
00:32:47,283 --> 00:32:49,943
I'm curious if Mr. Kudou is their match.

354
00:32:49,943 --> 00:32:52,033
I meant no offense.

355
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:54,993
I see.

356
00:32:59,953 --> 00:33:01,713
But I was really surprised.

357
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:05,293
Mr. Kudou, who is rumored to be as cold as ice to women,

358
00:33:07,593 --> 00:33:10,213
is interested in his fiancee.

359
00:33:13,303 --> 00:33:15,433
<i>Yurie, what did Miyo do?</i>

360
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:17,723
<i>After she helped me with some work,</i>

361
00:33:17,723 --> 00:33:19,563
<i>in order not to be noticed</i>

362
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:22,983
<i>she spent the entire day repairing
rips on her kimono.</i>

363
00:33:23,483 --> 00:33:26,733
<i>Also, she doesn't seem to be sleeping very well.</i>

364
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:38,776
On my next day off, I'd like to go out to the city.

365
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:42,963
Yes.

366
00:33:43,753 --> 00:33:44,963
Do you want to come along?

367
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:50,173
You haven't gone outside since you came here.

368
00:33:57,353 --> 00:33:58,893
But I can't go.

369
00:34:00,643 --> 00:34:03,983
I have nothing to do and I'm afraid
I'm going to bother you...

370
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,616
If it happens, it happens.

371
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:07,233
If you don't want to, that's fine.

372
00:34:07,233 --> 00:34:08,733
No, I didn't mean that...

373
00:34:08,903 --> 00:34:10,523
Then it's settled.

374
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:25,083
<i>I was never allowed to step out of
the Saimori house,</i>

375
00:34:25,923 --> 00:34:28,213
<i>so I don't know anything about the city.</i>

376
00:34:30,213 --> 00:34:33,343
<i>I hope I don't do something to embarrass Lord Kudou.</i>

377
00:34:39,303 --> 00:34:42,183
You don't have to do so much.

378
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,523
What are you talking about?

379
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:48,733
If the buds are in front of you,
you want to make them bloom.

380
00:34:49,563 --> 00:34:51,023
Sit down.

381
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,573
Hold this.

382
00:35:02,283 --> 00:35:05,373
Oh, the cracks have gotten a lot better.

383
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:07,833
Now that you mention it,

384
00:35:08,213 --> 00:35:10,843
the herbs may have worked.

385
00:35:11,173 --> 00:35:12,503
Herbs?

386
00:35:13,003 --> 00:35:16,343
Lord Kudou told me to put it in the bath every time.

387
00:35:23,893 --> 00:35:28,603
Young Master has always disliked
herbal baths since he was a child.

388
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:32,193
Ah, so it's for me...

389
00:35:33,613 --> 00:35:35,283
Let's make you look prettier.

390
00:35:36,323 --> 00:35:38,203
Okay.

391
00:35:42,413 --> 00:35:43,533
It's okay.

392
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:46,833
You don't have to run away.

393
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,833
<i>I'm cunning.</i>

394
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:50,253
Look at me.

395
00:35:51,173 --> 00:35:52,423
<i>I don't have a gift.</i>

396
00:35:53,213 --> 00:35:56,263
<i>Even though I am aware that
I don't have the right to accept it,</i>

397
00:35:57,383 --> 00:35:58,843
<i>I'm afraid of being hated.</i>

398
00:35:58,843 --> 00:36:01,223
I'm sorry I'll wipe it off.

399
00:36:01,223 --> 00:36:03,393
Now it's time to put on lipstick.

400
00:36:10,023 --> 00:36:11,853
Thank you for waiting.

401
00:36:14,403 --> 00:36:16,363
Thank you for waiting.

402
00:36:18,573 --> 00:36:20,033
I'm sorry.

403
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:25,953
Let's go.

404
00:36:27,043 --> 00:36:28,203
Good morning.

405
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:30,583
Good morning.

406
00:36:33,793 --> 00:36:35,543
Welcome, Mr. Kudou.

407
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,133
I'll be in your care.

408
00:36:40,553 --> 00:36:42,343
Regarding your request from our prior call,

409
00:36:42,343 --> 00:36:44,513
we've chosen a few that meet the criteria.

410
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:46,683
Please come in.

411
00:36:49,983 --> 00:36:51,273
I'll hold it for you.

412
00:36:52,063 --> 00:36:55,693
Young Master Kudou finally has reached that age.

413
00:36:56,653 --> 00:36:58,823
It's not like that.

414
00:37:01,073 --> 00:37:03,993
This is the first time you've brought a woman here.

415
00:37:04,953 --> 00:37:07,033
Don't mix one thing with another.

416
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,913
Let's go inside.

417
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,503
Good afternoon.

418
00:37:16,003 --> 00:37:17,043
Welcome.

419
00:37:34,103 --> 00:37:35,193
Do you like it?

420
00:37:35,193 --> 00:37:36,023
Yes.

421
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:40,573
No, I just feel a little nostalgic.

422
00:37:42,573 --> 00:37:45,663
This kimono reminds me of
one that belonged to my mother.

423
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:04,303
What was your mother like?

424
00:38:06,546 --> 00:38:07,394
I had one.

425
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:09,613
The one lives with the Saimori
family is your stepmother, right?

426
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:13,118
Just now you mentioned your mother's kimono.

427
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:34,043
My mother passed away when I was two.

428
00:38:36,963 --> 00:38:39,383
I barely remember her,

429
00:38:40,593 --> 00:38:42,843
but I remember the sakura-colored kimono

430
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:46,513
and her long black hair.

431
00:38:49,353 --> 00:38:50,303
I see.

432
00:38:51,353 --> 00:38:53,063
So you resemble your mother.

433
00:38:57,273 --> 00:38:59,363
My Lord, who do you resemble more?

434
00:39:01,073 --> 00:39:03,363
People say I resemble my mother.

435
00:39:03,943 --> 00:39:05,033
I don't really know.

436
00:39:08,663 --> 00:39:11,783
What do you mean?

437
00:39:16,293 --> 00:39:19,333
She's what I'd call a social butterfly.

438
00:39:20,003 --> 00:39:21,963
She hardly ever stays at home.

439
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:24,713
My sister and I were brought up by Yurie.

440
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:30,643
As far as I'm concerned,

441
00:39:32,263 --> 00:39:34,103
the definition of a mother is very vague to me.

442
00:39:36,983 --> 00:39:38,523
We're the same.

443
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,063
I'm really sorry.

444
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:43,063
I shouldn't have said that.

445
00:39:43,063 --> 00:39:45,733
Raise your head,
you don't need to feel small.

446
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:51,203
Rather than apologize,
I want you to speak your mind.

447
00:39:51,663 --> 00:39:53,123
I'll be happier.

448
00:39:56,043 --> 00:39:59,833
<i>The truth is, I'm not in a position
to raise my head.</i>

449
00:40:00,873 --> 00:40:01,923
<i>But,</i>

450
00:40:03,753 --> 00:40:05,553
<i>I can't help but wish for it.</i>

451
00:40:07,206 --> 00:40:12,466
<i>To spend more time with this man.</i>

452
00:40:15,393 --> 00:40:16,683
That's better.

453
00:40:51,923 --> 00:40:54,343
So, have you been sleeping well lately?

454
00:40:57,313 --> 00:40:58,223
Yes.

455
00:41:04,903 --> 00:41:06,323
Show me.

456
00:41:06,323 --> 00:41:08,451
What's this?

457
00:41:08,475 --> 00:41:09,823
It's shiny.

458
00:41:09,823 --> 00:41:12,153
- It's glittering.
- It's blue.

459
00:41:12,613 --> 00:41:13,953
Are you all right?

460
00:41:18,703 --> 00:41:21,663
<i>The royal family has long been
divided on who will succeed the family.</i>

461
00:41:22,503 --> 00:41:24,123
<i>16 years ago,</i>

462
00:41:25,003 --> 00:41:28,923
<i>the successor to the Emperor,
Lord Takaihito was finally born.</i>

463
00:41:29,963 --> 00:41:31,883
<i>The Kudou family,
as the leader of the gifted families</i>

464
00:41:31,883 --> 00:41:33,683
<i>has always been in contact with the royal family.</i>

465
00:41:34,343 --> 00:41:38,643
<i>I've been Lord Takaihito's playmate
since he was a child.</i>

466
00:41:42,063 --> 00:41:44,353
An insect has made it's appearance in the city.

467
00:41:44,353 --> 00:41:46,363
But it's been retrieved and
returned to the Burial Grounds.

468
00:41:47,113 --> 00:41:50,113
So far, no civilians were harmed.

469
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,403
Kiyoka, aren't you scared?

470
00:41:56,913 --> 00:41:58,413
Your Highness.

471
00:42:04,503 --> 00:42:06,213
Although still incomplete

472
00:42:07,043 --> 00:42:08,793
I received a Divine Revelation.

473
00:42:13,093 --> 00:42:14,383
And that is?

474
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:18,803
My father's death is imminent.

475
00:42:20,013 --> 00:42:24,063
That was probably the last revelation for now.

476
00:42:35,783 --> 00:42:37,033
Kiyoka.

477
00:42:40,663 --> 00:42:41,873
Don't die.

478
00:42:47,003 --> 00:42:49,213
That's why we're here.

479
00:42:50,843 --> 00:42:52,133
It's a promise.

480
00:42:55,763 --> 00:42:56,553
Don't die.

481
00:43:00,053 --> 00:43:01,563
Yes, Your Highness.

482
00:43:07,143 --> 00:43:10,733
What happens in the Burial Grounds

483
00:43:11,483 --> 00:43:18,243
will bring war and suffering to the capital city.

484
00:43:20,663 --> 00:43:23,913
Kudou Kiyoka.

485
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:31,463
The Anti-Grotesquerie Special Unit
must act as a shield

486
00:43:33,883 --> 00:43:41,303
to protect the people.

487
00:43:47,353 --> 00:43:48,813
Thank you for waiting.

488
00:43:49,233 --> 00:43:50,853
Thank you very much.

489
00:43:51,563 --> 00:43:53,483
You finally found a good place.

490
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,363
I'm going to get some ingredients.

491
00:43:56,363 --> 00:43:58,113
Can you wait a minute?

492
00:43:58,533 --> 00:43:59,573
Okay.

493
00:44:00,993 --> 00:44:03,323
<i>Ever since Lord Kudou took me out to the city</i>

494
00:44:03,323 --> 00:44:04,913
<i>I've been thinking.</i>

495
00:44:05,873 --> 00:44:09,873
<i>What can I do to repay him.</i>

496
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:11,543
Sister.

497
00:44:15,343 --> 00:44:18,383
I'm surprised you're still alive.

498
00:44:20,013 --> 00:44:21,893
Kaya, let's go home.

499
00:44:26,103 --> 00:44:28,983
You're still walking around in
those filthy clothes.

500
00:44:28,983 --> 00:44:31,063
Have you been abandoned by Lord Kudou?

501
00:44:32,853 --> 00:44:34,523
I suppose it's better because you're still alive.

502
00:44:35,823 --> 00:44:36,653
I...

503
00:44:41,863 --> 00:44:43,743
You dare to talk back to me?

504
00:44:47,163 --> 00:44:50,373
A useless person does not suit Lord Kudou.

505
00:44:50,873 --> 00:44:51,793
You don't even have a gift.

506
00:44:53,673 --> 00:44:55,923
<i>I can't cry here.</i>

507
00:44:57,463 --> 00:45:00,303
<i>If I show my weakness,</i>

508
00:45:00,303 --> 00:45:02,053
<i>it'll only make her happy.</i>

509
00:45:06,013 --> 00:45:08,063
I sincerely apologize.

510
00:45:09,983 --> 00:45:10,853
Kaya.

511
00:45:11,313 --> 00:45:12,813
What a boring woman.

512
00:45:16,573 --> 00:45:17,773
Be careful.

513
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:30,913
Slowly breathe in,
concentrate on breathing out.

514
00:45:50,353 --> 00:45:51,603
It's okay now.

515
00:45:53,433 --> 00:45:54,813
The nightmare will soon be over.

516
00:45:58,903 --> 00:46:00,483
Lady Miyo.

517
00:46:04,823 --> 00:46:06,113
I'm fine.

518
00:46:07,703 --> 00:46:10,873
Thank you for helping me.

519
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:14,043
Thank you very much.

520
00:46:21,093 --> 00:46:23,086
Lord Kudou.

521
00:46:24,263 --> 00:46:26,343
What brings you here today?

522
00:46:27,723 --> 00:46:31,103
I want to clarify the relationship
between the Kudou and Saimori families.

523
00:46:32,473 --> 00:46:33,353
What do you mean?

524
00:46:34,103 --> 00:46:37,313
Normally, marriages for people like us
are always political.

525
00:46:38,653 --> 00:46:41,363
It is predicated on a
predetermined level of interest.

526
00:46:43,841 --> 00:46:50,386
But I'm a little reluctant to give you
any kind of compensation.

527
00:46:51,873 --> 00:46:52,913
That is...

528
00:46:52,913 --> 00:46:54,293
Don't you understand?

529
00:47:02,923 --> 00:47:04,383
I have a condition.

530
00:47:05,463 --> 00:47:08,593
If you sincerely apologize to Miyo,

531
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:11,053
I will pay you a lot of money.

532
00:47:12,103 --> 00:47:15,103
Apologize?

533
00:47:15,103 --> 00:47:18,313
I won't force you,
I'll just cut our family ties.

534
00:47:22,363 --> 00:47:23,733
Could you,

535
00:47:25,863 --> 00:47:27,363
let me think about it.

536
00:47:27,363 --> 00:47:28,953
I won't wait long.

537
00:47:32,623 --> 00:47:34,293
Which side are you on, Mr. Kouji?

538
00:47:34,293 --> 00:47:35,493
I told you.

539
00:47:46,053 --> 00:47:47,593
Mother, who is he?

540
00:47:47,593 --> 00:47:48,843
That girl's fiancé.

541
00:47:52,763 --> 00:47:55,183
What a beautiful man.

542
00:48:14,283 --> 00:48:16,293
Are you okay?

543
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:20,623
I'm sorry.

544
00:48:21,543 --> 00:48:23,713
Mother, it hurts.

545
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:26,133
- How dare you call someone a thief?
- Young Miss.

546
00:48:26,133 --> 00:48:27,593
Young Miss, Young Miss.

547
00:48:27,593 --> 00:48:30,473
- You burned my mother's kimono.
- Please don't.

548
00:48:30,473 --> 00:48:32,843
This family doesn't need anything
from that woman!

549
00:48:33,183 --> 00:48:34,433
I'm sorry.

550
00:48:35,763 --> 00:48:36,663
<i>Let me go.</i>

551
00:48:36,688 --> 00:48:37,510
I'm sorry.

552
00:48:37,649 --> 00:48:39,779
Hana! You're fired!

553
00:48:43,483 --> 00:48:45,773
No!

554
00:48:45,903 --> 00:48:49,283
No! You burned my mother's kimono!

555
00:48:49,283 --> 00:48:50,443
Shut up!

556
00:48:50,743 --> 00:48:53,413
No, I don't want the
warehouse door to close!

557
00:48:53,743 --> 00:48:57,453
Let me out! Open the door!

558
00:48:58,543 --> 00:48:59,793
I'm coming in.

559
00:49:01,873 --> 00:49:03,213
Miyo.

560
00:49:05,096 --> 00:49:05,963
Miyo.

561
00:49:07,463 --> 00:49:08,463
Miyo.

562
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:12,633
I'm sorry.

563
00:49:20,233 --> 00:49:21,353
<i>Cold hands.</i>

564
00:49:21,353 --> 00:49:24,813
No, I don't want the
warehouse door to close.

565
00:49:26,903 --> 00:49:28,823
All the worries you're holding in,

566
00:49:31,146 --> 00:49:32,823
will eventually disappear.

567
00:49:58,553 --> 00:50:01,143
<i>I have to tell the truth.</i>

568
00:50:02,893 --> 00:50:04,193
<i>But...</i>

569
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:15,533
Lady Miyo, is this a good time?

570
00:50:16,323 --> 00:50:18,493
You have a visitor.

571
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:29,343
<i>I hate</i>

572
00:50:30,543 --> 00:50:31,963
<i>myself.</i>

573
00:50:46,193 --> 00:50:48,363
You've grown up.

574
00:50:49,403 --> 00:50:52,283
I'm married.

575
00:50:53,993 --> 00:50:56,113
I have two children.

576
00:50:57,323 --> 00:51:00,663
I live with my husband
and we both work in the fields.

577
00:51:03,793 --> 00:51:04,913
I see.

578
00:51:06,373 --> 00:51:08,003
You've found your happiness.

579
00:51:10,583 --> 00:51:11,673
I'm glad.

580
00:51:16,053 --> 00:51:17,723
Young Miss.

581
00:51:20,263 --> 00:51:22,103
When you were facing a hard times...

582
00:51:22,763 --> 00:51:25,683
I'm deeply sorry I wasn't there for you.

583
00:51:27,773 --> 00:51:29,943
I've always felt ashamed to meet you.

584
00:51:30,523 --> 00:51:33,363
I couldn't do anything to help and now I...

585
00:51:35,481 --> 00:51:37,703
But the reason I still came here,

586
00:51:38,703 --> 00:51:41,453
is because I wanted
to witness Young Miss' happiness.

587
00:51:44,703 --> 00:51:48,623
I really wanted to see

588
00:51:49,423 --> 00:51:52,293
my precious, precious Young Miss

589
00:51:54,253 --> 00:51:57,473
who had been through so much

590
00:51:58,205 --> 00:52:00,053
to smile happily.

591
00:52:04,563 --> 00:52:05,853
Hana.

592
00:52:10,903 --> 00:52:12,403
I...

593
00:52:14,773 --> 00:52:17,363
I don't have any gift.

594
00:52:20,703 --> 00:52:22,033
That's why...

595
00:52:23,783 --> 00:52:28,753
That's why I'm not worthy
of being his wife.

596
00:52:31,226 --> 00:52:34,003
I can't be here forever.

597
00:52:39,343 --> 00:52:40,843
Young Miss.

598
00:52:43,683 --> 00:52:47,773
Do you understand
how I was able to come here

599
00:52:48,143 --> 00:52:50,943
even though my relationship

600
00:52:50,943 --> 00:52:52,353
with the Saimori family had ended?

601
00:53:04,823 --> 00:53:07,203
When I heard the voice
of a man coming out from this,

602
00:53:07,203 --> 00:53:09,123
I was honestly surprised.

603
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:16,093
They say it's the voice
of a member of Lord Kudou's unit.

604
00:53:18,343 --> 00:53:22,183
Afterward, Lord Kudou
came to our village to pick me up.

605
00:53:24,263 --> 00:53:25,683
Lord Kudou?

606
00:53:30,813 --> 00:53:32,523
Young Miss.

607
00:53:34,103 --> 00:53:36,443
Lord Kudou is a really good man.

608
00:53:54,213 --> 00:53:55,333
My Lord.

609
00:53:58,343 --> 00:54:00,883
What... what is it?

610
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:02,123
My Lord.

611
00:54:03,188 --> 00:54:08,568
There's something I haven't been able to tell you.

612
00:54:17,733 --> 00:54:19,153
I...

613
00:54:22,573 --> 00:54:24,323
I don't posses any gift.

614
00:54:25,743 --> 00:54:26,823
While I inherited

615
00:54:26,823 --> 00:54:28,663
my parents' bloodline,

616
00:54:28,663 --> 00:54:30,203
I'm useless.

617
00:54:31,743 --> 00:54:34,293
I only went to elementary school.

618
00:54:36,463 --> 00:54:40,633
I was working as a servant in my parents' house.

619
00:54:42,883 --> 00:54:44,343
I'm not educated,

620
00:54:45,433 --> 00:54:48,343
and I can't do anything
a prominent family's daughter can.

621
00:54:49,973 --> 00:54:51,013
So...

622
00:54:52,023 --> 00:54:55,393
I'm really not good enough for my Lord.

623
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,693
It's because of my own shortsightedness,

624
00:55:04,443 --> 00:55:06,533
I've been hiding this from you.

625
00:55:09,743 --> 00:55:11,743
I don't want to be thrown out.

626
00:55:15,163 --> 00:55:17,833
If you tell me to die, I'll die.

627
00:55:18,173 --> 00:55:20,633
If you tell me to leave, I'll leave.

628
00:55:29,473 --> 00:55:30,433
I made this

629
00:55:30,433 --> 00:55:33,013
with an apology and gratitude in mind.

630
00:55:34,433 --> 00:55:35,973
If you don't want it,

631
00:55:35,973 --> 00:55:38,983
you could throw it away or burn it.

632
00:55:46,193 --> 00:55:48,493
Thank you for taking care of me all this time.

633
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:01,713
How long are you going to stay like that?

634
00:56:14,763 --> 00:56:16,523
I don't care about the gift.

635
00:56:17,313 --> 00:56:19,943
It's not necessary between us.

636
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,813
It will be problematic if you leave.

637
00:56:25,113 --> 00:56:27,993
Because after some time, I plan to...

638
00:56:30,663 --> 00:56:32,743
formally become engaged to you.

639
00:56:36,293 --> 00:56:38,753
Don't you want to continue living here with me?

640
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:44,713
I'd like to stay here.

641
00:56:46,213 --> 00:56:48,883
As long as you give me your permission...

642
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:52,013
There's no such thing as permission.

643
00:56:53,303 --> 00:56:55,183
I'm the one who wants you to stay

644
00:56:56,223 --> 00:56:57,973
not anyone else.

645
00:57:11,363 --> 00:57:12,453
Could you tie my hair?

646
00:57:31,133 --> 00:57:32,513
It's a beautiful color.

647
00:57:33,763 --> 00:57:35,183
Thank you, Miyo.

648
00:57:38,442 --> 00:57:39,302
You're welcome.

649
00:57:45,153 --> 00:57:48,693
I won't be returning home as often
in the upcoming days.

650
00:57:49,903 --> 00:57:51,283
I understand.

651
00:58:05,543 --> 00:58:08,843
Greetings, Father.

652
00:58:12,843 --> 00:58:14,683
Come in.

653
00:58:21,313 --> 00:58:23,603
Come closer.

654
00:58:37,243 --> 00:58:39,033
I know...

655
00:58:40,413 --> 00:58:46,833
what kind of face you would make.

656
00:58:48,213 --> 00:58:51,753
Since childhood

657
00:58:52,713 --> 00:59:00,353
you've been forced to carry
the entire weight of this country.

658
00:59:03,143 --> 00:59:05,563
I don't understand.

659
00:59:07,983 --> 00:59:10,943
Whether you like it or not,

660
00:59:11,863 --> 00:59:17,573
you'll understand it one day.

661
00:59:18,156 --> 00:59:25,786
I've done a lot of things along the way.

662
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:32,503
In the future,

663
00:59:35,173 --> 00:59:41,223
you have to continue to do all of them.

664
00:59:43,763 --> 00:59:44,813
Yes.

665
00:59:45,143 --> 00:59:50,523
Kudou from the Anti-Grotesquerie Special Unit,

666
00:59:52,153 --> 00:59:58,153
I have to thank him, too.

667
01:00:00,453 --> 01:00:01,623
Yes.

668
01:00:04,453 --> 01:00:05,663
Be careful.

669
01:00:06,243 --> 01:00:08,163
It's like they're infected with the insects.

670
01:00:11,003 --> 01:00:11,963
Please step back.

671
01:00:12,633 --> 01:00:15,003
The insects seem to be particularly responsive
to gifted people.

672
01:00:15,003 --> 01:00:17,263
I've tried everything.

673
01:00:17,263 --> 01:00:19,223
As long as you don't get the insects out of their body

674
01:00:19,223 --> 01:00:20,383
our skills are not going to work.

675
01:00:21,133 --> 01:00:23,643
Instead, you'll hurt yourself.

676
01:00:23,973 --> 01:00:26,183
Will the insects die if you
kill the person?

677
01:00:27,393 --> 01:00:28,353
How are they transmitted?

678
01:00:28,773 --> 01:00:30,103
I don't know.

679
01:00:30,523 --> 01:00:35,483
The insects can be said to attach themselves
to the mind in order to manipulate the body.

680
01:00:39,033 --> 01:00:41,823
There is no way to just kill off the insects...

681
01:00:43,993 --> 01:00:47,163
Are you're going to stay here again
and leave Lady Miyo alone?

682
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:49,293
It's none of your business.

683
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:55,093
Who was the one who sent
a familiar to Mrs. Hana?

684
01:00:55,093 --> 01:00:57,673
That's...

685
01:00:58,053 --> 01:00:59,673
What?

686
01:00:59,593 --> 01:01:00,593
Thank you.

687
01:01:00,263 --> 01:01:01,803
Thank you.

688
01:01:01,803 --> 01:01:03,803
I appreciate your honesty.

689
01:01:04,303 --> 01:01:07,523
There are generals who tremble when
they hear the captain's name.

690
01:01:07,523 --> 01:01:08,773
That's because...

691
01:01:08,773 --> 01:01:11,103
The captain used his saber
to give the Grotesqueries skull a...

692
01:01:12,653 --> 01:01:13,813
I wish you could have seen,

693
01:01:13,813 --> 01:01:16,193
how his murderous face looked like a Hannya*.
(*A Noh theater mask)

694
01:01:17,613 --> 01:01:18,693
Who's a Hannya?

695
01:01:21,283 --> 01:01:24,203
I was talking about how cool you were,
like a Hannya.

696
01:01:24,663 --> 01:01:27,083
I was explaining it to Lady Miyo.

697
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:34,423
Well... welcome back.

698
01:01:36,963 --> 01:01:38,593
What brings you here?

699
01:01:38,843 --> 01:01:42,433
I... I was going to give it to you
at the entrance...

700
01:01:42,763 --> 01:01:47,183
It's just... I'm worried that
you haven't eaten properly.

701
01:01:49,223 --> 01:01:49,893
Thank you.

702
01:01:50,523 --> 01:01:52,983
Can we have some too?

703
01:01:53,233 --> 01:01:55,193
Pleases, go ahead.

704
01:01:55,563 --> 01:01:56,443
Let's eat!

705
01:01:56,443 --> 01:01:57,443
Let's eat!

706
01:01:59,903 --> 01:02:01,653
This is for you, Mr. Godou.

707
01:02:02,613 --> 01:02:03,703
For me?

708
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:08,703
Next time, I'd like to
properly thank you for Mrs. Hana...

709
01:02:08,703 --> 01:02:09,743
Captain.

710
01:02:11,163 --> 01:02:13,163
He's starting to smile lately.

711
01:02:13,873 --> 01:02:16,503
Oh, that's so cute.

712
01:02:16,503 --> 01:02:17,293
Thank you.

713
01:02:18,173 --> 01:02:20,843
It's a back you want to hug.

714
01:02:21,133 --> 01:02:22,263
Huh?

715
01:02:22,593 --> 01:02:24,633
Everyone here feels that way.

716
01:02:25,223 --> 01:02:26,973
They all admire that man.

717
01:02:29,143 --> 01:02:30,513
Captain I'll do it!

718
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:31,603
It's not me!

719
01:02:32,063 --> 01:02:33,643
It's you!

720
01:02:51,793 --> 01:02:53,123
Are you okay?

721
01:02:57,713 --> 01:03:00,503
Are you okay? What's wrong?

722
01:03:01,843 --> 01:03:02,803
Can you hear me?

723
01:03:03,803 --> 01:03:04,763
Can you stand up?

724
01:03:16,103 --> 01:03:18,273
How wonderful!

725
01:03:18,273 --> 01:03:19,863
Is this a maple leaf pattern?

726
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:20,983
Yes, it is.

727
01:03:20,983 --> 01:03:22,863
This one has a floral pattern...

728
01:03:22,863 --> 01:03:24,743
- Excuse me...
- with small stripes.

729
01:03:24,743 --> 01:03:27,113
I can't accept this.

730
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:29,913
What are you saying Lady Miyo.

731
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:33,743
This is the thoughtfulness, sincerity and
generosity of the Young Master.

732
01:03:34,123 --> 01:03:36,123
You can't turn him down.

733
01:03:36,123 --> 01:03:37,543
I'm sorry.

734
01:03:37,963 --> 01:03:40,333
Which one do you like?

735
01:03:40,753 --> 01:03:43,293
I...

736
01:03:45,513 --> 01:03:46,923
Which one is it?

737
01:03:49,303 --> 01:03:50,853
- This one.
- That one?

738
01:03:50,853 --> 01:03:54,393
Young Master also instantly fell in love
with that one.

739
01:03:54,393 --> 01:03:55,523
Cherry blossoms?

740
01:03:55,523 --> 01:03:56,983
My Lord?

741
01:03:58,523 --> 01:03:59,353
And...

742
01:04:00,313 --> 01:04:01,483
This one.

743
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:09,783
Young Master bought a comb?

744
01:04:09,783 --> 01:04:12,783
When a man gives a comb to a woman,

745
01:04:13,283 --> 01:04:15,663
that usually means a proposal.

746
01:04:16,753 --> 01:04:19,043
It just he didn't give it to her directly...

747
01:04:20,793 --> 01:04:22,713
Young Master wants Lady Miyo

748
01:04:22,713 --> 01:04:25,843
to receive whatever she need wholeheartedly.

749
01:04:32,473 --> 01:04:34,303
Which one would you like to see next?

750
01:04:34,593 --> 01:04:35,593
I'll do it.

751
01:04:35,853 --> 01:04:37,353
I'll do it.

752
01:04:40,603 --> 01:04:43,693
Ms. Yurie, take a look at the belt,

753
01:04:43,693 --> 01:04:45,863
it's the second one in front of you.

754
01:04:46,233 --> 01:04:48,443
It has a pine, bamboo and plum pattern.

755
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:51,566
It has a distinguished appearance.

756
01:04:52,163 --> 01:04:54,873
I'm sure it'll look good on Lady Miyo.

757
01:04:55,663 --> 01:04:59,123
The other thing is... this one over here...

758
01:04:59,123 --> 01:05:00,463
Lady Miyo?

759
01:05:07,463 --> 01:05:08,843
Lady Miyo!

760
01:05:11,473 --> 01:05:14,803
A female school name list? It's really old.

761
01:05:15,303 --> 01:05:17,893
It was during Miyo's mother's schooldays.

762
01:05:18,313 --> 01:05:21,023
Even if you narrow it down to the
schools in the capital.

763
01:05:21,023 --> 01:05:23,483
There are still 27 students named Sumi.

764
01:05:23,483 --> 01:05:24,863
27?

765
01:05:25,773 --> 01:05:27,233
You want to go through them one by one?

766
01:05:27,233 --> 01:05:28,733
That's the plan.

767
01:05:28,733 --> 01:05:30,533
But there's no proof they're in the capital.

768
01:05:32,033 --> 01:05:33,993
This will take a lot of time.

769
01:05:36,033 --> 01:05:38,203
Why are you doing this?

770
01:05:38,203 --> 01:05:39,753
You two are on good terms, right?

771
01:05:39,753 --> 01:05:41,123
<i>At that time...</i>

772
01:05:41,123 --> 01:05:43,213
<i>I felt something I've never felt before.</i>

773
01:05:43,793 --> 01:05:45,383
I'm sorry.

774
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:51,223
If that was Usuba's doing...

775
01:05:52,223 --> 01:05:54,893
Please get out of my way. I'm in a hurry.

776
01:05:55,513 --> 01:05:57,973
Only authorized personnel are permitted! Wait!

777
01:05:59,643 --> 01:06:01,733
I'm in a hurry! Let me go!

778
01:06:02,773 --> 01:06:04,903
Mr. Kudou, I'm sorry.

779
01:06:04,903 --> 01:06:05,903
Miyo...

780
01:06:23,253 --> 01:06:25,333
You want us to apologize?

781
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:27,043
Help!

782
01:06:30,003 --> 01:06:32,843
You and your mother...

783
01:06:32,843 --> 01:06:34,513
How far are you going to make fun of me

784
01:06:34,513 --> 01:06:35,763
before you're satisfied?

785
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:40,223
I hate those eyes of yours.

786
01:06:40,223 --> 01:06:42,393
The spitting image of that woman.

787
01:06:42,683 --> 01:06:45,443
Just because you have
a somewhat better bloodline.

788
01:06:45,443 --> 01:06:47,273
Why are you treated so favorably?

789
01:06:53,113 --> 01:06:54,953
If it weren't for your mother,

790
01:06:55,823 --> 01:06:58,953
I would've already married
into the Saimori family!

791
01:06:59,993 --> 01:07:03,543
I have a favor to ask.

792
01:07:07,713 --> 01:07:09,543
Cancel your engagement with Lord Kudou.

793
01:07:25,433 --> 01:07:28,563
It's a plot between Kaya and my father.

794
01:07:29,733 --> 01:07:30,943
Kaya wanted you.

795
01:07:31,613 --> 01:07:33,443
My father wanted to get
Usuba's bloodline.

796
01:07:36,033 --> 01:07:38,283
I couldn't do anything on my own.

797
01:07:45,203 --> 01:07:46,213
What should we do?

798
01:07:46,623 --> 01:07:48,333
I doubt anyone will open the door if I shout.

799
01:07:49,293 --> 01:07:50,633
Not a problem.

800
01:08:21,493 --> 01:08:23,623
All you have to do is refuse the marriage

801
01:08:25,663 --> 01:08:28,463
then I'll be engaged to Lord Kudou.

802
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:34,543
All you have to do is say yes.

803
01:08:37,013 --> 01:08:38,473
Miyo!

804
01:08:39,513 --> 01:08:40,933
- Get some water.
- Okay.

805
01:08:41,723 --> 01:08:42,393
Miyo!

806
01:08:42,803 --> 01:08:43,853
Leave!

807
01:08:44,183 --> 01:08:44,973
Where's Miyo?

808
01:08:44,973 --> 01:08:47,393
Miyo belongs to the Tatsuishi family!

809
01:09:02,533 --> 01:09:03,373
Wait!

810
01:09:04,323 --> 01:09:06,293
Where are you going?

811
01:09:08,503 --> 01:09:11,423
I need to wash that filthy face.

812
01:09:11,423 --> 01:09:12,673
Miyo!

813
01:09:14,633 --> 01:09:16,303
Put out the fire!

814
01:09:16,303 --> 01:09:17,753
Where are you, Miyo?

815
01:09:23,683 --> 01:09:24,513
Miyo!

816
01:09:26,353 --> 01:09:27,143
Where are you, Miyo?

817
01:09:31,983 --> 01:09:32,853
Where are you, Miyo?

818
01:09:33,813 --> 01:09:35,193
- Tatsuishi that bastard,
- Miyo!

819
01:09:35,863 --> 01:09:37,233
dragging me into this!

820
01:10:09,353 --> 01:10:10,223
Where's Miyo?

821
01:10:20,113 --> 01:10:21,073
Miyo!

822
01:10:25,913 --> 01:10:27,953
<i>If I give up now,</i>

823
01:10:27,953 --> 01:10:29,123
<i>I'll be free.</i>

824
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:33,463
<i>Even if it's taken away from me,
I won't talk back.</i>

825
01:10:34,963 --> 01:10:36,923
<i>It'll be the same as always.</i>

826
01:10:36,923 --> 01:10:38,673
<i>It's an easy thing to do.</i>

827
01:10:39,843 --> 01:10:43,633
<i>While praying for the storm to pass,</i>

828
01:10:43,633 --> 01:10:45,433
<i>I survived.</i>

829
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:47,973
<i>But...</i>

830
01:10:49,542 --> 01:10:52,103
Don't you even have any fatherly love?

831
01:10:52,103 --> 01:10:53,063
Love?

832
01:10:53,433 --> 01:10:56,313
There's no love for a person
without a gift.

833
01:11:12,743 --> 01:11:14,623
Tell me you're going to break the engagement.

834
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:16,623
No.

835
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:23,803
<i>However, the person who will stay next to him is...</i>

836
01:11:31,223 --> 01:11:32,433
I...

837
01:11:35,143 --> 01:11:36,773
I'm his...

838
01:11:40,733 --> 01:11:42,693
I'm Kudou Kiyoka's...

839
01:11:45,193 --> 01:11:46,453
fiancée.

840
01:12:11,973 --> 01:12:13,013
Miyo!

841
01:12:16,603 --> 01:12:17,683
Miyo.

842
01:12:21,853 --> 01:12:22,313
Miyo!

843
01:12:49,633 --> 01:12:51,093
It's all right.

844
01:13:13,493 --> 01:13:14,623
Let's go home.

845
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:23,083
I'm not wrong, I'm just trying
to correct a mistake!

846
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:24,083
Mistake?

847
01:13:24,253 --> 01:13:27,343
Because it's weird that she was
accepted into the Kudou family.

848
01:13:27,343 --> 01:13:30,383
She's useless and I've Spirit-sight as gift.

849
01:13:30,383 --> 01:13:31,683
Shut up.

850
01:13:32,973 --> 01:13:35,183
I'm the one who is more useful.

851
01:13:35,183 --> 01:13:36,053
I'm better...

852
01:13:36,053 --> 01:13:37,473
Shut up!

853
01:13:39,103 --> 01:13:41,523
I don't give a damn about looks or 'gift'.

854
01:13:42,193 --> 01:13:43,443
Even if the sky is falling down.

855
01:13:44,273 --> 01:13:46,113
I won't choose you.

856
01:13:50,863 --> 01:13:52,863
Take that man to the headquarters.

857
01:13:53,453 --> 01:13:54,533
Yes, sir!

858
01:14:18,263 --> 01:14:22,393
But, even so you...

859
01:14:24,733 --> 01:14:27,313
We haven't caught the culprits
who exposed the Burial Grounds.

860
01:14:27,313 --> 01:14:28,233
Don't worry about it.

861
01:14:28,233 --> 01:14:29,903
Hey, let me see the baby.

862
01:14:30,073 --> 01:14:31,363
How many times are you going to look?

863
01:14:32,113 --> 01:14:33,283
It's so cute.

864
01:14:36,493 --> 01:14:38,703
Mochizuki, are you okay?

865
01:15:01,973 --> 01:15:03,483
<i>Five days later...</i>

866
01:15:04,143 --> 01:15:06,893
<i>The Saimori family,
whose house burned to the ground,</i>

867
01:15:06,893 --> 01:15:09,363
<i>moved to a private house
in the countryside.</i>

868
01:15:10,773 --> 01:15:13,903
<i>My Lord said the family is
in total decline.</i>

869
01:15:20,623 --> 01:15:23,583
<i>The Tatsuishi family has entrusted their
eldest son as the head of the family....</i>

870
01:15:24,203 --> 01:15:26,963
<i>and is presently under the management
of the Kudou family.</i>

871
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:33,173
Lady Miyo!

872
01:15:33,173 --> 01:15:34,263
Don't do that.

873
01:15:34,263 --> 01:15:35,973
I'll do it.

874
01:15:35,973 --> 01:15:38,053
It's fine.

875
01:15:38,053 --> 01:15:39,593
You need to get some rest.

876
01:15:40,223 --> 01:15:41,111
Excuse me.

877
01:15:41,135 --> 01:15:42,763
Please come in.

878
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:43,130
Okay.

879
01:15:47,443 --> 01:15:49,773
Come Lady Miyo, let's go inside.

880
01:15:50,943 --> 01:15:52,193
Hello.

881
01:15:55,783 --> 01:15:58,953
He's the gentleman that assisted Lady Miyo
when we were in the city.

882
01:15:59,323 --> 01:16:01,493
So I invited him to return the favor.

883
01:16:03,623 --> 01:16:05,833
Is there a problem?

884
01:16:07,543 --> 01:16:08,623
No.

885
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:11,673
Thank you for your help earlier.

886
01:16:11,673 --> 01:16:15,173
No, I was in a hurry too.

887
01:16:16,423 --> 01:16:19,383
But I didn't realize
you were Captain Kudou's fiancée.

888
01:16:19,383 --> 01:16:21,303
I was surprised too.

889
01:16:21,303 --> 01:16:23,053
I had no idea you were his colleague.

890
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:25,853
Well...

891
01:16:27,063 --> 01:16:28,233
That bruise is...

892
01:16:32,773 --> 01:16:34,113
This is...

893
01:16:37,283 --> 01:16:39,033
a battle scar.

894
01:16:56,883 --> 01:16:59,343
You can leave the report to the guards.

895
01:16:59,973 --> 01:17:01,803
I went to the headquarters.

896
01:17:02,593 --> 01:17:03,473
But they said

897
01:17:03,473 --> 01:17:05,103
you're taking care of Lady Miyo
and don't know when you'll be back.

898
01:17:05,103 --> 01:17:07,353
The guards didn't know Miyo was hurt.

899
01:17:09,483 --> 01:17:10,983
What are you thinking?

900
01:17:11,603 --> 01:17:16,153
That's what I wanted to say.

901
01:17:17,613 --> 01:17:18,233
What?

902
01:17:18,653 --> 01:17:21,113
Lady Miyo's injury
wasn't caused by the Saimori family

903
01:17:21,113 --> 01:17:22,823
but it was caused by you.

904
01:17:22,993 --> 01:17:25,913
Your existence was the cause.

905
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:28,293
And also,

906
01:17:30,623 --> 01:17:33,423
you left her nightmare unattended.

907
01:17:37,633 --> 01:17:39,303
Don't tell me...

908
01:17:42,843 --> 01:17:44,803
If you want to save Miyo...

909
01:17:47,973 --> 01:17:49,103
bring her to me.

910
01:18:11,123 --> 01:18:12,203
Captain...

911
01:18:13,463 --> 01:18:17,593
Vigilance class 1 is back,
class 2 is ready to move out.

912
01:18:17,963 --> 01:18:19,253
Okay, I got it.

913
01:18:22,912 --> 01:18:24,359
[Sumi]

914
01:18:24,384 --> 01:18:25,813
[Tsuruki]

915
01:18:26,183 --> 01:18:28,053
Tsuruki Sumi...

916
01:18:31,813 --> 01:18:33,143
Tsuruki...

917
01:18:34,023 --> 01:18:36,693
Please help me.

918
01:18:41,073 --> 01:18:42,443
When Miyo came to this house,

919
01:18:42,443 --> 01:18:43,863
I sensed it.

920
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:47,823
Now I'm sure I was right.

921
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:53,373
Please.

922
01:18:56,293 --> 01:18:59,043
Miyo. Miyo!

923
01:19:00,293 --> 01:19:01,383
Miyo, it's okay.

924
01:19:02,173 --> 01:19:03,383
Miyo, it's okay.

925
01:19:03,803 --> 01:19:05,423
It's okay I'm here.

926
01:19:06,683 --> 01:19:08,803
Miyo.

927
01:19:13,593 --> 01:19:15,593
Did you have a nightmare?

928
01:19:18,943 --> 01:19:21,903
There's no one around, just me.

929
01:19:23,113 --> 01:19:25,193
It's dark inside the water.

930
01:19:27,913 --> 01:19:29,073
It's just me.

931
01:19:29,073 --> 01:19:30,533
Miyo, look at me.

932
01:19:30,703 --> 01:19:32,663
Miyo, look at me.

933
01:19:34,913 --> 01:19:36,253
It's okay.

934
01:19:39,003 --> 01:19:40,333
It's okay.

935
01:19:41,923 --> 01:19:44,923
I don't want to have nightmares anymore.

936
01:19:59,773 --> 01:20:02,073
I appreciate you coming over so quickly.

937
01:20:08,573 --> 01:20:10,533
Ms. Miyo doesn't seem to understand

938
01:20:10,533 --> 01:20:12,163
why she was brought here?

939
01:20:19,923 --> 01:20:21,923
Are you currently the 'real' you?
[not an illusion]

940
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:23,293
What do you mean?

941
01:20:23,293 --> 01:20:26,883
You're the one who said you had
the power to interfere people's mind.

942
01:20:27,723 --> 01:20:29,053
That's right.

943
01:20:29,433 --> 01:20:30,433
<i>When he helped Miyo before</i>

944
01:20:30,433 --> 01:20:33,563
<i>he suddenly disappeared
right in front of the car.</i>

945
01:20:35,513 --> 01:20:38,183
You're using Usuba's gift
to create illusions, aren't you?

946
01:20:38,183 --> 01:20:40,903
Don't worry, currently I'm the real me.

947
01:20:40,903 --> 01:20:43,823
Did you just mention Usuba?

948
01:20:44,153 --> 01:20:44,983
Yes.

949
01:20:48,073 --> 01:20:49,653
Ms. Miyo, come here.

950
01:21:09,093 --> 01:21:10,093
Indeed.

951
01:21:11,893 --> 01:21:14,013
She does look a lot like Sumi.

952
01:21:15,013 --> 01:21:17,313
These men are the elders of the Usuba family.

953
01:21:17,313 --> 01:21:18,983
This is Mrs. Sumi's father.

954
01:21:19,523 --> 01:21:21,353
He is Miyo's and my grandfather.

955
01:21:21,903 --> 01:21:25,193
"Tsuruki" is the name we use outside.

956
01:21:25,193 --> 01:21:27,693
My real name is Usuba Arata.

957
01:21:28,403 --> 01:21:29,193
Miyo,

958
01:21:29,743 --> 01:21:31,243
I'm your cousin.

959
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:37,283
I have only one question.

960
01:21:38,793 --> 01:21:43,373
Who is the person that showed Miyo nightmares?

961
01:21:57,473 --> 01:21:58,603
It's no one.

962
01:21:59,563 --> 01:22:01,853
It's Usuba's blood that does it.

963
01:22:02,103 --> 01:22:04,693
Our power is very special and strong.

964
01:22:05,443 --> 01:22:07,483
Just having the blood of Usuba flowing on your body

965
01:22:07,483 --> 01:22:09,863
has an effect on your mind.

966
01:22:10,863 --> 01:22:13,913
If the power of Usuba can effect the mind,

967
01:22:16,453 --> 01:22:18,493
can it stop Miyo's nightmare?

968
01:22:20,623 --> 01:22:22,833
Yes, if she stays here

969
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:25,793
we can deal with it.

970
01:22:26,423 --> 01:22:27,543
Please wait.

971
01:22:27,753 --> 01:22:30,763
I can't leave my Lord's side.

972
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:33,263
It's only a matter of time
before the nightmares kill you.

973
01:22:33,263 --> 01:22:36,183
Besides, Mr. Kudou is busy with
the Burial Ground case.

974
01:22:36,933 --> 01:22:38,683
- Stop making any trouble...
- That has nothing to do with Miyo.

975
01:22:38,683 --> 01:22:40,013
Even so,

976
01:22:40,723 --> 01:22:43,643
can a man who can't stop her nightmares

977
01:22:44,483 --> 01:22:46,103
make her happy?

978
01:22:53,073 --> 01:22:54,403
If this continues,

979
01:22:55,283 --> 01:22:57,323
she'll be killed by her own power.

980
01:23:17,933 --> 01:23:19,263
You should stay here.

981
01:23:19,263 --> 01:23:21,013
You must obey anything I say.

982
01:23:40,623 --> 01:23:41,993
Yes, my Lord.

983
01:24:11,063 --> 01:24:12,983
I only have western clothing.

984
01:24:13,693 --> 01:24:15,573
If you want to wear a kimono,
let's go shopping.

985
01:24:22,953 --> 01:24:24,203
Miyo.

986
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:29,833
Why don't we get married?

987
01:24:37,713 --> 01:24:40,223
I've always been thinking about you.

988
01:24:41,486 --> 01:24:42,726
I've always admired you.

989
01:24:44,813 --> 01:24:45,853
I've been waiting for you.

990
01:24:49,893 --> 01:24:51,483
The power of Usuba is dangerous

991
01:24:51,483 --> 01:24:52,903
to the people around you.

992
01:24:53,403 --> 01:24:56,403
Our bloodline was actually forbidden
to be shared with other families.

993
01:24:56,403 --> 01:24:57,533
Then...

994
01:24:59,323 --> 01:25:01,363
why did my mother
marry into the Saimori family?

995
01:25:05,783 --> 01:25:07,833
It was Mrs. Sumi's wish.

996
01:25:09,213 --> 01:25:10,293
In order to save

997
01:25:10,318 --> 01:25:12,108
Tsuruki Trading from financial trouble,

998
01:25:12,589 --> 01:25:15,253
we received financial support
from the Saimori family.

999
01:25:20,843 --> 01:25:21,803
Miyo...

1000
01:25:22,843 --> 01:25:25,223
you've returned to your rightful place.

1001
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:30,063
My rightful place...

1002
01:25:30,063 --> 01:25:32,353
The most important thing for the Usuba family is

1003
01:25:32,353 --> 01:25:34,233
to live in peace and harmony.

1004
01:25:35,403 --> 01:25:38,233
This is why we live independently and quietly.

1005
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:40,533
There's nothing here that can hurt you.

1006
01:25:41,033 --> 01:25:42,323
That's why...

1007
01:25:44,073 --> 01:25:45,323
Arata.

1008
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:50,373
We'll continue this conversation later.

1009
01:26:00,633 --> 01:26:01,883
Godou.

1010
01:26:02,473 --> 01:26:04,393
Captain, please hurry!

1011
01:26:04,393 --> 01:26:06,433
The Imperial Household Army
is infected by the insects...

1012
01:26:11,563 --> 01:26:12,943
Your Highness.

1013
01:26:14,103 --> 01:26:14,733
Are you alright?

1014
01:26:17,813 --> 01:26:19,323
Your Highness!

1015
01:26:22,783 --> 01:26:24,653
Send a messenger to Kiyoka!

1016
01:26:29,703 --> 01:26:32,163
Your Highness, what's wrong?

1017
01:26:51,433 --> 01:26:54,813
The Emperor's history and thoughts
have been absorbed, haven't they?

1018
01:26:55,983 --> 01:26:59,733
<i>Send everyone infected with the insects
to the basement dungeon for quarantine.</i>

1019
01:27:02,653 --> 01:27:03,903
Captain!

1020
01:27:11,373 --> 01:27:12,373
Mochizuki!

1021
01:27:12,873 --> 01:27:13,833
Captain!

1022
01:27:23,513 --> 01:27:25,723
Find out who's infected by the insects!

1023
01:27:26,303 --> 01:27:27,303
Godou!

1024
01:27:27,303 --> 01:27:28,553
Captain!

1025
01:27:28,553 --> 01:27:30,803
The Imperial Household Army Unit
suddenly came and attack us.

1026
01:27:31,853 --> 01:27:34,483
More than half of the units are infected.

1027
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:36,273
Were any civilians harmed?

1028
01:27:36,273 --> 01:27:36,983
No!

1029
01:27:37,563 --> 01:27:39,363
Based on what I've gathered from my familiar,

1030
01:27:39,693 --> 01:27:42,233
all the insects are here!

1031
01:27:42,653 --> 01:27:43,943
Then raise the barrier.

1032
01:27:44,283 --> 01:27:45,993
Don't let a single one out!

1033
01:27:46,363 --> 01:27:47,113
But...

1034
01:27:47,653 --> 01:27:49,283
We won't be able to use our familiar.

1035
01:27:49,703 --> 01:27:50,493
I don't care.

1036
01:27:51,163 --> 01:27:53,123
These are no ordinary insects.

1037
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:01,923
Prepare yourself to become a shield.

1038
01:28:04,553 --> 01:28:06,223
Stop panicking!

1039
01:28:06,473 --> 01:28:07,263
Yes, sir!

1040
01:28:07,263 --> 01:28:08,933
Don't let the insects get out!

1041
01:28:19,353 --> 01:28:21,483
<i>Anyone infected with the insects</i>

1042
01:28:21,483 --> 01:28:23,573
<i>should be tied and confined.</i>

1043
01:28:26,533 --> 01:28:27,693
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1044
01:28:41,503 --> 01:28:42,923
<i>Is there enough rope?</i>

1045
01:29:36,683 --> 01:29:40,063
I've heard that all the insects of the
Burial Grounds have gone to the headquarters.

1046
01:29:40,983 --> 01:29:42,523
What about the Anti-Grotesquerie Special Unit?

1047
01:29:42,943 --> 01:29:44,193
They are still fighting.

1048
01:29:45,313 --> 01:29:47,233
They won't be able to avoid annihilation.

1049
01:29:49,283 --> 01:29:50,903
What do you mean?

1050
01:29:53,783 --> 01:29:55,533
Miyo!

1051
01:29:55,533 --> 01:29:56,663
Let me explain!

1052
01:29:56,663 --> 01:29:58,243
Let me go!

1053
01:30:10,213 --> 01:30:11,303
Arata.

1054
01:30:12,343 --> 01:30:13,223
I'm fine.

1055
01:30:13,763 --> 01:30:14,883
I'm not entranced.

1056
01:30:15,263 --> 01:30:16,893
I just fainted for a moment.

1057
01:30:21,643 --> 01:30:24,523
What did I just do?

1058
01:30:29,983 --> 01:30:31,493
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1059
01:30:32,303 --> 01:30:34,243
Your 'Dream-weaver' power manifested.

1060
01:30:36,573 --> 01:30:37,783
Dream-weaver?

1061
01:30:37,783 --> 01:30:38,243
Yes.

1062
01:30:38,783 --> 01:30:41,833
It has the power to draw people into
a dream or spiritual world

1063
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:43,793
and you can enter to that world.

1064
01:30:45,253 --> 01:30:46,673
No matter how strong the opponent is,

1065
01:30:46,673 --> 01:30:48,883
you can manipulate their dreams
and brainwash them.

1066
01:30:51,463 --> 01:30:52,673
It's a power

1067
01:30:52,673 --> 01:30:54,973
that's unique even to the Usuba family.

1068
01:30:56,843 --> 01:31:00,643
But I couldn't even see a Grotesquerie,
how can I have a gift?

1069
01:31:00,643 --> 01:31:02,183
We can't see it either.

1070
01:31:03,603 --> 01:31:07,443
The power of the Usuba family
isn't used to defeat the Grotesqueries.

1071
01:31:08,863 --> 01:31:10,733
What do you mean?

1072
01:31:14,783 --> 01:31:17,863
Our duty is to stop gifted people

1073
01:31:17,863 --> 01:31:19,623
from going berserk.

1074
01:31:21,293 --> 01:31:21,953
In other words,

1075
01:31:21,953 --> 01:31:25,503
the Usuba's gift is to
defeat other gifted people.

1076
01:31:26,623 --> 01:31:29,963
Dream-weaver's power always appear
in the form of nightmares.

1077
01:31:33,093 --> 01:31:35,633
I need to get back to Lord Kudou's side
as soon as possible.

1078
01:31:35,633 --> 01:31:36,473
You can't.

1079
01:31:36,843 --> 01:31:38,343
It's not just because of your gift.

1080
01:31:40,643 --> 01:31:42,523
It's the Emperor's order.

1081
01:31:43,523 --> 01:31:45,433
If you invite Miyo to Usuba family,

1082
01:31:45,433 --> 01:31:47,773
she's not allowed to see Kudou
until order was given.

1083
01:31:50,823 --> 01:31:52,443
Why would the Emperor...

1084
01:31:53,073 --> 01:31:54,323
<i>The Emperor...</i>

1085
01:31:56,153 --> 01:31:58,913
received a Divine Revelation

1086
01:31:59,953 --> 01:32:03,873
that a Dream-weaver would appear,
and was afraid.

1087
01:32:05,873 --> 01:32:08,873
If the 'Divine Revelation' is
inferior to the 'Dream-weaver',

1088
01:32:11,423 --> 01:32:12,633
all the members

1089
01:32:14,133 --> 01:32:19,093
of royal family will be displaced one day.

1090
01:32:20,973 --> 01:32:23,223
And the existence of Kudou Kiyoka

1091
01:32:24,063 --> 01:32:26,433
<i>will become a big threat to the Emperor</i>

1092
01:32:26,893 --> 01:32:29,653
<i>should he join forces with the Saimori family.</i>

1093
01:32:30,863 --> 01:32:36,153
<i>The Emperor took advantage
of the exposed Burial Grounds</i>

1094
01:32:36,533 --> 01:32:38,073
and ordered Mr. Kudou

1095
01:32:41,243 --> 01:32:43,533
to become a shield.

1096
01:32:44,583 --> 01:32:50,043
You wanted to kill Kiyoka from the beginning?

1097
01:32:52,083 --> 01:32:54,043
It's all your father's wishes

1098
01:32:54,633 --> 01:32:58,343
in order to protect you.

1099
01:33:08,643 --> 01:33:10,063
Stay away from their faces.

1100
01:33:10,813 --> 01:33:13,653
<i>If there's no other way
to kill just the "insect",</i>

1101
01:33:14,443 --> 01:33:17,443
<i>the Anti-Grotesquerie Special Unit
inside the barrier</i>

1102
01:33:17,443 --> 01:33:19,403
<i>will have to kill each other.</i>

1103
01:33:22,033 --> 01:33:23,113
What should we do?

1104
01:33:23,993 --> 01:33:25,743
What should we do, Kato?!

1105
01:33:33,383 --> 01:33:35,133
Go get me a rope!

1106
01:33:36,803 --> 01:33:38,513
Don't come any closer!

1107
01:33:54,363 --> 01:33:54,863
Okabe.

1108
01:34:02,453 --> 01:34:03,363
Okabe.

1109
01:34:04,163 --> 01:34:04,913
Okabe!

1110
01:34:15,003 --> 01:34:16,423
Okabe!

1111
01:34:21,923 --> 01:34:23,513
<i>I don't want to kill.</i>

1112
01:34:23,883 --> 01:34:24,933
Captain!

1113
01:34:26,223 --> 01:34:29,263
Godou, stay away from him.

1114
01:34:45,323 --> 01:34:46,493
Get me a rope!

1115
01:34:57,043 --> 01:34:59,463
<i>I'm sorry, Okabe.</i>

1116
01:35:33,293 --> 01:35:34,463
I'm sorry.

1117
01:35:36,253 --> 01:35:37,293
I'm sorry.

1118
01:35:59,233 --> 01:36:00,483
Don't tell me you poisoned...

1119
01:36:08,113 --> 01:36:09,623
You're the one who exposed the Burial Grounds?

1120
01:36:10,533 --> 01:36:11,243
How dare you!

1121
01:36:12,703 --> 01:36:15,083
Father, Father!

1122
01:36:15,373 --> 01:36:18,463
Father!

1123
01:36:34,313 --> 01:36:38,483
The Usuba family has a rule.

1124
01:36:43,113 --> 01:36:45,273
If a Dream-weaver appears,

1125
01:36:47,153 --> 01:36:49,283
a chosen member from the family

1126
01:36:49,613 --> 01:36:51,743
will risk their life to protect them.

1127
01:36:54,583 --> 01:36:55,413
I won't let you go.

1128
01:37:00,173 --> 01:37:05,843
It's my duty to protect you
for the rest of my life.

1129
01:37:12,683 --> 01:37:14,263
Stay away from their faces!

1130
01:37:18,433 --> 01:37:19,353
Captain!

1131
01:37:25,443 --> 01:37:27,323
- I'm really sorry.
- Miyo, please!

1132
01:37:27,323 --> 01:37:28,403
Please let me go!

1133
01:37:28,403 --> 01:37:29,283
<i>You can't!</i>

1134
01:37:29,743 --> 01:37:31,913
<i>You still can't control your power.</i>

1135
01:37:31,913 --> 01:37:34,373
You'll be consumed by that power and die.

1136
01:37:34,373 --> 01:37:35,743
I don't care!

1137
01:37:36,833 --> 01:37:40,503
<i>If I can be of any help to Lord Kudou,</i>

1138
01:37:40,503 --> 01:37:42,213
<i>I'll gladly die.</i>

1139
01:38:16,953 --> 01:38:18,413
<i>My Lord.</i>

1140
01:38:19,123 --> 01:38:20,623
<i>My Lord.</i>

1141
01:38:22,463 --> 01:38:23,793
<i>My Lord.</i>

1142
01:38:23,793 --> 01:38:27,883
<i>But, even so you...</i>

1143
01:38:28,963 --> 01:38:34,763
will definitely be happy.

1144
01:38:37,933 --> 01:38:39,933
When you become older.

1145
01:39:18,763 --> 01:39:20,013
Godou!

1146
01:39:23,393 --> 01:39:24,773
Wait!

1147
01:39:25,103 --> 01:39:26,023
What's wrong?

1148
01:39:26,813 --> 01:39:27,693
What?

1149
01:39:45,753 --> 01:39:46,923
Captain...

1150
01:39:48,133 --> 01:39:51,043
Stop! Stop!

1151
01:39:57,013 --> 01:39:58,013
Stop!

1152
01:40:07,693 --> 01:40:09,403
<i>A Dream-weaver.../i></i>

1153
01:40:10,233 --> 01:40:13,233
<i>has the power to infiltrate other
people's dreams and spiritual worlds</i>

1154
01:40:13,733 --> 01:40:16,323
<i>and defeat the gifted.</i>

1155
01:40:39,133 --> 01:40:41,223
Cut them!

1156
01:41:07,203 --> 01:41:08,753
Mother.

1157
01:41:10,003 --> 01:41:11,543
I...

1158
01:41:13,673 --> 01:41:14,923
I...

1159
01:41:18,383 --> 01:41:19,633
still can't...

1160
01:41:22,263 --> 01:41:24,353
go to your side.

1161
01:41:31,903 --> 01:41:35,773
Let's meet again.

1162
01:41:40,783 --> 01:41:42,203
Again?

1163
01:41:48,743 --> 01:41:50,043
Miyo!

1164
01:41:59,383 --> 01:42:00,763
You are incredibly foolish.

1165
01:42:46,393 --> 01:42:47,223
Hey, are you okay?

1166
01:42:48,513 --> 01:42:50,393
Somebody!

1167
01:42:59,903 --> 01:43:00,983
Miyo!

1168
01:43:10,333 --> 01:43:11,953
My Lord.

1169
01:43:19,423 --> 01:43:21,133
I want to be by your side.

1170
01:43:24,803 --> 01:43:26,593
I want to stay with you.

1171
01:43:54,373 --> 01:43:55,083
Kiyoka.

1172
01:43:59,173 --> 01:44:00,093
Kiyoka.

1173
01:44:00,793 --> 01:44:02,593
I'm really sorry.

1174
01:44:08,013 --> 01:44:12,563
Miyo's mother knew that Miyo
had the gift of a Dream-weaver

1175
01:44:14,223 --> 01:44:15,683
and sealed that power.

1176
01:44:17,353 --> 01:44:18,523
Yes.

1177
01:44:20,193 --> 01:44:21,863
From my father

1178
01:44:23,023 --> 01:44:25,903
and those who intend to abuse that power.

1179
01:44:26,856 --> 01:44:29,413
She did it to keep her child safe.

1180
01:44:50,843 --> 01:44:52,183
I'm glad.

1181
01:44:56,023 --> 01:45:00,853
So, Miyo was loved.

1182
01:45:12,823 --> 01:45:14,743
It's the same for you, Your Highness.

1183
01:45:15,543 --> 01:45:19,123
If there is anything wrong
with the Emperor's actions,

1184
01:45:22,923 --> 01:45:24,383
there's only one person

1185
01:45:26,133 --> 01:45:27,763
that will be able to correct it.

1186
01:45:37,603 --> 01:45:39,773
It looks really good on you.

1187
01:45:40,353 --> 01:45:42,313
It's very beautiful.

1188
01:45:42,653 --> 01:45:45,153
Lord Kudou chose it himself.

1189
01:45:45,403 --> 01:45:46,653
No.

1190
01:45:46,653 --> 01:45:47,903
He did choose the kimono,

1191
01:45:49,153 --> 01:45:51,663
but most importantly, you're beautiful.

1192
01:45:55,033 --> 01:45:56,583
Thank you very much.

1193
01:45:57,793 --> 01:46:01,873
Anyone can gain confidence by being loved.

1194
01:46:02,293 --> 01:46:04,253
Young Master and Lady Miyo

1195
01:46:04,278 --> 01:46:06,018
have grown more at ease.

1196
01:46:07,003 --> 01:46:08,213
I'm leaving.

1197
01:46:08,213 --> 01:46:09,553
Please take care.

1198
01:46:18,103 --> 01:46:19,353
My Lord.

1199
01:46:28,533 --> 01:46:29,903
Did you come to pick me up?

1200
01:46:31,153 --> 01:46:32,613
It's looks like it's going to snow.

1201
01:46:44,503 --> 01:46:45,253
Let's go home.

1202
01:46:51,173 --> 01:46:52,343
Yes.

1203
01:47:12,533 --> 01:47:14,243
Please wait, my Lord.

1204
01:47:15,493 --> 01:47:16,703
This...

1205
01:47:18,493 --> 01:47:20,333
It's broken, I'm sorry.

1206
01:47:20,333 --> 01:47:21,493
I'll just buy you another one.

1207
01:47:21,493 --> 01:47:24,623
No, I'm going to keep this one.

1208
01:47:27,423 --> 01:47:30,553
The most important thing to me is...

1209
01:47:32,770 --> 01:47:37,140
this comb has a deeper meaning...

1210
01:47:38,263 --> 01:47:38,933
behind it.

1211
01:47:39,683 --> 01:47:41,313
I see.

1212
01:47:42,773 --> 01:47:44,183
Okay.

1213
01:47:51,403 --> 01:47:52,483
Miyo.

1214
01:47:53,783 --> 01:47:58,323
From now on, you're probably going to
face a rough time.

1215
01:47:59,743 --> 01:48:01,533
I'm a soldier, after all.

1216
01:48:01,993 --> 01:48:05,503
Sometimes I have to go to the battlefield.

1217
01:48:06,753 --> 01:48:08,293
And also my personality...

1218
01:48:12,383 --> 01:48:13,136
is boring.

1219
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,383
No.

1220
01:48:14,883 --> 01:48:16,513
But I...

1221
01:48:20,933 --> 01:48:22,313
want to be with you.

1222
01:48:23,603 --> 01:48:24,643
Troublesome men like me...

1223
01:48:24,643 --> 01:48:26,483
I don't find you troublesome at all.

1224
01:48:28,393 --> 01:48:29,853
- I am.
- No.

1225
01:48:30,063 --> 01:48:32,363
I'm more troublesome than you.

1226
01:48:40,163 --> 01:48:42,073
Will you marry me?

1227
01:48:49,373 --> 01:48:50,543
You won't regret it?

1228
01:48:50,543 --> 01:48:51,673
Of course not.

1229
01:48:57,763 --> 01:48:59,473
I'm a person with many shortcomings.

1230
01:49:00,513 --> 01:49:02,553
Please treat me favorably.

1231
01:49:12,103 --> 01:49:13,313
Let's go.

1232
01:49:13,313 --> 01:49:14,573
Yes.

1233
01:49:16,517 --> 01:49:21,969
<i>♫ Tears spelling love, swaying in the wind</i>

1234
01:49:21,969 --> 01:49:26,663
<i>♫ I think of you and my heart cries</i>

1235
01:49:26,663 --> 01:49:30,951
<i>♫ Lead the two of us to eternity</i>

1236
01:49:30,951 --> 01:49:36,130
<i>♫ To your side right now...</i>

1237
01:49:54,633 --> 01:49:57,741
<i>♫ Even though the sky is clear</i>

1238
01:49:57,741 --> 01:50:02,384
<i>♫ The rain is hitting my shoulder now</i>

1239
01:50:02,384 --> 01:50:05,528
<i>♫ The sadness of finding a place to belong</i>

1240
01:50:05,528 --> 01:50:09,185
<i>♫ I wonder if it's because I started crying</i>

1241
01:50:09,185 --> 01:50:13,285
<i>♫ If I close my eyes (every time)</i>

1242
01:50:13,285 --> 01:50:17,172
<i>♫ I hear your heartbeat throbbing</i>

1243
01:50:17,172 --> 01:50:21,952
<i>♫ The fingertips that touch you (running on the cheeks)</i>

1244
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:25,151
<i>♫ It melts away the loneliness</i>

1245
01:50:25,151 --> 01:50:29,773
<i>♫ Deeply in love, dancing fleetingly in the sky</i>

1246
01:50:29,773 --> 01:50:33,584
<i>♫ So that this feeling does not disappear</i>

1247
01:50:33,584 --> 01:50:37,228
<i>♫ The moonlight that illuminates the furrows</i>

1248
01:50:37,228 --> 01:50:41,338
<i>♫ Where shall we go now?</i>

1249
01:50:41,338 --> 01:50:44,987
<i>♫In exchange for eternal love</i>

1250
01:50:44,987 --> 01:50:49,051
<i>♫ I can throw everything away, that's why</i>

1251
01:50:49,051 --> 01:50:56,464
<i>♫ Let's go to end the loneliness</i>

1252
01:50:56,464 --> 01:50:59,742
<i>♫ Things like painfulness and destiny</i>

1253
01:50:59,742 --> 01:51:04,364
<i>♫ I screamed your name to cross over them</i>

1254
01:51:04,364 --> 01:51:07,516
<i>♫ If it's where I belong, if it's there</i>

1255
01:51:07,516 --> 01:51:11,406
<i>♫ (it will be where) the flowers blooming under the sun</i>

1256
01:51:11,406 --> 01:51:15,242
<i>♫ Every time the night comes (anytime)</i>

1257
01:51:15,242 --> 01:51:19,137
<i>♫ So that I don't end up getting lost</i>

1258
01:51:19,137 --> 01:51:23,746
<i>♫ The destination that shines (Tie me to it)</i>

1259
01:51:23,773 --> 01:51:27,133
<i>♫ I can't untie the hands that are connected...</i>

1260
01:51:48,197 --> 01:51:52,089
<i>♫ Keep unraveling the tangled threads</i>

1261
01:51:52,089 --> 01:51:55,235
<i>♫ One person turns into two</i>

1262
01:51:55,235 --> 01:51:57,421
<i>♫ The space in my heart</i>

1263
01:51:57,421 --> 01:51:59,854
<i>♫ We complete each other, that's why</i>

1264
01:51:59,854 --> 01:52:05,041
<i>♫ become an umbrella for tears...</i>

1265
01:52:11,668 --> 01:52:16,326
<i>♫ A wish yearning for love, swaying in the wind</i>

1266
01:52:16,326 --> 01:52:20,188
<i>♫ So that this feeling does not vanish</i>

1267
01:52:20,188 --> 01:52:23,801
<i>♫ Guide me with your sweet love</i>

1268
01:52:23,801 --> 01:52:27,926
<i>♫ Where shall we go now?</i>

1269
01:52:27,926 --> 01:52:31,541
<i>♫ In exchange for eternal love</i>

1270
01:52:31,541 --> 01:52:35,637
<i>♫ I can throw everything away, that's why</i>

1271
01:52:35,637 --> 01:52:44,145
<i>♫ (It's) a story written by two people</i>

1272
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:51,901
<i>♫ (a) story…</i>

1273
01:53:25,233 --> 01:53:27,443
It ended smoothly.

1274
01:53:30,033 --> 01:53:32,123
At last the flowers have bloomed.

1275
01:53:33,033 --> 01:53:35,413
I'm going to pick you this time,

1276
01:53:35,413 --> 01:53:36,203
Miyo.
