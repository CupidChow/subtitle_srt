1
00:00:08,382 --> 00:00:11,510
I forbid anyone from opening
his gate of energy!

2
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:19,685
Wait!

3
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,106
You cannot just leave like this.

4
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,400
What about this child?

5
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:30,279
Think about what people will say
about Do-hwa and this baby.

6
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:32,656
They will say he is not your son

7
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:35,993
and call him an illegitimate child.

8
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:40,456
He will be raised by the Jang family
since my wife gave birth to him.

9
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,501
I will send someone over
after his mother's funeral.

10
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:45,044
Are you abandoning this child?

11
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,588
Is he really

12
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,882
not your son?

13
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:54,470
Believe what you wish to believe.

14
00:00:57,264 --> 00:00:59,475
If this child is
only going to cause trouble,

15
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:01,310
let us just end his life here and now.

16
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:13,489
See? He is your son.

17
00:01:13,572 --> 00:01:18,410
A son you are willing to protect
even at the risk of your own life.

18
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:20,746
I am merely trying to keep him safe.

19
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:25,793
If his gate of energy remains closed
and he lives as my son, he will live.

20
00:01:26,293 --> 00:01:29,421
However, if he chooses
to discover his fate instead,

21
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:32,675
he will not survive.

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,263
Who is the father

23
00:01:38,722 --> 00:01:39,849
of that child?

24
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,522
He is the son of a dead man.

25
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:52,111
Not only does his birth make no sense,

26
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:54,947
but it never should have happened either.

27
00:02:00,452 --> 00:02:02,705
Young Master, are you all right?

28
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:05,833
Why did you bring her out?

29
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,168
Let her go.

30
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:38,157
I apologize for causing trouble.

31
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,409
Why did you bring her out?

32
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:46,123
She tried to poison you.

33
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:48,709
She did not poison me.

34
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,378
I poisoned myself.

35
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:57,718
I did it because I hated that
I was incapable of casting spells.

36
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,347
My maid only risked her life
by doing what she was told to do.

37
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,433
It was all my doing.

38
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:16,028
-Jang Uk, how could you?
-Please save it for another time.

39
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:19,907
He still has not recovered
from the poison.

40
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,494
Punish him all you want,
but wait until he has fully recovered.

41
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:25,371
Uk almost died just now.

42
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:27,706
Please do not scold him like that.

43
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,458
Look at how pale he is.

44
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,920
Take him home for now.

45
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:35,130
Young Master, let us go.

46
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,007
Go to Sejukwon and receive treatment.

47
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,634
Mu-deok needs to go too.

48
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,803
Now is not the time.

49
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:42,805
Mu-deok needs to get treatment too.

50
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:44,473
Otherwise, I will not go.

51
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:45,766
Young Master.

52
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:47,935
Fine. Go ahead and die!

53
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:50,896
-Lock them back up!
-Calm down, Uncle.

54
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,065
If Uk is right,
that maid did nothing wrong.

55
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:55,025
She is severely injured.

56
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,278
Without treatment, she could die.

57
00:03:57,361 --> 00:04:00,614
I am surprised she is still alive
even after all those beatings.

58
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:03,909
If she dies, I will allow you
to hold a funeral for her.

59
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:22,803
Please help.

60
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:27,433
Mu-deok risked her life
to do what I asked.

61
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:30,102
We need to treat her at Sejukwon
to save her life.

62
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,147
Please help her.

63
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,659
I want them out of my sight.

64
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,620
Take them both to Sejukwon.

65
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:52,541
Uk.

66
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,213
Young Master, go on ahead.
I will take Mu-deok there.

67
00:04:58,881 --> 00:04:59,715
Mu-deok.

68
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,384
Mu-deok, wake up.

69
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,531
-I will take her.
-No.

70
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:27,409
I will do it myself.

71
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,952
You cannot even walk properly.

72
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:32,706
I can do it. She is my maid,
so I will take her.

73
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,416
But you are not well either.

74
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,168
You cannot take her there.

75
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:40,172
Do you think so? Then…

76
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,842
-You carry her on your back.
-Pardon?

77
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,219
Carry her on your back.

78
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:47,805
-You want me to carry her?
-Yes.

79
00:05:48,388 --> 00:05:50,099
Why should I carry her?

80
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:51,683
-Come here.
-Young Master.

81
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:54,353
No, but wait. My goodness.

82
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,063
Oh, my goodness.

83
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:59,399
Hey, Yul. All right.

84
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:01,068
Help me instead of Mu-deok.

85
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:05,739
I do not have the strength to walk.
Take me to Sejukwon.

86
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,992
Do you want me to carry him?

87
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:13,288
-No.
-All right. Thank you.

88
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,124
Maidservant Kim, be careful!

89
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:16,750
-Be careful with her!
-All right.

90
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,709
-Goodness.
-What…

91
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,795
Be careful.

92
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:21,630
Oh, dear.

93
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,633
Uk has opened

94
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:28,637
his gate of energy in the end.

95
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:30,931
Right.

96
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:36,854
He was even willing to end his life.
I could not just sit back and watch.

97
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:40,441
I guess he knew that

98
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:44,069
we would never just let him kill himself.

99
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:47,531
He probably poisoned himself

100
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:49,283
knowing he would get saved.

101
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:54,621
Are you all right?

102
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,793
Opening Uk's gate of energy
and treating him

103
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,629
has probably cost me
ten years' worth of energy.

104
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:07,801
So you not only opened his gate of energy,
but you even gave him extra energy?

105
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,430
What good would it be for an old man
to keep his energy saved up?

106
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,141
He was poisoned,

107
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:16,852
so I gave him some energy
to speed up his recovery.

108
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:20,856
Once Uk recovers,
you must retrieve it no matter what.

109
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:25,152
Is that really necessary
now that his gate of energy is open?

110
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:29,406
He is at least 20 years behind
when it comes to knowing spells.

111
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,909
Even if he begins training himself now,

112
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:36,747
he will at least have to be 60
to do anything impressive.

113
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,666
That is the fate he was given.

114
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:43,045
We must make sure of it.

115
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:48,091
If that is what you wish,
then I will retrieve it.

116
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:49,301
You know what?

117
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:52,888
I am too exhausted. I need a break.

118
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,849
Bring me some wine.

119
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,938
Wine?

120
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,107
I mean…

121
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,487
Why would there be wine
in the room of a practitioner?

122
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,821
I saw it.

123
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:13,116
I saw it hidden in your room.

124
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,537
Come on. The wine you drink
whenever you get lonely.

125
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,540
-I am not lonely!
-My gosh.

126
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,834
I am merely…

127
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:24,127
Gosh, I have a headache.

128
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:26,046
It is because of…

129
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:27,714
What was it called again?

130
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,299
Right. Insomnia.

131
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:31,718
I have very bad insomnia.

132
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,681
I merely take it for that.

133
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:45,482
Loneliness prevents you
from falling asleep.

134
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,859
You should have gotten married
when you were young.

135
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:53,574
Are you still not over Do-hwa?
Is that why you are alone?

136
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:06,420
It is empty.

137
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,463
-What?
-You finished it.

138
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:12,259
That is not possible. What?

139
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:17,514
What in the world…

140
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,225
I guess you were unbelievably lonely.

141
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,353
I only had a glass
every time I could not sleep.

142
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:25,564
I only had one glass each time…

143
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,782
This is the wine that
my uncle hides in his room.

144
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,492
It tastes quite nice.

145
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:41,705
Anyway, Uk's life-long dream
has finally come true.

146
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:43,040
So let us celebrate.

147
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,208
That girl, Mu-deok…

148
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,336
He recently brought her
from a brothel, right?

149
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:52,341
She risked her life for him
even though they only just met.

150
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:55,636
It is strange.

151
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:58,555
Uk saved her
from having to become a gisaeng.

152
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,933
She hated it so much that
she even pretended to be blind.

153
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:03,685
Have a drink.

154
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,978
"Blind"?

155
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:09,107
Yes. According to Ju-wol,
she was blind when she came

156
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,068
but could see just fine when she left.

157
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:13,070
The wine tastes great.

158
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:16,365
She easily deceives people.

159
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:20,619
She lied about being blind
and even said she poisoned Uk.

160
00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:24,247
She did not speak
even though she was tortured.

161
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,458
There is more to her than meets the eye.

162
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,086
On the outside,
she just looks cute and naive.

163
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:31,421
She seems to be hiding something.

164
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:40,806
-You finished it.
-What? What about it?

165
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:44,559
Your uncle is on his way here,

166
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:46,144
so I am guessing you are doomed.

167
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,773
-I did not drink any.
-Wait. Yul.

168
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:50,941
Yul!

169
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:55,070
-Oh, gosh.
-Dang-gu.

170
00:10:57,155 --> 00:10:58,490
I am dead.

171
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,535
Dang-gu.

172
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:04,621
It was you, right?

173
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,248
No.

174
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,921
Come here.

175
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,549
-Dang-gu.
-Yes, Uncle?

176
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:26,560
Is she breathing?

177
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:33,733
You are awake.

178
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:36,903
You kept passing out,
so I thought you might die.

179
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,658
Gosh.

180
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,078
Does it hurt a lot?

181
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:48,248
I think I broke my bones.

182
00:11:48,832 --> 00:11:50,083
They said you were fine.

183
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:52,711
-Really?
-Yes.

184
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:55,630
Then why does it hurt so much?

185
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,215
What a useless body.

186
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:00,218
Hey.

187
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,181
Why did you say you poisoned me?

188
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,642
If you pretended like
you did not know anything,

189
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,478
they would not have tortured you.

190
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,398
I had to make them believe
that you were dying.

191
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,526
Otherwise, they would not have
opened your gate of energy.

192
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,029
They just would have made an antidote.

193
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,616
So you really did risk your life.

194
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:28,497
I thought I might lose
at least an arm or a leg.

195
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:30,957
But I am surprisingly fine.

196
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,460
The people of Songrim are too nice.

197
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:35,337
If this is how they torture people…

198
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,424
By the way,

199
00:12:40,258 --> 00:12:42,719
you still seem pretty sick yourself.

200
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,554
Why are you here?

201
00:12:45,805 --> 00:12:48,099
Obviously to take care of you.

202
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:51,186
All the practitioners here are mages.

203
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:52,854
They cannot find out about you.

204
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:57,025
So I closed the door
when no one was looking,

205
00:12:57,108 --> 00:13:00,612
changed your clothes for you,
applied ointment on your wounds,

206
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:03,198
and gave you a massage
whenever you passed out.

207
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:06,743
-You did?
-Yes.

208
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:14,960
I am the only person who is safe enough
to come this close to you.

209
00:13:46,074 --> 00:13:47,325
All my life,

210
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:51,079
no one ever seemed to know
how desperate I was.

211
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:55,917
No one has ever risked their lives for me

212
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:58,420
like you did.

213
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:14,936
Since I survived as promised,

214
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,188
I will serve you as my master.

215
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,741
Up until now, I have served 12 masters.

216
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,745
People think I got kicked out every time,
but I was the one who left.

217
00:14:34,122 --> 00:14:36,875
But now, I have
finally found my true master.

218
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,878
So I shall kneel before you

219
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:42,213
and swear to serve you
as my master forever.

220
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,717
On one condition.

221
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:51,014
Do not tell anyone about our relationship.

222
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:53,975
You will continue to be my owner,

223
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:57,228
and I will continue to be your maid.

224
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:01,900
Also,

225
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:06,738
our relationship as master and pupil
will only last until you become the best

226
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:09,199
and help me get my energy back.

227
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:12,535
Only until then.

228
00:15:14,037 --> 00:15:16,998
The moment I get my energy back
and become Naksu again,

229
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,544
we will no longer be master and pupil.

230
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:24,422
Can you tell me why?

231
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:29,094
Because then,

232
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,472
you should no longer
have a reason to protect me,

233
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,350
nor should I have a reason…

234
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:40,063
to go easy on you.

235
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:51,700
So you want to part ways
once our business is done?

236
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:53,410
I see.

237
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:57,414
All right.

238
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:00,875
Once I am no longer of use to you,
you may abandon me.

239
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,586
Then I will respect your decision
and let you leave.

240
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:12,554
Now, kneel before your master.

241
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:21,104
I, Jang Uk, your pupil,

242
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:24,691
will serve and protect my master, Mu-deok,
with all my heart.

243
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:46,523
You have returned to your true self.

244
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:56,407
You will not run wild for a while.

245
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,286
Then I shall meet you in the royal palace.

246
00:18:09,462 --> 00:18:12,048
Feeding human souls
to soul shifters who run wild

247
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,134
allow them to continue to be of use.

248
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:19,222
Did you kill the gisaeng
that Naksu's soul has shifted into?

249
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:21,766
Yes, we threw the body away
in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

250
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,852
Did you check for the blue mark?

251
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:30,775
There is no blue mark.

252
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,570
She is not Naksu.

253
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,699
Yes, I checked.

254
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:41,244
The Naksu I used to know
would not have lost to you,

255
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:44,622
but she must have lost her energy
due to the body she is in.

256
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,459
Do soul shifters sometimes lose energy?

257
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,879
If a soul is too strong,

258
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:55,425
it enters an unbefitting body
and cannot access its energy.

259
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:57,260
Have you seen that before?

260
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:07,437
Your Majesty.

261
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,272
I am Master Jang's pupil, Jin Mu.

262
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:11,191
I heard you asked for me.

263
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:22,577
Jin Mu.

264
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:24,579
Yes, Your Majesty.

265
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:27,790
I am not the king.
I am your master, Jang Gang.

266
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:31,294
Right now, my soul has shifted
into the king's body.

267
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:44,015
Master, is that you?

268
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:47,560
Yes, the king and I have switched bodies.

269
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,021
Then where is His Majesty?

270
00:19:50,104 --> 00:19:51,898
His soul is inside my body.

271
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,567
I must get my body back.

272
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:57,654
But I cannot seem to retrieve my energy.

273
00:19:57,737 --> 00:20:00,490
I need you to help me.

274
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,284
Master.

275
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:06,746
I do not know
how the alchemy of souls works.

276
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,584
Go to the Cheonbugwan Secret Room
and bring me the Soul Ejector.

277
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,213
I shall teach you the alchemy of souls.

278
00:20:17,924 --> 00:20:21,010
He could not retrieve his energy
due to the weak body he was in,

279
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,096
which was why I was given a chance.

280
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:26,057
I was lucky.

281
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:30,478
Burn these bodies.

282
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:54,127
Search the brothel that
the dead gisaeng used to work at.

283
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,130
Find the owner of the Spirit Plaque,

284
00:20:58,214 --> 00:20:59,716
and do it discreetly.

285
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:01,384
Yes, sir.

286
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,483
What are you doing?

287
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,570
It is cold.

288
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:23,239
It is freezing.

289
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,075
Of course, it is cold.
So why are you sitting there?

290
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,080
I have never felt this cold before.

291
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,917
I would easily collapse
because my gate of energy was closed.

292
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:37,211
Even though I am shivering, I can stand.

293
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:39,964
I guess my gate of energy
is really open now.

294
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,467
If you master your spells,
you will neither feel cold on ice

295
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,010
nor hot walking on fire.

296
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:46,971
What were you like
before you shifted souls?

297
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,474
I had heard many rumors
since you were so infamous.

298
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:51,559
But I never actually saw you myself.

299
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:53,936
I heard you were pretty strong.

300
00:21:55,354 --> 00:21:59,734
I was not just strong.
I was extremely strong.

301
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:02,028
"Extremely"? I see.

302
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:05,656
In order to become the best mage,
you must go through several steps.

303
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:10,328
First is Jipsu, the ability
to gather the energy of water.

304
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:19,170
Second is Ryusu, the ability
to gain energy from the flow of water.

305
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:22,715
Then comes Chisu,
the ability to control the energy

306
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,219
in the atmosphere.

307
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:30,389
I am a mage
who has mastered all three steps.

308
00:22:30,473 --> 00:22:33,142
Not many in Daeho have mastered all three.

309
00:22:33,726 --> 00:22:36,938
I guess you really did
live up to your name.

310
00:22:37,688 --> 00:22:38,731
Yes.

311
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,776
I moved silently like a shadow,

312
00:22:42,485 --> 00:22:46,447
and the heads of my enemies
fell to the ground where I passed.

313
00:22:47,156 --> 00:22:48,699
I was Naksu,

314
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,536
the Shadow Assassin.

315
00:23:04,423 --> 00:23:06,425
I walked on water like I was flying,

316
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,720
and the wind blew as I passed by.

317
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:30,867
If I did this, it would rain.

318
00:23:34,745 --> 00:23:38,457
I am Naksu, the best mage in this land,

319
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:42,044
who even has the ability
to create snow and rain…

320
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,425
Are you all right?

321
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,053
All I did was run for a bit,

322
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,932
but it feels like
my lungs are going to explode.

323
00:23:59,812 --> 00:24:00,730
What is the matter?

324
00:24:00,813 --> 00:24:02,899
I have cramps!

325
00:24:02,982 --> 00:24:03,941
You have cramps?

326
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:07,236
These legs are short, skinny, weak,
and cannot stand the cold.

327
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,864
What a useless body.

328
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:15,745
Be careful. You are no longer Naksu,
the Shadow Assassin.

329
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:17,872
You are Mu-deok, our family maid.

330
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:21,083
You should not run around
like you did earlier.

331
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:22,752
You could get hurt.

332
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:25,671
I feel miserable.

333
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,761
Do not feel miserable. You have me.

334
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:34,805
Let us begin training
now that my gate of energy is open.

335
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:37,141
But first, put your shoes back on.
It is cold.

336
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:53,658
What was that for?

337
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,534
You are not agile.

338
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:57,745
Pick it up.

339
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:02,291
What are you doing?

340
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:06,712
Let me see how good my pupil is
so I can forget how miserable I feel.

341
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:07,964
What?

342
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:22,645
Why did you hit me?

343
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:24,730
You have no swordsmanship.

344
00:25:25,231 --> 00:25:26,315
Then show me how you fight.

345
00:25:42,665 --> 00:25:43,666
You little…

346
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,293
Gosh, that hurts.

347
00:25:57,805 --> 00:25:59,348
You fight poorly too.

348
00:26:01,058 --> 00:26:03,561
You are worse than what I had expected.

349
00:26:03,644 --> 00:26:06,480
That is because I never learned properly!

350
00:26:10,651 --> 00:26:12,611
You had 12 masters.

351
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:15,698
You may not have been able
to learn how to cast spells,

352
00:26:15,781 --> 00:26:19,160
but you could have learned
basic martial arts.

353
00:26:19,243 --> 00:26:21,412
I did not feel motivated to do so.

354
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:22,496
As you already know,

355
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,832
I need to feel motivated
in order to do something.

356
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:26,834
Because you are lazy.

357
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:31,088
I have noticed that
you never do anything around the house.

358
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,299
I know everything by heart. Test me.

359
00:26:33,382 --> 00:26:35,009
How do you think I recognized you?

360
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:37,595
It was because I saw you using Tansu.
I know it all.

361
00:26:38,095 --> 00:26:39,347
You are all talk.

362
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,931
I can do more than talk now.

363
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,644
Did you just see that?

364
00:26:45,728 --> 00:26:47,355
I am a quick learner.

365
00:26:47,438 --> 00:26:50,316
I will quickly master Jipsu.
How long does it take?

366
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:52,526
I was a fast learner,
but I took five years.

367
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,403
Those who are slow take 20 years.

368
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,613
As for you…

369
00:26:57,156 --> 00:26:59,116
You may master it pretty quickly

370
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,160
since you are Jang Gang's son.

371
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,121
What does he have to do with this?

372
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:07,083
He was a genius
who only took a year to master Jipsu.

373
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,085
If you achieve that,

374
00:27:09,168 --> 00:27:11,754
rumors that say
you are not his son will subside.

375
00:27:11,837 --> 00:27:13,964
But of course,
I doubt it will be possible.

376
00:27:14,465 --> 00:27:16,634
If he took a year,
I will do it in six months.

377
00:27:16,717 --> 00:27:18,594
No, I will do it in three months.

378
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:20,012
You are bluffing.

379
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,015
I am determined, so do not discourage me.

380
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,188
Maidservant Kim asked me
to sweep the entire yard.

381
00:27:29,688 --> 00:27:31,190
You have recovered a lot,

382
00:27:31,273 --> 00:27:34,193
and you seem to be doing better,
so help me out.

383
00:27:37,154 --> 00:27:38,030
What…

384
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,117
Mu-deok.

385
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,579
I am a lazy guy who does not do things
he does not feel motivated to do.

386
00:27:47,456 --> 00:27:48,582
Good luck.

387
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,918
That little…

388
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:53,087
-That…
-It is cold. How chilly.

389
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,506
That lazy, useless show-off!

390
00:27:55,589 --> 00:27:58,801
It is so chilly. It is way too cold.

391
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:08,060
Master Heo has made
herbal medicine for Uk.

392
00:28:08,602 --> 00:28:10,187
It seems to be extremely effective

393
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:14,066
now that Young Master's
gate of energy is open.

394
00:28:15,192 --> 00:28:19,405
Maidservant Kim, you seem very delighted.

395
00:28:20,948 --> 00:28:24,285
Are you really that upset
that his gate of energy is open?

396
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,248
You did not do anything
even when he was about to die.

397
00:28:30,332 --> 00:28:34,128
If not for Master Heo,
Young Master Jang would have died.

398
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:38,048
He should have looked for a way
to save him without opening his gate.

399
00:28:38,132 --> 00:28:39,383
How cold of you.

400
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:43,053
You have always kept a distance
from Young Master Jang.

401
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:44,138
Is it…

402
00:28:45,222 --> 00:28:46,474
because of the rumors?

403
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:54,398
What rumors?

404
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,733
Of course, you would know.

405
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,527
You know that there are
rumors going around

406
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,906
saying you are the father
of Young Master Jang.

407
00:29:03,365 --> 00:29:05,951
Do not dare to speak of

408
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:09,789
such absurd rumors!

409
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:12,500
It is not completely absurd.

410
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:15,711
Let us be honest. We both know that

411
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,631
you used to fancy Madam Do-hwa
before she got married.

412
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:22,927
You used to write her poems
and give her gifts.

413
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,178
I am a living witness.

414
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,224
People say you are still single
because you are not yet over her.

415
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:30,559
What about you, Maidservant Kim?

416
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,938
Are you still head over heels
for Jang Gang?

417
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:38,234
Is that why you are unmarried
and still living in his house?

418
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:39,693
What?

419
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:43,739
I know very well
how much you used to like him.

420
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,117
When he told you that
he liked acorn jelly,

421
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:48,953
you climbed mountains to collect acorns

422
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:50,955
-like some kind of a squirrel.
-A squirrel?

423
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:53,415
I saw you going around collecting acorns.

424
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,546
What is your point?

425
00:29:59,588 --> 00:30:03,843
Are you making fun of the fact that
I went around collecting acorns?

426
00:30:06,136 --> 00:30:07,304
Fine!

427
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,432
I admit I went here and there
to collect acorns.

428
00:30:11,016 --> 00:30:14,854
Making acorn jelly was the only way
I could express my feelings for him.

429
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:18,065
You can mock me all you want.

430
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,490
I am not mocking you.

431
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,619
Seeing you make all that acorn jelly…

432
00:30:32,538 --> 00:30:33,831
made me feel sad.

433
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:38,085
I know how it feels

434
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,797
to be in a situation
where you cannot do anything

435
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:43,799
for the person you love.

436
00:30:46,176 --> 00:30:47,303
Other people can say

437
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,556
what they want to say about us
behind our backs,

438
00:30:51,223 --> 00:30:54,643
but let us not do the same to each other.

439
00:30:57,229 --> 00:31:00,566
It is obvious to us both
that the passionate love we had

440
00:31:01,817 --> 00:31:04,403
back when we were young

441
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:07,907
only ended up
leaving a scar in our hearts.

442
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,290
I got too worked up
about Young Master Jang

443
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,251
and said things I should not have said.

444
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,628
Forgive me.

445
00:31:22,087 --> 00:31:24,924
I also care for Uk greatly.

446
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:28,677
I am just afraid that
opening his gate of energy

447
00:31:29,678 --> 00:31:33,307
might have broken the barrier
that is protecting him.

448
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,476
It just makes me feel anxious.

449
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,979
I may have to break his will

450
00:31:40,814 --> 00:31:43,442
and stop him in the future.

451
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:48,280
Please do not resent me for that.

452
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:51,992
Let us see how things go.

453
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:02,586
Young Master, this is wild ginseng tea.

454
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,463
Drink up.

455
00:32:04,546 --> 00:32:05,673
"Wild ginseng"?

456
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:08,008
I will drink it after I return. Leave it.

457
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,259
Are you trying

458
00:32:09,843 --> 00:32:11,428
to give it to Mu-deok again?

459
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:14,640
It is cold outside.
She deserves something nice and warm.

460
00:32:15,474 --> 00:32:18,018
Why did you make her
sweep the yard out in the cold?

461
00:32:19,353 --> 00:32:20,396
Wait.

462
00:32:21,313 --> 00:32:23,607
That maid is getting treated for free.

463
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,609
So I asked her to do her part.

464
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,487
Why does it have to be her?
Could you not do it instead?

465
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:32,533
I need to heat up your medicine,
prepare your meals,

466
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:33,742
and take care of you.

467
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,286
Mu-deok will take care of me.
You do not need to worry.

468
00:32:39,456 --> 00:32:40,708
Oh, I see.

469
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:43,002
So you only care about Mu-deok.

470
00:32:44,503 --> 00:32:46,088
Since I am now considered useless,

471
00:32:46,171 --> 00:32:49,925
I will go outside
and sweep the yard just like Mu-deok.

472
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:57,391
It is just that I feel like
I am putting you through a lot.

473
00:32:57,474 --> 00:33:00,561
How long did it take for you
to boil this wild ginseng?

474
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:02,521
I boiled it for the entire day.

475
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:05,149
That is my point.
You did not get to sleep a wink.

476
00:33:05,232 --> 00:33:07,901
How do you think that makes me feel?

477
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:10,946
-Not good.
-Right?

478
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,450
I know I put you through a lot
with all the trouble I caused.

479
00:33:15,826 --> 00:33:19,913
Look at how tired you look.
You used to have porcelain skin.

480
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,708
You should be the one
drinking this wild ginseng tea.

481
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:26,045
So will you stop causing so much trouble?

482
00:33:26,128 --> 00:33:27,963
I do not know what to say to the leader.

483
00:33:28,547 --> 00:33:29,965
If he punishes me, so be it.

484
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:33,886
My gates are open now,
which means I will be a part of Songrim.

485
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:40,100
Are you that happy
that your gates of energy are open?

486
00:33:40,726 --> 00:33:42,352
Yes, I am.

487
00:33:43,103 --> 00:33:46,148
Once I enter Songrim
and become better than Yul and Dang-gu,

488
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:48,650
they will regret
not having taken me in sooner.

489
00:33:52,654 --> 00:33:54,531
Maidservant Kim, you can have the ginseng.

490
00:33:55,282 --> 00:33:57,618
Thank you for the ginseng.
I appreciate it.

491
00:33:57,701 --> 00:33:58,827
-Sure.
-Thanks.

492
00:34:12,841 --> 00:34:15,719
You must be the spiteful maid.

493
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,763
What are you doing? We gave you treatment.

494
00:34:17,846 --> 00:34:19,014
Your wounds could get infected.

495
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,809
I got treated for free,

496
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:24,436
so I was told to work to show gratitude.

497
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,563
Maidservant Kim is a wise woman.

498
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:30,150
Sweep the yard nice and clean.
Then manure the medicinal herb garden.

499
00:34:31,026 --> 00:34:32,027
All right.

500
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,571
You just wait, Heo Yeom.

501
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:37,032
Right now, I may be
sweeping your front yard.

502
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,992
But one day, I will get rid of Sejukwon.

503
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:44,540
Hey! Watch it.

504
00:34:44,623 --> 00:34:46,250
Was that on purpose?

505
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:47,751
No.

506
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,711
I think it was on purpose.

507
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:50,963
That is absurd.

508
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:56,802
You are an odd one.

509
00:34:57,594 --> 00:34:58,846
This ear…

510
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:01,807
I have seen this ear before.

511
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:07,813
Have I ever treated you before?

512
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,484
How would I be able to afford
getting treated at Sejukwon?

513
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,490
This ear looks familiar somehow.

514
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:25,414
Sweep the yard properly.

515
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,918
He almost ripped my ear out.

516
00:35:30,752 --> 00:35:32,296
I know it hurts, but bear with it.

517
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:35,716
He is angry with Young Master Jang
and is taking it out on you.

518
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:39,928
It is normal to pick on the weak.
That is how the world works.

519
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,055
I will just stay quiet.

520
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:44,183
If that is the case,
try not to resent him.

521
00:35:44,266 --> 00:35:46,143
He gave ten years' worth
of his torrent of energy

522
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:48,187
to help your young master heal faster.

523
00:35:48,937 --> 00:35:50,814
Get some rest once you are done.

524
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:56,737
Ten years' worth of his torrent of energy?

525
00:36:08,373 --> 00:36:10,000
What took you so long?

526
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:12,211
Come here. This is wild ginseng--

527
00:36:13,128 --> 00:36:14,213
What is it, Mu-deok?

528
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:16,006
What are you doing?

529
00:36:16,882 --> 00:36:18,050
Stay still.

530
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,928
This is not what I had in mind
when I brought you here.

531
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:23,263
Mu-deok, this is wrong.
I am your pupil. Stop it.

532
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,850
My gosh.

533
00:36:31,897 --> 00:36:33,398
What are you doing right now?

534
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,816
I am checking the core of your energy.

535
00:36:36,902 --> 00:36:38,028
Breathe properly.

536
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,213
It is there.

537
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,258
It really is inside.

538
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,010
You really are special.

539
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,887
Cut it out.

540
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,390
What is inside my stomach?

541
00:37:06,473 --> 00:37:07,933
A great torrent of energy.

542
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,894
Heo Yeom placed a torrent of energy
in your stomach.

543
00:37:12,854 --> 00:37:14,231
A torrent of energy?

544
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:25,158
Uk seems to have recovered now.

545
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:27,869
It is time you retrieve
the torrent of energy you gave him.

546
00:37:27,953 --> 00:37:31,039
If it surges the wrong way,
it could make him go mad.

547
00:37:31,748 --> 00:37:34,584
Uk will not be able to use it.

548
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,629
His gate of energy just opened.

549
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,132
There is nothing he can actually do.

550
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:41,591
You are worried for nothing.

551
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:46,722
He probably does not even know
that there is something great inside him.

552
00:37:49,683 --> 00:37:51,768
Let us steal Heo Yeom's torrent of energy.

553
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:57,316
The core of your energy is filled
with the energy that Heo Yeom gave you.

554
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:00,360
You are now strong enough
to use Jipsu with ease.

555
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,196
I had no idea that
something so precious was inside me.

556
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,575
It takes ten years to gather
this kind of torrent. You got it for free.

557
00:38:06,658 --> 00:38:08,869
And it is Heo Yeom's,
the best you could ask for.

558
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,121
You are one lucky punk.

559
00:38:11,204 --> 00:38:15,459
I thought that old man hated me.
I am surprised he gave me this.

560
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:18,545
He probably gave it to you
to help you recover.

561
00:38:18,628 --> 00:38:19,880
He will take it back soon.

562
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:23,342
He cannot do that.
It is in my stomach, so it is mine.

563
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:25,510
If you do not have
the power to control it,

564
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:28,472
it cannot become yours.
He can take it back whenever.

565
00:38:28,555 --> 00:38:31,183
To keep this, I need to be able
to control energy,

566
00:38:31,266 --> 00:38:34,269
which means I need to breathe
just like the source of the energy.

567
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:38,106
I guess those 12 masters
taught you a thing or two.

568
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,275
Correct.

569
00:38:41,568 --> 00:38:44,571
The energy from your core
is controlled by your breathing.

570
00:38:44,654 --> 00:38:46,865
However, every mage breathes differently.

571
00:38:46,948 --> 00:38:50,619
There is a difference in how much air
one breathes in and out.

572
00:38:51,745 --> 00:38:55,499
It is Heo Yeom's energy,
so we must control it with his breathing.

573
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:58,377
I doubt he will teach me.

574
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,588
Should we just try everything?
After all, it is just breathing.

575
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:05,717
If you use someone else's breathing,
you could lose control and go mad.

576
00:39:06,468 --> 00:39:10,639
You will shed blood
from every hole in your body and die.

577
00:39:10,722 --> 00:39:12,015
Should we still try?

578
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,059
No.

579
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,270
You are way too extreme.

580
00:39:18,146 --> 00:39:21,316
Think of a way to keep me alive
along with this energy, Master.

581
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:26,988
The most basic breathing skill
is handed down to you by your family.

582
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:28,990
Heo Yeom is a member of the Seo family.

583
00:39:29,074 --> 00:39:32,202
So anyone from that family
will use the same breathing technique.

584
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,706
-Seo Yul.
-Seo Yul.

585
00:39:45,298 --> 00:39:47,509
Go ask him. You said you were close.

586
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:49,136
Yul is a careful guy.

587
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:53,014
If I ask,
he will catch on and tell Heo Yeom.

588
00:39:54,766 --> 00:39:56,184
Just ten breaths…

589
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,979
No, seven will be enough.

590
00:39:59,062 --> 00:40:01,898
I will be able to know
by putting a hand on his core of energy.

591
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,860
He will break your hand
before his first breath.

592
00:40:05,527 --> 00:40:08,280
You have a point. He is not like you.

593
00:40:09,614 --> 00:40:10,699
Me?

594
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:12,993
What is wrong with me?

595
00:40:15,078 --> 00:40:18,457
What? What is with
that condescending look?

596
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,877
Anyway, I do not think
I can do to him what I did to you.

597
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,420
No, wait. Mu-deok.

598
00:40:23,503 --> 00:40:25,046
Look at me in the eyes.

599
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,467
So you feel uneasy about touching him
unlike how you felt with me?

600
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,136
You are so immature.
How is that even important?

601
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,804
"Immature"?

602
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:35,682
Yes, it is important.

603
00:40:35,765 --> 00:40:37,684
Are you insane? What are you doing?

604
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:38,602
I am sane.

605
00:40:38,685 --> 00:40:41,021
-No, let us say I am insane.
-Let go of me.

606
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:44,774
What are you doing?

607
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:47,360
Hey.

608
00:40:49,362 --> 00:40:52,365
Why do you keep badgering Mu-deok?

609
00:40:52,991 --> 00:40:54,034
She is still sick.

610
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:56,161
I was not badgering her.

611
00:40:57,704 --> 00:40:59,206
-Seriously?
-Goodness.

612
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:00,874
I thought you were being nice.

613
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,793
Mu-deok, are you all right?

614
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,256
Your young master expects
a lot from you, does he not?

615
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,551
You not only need to care for him,
but you must keep him amused too.

616
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,845
He asks for warm water,
but when I bring it,

617
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,347
he asks for cold water again…

618
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,307
-Hey, that--
-He says something is salty,

619
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,059
but later on, he complains it is bland.

620
00:41:19,142 --> 00:41:21,436
-Me?
-He is immature and fickle.

621
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,897
He is lazy but full of himself.

622
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,066
But what can I do?

623
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:27,442
He is my young master,

624
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,486
so I have no choice but to serve him.

625
00:41:30,153 --> 00:41:32,489
Mu-deok, you seem to know
a lot about him already.

626
00:41:32,572 --> 00:41:33,907
I am embarrassed for you.

627
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:39,120
Anyway, what are you two doing here?
Why are you not at Sejukwon?

628
00:41:42,874 --> 00:41:45,502
We were looking at Yul.

629
00:41:45,585 --> 00:41:46,795
Mu-deok asked me to come.

630
00:41:49,214 --> 00:41:50,215
Yul?

631
00:41:51,174 --> 00:41:53,927
Why not go see him up close?

632
00:41:55,011 --> 00:41:56,137
We were doing it in secret.

633
00:41:56,721 --> 00:42:00,350
Mu-deok seemed to feel uneasy
about approaching him,

634
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:01,560
so I stayed with her.

635
00:42:04,729 --> 00:42:08,149
Mu-deok, you must have feelings for Yul.

636
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:10,235
-No--
-Dang-gu.

637
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:12,195
You caught on very quickly.

638
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,114
This is making me blush.

639
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:17,617
-Young Master! This is a misunderstanding.
-Do not be shy.

640
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,620
Many women have fallen for Yul.

641
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,372
-It is natural you feel that way.
-It is not…

642
00:42:22,455 --> 00:42:24,583
I will help Mu-deok.

643
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:26,251
Uk, go to the reception room.

644
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:27,544
Why?

645
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,170
Master Heo wants to see you.

646
00:42:29,254 --> 00:42:30,255
Master Heo?

647
00:42:53,653 --> 00:42:55,905
Goodness.

648
00:42:58,408 --> 00:43:00,118
I heard you asked for me.

649
00:43:02,245 --> 00:43:03,246
Yes.

650
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,374
The sound of your cough is nice and clear.

651
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,209
I guess you are feeling much better.

652
00:43:08,293 --> 00:43:10,670
I still feel dizzy and nauseous.

653
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,881
I also keep fainting.

654
00:43:13,506 --> 00:43:16,009
But I am getting better thanks to you.

655
00:43:16,092 --> 00:43:18,178
I saw you and your maid

656
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:22,098
energetically walking around this morning.

657
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,683
How strange is that?

658
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,811
Hey, come stand here.

659
00:43:27,687 --> 00:43:29,314
I need to take something from you.

660
00:43:31,316 --> 00:43:32,150
Before you do,

661
00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:34,778
I brought something for you.

662
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:37,572
For me?

663
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:39,991
Back when I was a child,

664
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,327
I let loose a bunch of goats
in your medicinal herb garden,

665
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:44,162
and I know you have hated me since.

666
00:43:44,245 --> 00:43:47,916
Those goats ate all the medicinal herbs

667
00:43:47,999 --> 00:43:49,918
and are still living to this day.

668
00:43:50,001 --> 00:43:52,295
Even so, you still saved my life

669
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:55,298
and kept me alive.
I am extremely grateful for that.

670
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,550
I thought you were a complete lout,

671
00:43:57,634 --> 00:44:00,720
but I guess you have learned
how to express your gratitude.

672
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,847
I have prepared something for you.

673
00:44:03,431 --> 00:44:04,474
Maidservant Kim.

674
00:44:26,663 --> 00:44:30,250
This wine was made with spring water
from a volcanic island in Southern Daeho.

675
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:33,545
It is dark wine,
the best wine you can find in Daeho.

676
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,340
Young Master Jang said
he wanted to thank you,

677
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,885
so I went through great lengths
to acquire it.

678
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:47,183
This is a rare delicacy.

679
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,398
But do I only get one bottle?

680
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:11,291
You are a man who knows
how to express your gratitude!

681
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:15,879
Maidservant Kim, you raised him well.

682
00:45:15,962 --> 00:45:17,422
-You really did.
-Thank you.

683
00:45:17,964 --> 00:45:19,424
Bring it here. Come on.

684
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:21,551
My goodness gracious.

685
00:45:25,221 --> 00:45:27,265
Three bottles?

686
00:45:32,687 --> 00:45:33,771
Mother.

687
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,733
Uk's gate of energy has opened.

688
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:41,946
We could not do anything until now
because of the Gwanju's orders,

689
00:45:43,072 --> 00:45:46,659
but does this mean we can
accept him into the family now?

690
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:50,330
That boy called off the engagement
after he used you.

691
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:52,665
Yet you still like him?

692
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:55,627
I was the one
who used him to my advantage.

693
00:45:56,127 --> 00:45:58,588
His gate of energy was closed,
so I used it against him

694
00:45:58,671 --> 00:46:00,381
to try and make him live with us.

695
00:46:00,465 --> 00:46:02,050
Do not distort the truth.

696
00:46:02,133 --> 00:46:05,512
He offered to come live with us
if we helped him open his gate.

697
00:46:05,595 --> 00:46:06,930
That is how he seduced you.

698
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,060
It ended up happening anyway.

699
00:46:12,143 --> 00:46:15,271
If you had opened
his gate of energy back then,

700
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,440
you would have gotten a son-in-law,

701
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:21,653
and I would have married
the man I wanted to marry.

702
00:46:23,988 --> 00:46:25,114
Cho-yeon.

703
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:28,493
The son of the Jang family
whose gate of energy is now open

704
00:46:28,576 --> 00:46:30,745
will never become my son-in-law.

705
00:46:32,121 --> 00:46:34,874
You will have to take your sister's place

706
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,711
and become the leader
that guards Jinyowon for the family.

707
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,715
Find a man who will support your cause.

708
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,135
If my sister had not died,

709
00:46:46,928 --> 00:46:49,097
I would have gotten married
to the man I loved.

710
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,897
I apologize, Mother.

711
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:03,194
Go and see if Gwigu's pottery
is back in one piece again.

712
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:05,697
All right.

713
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,789
Uk even broke this precious Gwigu.

714
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,796
What if I ask him to marry me in return?

715
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,174
I bet he will refuse.

716
00:48:12,096 --> 00:48:15,892
So Yul sleeps in the room
that is at the very far end?

717
00:48:15,975 --> 00:48:19,187
Yes. He enjoys peace and quiet.

718
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,398
What time does he go to bed?

719
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:24,359
If he is not busy,

720
00:48:24,442 --> 00:48:27,654
he normally sleeps early
and wakes up early too.

721
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,073
Why do you ask?

722
00:48:30,156 --> 00:48:32,033
So you can visit him during his sleep?

723
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:35,495
No matter how much you like him,
that is wrong.

724
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:39,791
Here is a tip.

725
00:48:39,874 --> 00:48:42,794
He always eats at the same hour,
so go see him in the dining hall.

726
00:48:44,003 --> 00:48:45,254
All right.

727
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:48,633
I need to do more than just see him.
I need to touch him.

728
00:49:06,275 --> 00:49:07,860
Mu-deok, are you all right?

729
00:49:11,906 --> 00:49:13,074
Hey, Yul.

730
00:49:16,202 --> 00:49:18,746
Outsiders are not allowed
to read the books in Jeongjingak.

731
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,916
She is only here to help.

732
00:49:21,999 --> 00:49:23,876
Besides, they are all about magic spells.

733
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,837
She would not understand anyway.

734
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:28,965
You are quite nimble.

735
00:49:30,299 --> 00:49:31,884
Do you know martial arts?

736
00:49:34,887 --> 00:49:37,640
I learned how to dance at the brothel.

737
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:42,437
That is why I am nimble.

738
00:49:46,774 --> 00:49:49,902
Where is Dong-i?
I need to ask for something.

739
00:49:52,488 --> 00:49:55,366
Well, Dong-i is not here but Mu-deok is.

740
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,369
Mu-deok, come and help him out.

741
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,746
I will help you.

742
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:01,831
No, that is not necessary.

743
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:20,224
Shall I clean up, Young Master?

744
00:50:24,061 --> 00:50:26,939
Young Master, are you going to eat?
What would you like to eat?

745
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:31,194
Young Master! I will…

746
00:50:43,748 --> 00:50:47,335
This is where the Jeongjingak mages live.
Do not follow me any longer.

747
00:50:52,757 --> 00:50:56,135
I heard he sleeps early.
I wonder if he is going to bed already.

748
00:51:09,774 --> 00:51:11,108
Is this the bathhouse?

749
00:51:19,492 --> 00:51:21,744
I told you to leave.
Why do you keep following me?

750
00:51:24,455 --> 00:51:28,876
I still figured there might be
something I could do.

751
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,753
Is there

752
00:51:32,171 --> 00:51:33,798
something you want from me?

753
00:51:38,886 --> 00:51:41,514
I need to touch it. Now is the chance.

754
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:45,142
What made you follow me
all the way to the men's bathhouse?

755
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:22,346
This is my chance. Six breaths
and I will know how he breathes.

756
00:52:25,224 --> 00:52:26,183
One.

757
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,144
Two.

758
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,189
Three.

759
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,025
Four.

760
00:52:50,207 --> 00:52:51,250
What was that for?

761
00:52:51,834 --> 00:52:54,003
I was so close to figuring it out.

762
00:52:54,086 --> 00:52:56,172
I know you also stared at me
from afar with Uk.

763
00:52:56,255 --> 00:52:57,715
Why did you follow me?

764
00:52:59,091 --> 00:53:01,552
I just need him to take one more breath.

765
00:53:02,595 --> 00:53:03,471
Give me an answer.

766
00:53:04,221 --> 00:53:05,723
I am in love with you!

767
00:53:31,624 --> 00:53:32,625
Are you all right?

768
00:53:33,709 --> 00:53:35,002
It hurts.

769
00:53:51,143 --> 00:53:54,814
You must be after my breathing technique.
You keep reaching for my core of energy.

770
00:53:55,564 --> 00:53:57,400
But I am in love with you.

771
00:53:57,483 --> 00:53:58,943
You are such an adept liar.

772
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,821
I bet that move earlier
was martial arts too.

773
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,031
I lived a harsh life,

774
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:06,534
so I learned a few moves
just to keep myself safe.

775
00:54:06,617 --> 00:54:08,202
Are you doing this for Uk?

776
00:54:10,496 --> 00:54:13,416
I guess he is trying to control
the torrent of energy inside him.

777
00:54:13,499 --> 00:54:16,419
But Uk will not succeed
even with my breathing technique.

778
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,133
Stop wasting your time.
Just get treated and leave.

779
00:54:42,069 --> 00:54:43,988
So you remember me,

780
00:54:44,989 --> 00:54:46,115
Yul.

781
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:16,122
I did not ignore you because I hated you.

782
00:56:16,205 --> 00:56:19,750
Your mother, Do-hwa,
was like a daughter to me.

783
00:56:20,334 --> 00:56:22,670
I am pretty much your grandfather.

784
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,340
You little lout.

785
00:56:28,759 --> 00:56:30,636
Right, Grandfather.

786
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:38,018
Your mother, Do-hwa,
was extremely kind-hearted.

787
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,063
Was she?

788
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:45,234
Yes, she was! You need to know that.

789
00:56:45,317 --> 00:56:48,446
Always remember that
and ignore what everyone else says.

790
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:53,200
That poor kid…

791
00:56:56,287 --> 00:57:00,166
The length and depth of how much air
he inhales and exhales.

792
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,346
That is hard to play. I am impressed.

793
00:57:15,848 --> 00:57:17,766
I know how to do many things.

794
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:20,686
I would like it back.

795
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:28,194
It looks very old.

796
00:57:28,277 --> 00:57:30,738
Why do you have something so old?

797
00:57:34,575 --> 00:57:36,243
It belongs to an old friend.

798
00:57:42,374 --> 00:57:45,211
Seeing that you have it
instead of your friend,

799
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:48,047
I am guessing that friend is gone.

800
00:57:52,384 --> 00:57:53,552
Yes.

801
00:57:54,386 --> 00:57:55,888
It belonged to that friend.

802
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:00,726
It means a lot to me, so give it back.

803
00:58:02,311 --> 00:58:06,315
Then in return for giving it back,
teach me your breathing technique.

804
00:58:08,901 --> 00:58:11,403
You said it was
going to be useless anyway.

805
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:13,697
To me, this is just as useless.

806
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:15,616
So let us trade.

807
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,871
This means nothing to me,

808
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:23,374
so I could even break it.

809
00:58:40,766 --> 00:58:42,268
Only three breaths.

810
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,477
Where is she?

811
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,173
What is that look on your face?

812
00:59:54,715 --> 00:59:57,051
That is no ordinary look.

813
00:59:59,595 --> 01:00:00,763
I like him.

814
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:07,061
You set it up that way.

815
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:11,315
I followed Yul around saying I liked him
and finally found out.

816
01:00:11,398 --> 01:00:12,608
I see.

817
01:00:13,442 --> 01:00:16,445
You are a sensitive person
who kills everyone who gets near,

818
01:00:16,528 --> 01:00:19,782
but you decided to fancy a guy
just so you could help your pupil.

819
01:00:20,824 --> 01:00:22,034
What about you?

820
01:00:22,117 --> 01:00:24,787
I hope you did not let Heo Yeom
retrieve his torrent of energy.

821
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:27,206
It is safe inside me.
I found out his breathing technique too.

822
01:00:27,289 --> 01:00:28,749
So you wasted your time.

823
01:00:28,832 --> 01:00:31,377
You found out? Do not lie to me.

824
01:00:32,002 --> 01:00:33,295
I bet you are bluffing

825
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:35,547
just to act like
you did something important.

826
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:37,675
I breathed the way he did,

827
01:00:37,758 --> 01:00:40,052
and I think I feel something
moving inside me.

828
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,937
The energy is surging inside you.

829
01:00:51,355 --> 01:00:52,690
It worked.

830
01:00:55,442 --> 01:00:57,152
Were you this close with Yul?

831
01:00:58,779 --> 01:01:00,864
Be careful. I can still see
the mark in your eyes.

832
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:03,867
I kept using the eye drops.

833
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,496
I didn't see the mark in the mirror.
Do you still see it?

834
01:01:07,579 --> 01:01:09,123
I can see if I look this close.

835
01:01:09,206 --> 01:01:11,166
If you really like him,
this is how close you will get.

836
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,043
So be careful who you fall for.

837
01:01:14,795 --> 01:01:16,088
Only I get to come this close.

838
01:01:18,757 --> 01:01:21,343
Fine. I will only allow it to you.

839
01:01:23,303 --> 01:01:25,139
I will try not to fall for Yul.

840
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:27,891
What?

841
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:30,060
Why does that require effort?

842
01:01:30,769 --> 01:01:32,271
He is handsome.

843
01:01:32,354 --> 01:01:35,190
It takes effort
not to fall for a handsome man.

844
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:36,483
What about me?

845
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:39,737
I guess you have been trying hard
not to fall for me as well.

846
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:40,946
Not at all.

847
01:01:41,947 --> 01:01:43,824
Why not? It makes no sense.

848
01:01:43,907 --> 01:01:46,452
-Just tell me it has been hard.
-Yes, Young Master.

849
01:01:46,535 --> 01:01:48,287
-Say it like you mean it.
-Yes.

850
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:50,205
-Will you keep this up?
-Yes.

851
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:51,707
Come on. Humor me.

852
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:27,719
Your Royal Highness.

853
01:03:28,637 --> 01:03:30,889
Judging by the energy on your sword,

854
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:33,725
you have reached the highest stage
of the second step, Ryusu.

855
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:38,313
It is all thanks to your guidance,

856
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:40,899
Assistant Gwanju.

857
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,652
The only person
who is on a similar level as you

858
01:03:43,735 --> 01:03:45,988
is probably Seo Yul from the Seo family.

859
01:03:46,822 --> 01:03:50,492
Her Majesty the Queen and Yul's father,
General Seo, are siblings.

860
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,703
Yul and I were close as kids,

861
01:03:52,786 --> 01:03:54,705
but things changed
after he joined Songrim.

862
01:03:57,124 --> 01:04:00,961
Seo Yul, Park Dang-gu, Jang Uk,
and Jin Cho-yeon are known

863
01:04:01,044 --> 01:04:02,796
to some people as Four Seasons.

864
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:05,424
Let them have their fun.

865
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,050
But wait.

866
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:09,845
Why is Jang Uk part of the group
when he cannot cast spells?

867
01:04:10,804 --> 01:04:12,389
He can now.

868
01:04:13,098 --> 01:04:14,516
His gate of energy has opened.

869
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:16,977
His gate of energy has opened?

870
01:04:20,272 --> 01:04:22,274
But there is not much he can do.

871
01:04:22,357 --> 01:04:24,776
He is the son of Jang Gang,
Cheonbugwan's Gwanju.

872
01:04:26,278 --> 01:04:27,362
Recently,

873
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:30,157
he came and asked me for Naksu's sword.

874
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:33,160
And?

875
01:04:36,204 --> 01:04:38,206
Are you afraid I will do it?

876
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:39,583
So did you give it to him?

877
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:42,127
His Majesty ordered you
to keep it inside Cheonbugwan.

878
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:45,631
The Gwanju position belongs
to a member of the Jang family,

879
01:04:46,298 --> 01:04:47,549
so I had no choice.

880
01:04:49,885 --> 01:04:51,511
How rude of him.

881
01:04:51,595 --> 01:04:53,472
He was probably looking down on me.

882
01:04:54,306 --> 01:04:56,558
After all, I was his father's pupil.

883
01:04:56,642 --> 01:05:00,020
If you think about it,
I was not even an official pupil.

884
01:05:01,271 --> 01:05:04,149
I had nowhere to go
after I got kicked out by the Jin family,

885
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:07,069
and he took me in as his servant.

886
01:05:07,861 --> 01:05:10,197
You are the teacher
of this country's crown prince.

887
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,032
How dare he look down on you.

888
01:05:12,115 --> 01:05:13,992
That is the same thing as insulting me.

889
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,203
I just want to apologize that

890
01:05:17,162 --> 01:05:20,290
your teacher is someone
who comes from a low status.

891
01:05:25,045 --> 01:05:26,296
One of these days,

892
01:05:27,172 --> 01:05:29,508
I must crush that Jang Uk.

893
01:05:50,153 --> 01:05:52,698
That sword belongs to Gwanju Jang,
Jang Uk's father.

894
01:05:54,199 --> 01:05:55,283
I once…

895
01:05:56,368 --> 01:05:58,745
promised to take him in
if he successfully unsheathed

896
01:05:59,496 --> 01:06:01,123
his father's sword.

897
01:06:01,206 --> 01:06:03,792
Now that his gate of energy is open,
it will be possible.

898
01:06:04,376 --> 01:06:07,546
Are you going to let Uk
become a mage of Songrim?

899
01:06:09,965 --> 01:06:12,634
Go bring Uk.

900
01:06:21,977 --> 01:06:25,230
What did you say?
The father of this child is whom?

901
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:27,441
The late king.

902
01:06:28,817 --> 01:06:30,694
He is the king's son!

903
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,656
Are you saying he is the son

904
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:38,201
of His Majesty who died last year?

905
01:06:38,785 --> 01:06:40,120
The late king

906
01:06:40,787 --> 01:06:43,623
passed due to a severe illness
and could not even move.

907
01:06:43,707 --> 01:06:44,875
So how is that possible?

908
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:46,543
The day this child was born,

909
01:06:47,502 --> 01:06:50,130
a star that symbolizes the king
was found in the night sky.

910
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:54,634
The late king's brother
had already taken over the throne,

911
01:06:55,343 --> 01:06:57,471
and he even has a son to succeed him.

912
01:06:57,554 --> 01:07:00,682
If the royal family finds out that
this child was destined to be king,

913
01:07:01,558 --> 01:07:03,393
they will see it

914
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:05,812
as treason.

915
01:07:10,942 --> 01:07:13,403
His existence will bring chaos.

916
01:07:14,404 --> 01:07:17,032
He should not attract attention
or challenge anyone.

917
01:07:19,034 --> 01:07:21,536
We must make people think
that he is nothing special.

918
01:07:27,292 --> 01:07:29,002
I sincerely apologize

919
01:07:29,669 --> 01:07:32,255
for all the trouble and chaos
I have caused.

920
01:07:34,841 --> 01:07:36,885
Songrim decided

921
01:07:37,552 --> 01:07:39,304
to open your gate of energy,

922
01:07:40,013 --> 01:07:41,681
so you will not be held responsible.

923
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,185
I, Jang Uk, the eldest of the Jang family,

924
01:07:45,268 --> 01:07:47,062
am now ready to practice and learn.

925
01:07:47,896 --> 01:07:50,273
If Songrim gives me a chance,
I will do my very best.

926
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:53,652
And to show my loyalty,

927
01:07:53,735 --> 01:07:56,571
I will pass on Naksu's sword,
a sword I took from Jin Mu,

928
01:07:57,405 --> 01:07:59,157
and keep it in Songrim's Sword Room.

929
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:03,286
I refuse the offer.

930
01:08:06,706 --> 01:08:11,461
That sword was meant for the Jang family,
so your family can keep it safe.

931
01:08:18,218 --> 01:08:21,429
You may take your father's sword as well.

932
01:08:22,889 --> 01:08:26,977
From this moment forward,
I hereby banish Jang Uk from Songrim.

933
01:08:33,024 --> 01:08:34,609
I allowed you to freely enter

934
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:37,737
as you were the son of an old friend.

935
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:43,702
But you have no right
to enter Songrim as a mage.

936
01:08:45,078 --> 01:08:46,746
From now on,

937
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:50,625
Jang Uk will not be given access
to anything in Songrim.

938
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:57,883
Hand in the Spirit Plaque
that allows you to enter this place.

939
01:09:02,971 --> 01:09:04,222
I do not have it.

940
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:05,849
What?

941
01:09:07,809 --> 01:09:09,144
I lost it.

942
01:09:11,855 --> 01:09:13,023
I lost the Spirit Plaque.

943
01:09:13,106 --> 01:09:15,609
What kind of punishment is given

944
01:09:16,568 --> 01:09:18,278
to those who lose the Spirit Plaque?

945
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:21,531
A hundred floggings, my lord.

946
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:24,201
Then I hereby order
a hundred floggings for Jang Uk

947
01:09:24,284 --> 01:09:26,328
for having lost the Spirit Plaque.

948
01:10:02,864 --> 01:10:05,325
He has Master Heo's torrent of energy,
so he will be all right.

949
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:08,745
If you get involved,
it will only make it worse for him.

950
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:55,375
Jang Uk, leave Songrim

951
01:10:55,458 --> 01:10:57,460
and do not ever come back again.

952
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:03,383
Leave.

953
01:11:05,385 --> 01:11:06,678
No.

954
01:11:06,761 --> 01:11:07,804
No.

955
01:11:08,638 --> 01:11:09,848
I cannot leave like this.

956
01:11:11,516 --> 01:11:13,601
I was only flogged 99 times.

957
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:16,980
There is one more left.

958
01:11:19,524 --> 01:11:21,026
As for the last one,

959
01:11:22,694 --> 01:11:24,112
you should do it yourself.

960
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:43,048
I am merely trying to keep him safe.

961
01:11:43,631 --> 01:11:47,385
If his gate of energy remains closed
and he lives as my son, he will live.

962
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:50,597
However, if he chooses
to discover his fate instead,

963
01:11:52,807 --> 01:11:54,934
he will not survive.

964
01:12:11,659 --> 01:12:14,704
Uk, just stand down, give up,

965
01:12:15,997 --> 01:12:17,957
and live a quiet life.

966
01:12:20,043 --> 01:12:21,669
That is the only way you can live.

967
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:53,201
Mu-deok.

968
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:56,871
Get the sword.

969
01:13:29,946 --> 01:13:30,780
Let us go.

970
01:14:26,711 --> 01:14:29,088
I want to unsheathe it and show them.

971
01:14:29,172 --> 01:14:30,965
-Is that an act of stupidity?
-No, It is an act of vigor.

972
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:32,050
Stay strong.

973
01:14:32,133 --> 01:14:34,260
There is another sword here that
you cannot unsheathe.

974
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:37,096
But that belongs to his father.

975
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,432
I must take it with me.

976
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:41,434
Whoever wins shall take the sword.

977
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:44,562
Going against you would be
an act of stupidity.

978
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:48,066
However, there is someone who sees it
as one of vigor. So I shall try.

979
01:14:49,108 --> 01:14:51,819
My pupil is still too weak
to fight against you.

980
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:54,489
You have put him in danger once again.

981
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,659
And he will get what he wants once more.

982
01:14:59,744 --> 01:15:04,749
