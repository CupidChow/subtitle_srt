00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You…

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who are you?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I am exactly what you see.

5
00:00:00,342 --> 00:00:02,303
I am a soul shifter

6
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,221
with blue marks in my eyes.

7
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:05,765
What?

8
00:00:05,848 --> 00:00:08,100
When the blue marks happened to reappear,

9
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,353
I remembered who I was.

10
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,192
I am not Jin Bu-yeon.

11
00:00:18,694 --> 00:00:19,862
My soul…

12
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:23,449
belongs to someone else.

13
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:25,493
Someone else?

14
00:00:25,576 --> 00:00:27,787
I ran away
because I did not want to get caught.

15
00:00:30,414 --> 00:00:31,499
But here we are.

16
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:36,670
What will you do now?

17
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:39,298
Jang Uk.

18
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:46,639
Did you find her?

19
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:48,808
Yes, I did. She is safe with me.

20
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:51,101
Is she hurt? Are you all right?

21
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:53,229
She was just startled by the wraiths.

22
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:54,605
She is calming herself down.

23
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:56,398
Do not worry.

24
00:00:56,482 --> 00:00:58,359
Is that so? There are wraiths?

25
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:00,653
Come to think of it,
this is one dreary forest.

26
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:14,959
The marks are only detectable
from this close.

27
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:19,213
I will decide what to do with you.

28
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:21,048
No one else should know.

29
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:22,466
Keep it in mind.

30
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,343
Only I am allowed

31
00:01:25,928 --> 00:01:26,929
to come this close.

32
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,058
Fine.

33
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:35,104
Only you are allowed…

34
00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:37,898
to come this close.

35
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,240
Are you saying Naksu realized
who she truly was?

36
00:01:46,824 --> 00:01:47,992
I believe so.

37
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:52,246
Now that Naksu has regained her memory,
will her soul leave the body?

38
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:55,249
Will the body be Bu-yeon's entirely?

39
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,501
Seo Yul told me.

40
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,964
I will not blame you
for deceiving me, so please tell me.

41
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:03,883
If Naksu's soul leaves the body

42
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:06,760
and she becomes Bu-yeon again
while she is in Gwido,

43
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:09,972
will she be able to come
out of there alive?

44
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:11,849
She will be fine.

45
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,226
Bu-yeon's soul has immense powers

46
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,813
that even I fail to fathom.

47
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,739
The one who attacked me earlier
was the wraith of this corpse.

48
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:28,991
Unlike the other wraiths that avoided me,

49
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,660
this one chased me.

50
00:02:31,744 --> 00:02:33,162
What is that blue object?

51
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:42,296
This is an ice stone.

52
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:45,090
An ice stone?
I did not know there was one in Gwido too.

53
00:02:45,174 --> 00:02:47,843
That ice stone has no energy of the sky.

54
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:49,386
It is different from Uk's.

55
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,348
It desires to absorb human energy

56
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:54,183
like a soul shifter that has run wild.

57
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:55,726
It is best that we let it be.

58
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,813
Someone with an ice stone who died here…

59
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:02,358
This body must belong
to that mage of the Choi family.

60
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:06,487
That mage held deep resentment
toward Jin Seol-ran.

61
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,156
You were likely attacked as it sensed
that you were her descendant.

62
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:10,491
It seems so.

63
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:14,328
The wraith must have noticed
that this body belongs to the Jin family.

64
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:18,207
Hold on.

65
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,585
-How did you two find me?
-I thought you summoned us.

66
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:22,544
What do you mean?

67
00:03:23,587 --> 00:03:24,797
-I summoned you?
-Yes.

68
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,549
I went to tell Jang Uk about this
after you had entered Gwido.

69
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:29,802
You summoned us here,
so we came to your rescue.

70
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:32,263
After you and Jin Mu
agreed to throw me in here,

71
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:33,347
you came to rescue me?

72
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:35,933
Does that mean
you went all the way to North Fortress

73
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,476
to tell him about me?

74
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:39,937
I was never

75
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:42,314
at North Fortress to begin with.

76
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,110
I never sided with Jin Mu either.

77
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:48,445
I am on his side.

78
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:52,950
You do not need to come so close.

79
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:54,785
Stay still.

80
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,955
I offered to join hands first

81
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,290
since I am the Crown Prince.

82
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,129
I will hide behind Jin Mu like you said,

83
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,755
and I order you to go far away.

84
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:09,967
It sounds like

85
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,970
you and Jin Mu can only begin
your scheme once I leave.

86
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:13,887
That is right.

87
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,350
I will remain here
and uncover those behind his power.

88
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:19,768
His secret organization?

89
00:04:19,852 --> 00:04:22,688
He has made countless soul shifters
with the Soul Ejector,

90
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:24,523
and they are still aiding him.

91
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:27,901
I do not know how many there are
or their identities.

92
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:32,614
But I know that they need the ice stone
to prevent themselves from running wild.

93
00:04:32,698 --> 00:04:34,491
We need to wipe out
his entire secret organization

94
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,744
if we want to stop him.

95
00:04:36,827 --> 00:04:39,830
And you are the only one
who can do just that.

96
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,082
Are you saying

97
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,626
that you want to join hands with me?

98
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,924
Tell them you will go to North Fortress.

99
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:52,885
Then return immediately.

100
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:55,137
Meanwhile, I will gather
all the soul shifters

101
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,639
in one place so you can annihilate them.

102
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:02,811
You could gain great power
if you side with Jin Mu.

103
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,106
So why have you decided to go against him?

104
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,447
He got rid of my turtle.

105
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,117
Your turtle?

106
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:19,620
I am not going to add
a grand pretext for my decision,

107
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:21,455
such as wanting to save the world.

108
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,540
The moment he got rid of my turtle,

109
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,628
I decided to abandon him as well.

110
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:33,050
What is it?

111
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:36,095
Is my trivial reason too unbelievable?

112
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:39,348
You have decided to go against him
because of a single turtle.

113
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:41,809
That sounds more believable
than a grand justification.

114
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:46,188
So did you find your turtle?

115
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:54,029
It is nowhere to be found.

116
00:05:54,113 --> 00:05:55,614
It is a smart turtle,

117
00:05:55,697 --> 00:05:57,616
so it should be able to find its way back.

118
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:01,161
It may have died.

119
00:06:15,384 --> 00:06:17,094
Jang Uk of the Jang family

120
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,888
will be appointed
as the general of North Fortress.

121
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:23,350
No one will know
that you did not leave for the time being.

122
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:26,186
I have sent one of my men
to get on that boat.

123
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,399
So no one will know that you are missing
until the boat arrives at its destination.

124
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:34,236
Stay here and wait
for Jin Mu to make his move.

125
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,114
Dang-gu and Yul
will take turns and stop by.

126
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:40,367
Could you not have found
a cleaner place for me to stay in?

127
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:41,326
Look at this place.

128
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,495
-There are so many spiderwebs.
-My goodness.

129
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:47,916
He does not seem
to like this place either.

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,544
-There are still spiderwebs here.
-Please be careful, Your Royal Highness.

131
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:52,129
How am I to go through them?

132
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:53,547
Goodness.

133
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,134
I thought you did not like
how he was slowly crawling toward you.

134
00:06:58,177 --> 00:06:59,344
But I guess you opened your heart.

135
00:06:59,428 --> 00:07:02,097
He did not want us
to be hostile toward each other anymore.

136
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:05,309
So I told him to stop bugging me
and to step aside.

137
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:06,894
Goodness.

138
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:16,069
I want Songrim
to give full support to Jang Uk.

139
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:18,322
As for me,

140
00:07:18,947 --> 00:07:20,449
I will hide and make way for us.

141
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:27,456
Bring them in with the gifts for the King
that get imported from the volcano.

142
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:31,710
Jin Mu's items will be brought in
alongside the gifts for the King.

143
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:33,712
Do not inspect them and just let them in.

144
00:07:33,795 --> 00:07:35,130
-Yes, my lord.
-We need to place them

145
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:36,965
throughout the canals before the rite.

146
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,344
Will you allow me to do that,
Your Royal Highness?

147
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:43,388
I will inform the men of the Night Watch
who guard the city at night.

148
00:07:43,472 --> 00:07:44,306
You may use them.

149
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:48,018
These are the areas where the Night Watch
placed the earthenware.

150
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:51,396
We can retrieve the earthenware
from those places later.

151
00:07:52,064 --> 00:07:54,107
The earthenware will help the fire bird

152
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:56,527
become stronger once it awakens.

153
00:07:57,194 --> 00:07:59,530
It is similar to adding fuel to a fire.

154
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:04,159
Once the Unanimous Assembly begins,
Jin Mu will go for Jinyowon.

155
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:05,494
And I will help him.

156
00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:08,830
Once he gains Jinyowon,
he will try to bring out the fire bird.

157
00:08:08,914 --> 00:08:12,251
His secret organization will get to work
within the next few days.

158
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,463
Is Bu-yeon staying in Jinyowon right now?

159
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:19,675
Does she know that you are here?

160
00:08:20,342 --> 00:08:21,510
No, I did not tell her.

161
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:23,387
I see.

162
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,431
If she finds out that you left
for North Fortress without her,

163
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:28,392
she will be hurt.

164
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:30,769
Right.

165
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,110
You did not tell the shaman?

166
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,695
Why not?

167
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,947
She is not a shaman, Eunuch Go.

168
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,990
Did you two fight?

169
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:45,909
That was why you could not tell her.

170
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,119
Goodness.

171
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:48,787
Why?

172
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:50,122
Why did you argue?

173
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:53,166
She told me a few things
about your relationship

174
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,877
during my eunuch days.

175
00:08:56,545 --> 00:08:57,379
So tell me.

176
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:00,632
Did she

177
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,676
mention me often?

178
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,013
She talked about you all the time.
She was heartbroken because of you.

179
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:08,181
How ridiculous.
That is rich coming from her.

180
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,475
What is it?

181
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,352
Did she break your heart this time?

182
00:09:12,894 --> 00:09:14,271
Did she cheat on you as well?

183
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:17,858
Seriously?

184
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,944
I was just joking.
Has she really fallen for someone new?

185
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,030
He is not new.

186
00:09:23,113 --> 00:09:24,531
Then a former lover.

187
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:26,116
So? Did she go to him?

188
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,492
No, she did not.

189
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,746
He does not recognize her,
and she cannot go to him.

190
00:09:32,414 --> 00:09:33,373
Is that so?

191
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,709
That must mean he is…

192
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:38,712
-married.
-Married?

193
00:09:40,255 --> 00:09:41,089
Married?

194
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:43,467
That must be why he is ignoring

195
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,885
and rejecting her.

196
00:09:45,844 --> 00:09:47,012
Darn it.

197
00:09:47,095 --> 00:09:50,265
Seeing how he is not giving in,
he must be a good man.

198
00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:51,975
She is the dangerous one.

199
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:55,437
She is ready to abandon you
and act like a moth to a flame.

200
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,647
She is not a moth.

201
00:09:57,689 --> 00:09:59,399
And she has not abandoned me yet.

202
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:00,359
Yet?

203
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:02,944
Does that mean you expect her
to abandon you in the future?

204
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:04,613
Darn it.

205
00:10:05,781 --> 00:10:08,033
I should not be making a joke out of this.

206
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:09,701
So please…

207
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:12,454
Please stop confusing me

208
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:15,290
by saying the guy is married
or that she is a moth.

209
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:18,835
Despite owning an ice stone
and reaching Hwansu,

210
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,088
you have failed to win your wife's heart.

211
00:10:21,713 --> 00:10:23,548
That power of yours is useless.

212
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:31,848
Despite your frustration,
you cannot see her due to this situation.

213
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:35,143
I will meet with her myself
and ask her what is going on.

214
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:36,144
Stay here.

215
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:43,110
A married man?

216
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,363
Darn it.

217
00:10:51,576 --> 00:10:53,870
There is no way I can bring up that topic

218
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,539
in a situation like this.

219
00:10:57,499 --> 00:10:59,668
If I stop Jin Mu right now,

220
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:02,129
everything will fall apart.

221
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:07,467
This is our chance to attack Jinyowon.

222
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:10,929
The plaque is missing,
and Bu-yeon is trapped in Gwido.

223
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:14,641
In addition, Jin Ho-gyeong
is too weak to protect her.

224
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:16,268
Will you make your move right away?

225
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:21,398
I promised to introduce you
to the secret organization.

226
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,442
We will gather together tonight

227
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:25,944
and open Jinyowon's doors.

228
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:31,199
Tonight?

229
00:11:31,283 --> 00:11:32,951
Tonight?

230
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:34,661
It is sooner than expected.

231
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:36,121
Please inform Songrim as well.

232
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:38,123
But there is one problem.

233
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:41,418
Jin Bu-yeon is locked
in Cheonbugwan's prison.

234
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:44,713
What prison?

235
00:11:45,714 --> 00:11:48,175
Gwido, the prison that holds those
who once performed sorcery.

236
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,343
She is in there right now.

237
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,100
If you want me
to open Gwido's door right away,

238
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,226
I will do so.

239
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,227
However,

240
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:01,354
if I side with Jinyowon now,

241
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:03,523
Jin Mu's organization
will not gather tonight,

242
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:05,692
and Jin Mu will no longer trust me.

243
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:07,986
What will you do?

244
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:09,446
I will do as you say.

245
00:12:37,307 --> 00:12:39,267
I must go inside Gwido.

246
00:12:39,935 --> 00:12:42,854
Please feign ignorance
and step aside, Your Royal Highness.

247
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:54,950
Jang Uk.

248
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:55,992
It is a turtle.

249
00:12:58,745 --> 00:12:59,871
That is my turtle.

250
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:03,500
She took that turtle with her into Gwido.

251
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,085
Hey, turtle.

252
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:06,920
How did you get out of there?

253
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:19,099
Jang Uk, come here.

254
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:23,562
That is the door to Gwido.

255
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:25,105
But why is it here?

256
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:27,148
Did you come out of there?

257
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:31,861
Someone opened the door here.

258
00:13:32,571 --> 00:13:35,866
They must want us to go in there.

259
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:37,701
Who?

260
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,704
Turtle, was it you?

261
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,081
The person who summoned us…

262
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,168
must be the one who is inside.

263
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,549
Bu-yeon must have summoned Uk
with her divine powers.

264
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:58,471
She must have opened the door
to protect herself.

265
00:13:58,555 --> 00:13:59,973
Was it not you?

266
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:03,018
That is correct. Bu-yeon opened it.

267
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:04,853
You have incredible divine powers.

268
00:14:04,936 --> 00:14:06,980
With such powers,
you could have cast away the wraith.

269
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:09,274
Why did you open the door
and summon Jang Uk?

270
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:11,735
You are right.

271
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,695
I should not have done that.

272
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,822
In the end, he saw something…

273
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:19,409
he should not have.

274
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:34,257
The ice stone in Jang Uk's body

275
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:37,844
was left behind by Master Seo Gyeong
to save Jin Seol-ran.

276
00:14:37,928 --> 00:14:39,888
But she passed away.

277
00:14:40,597 --> 00:14:43,516
So why do you think
he still left it in Jinyowon?

278
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,727
He could have just destroyed it.

279
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:48,104
What do you wish to say?

280
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,524
I heard you first took out the ice stone

281
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:54,527
to use it to save
your unborn baby that had died.

282
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:57,572
And that baby grew up to be Jin Bu-yeon.

283
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,660
If Jin Seol-ran's soul
remained in the ice stone,

284
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:03,495
I thought maybe the baby you had saved

285
00:15:03,578 --> 00:15:06,831
could have been Jin Seol-ran herself.

286
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:11,878
Bu-yeon was blind from birth
just like Jin Seol-ran

287
00:15:11,962 --> 00:15:14,130
and possessed astounding divine powers.

288
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,548
Have you never

289
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:18,301
found that odd?

290
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:22,222
How is that relevant
when I gave birth and raised her myself?

291
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:29,396
If Bu-yeon possesses divine powers
similar to Jin Seol-ran's,

292
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:32,357
she will make it out of Gwido.

293
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:38,196
Perhaps Naksu willingly went there,
hoping to retrieve her divine powers.

294
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,074
Has she decided

295
00:15:42,117 --> 00:15:44,285
to disappear in Gwido?

296
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:03,221
I looked around and found no threats.

297
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,766
But this place is quite big.

298
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,768
Do you think
you can find the plaque alone?

299
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,981
This body will find it with divine powers
equal to Jin Seol-ran's.

300
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:18,194
Jang Uk tried to look for you
with his red jade.

301
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,656
Do you have the blue one?

302
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,498
Did he call me through this?

303
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,168
I did not know.

304
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,087
Did he give that to you?

305
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,799
That is not yours.

306
00:16:40,884 --> 00:16:42,052
That belongs to someone else.

307
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:44,971
I know.

308
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:48,099
He temporarily left it with me

309
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:51,102
so I could read her memories.

310
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:54,022
You even have that kind of power?

311
00:16:54,606 --> 00:16:57,025
You are indeed not a shaman,
but a powerful priestess.

312
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,153
Give it to me.

313
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:03,198
It is not yours,
so I will return it to him.

314
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:09,662
In the past,

315
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:12,957
you also tried to take it.

316
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:16,086
I gave it back.

317
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,295
Do not lie.

318
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,091
She picked it up after you threw it away.

319
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:23,551
You know one too many things.

320
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:29,849
She must remember me

321
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:33,269
as someone who is heinous.

322
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,230
She always wished

323
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:39,651
you were Jang Uk's ally

324
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:42,487
and not his enemy.

325
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:46,741
I am sure she is happy to see…

326
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,828
that you are helping him.

327
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,040
Whenever I showed
my pettiness in front of her,

328
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,043
she bad-mouthed whomever I disliked.

329
00:17:58,711 --> 00:17:59,587
Despite it all,

330
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:03,174
it was annoying and impressive to see
that she always sided with her master.

331
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:06,761
That is why I liked her.

332
00:18:08,346 --> 00:18:09,806
She deceived you…

333
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:14,310
all along, Your Royal Highness.

334
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:17,188
I am aware of that.

335
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:21,776
So when she died,

336
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:25,321
I thought I would quickly forget about her
since she deceived me.

337
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:27,907
However,

338
00:18:29,951 --> 00:18:31,452
that never happened.

339
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:38,626
I wanted to have her.

340
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,213
My graceless desire to destroy something

341
00:18:44,048 --> 00:18:45,383
that I could not have

342
00:18:45,884 --> 00:18:48,887
definitely played a part in my decision
to turn my back on Jang Uk.

343
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:51,931
That is why whenever I think of her,

344
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:55,935
I feel ashamed of myself,
and I feel painful remorse.

345
00:18:56,728 --> 00:18:58,688
If she knows that you are in pain…

346
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:03,401
she will probably

347
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,445
be content with that.

348
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:07,697
You are right.

349
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,868
She is not someone
who would tell me to stop being in pain.

350
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:16,623
If it is possible,
I would like her to know

351
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,959
that I am in…

352
00:19:21,878 --> 00:19:23,296
an inexplicable amount of pain.

353
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,050
Still…

354
00:19:29,594 --> 00:19:31,304
she would not want the pain to last.

355
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,100
After you have been in enough pain…

356
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:39,812
you should let go.

357
00:19:55,954 --> 00:19:58,706
I found it in So-i's belongings
during her funeral.

358
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:02,043
The potion looked strange,
so I brought it here.

359
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:05,505
This is a soul potion
that is used in sorcery.

360
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:08,299
It is a heinous and bewitching potion

361
00:20:08,383 --> 00:20:10,677
that helps divination.

362
00:20:11,386 --> 00:20:12,512
Master Heo.

363
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:16,683
Was not the Queen, who had been
locked up after shifting souls,

364
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:19,519
fed this potion?

365
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:20,436
You are right.

366
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,981
Shaman Choi concocted this.

367
00:20:23,773 --> 00:20:25,566
How did So-i have this?

368
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,068
Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan

369
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:30,238
had something on her and was using her.

370
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:34,534
It could be from Cheonbugwan.

371
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:35,535
I will look into it.

372
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,332
It must be that potion.

373
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,669
Madam So-i and Yeom-su,
a Cheonbugwan mage,

374
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:47,588
would feed it to others
once or twice a month.

375
00:20:48,256 --> 00:20:50,425
She called it the bell potion.

376
00:20:50,508 --> 00:20:51,342
The bell potion?

377
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:55,763
She said you would hear bells
and go insane if you consume it.

378
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:01,227
Do you know where and on whom she used it?

379
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,520
No, I do not.

380
00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:05,440
She rarely told me anything related
to Cheonbugwan since it was dangerous.

381
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:11,279
But she once mentioned
an individual who consumed it.

382
00:21:18,328 --> 00:21:24,042
I rarely feel guilty for the things
I have done in my life.

383
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,793
But one thing bothers me.

384
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:28,629
There is one person I feel bad for.

385
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:32,467
That person was very kind

386
00:21:33,343 --> 00:21:35,219
and treated me well.

387
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:37,096
It must have been a guy.

388
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,264
You are wrong.

389
00:21:38,848 --> 00:21:41,142
She was a girl I had met in Sari Village.

390
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:46,314
Had I not stolen what was hers,

391
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:48,775
she would have found
her parents right away.

392
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,696
Then she would not
have gone crazy and died.

393
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,864
Gone crazy and died?

394
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:57,533
She was also a victim of the bell potion.

395
00:21:59,327 --> 00:22:01,120
So a girl she met in Sari Village

396
00:22:02,747 --> 00:22:04,499
consumed this same potion?

397
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,292
Yes.

398
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:13,174
You ignored me just like your father did
and never visited me once.

399
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:16,219
And now, you barge in here
and demand to know about the soul potion?

400
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:19,347
I heard you were force-fed
that potion when you were locked up.

401
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,598
Did you perhaps

402
00:22:21,182 --> 00:22:23,518
hear the sound of bells during that time?

403
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:33,653
I do not want to relive those moments.
That is enough.

404
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:34,695
This is important.

405
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,075
Someone seems to still be controlling
the soul shifters with this potion.

406
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:40,952
Shaman Choi, her brother, and Jang Gang

407
00:22:41,035 --> 00:22:42,662
turned her into a soul shifter.

408
00:22:43,246 --> 00:22:45,748
They are all dead, so please do not
torment Her Highness anymore.

409
00:22:46,707 --> 00:22:49,168
The potion may have altered your memory,
Your Highness.

410
00:22:49,252 --> 00:22:50,753
Please try to remember.

411
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:52,213
I know it may be painful,

412
00:22:52,922 --> 00:22:54,298
but please try to remember.

413
00:22:54,382 --> 00:22:55,633
I said that was enough!

414
00:22:55,716 --> 00:22:57,802
I am still in pain.

415
00:22:57,885 --> 00:23:01,139
You do not deserve to ask for my help
when you cannot take away this pain.

416
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:04,642
We are trying to end the alchemy of souls,
which is the root of your pain.

417
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:06,310
I do not want it to end.

418
00:23:06,894 --> 00:23:09,313
I do not understand why it is forbidden.

419
00:23:09,397 --> 00:23:13,693
I, the Queen, want to take
a young, insignificant body.

420
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:14,694
Why is that wrong?

421
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:20,616
You almost died recently, Yul.

422
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,118
If the alchemy of souls is permitted,

423
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:25,121
the precious son of the Seo family
will never worry about dying.

424
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:29,041
And you will be able to stay powerful
forever as the great leader of Songrim.

425
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:31,210
Do you not want that?

426
00:23:31,294 --> 00:23:32,545
If someone powerful

427
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,507
has everything they want and is immortal,

428
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:38,968
what will become of this world?

429
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:42,680
Rain is necessary,
but it should not last forever.

430
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:45,766
The sun is also necessary,
but it should set as well.

431
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,851
And no one

432
00:23:48,186 --> 00:23:52,023
should stay powerful and live forever.

433
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:59,947
That hypocrisy is
what makes everyone uncomfortable.

434
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:02,867
What do you think
other powerful individuals think?

435
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:07,163
We all want to join hands with the one
who will grant us everlasting power.

436
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,748
That is the truth.

437
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:10,917
And is that individual

438
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:12,627
Jin Mu?

439
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,503
-What?
-Please calm down, Your Highness.

440
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:17,673
Her Highness is very distressed.
You should all leave.

441
00:24:22,303 --> 00:24:25,473
Jin Mu controlled the soul shifters
with his divination.

442
00:24:25,556 --> 00:24:27,016
Perhaps Naksu

443
00:24:28,643 --> 00:24:30,728
was also one of his victims.

444
00:24:31,562 --> 00:24:35,775
Even so, that does not change the fact
that she practiced the alchemy of souls.

445
00:24:35,858 --> 00:24:39,320
Still, I would like
to reveal the truth and lessen her burden

446
00:24:39,403 --> 00:24:41,906
regarding the tragedy three years ago.

447
00:24:42,865 --> 00:24:47,036
Even Uk is in pain
as he is paying the price because of her.

448
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,871
Do you think he is in pain

449
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:53,167
solely because he is taking responsibility
for Naksu's sins?

450
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:55,670
Do you remember what the Queen said today?

451
00:24:55,753 --> 00:24:58,631
She did not see the fault
in powerful individuals

452
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:00,007
gaining everlasting power.

453
00:25:01,884 --> 00:25:04,011
Uk already possesses that power.

454
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,806
What troubles him the most

455
00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:09,100
is that he must take responsibility

456
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:13,354
as someone who possesses the power
that Jin Mu and the Queen desire.

457
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:16,649
Depending on who Uk's target is
and which path he takes,

458
00:25:18,442 --> 00:25:21,529
he could dry out this world,
just like Jin Mu wishes.

459
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:24,532
Or he could stop him.

460
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:31,664
Deciding whom to target

461
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,458
and which path to take

462
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:37,712
will always be painful and a burden.

463
00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:42,091
It may be too much for a human to handle.

464
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,435
I saved her life

465
00:25:52,977 --> 00:25:53,936
and took care of her.

466
00:25:54,812 --> 00:25:57,356
You have taken what Jin Ho-gyeong

467
00:25:57,982 --> 00:26:00,067
has tried so hard to hide.

468
00:26:01,444 --> 00:26:05,865
Master Lee must have known
that there was another soul within her.

469
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,034
He recognized it

470
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:11,203
and feigned ignorance once again.

471
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,294
The same blue mark.

472
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:21,922
There was a huge tree
where I used to live.

473
00:26:22,006 --> 00:26:25,760
So I imagined myself sitting alone
on top of a tall tree.

474
00:26:26,594 --> 00:26:27,845
The same memory.

475
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,227
Just die if you are not
going to do anything.

476
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:37,938
It is better to die than do nothing.

477
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:42,610
Are they the same person?

478
00:26:54,455 --> 00:26:56,082
We found our way here thanks to it.

479
00:26:56,665 --> 00:27:00,169
It could help you find the plaque,
so keep it with you.

480
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:02,380
I will leave first.

481
00:27:02,463 --> 00:27:04,298
Talk it out with Uk before he leaves.

482
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:06,801
You should also reconcile.

483
00:27:07,718 --> 00:27:09,053
He will be…

484
00:27:10,971 --> 00:27:12,348
in a huge battle today.

485
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,810
Jin Mu's secret organization
will gather to attack Jinyowon.

486
00:27:15,893 --> 00:27:17,853
And Uk will annihilate
all of the soul shifters.

487
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:21,899
We do not know their number
or how strong they are.

488
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:25,945
However, we must wipe out
every single one of them who is in hiding

489
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:29,407
to put an end
to Jin Mu's everlasting greed.

490
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,660
And Jang Uk is the only one
who is capable of doing that.

491
00:27:32,743 --> 00:27:35,037
All of them will have to be
eradicated for this to end.

492
00:27:37,331 --> 00:27:38,916
Every single one of them.

493
00:27:46,674 --> 00:27:48,175
The Crown Prince left first.

494
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:49,510
We are now…

495
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:52,805
the only ones here.

496
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,393
All right.

497
00:27:58,018 --> 00:27:59,353
You can ask what you are curious about.

498
00:27:59,437 --> 00:28:00,396
No.

499
00:28:02,106 --> 00:28:02,940
I will not.

500
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:07,069
So you better not say a word
before I respond.

501
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:12,825
The war that I am about to start

502
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:15,619
is clearly and precisely right.

503
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:18,289
I am doing what I can to stop them

504
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,417
from doing what they should not do.

505
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:26,797
Some will try to condone it
with a believable justification.

506
00:28:26,881 --> 00:28:29,467
Others will come up
with countless excuses to stop me.

507
00:28:30,384 --> 00:28:33,137
But this fight is the right thing to do.

508
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,723
That is why I know
exactly whom to point my sword at

509
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:39,059
and I know which path to take.

510
00:28:39,935 --> 00:28:40,770
That is why

511
00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:43,773
I must not recognize you here.

512
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,693
But let me ask you…

513
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:51,030
something else instead.

514
00:28:54,784 --> 00:28:55,618
Should I…

515
00:28:57,912 --> 00:28:59,288
not leave here?

516
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:02,792
Should I do absolutely nothing…

517
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,880
and stay here with you?

518
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:21,852
Should we do that?

519
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:26,857
I can probably close Gwido's door.

520
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,484
Then should we…

521
00:29:30,486 --> 00:29:31,779
stay here together?

522
00:29:37,952 --> 00:29:38,994
But the answer is…

523
00:29:42,373 --> 00:29:44,583
that such a decision
would clearly and precisely be wrong.

524
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:48,045
No matter the justification or excuse.

525
00:29:49,046 --> 00:29:50,130
Even if…

526
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,512
we were deeply pining and longing…

527
00:29:59,682 --> 00:30:00,683
for each other.

528
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:18,659
Dang-gu, go to Jinyowon.

529
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:20,286
Inform everyone and defend it.

530
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,289
-Yes, my lord.
-Yul and Sang-ho.

531
00:30:23,372 --> 00:30:24,957
Once everyone is gathered
in the secret room,

532
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,919
go to Cheonbugwan and stop the officials
who are outside the secret room.

533
00:30:29,003 --> 00:30:30,129
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

534
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:32,047
Once the battle begins,

535
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:34,884
I will go to the palace
and meet with the King.

536
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,720
I thought Jang Uk
had gone to North Fortress.

537
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:41,307
But he is going up against Jin Mu
alongside the Crown Prince.

538
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:45,269
He has decided to undertake
a great responsibility.

539
00:30:47,187 --> 00:30:48,355
Please keep him safe.

540
00:30:49,523 --> 00:30:50,649
Be safe as well.

541
00:30:53,777 --> 00:30:56,572
Once the sun sets,
Jin Mu's gathering will begin.

542
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:59,074
Once this night passes without problems,

543
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:03,621
the world they wish to see
will never come.

544
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:15,883
We will bring back the sky
from that fateful day 200 years ago.

545
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:18,469
The world will dry up.

546
00:31:18,552 --> 00:31:20,429
And when we perform the rite,

547
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:26,060
the ice stone, full of energy of the sky,
will fall into our hands.

548
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:29,980
We will live in a world
where the strong gain greater power

549
00:31:31,565 --> 00:31:34,526
and continue to rule forever!

550
00:31:41,617 --> 00:31:43,869
Are you saying they are all soul shifters?

551
00:31:43,953 --> 00:31:46,246
Those who wished for youth
received younger bodies.

552
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,166
Those who wished for power
received the bodies of the powerful.

553
00:31:49,249 --> 00:31:53,796
And those who wished for beauty
received alluring, beautiful bodies.

554
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:55,381
They all fulfilled their desires

555
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:58,175
through soul shifting.

556
00:31:58,968 --> 00:32:00,970
They may be in hiding for now.

557
00:32:02,846 --> 00:32:05,057
But once the door to the new world opens,

558
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,477
they will be of great use to you,
Your Royal Highness.

559
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,395
Gwanju.

560
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:14,149
When that new world emerges,

561
00:32:17,194 --> 00:32:19,363
what will become of those
who lose their bodies?

562
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,490
The young will age,

563
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:25,744
the powerful will lose their position,
and the beautiful will become ugly.

564
00:32:25,828 --> 00:32:26,745
Your Royal Highness.

565
00:32:27,955 --> 00:32:32,918
Did I not tell you not to allow yourself
to cling to something so insignificant?

566
00:32:35,629 --> 00:32:38,882
I do not think that trying to protect
such things is a sign of weakness.

567
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:42,761
Rather, it is a sign of strength.

568
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:47,599
And I am about to show you
exactly how powerful that strength is.

569
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:27,347
You have deceived me.

570
00:33:27,431 --> 00:33:30,517
No, you just underestimated me
and thought I was weak.

571
00:33:30,601 --> 00:33:33,145
I did everything for you.

572
00:33:34,396 --> 00:33:37,524
And yet, are you going to abandon me?

573
00:33:37,608 --> 00:33:41,111
That is not how I would describe
an enemy whom I am about to confront.

574
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,991
I am here to fight against you
alongside Jang Uk!

575
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:53,874
Jang Uk?

576
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:14,520
Attack!

577
00:34:56,145 --> 00:34:58,105
There is a barrier around the secret room.

578
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:12,911
Jang Uk.

579
00:35:13,704 --> 00:35:14,872
You are here.

580
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:28,237
There is no need to be alarmed.

581
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,947
I have only created a barrier.

582
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:34,451
But this one is much more complicated
than the one you had locked me in before.

583
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:43,418
I must say, I am quite busy
fighting all 78 soul shifters as we speak.

584
00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:29,006
Funnily enough, only you,

585
00:37:29,089 --> 00:37:31,341
the head of this secret organization,
are not a soul shifter.

586
00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:33,468
Were you afraid of running wild?

587
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:37,180
Then why did you encourage others
to do something so harmful?

588
00:37:38,932 --> 00:37:41,184
So you are finally here
to take your revenge.

589
00:37:41,268 --> 00:37:43,103
I would not have come
to do something that meaningless.

590
00:37:45,272 --> 00:37:48,066
I left behind a world
that I had always pined for.

591
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:49,860
Do you really think

592
00:37:50,861 --> 00:37:52,571
I left that world solely to kill you?

593
00:37:53,947 --> 00:37:56,241
What you are doing is absolutely wrong,

594
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:59,244
and it is absolutely right
for me to stop you.

595
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:02,289
So I am here to do what I need to do.

596
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:07,919
It is true that I vehemently resent you.

597
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,630
But that revenge is not mine to take.

598
00:38:12,632 --> 00:38:13,467
Go.

599
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:38,950
Go do what you can.

600
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:40,285
And I will stay here…

601
00:38:42,496 --> 00:38:43,705
and do what I can.

602
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,541
Send Jin Mu here.

603
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:54,883
Why am I here?

604
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,182
The ice stone?

605
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:26,665
I definitely saw an ice stone.

606
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:30,460
Has there been one here as well?

607
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:11,293
It was here as I suspected.

608
00:40:19,009 --> 00:40:20,093
That is an ice stone.

609
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:24,723
Right.

610
00:40:25,682 --> 00:40:27,309
I forgot that you were here.

611
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:29,102
Jin Bu-yeon.

612
00:40:30,353 --> 00:40:31,855
Did you find this?

613
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:36,359
Yes, just like how I found one
in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

614
00:40:37,527 --> 00:40:39,154
I thought you had lost your memory.

615
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,826
Anyway, I am impressed
that you found it once again.

616
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,203
You can have it.

617
00:40:47,287 --> 00:40:48,121
It is yours.

618
00:40:48,205 --> 00:40:50,290
The ice stone possesses
the energy of the sky.

619
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:53,376
Only the chosen ones
can possess its power.

620
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,671
Jang Gang and that mage of the Choi family
were able to use its power.

621
00:40:56,755 --> 00:41:00,509
But they could not possess it
as their own like Jang Uk has.

622
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:02,093
Shall I help you?

623
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:04,513
You?

624
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:11,228
That is right.

625
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:18,151
You are a priestess comparable
to Jin Seol-ran, Seo Gyeong's lover.

626
00:41:20,737 --> 00:41:21,571
All right.

627
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:23,782
Go on.

628
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:25,367
I will

629
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,411
make that yours.

630
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,615
What is happening to me?

631
00:42:06,783 --> 00:42:07,617
My energy…

632
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:09,661
That ice stone is empty.

633
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:14,583
It only desires to absorb energy

634
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:17,794
like a soul shifter who has run wild.

635
00:42:25,802 --> 00:42:27,220
You will not die quickly.

636
00:42:27,304 --> 00:42:29,389
You will slowly wither away

637
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:31,474
like a piece of wood.

638
00:42:35,061 --> 00:42:36,688
Just like that mage of the Choi family.

639
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:38,648
Why would you…

640
00:42:41,234 --> 00:42:42,235
do this?

641
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,362
You must remember my face, do you not?

642
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:49,200
I guess you never thought
it could actually be me.

643
00:42:50,952 --> 00:42:51,828
Danju.

644
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,085
Naksu?

645
00:43:01,171 --> 00:43:03,256
This prison holds those
who have performed sorcery.

646
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:12,515
This is the kind of death
that suits you perfectly.

647
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:15,352
Do not resent me too much.

648
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:19,272
I will likely meet my end…

649
00:43:22,317 --> 00:43:24,277
in this place as well.

650
00:43:51,721 --> 00:43:52,722
Jang Uk.

651
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:56,393
You have finally done it.

652
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:00,063
Uk, are you all right?

653
00:44:02,232 --> 00:44:03,733
Your body is as cold as ice.

654
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:05,193
It is bearable

655
00:44:06,403 --> 00:44:07,237
for now.

656
00:44:07,821 --> 00:44:08,947
Where is Jin Mu?

657
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:10,824
I sent him to Gwido.

658
00:44:12,075 --> 00:44:15,036
He will meet a demise that suits him.

659
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:17,455
But Bu-yeon is still in there.

660
00:44:18,373 --> 00:44:19,916
She asked me to send him there.

661
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:24,129
She wanted to fulfill her role
in all of this.

662
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,513
Uk.

663
00:44:45,942 --> 00:44:48,945
Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan has been sent
to Gwido, the prison for sorcerers.

664
00:44:49,028 --> 00:44:52,490
And every soul shifter in his organization
has been petrified to death.

665
00:44:52,574 --> 00:44:54,826
And was this done single-handedly
by Jang Uk and Songrim?

666
00:44:54,909 --> 00:44:56,077
Without telling anyone?

667
00:44:56,161 --> 00:44:58,246
Today seemed like our only opportunity,

668
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,167
so we had no time to discuss it
with you or the Unanimous Assembly.

669
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:05,170
The ice stone's power
that Jang Uk possesses sure is incredible.

670
00:45:05,753 --> 00:45:07,464
He, who belongs to Songrim,

671
00:45:07,547 --> 00:45:10,133
has gotten rid of Jin Mu, his only rival.

672
00:45:11,134 --> 00:45:14,637
Songrim will challenge the royal family
and the Unanimous Assembly in no time.

673
00:45:16,473 --> 00:45:18,683
This was not a power struggle,
Your Majesty.

674
00:45:19,476 --> 00:45:21,728
We only interfered
with Jin Mu's dangerous scheme

675
00:45:21,811 --> 00:45:24,147
of trying to steal
the fire bird from Jinyowon.

676
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:25,231
Whatever it may be,

677
00:45:25,982 --> 00:45:28,401
everyone was forbidden
from possessing its power.

678
00:45:28,485 --> 00:45:31,070
But Songrim indeed is
the only one to possess it.

679
00:45:32,989 --> 00:45:34,741
Not everyone will be happy about this.

680
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,207
Jin Mu is dead?

681
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:45,793
Then what will become of me?

682
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:47,170
Will I…

683
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,342
be trapped in this body forever?

684
00:45:54,093 --> 00:45:55,512
He is trapped in Gwido.

685
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,680
I do not think he will make it out alive.

686
00:46:05,355 --> 00:46:06,689
Find a way.

687
00:46:06,773 --> 00:46:09,025
You must find a way!

688
00:46:22,372 --> 00:46:24,374
Seeing how Jin Mu came here,

689
00:46:28,002 --> 00:46:30,463
Jang Uk and your master
must have done their job.

690
00:46:33,883 --> 00:46:35,468
I will remain here…

691
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:38,596
until my soul disappears.

692
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,851
Then only Jin Bu-yeon will be left
to leave this place.

693
00:46:45,979 --> 00:46:46,896
If that happens…

694
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:53,236
I will not have to be
Jang Uk's final task.

695
00:47:09,919 --> 00:47:11,087
It went into the sea.

696
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:15,341
But then again, you are a turtle.

697
00:47:15,425 --> 00:47:17,385
It is only natural that you go to the sea.

698
00:47:45,622 --> 00:47:47,206
This is the Jinyowon Plaque.

699
00:47:57,133 --> 00:47:58,760
Did you find it for me

700
00:48:00,261 --> 00:48:01,721
so I could leave this place?

701
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:05,683
In any case,

702
00:48:06,976 --> 00:48:08,144
thank you.

703
00:48:19,322 --> 00:48:20,448
THE BLACK TORTOISE

704
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:23,076
I met a sacred animal that possessed
the energy of the Black Tortoise.

705
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:25,453
It was diligently crawling somewhere.

706
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,914
It must have found a path for someone.

707
00:48:32,168 --> 00:48:35,046
I heard Jang Uk entered Gwido
to look for Jin Bu-yeon.

708
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:39,550
Seeing how he left that place,
he must have found his path as well.

709
00:48:39,634 --> 00:48:42,720
After putting an end
to the difficult battle,

710
00:48:42,804 --> 00:48:46,474
Uk is single-handedly enduring
the consequences.

711
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:03,991
He is weathering the wraiths
that are drawn by the energy of the sky.

712
00:49:04,075 --> 00:49:09,080
He is fighting another battle
in a cold, dark place all by himself.

713
00:49:13,668 --> 00:49:15,712
Why do you think he was chosen

714
00:49:16,838 --> 00:49:18,131
to carry this burden?

715
00:49:18,214 --> 00:49:21,217
Is he paying the price for being
a product of the alchemy of souls?

716
00:49:21,801 --> 00:49:24,929
While the most powerful
fought over the ice stone,

717
00:49:25,012 --> 00:49:28,766
it found its way to him.

718
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:31,769
I believe

719
00:49:32,895 --> 00:49:34,814
she was behind it all along.

720
00:49:38,401 --> 00:49:40,778
She? Whom are you speaking of?

721
00:49:40,862 --> 00:49:43,948
The one who first received
the ice stone from Master Seo Gyeong.

722
00:49:45,241 --> 00:49:49,036
I believe she has remained here
and has been protecting the ice stone.

723
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,457
Are you talking about Jin Seol-ran?

724
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:59,338
It is my assumption that she chose

725
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:02,341
both Jang Uk and that girl.

726
00:50:10,016 --> 00:50:11,225
Are you all right?

727
00:50:12,894 --> 00:50:13,936
I am sorry.

728
00:50:14,437 --> 00:50:16,773
I should have gone instead of you.

729
00:50:16,856 --> 00:50:18,274
I am all right.

730
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:20,860
I found the plaque.

731
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:26,365
You did it.

732
00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:29,118
You are really my daughter, Bu-yeon.

733
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:30,828
I am sorry.

734
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:32,997
Do not be sorry.

735
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:35,625
Now that you have found it,

736
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:37,168
Jinyowon will be safe.

737
00:50:38,961 --> 00:50:41,547
The Unanimous Assembly
will be summoned today regarding Jin Mu.

738
00:50:41,631 --> 00:50:43,758
You will have to explain
what happened in Gwido.

739
00:50:43,841 --> 00:50:44,967
Will you

740
00:50:45,968 --> 00:50:46,969
be able to do it?

741
00:50:47,053 --> 00:50:48,221
Yes, I can.

742
00:50:48,805 --> 00:50:51,140
I will attend the Unanimous Assembly.

743
00:50:53,851 --> 00:50:56,395
Seo Yul has been waiting for you.

744
00:50:56,938 --> 00:50:57,897
You should go see him.

745
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:08,616
Uk and I…

746
00:51:12,078 --> 00:51:14,038
have decided to feign ignorance.

747
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:18,501
I hope you will do the same.

748
00:51:21,087 --> 00:51:22,296
I have something to tell you.

749
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:26,634
Jin Mu could control
the soul shifters with his divination.

750
00:51:27,635 --> 00:51:28,594
So I believe…

751
00:51:30,179 --> 00:51:32,390
that the tragic events in Songrim
three years ago

752
00:51:34,141 --> 00:51:36,769
did not occur out of Naksu's will,
but because of Jin Mu.

753
00:51:52,285 --> 00:51:53,911
So that was why

754
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,247
I heard those bells.

755
00:52:06,465 --> 00:52:08,801
If you are blaming yourself
for what happened,

756
00:52:10,678 --> 00:52:13,014
I wanted to let you know
you do not need to do that.

757
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:20,396
I hope this excuse…

758
00:52:23,733 --> 00:52:25,568
will let you stay where you want to be.

759
00:52:28,446 --> 00:52:31,490
I was merely a soul shifter
who was driven by vengeance.

760
00:52:32,491 --> 00:52:36,454
I was an assassin raised in Danhyanggok
with that one purpose.

761
00:52:37,038 --> 00:52:39,040
And I just simply met my demise.

762
00:52:42,084 --> 00:52:42,960
So that…

763
00:52:46,923 --> 00:52:48,549
cannot be an excuse.

764
00:53:04,273 --> 00:53:06,233
You are really going to North Fortress?

765
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:08,110
If I remain here,

766
00:53:08,194 --> 00:53:11,155
people will torment Lord Park
and Songrim regarding the ice stone.

767
00:53:11,739 --> 00:53:13,449
I must obey the King's command

768
00:53:14,033 --> 00:53:15,242
for the Crown Prince's sake as well.

769
00:53:16,494 --> 00:53:17,578
When will you be leaving?

770
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:20,831
I have been given a position there,
so I must leave right away.

771
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:23,417
So I am afraid

772
00:53:24,168 --> 00:53:26,087
that I will not be attending your wedding.

773
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,922
That is not the problem.

774
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:31,592
You are going far away.
Who knows when we will meet again?

775
00:53:31,676 --> 00:53:33,928
You can visit me with Lord Park.

776
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:36,764
Then how about I follow you for now--

777
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:37,682
No.

778
00:53:38,265 --> 00:53:39,225
I said no.

779
00:53:41,227 --> 00:53:44,605
Do not say that to him.
He is already very jealous of me.

780
00:53:45,231 --> 00:53:46,524
It cannot be helped.

781
00:53:46,607 --> 00:53:48,734
You will always be my top priority.

782
00:53:48,818 --> 00:53:49,902
I know.

783
00:53:50,653 --> 00:53:53,155
But do not express such feelings to him.

784
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,576
He does get sulky easily.

785
00:53:59,412 --> 00:54:00,413
Maidservant Kim.

786
00:54:01,747 --> 00:54:03,457
I may not be there for the wedding,

787
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:06,252
but make sure you are
the prettiest person there.

788
00:54:07,128 --> 00:54:10,297
Make sure you look like
the happiest woman in the world.

789
00:54:11,924 --> 00:54:12,758
I will.

790
00:54:14,135 --> 00:54:16,012
I promise to look the prettiest

791
00:54:17,555 --> 00:54:18,848
and happiest.

792
00:54:38,659 --> 00:54:41,412
I did not know
Uk was concerned about that.

793
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:45,875
Let us also move
to North Fortress after our wedding.

794
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:47,710
Will you be fine with that?

795
00:54:48,252 --> 00:54:52,048
I am no longer the leader of Songrim.
I am free to go wherever I want.

796
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:55,926
Is that why you did not attend
the Unanimous Assembly today?

797
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:58,054
If I remain here,

798
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:01,766
they will pester Uk
regarding the ice stone.

799
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:03,976
That is exactly what he said.

800
00:55:04,643 --> 00:55:05,770
In that case,

801
00:55:06,353 --> 00:55:08,397
let us move there right after the wedding.

802
00:55:09,231 --> 00:55:10,900
Promise me.

803
00:55:15,905 --> 00:55:17,281
Hold on.

804
00:55:17,364 --> 00:55:19,533
Why are you wearing
the ring on your pinky?

805
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:21,452
It is for this finger.

806
00:55:21,535 --> 00:55:23,120
It is too small.

807
00:55:24,413 --> 00:55:26,332
It stops my blood circulation.

808
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:27,792
Is that so?

809
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:28,876
Then take it off.

810
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:30,544
I will make it bigger

811
00:55:30,628 --> 00:55:32,630
or get you a larger size.

812
00:55:34,006 --> 00:55:34,840
Goodness.

813
00:55:34,924 --> 00:55:35,800
That is fine.

814
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:38,636
It is a promise of our everlasting love.

815
00:55:39,386 --> 00:55:40,679
I do not mind it.

816
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:44,225
That is right.

817
00:55:44,809 --> 00:55:45,643
It is a promise.

818
00:55:50,272 --> 00:55:53,484
Will you be going to North Fortress
by yourself as arranged?

819
00:55:53,567 --> 00:55:56,987
There will only be peace
and quiet if I leave.

820
00:55:58,197 --> 00:55:59,031
Uk.

821
00:56:01,283 --> 00:56:02,701
I am here to tell you something

822
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:06,205
that will bring about
neither peace nor quiet.

823
00:56:09,917 --> 00:56:14,130
The pain you will feel
upon learning of it or ignoring it

824
00:56:15,881 --> 00:56:17,842
is something you should endure,

825
00:56:18,717 --> 00:56:20,261
not for me to decide.

826
00:56:21,512 --> 00:56:22,555
That is why I am here.

827
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:29,979
Naksu will disappear soon.

828
00:56:32,314 --> 00:56:36,652
She believes that no justification
is reasonable enough to stay by your side.

829
00:56:38,154 --> 00:56:39,280
But will this be

830
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,783
a good justification for you?

831
00:56:45,161 --> 00:56:45,995
Yul.

832
00:56:47,496 --> 00:56:48,622
Do you know how I felt

833
00:56:50,124 --> 00:56:52,376
when I decided to feign ignorance…

834
00:56:54,503 --> 00:56:55,880
and leave her behind?

835
00:57:13,189 --> 00:57:14,982
I turned away with the knowledge

836
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,694
that I must slay her
if I acknowledged who she was.

837
00:57:42,343 --> 00:57:43,677
Her approaching death

838
00:57:44,803 --> 00:57:46,722
cannot be an excuse for us to be together.

839
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:55,981
Instead of using my coming death
as a cowardly excuse to be together…

840
00:57:56,565 --> 00:57:57,399
It is much better…

841
00:58:00,736 --> 00:58:02,321
for us to be tormented instead.

842
00:58:20,172 --> 00:58:22,258
I, Jin Bu-yeon,
the eldest daughter of the Jin family,

843
00:58:22,341 --> 00:58:24,510
have retrieved the plaque
from Gwido to prove

844
00:58:25,094 --> 00:58:26,595
my power as a priestess.

845
00:58:41,694 --> 00:58:44,280
I heard Jang Uk sent Jin Mu to Gwido.

846
00:58:44,363 --> 00:58:45,406
What happened to him?

847
00:58:45,489 --> 00:58:48,492
I found the ice stone that belonged
to that mage of the Choi family

848
00:58:49,743 --> 00:58:50,995
and put it inside of him.

849
00:58:53,747 --> 00:58:54,623
Jin Mu…

850
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,168
will eventually wither away and die.

851
00:59:23,736 --> 00:59:26,280
It desires to absorb human energy

852
00:59:26,363 --> 00:59:27,990
like a soul shifter that has run wild.

853
00:59:28,574 --> 00:59:30,200
So you put that inside of him.

854
00:59:30,951 --> 00:59:32,786
It may have lost the energy of the sky,

855
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,455
but it is still an ice stone.

856
00:59:34,538 --> 00:59:36,707
And you put that inside of him.

857
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:39,043
I am impressed by your divine powers.

858
00:59:41,503 --> 00:59:43,881
If you could put it inside of someone,

859
00:59:43,964 --> 00:59:47,176
that must mean
you can take it out as well.

860
00:59:48,135 --> 00:59:50,387
The main purpose
of today's Unanimous Assembly

861
00:59:50,471 --> 00:59:53,390
is to discuss what to do
with Jang Uk's ice stone.

862
00:59:53,474 --> 00:59:55,726
Since she can take out the ice stone,

863
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:57,603
we can retrieve Jang Uk's ice stone

864
00:59:57,686 --> 00:59:59,855
if we agree on it today.

865
00:59:59,938 --> 01:00:04,485
But Jang Uk will die
if the ice stone is removed from his body.

866
01:00:04,568 --> 01:00:06,654
He should have died three years ago.

867
01:00:06,737 --> 01:00:08,322
He is only alive due to the decision

868
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:10,074
of the royal family
and the Unanimous Assembly.

869
01:00:10,157 --> 01:00:12,242
If Jang Uk did not stop Jin Mu,

870
01:00:12,326 --> 01:00:14,912
the fire bird would have emerged
and caused chaos in the world.

871
01:00:14,995 --> 01:00:16,330
Songrim should not intervene!

872
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:20,042
We are only having this conversation
because you decided to be rash

873
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:23,045
instead of asking the royal family
or the Unanimous Assembly for permission.

874
01:00:23,671 --> 01:00:24,546
I took part…

875
01:00:26,507 --> 01:00:27,633
in their plan.

876
01:00:27,716 --> 01:00:28,967
Do not intervene.

877
01:00:30,219 --> 01:00:32,304
You deliberately did so
without my consent.

878
01:00:33,222 --> 01:00:35,307
-You should not have done that.
-But, Your Majesty…

879
01:00:37,851 --> 01:00:40,604
We only allowed Jang Uk
to keep that ice stone

880
01:00:40,688 --> 01:00:42,981
so that he could obliterate
the soul shifters.

881
01:00:43,065 --> 01:00:44,775
He does not need its power anymore

882
01:00:44,858 --> 01:00:47,569
since there are
no more soul shifters left.

883
01:00:47,653 --> 01:00:49,196
-Right.
-I agree.

884
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,531
-True.
-Take the ice stone back.

885
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:52,074
That is only natural.

886
01:00:52,157 --> 01:00:54,535
-Right.
-He is right.

887
01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:01,709
If that is what
the Unanimous Assembly decides,

888
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:05,003
you must also abide by it
as a fellow member

889
01:01:05,087 --> 01:01:06,755
and Jinyowon's heiress.

890
01:01:08,841 --> 01:01:10,676
If that is
what the Unanimous Assembly decides,

891
01:01:12,344 --> 01:01:13,887
then I must follow their decision.

892
01:01:26,191 --> 01:01:27,025
Your Highness.

893
01:01:27,109 --> 01:01:28,944
That is the door to Gwido.

894
01:01:29,903 --> 01:01:31,280
You can find Jin Mu there.

895
01:01:31,363 --> 01:01:32,781
You can ask him where the Soul Ejector is

896
01:01:32,865 --> 01:01:35,284
and how you can perform
the alchemy of souls.

897
01:01:36,577 --> 01:01:40,122
Yun-o, how did you find
the key to that door?

898
01:01:41,457 --> 01:01:44,084
My friends from Cheonbugwan helped me.

899
01:01:44,668 --> 01:01:45,502
Is that so?

900
01:01:48,714 --> 01:01:49,590
Let us go.

901
01:01:57,973 --> 01:01:58,807
Uk.

902
01:02:00,225 --> 01:02:01,059
Where is Bu-yeon?

903
01:02:01,143 --> 01:02:03,228
She agreed to abide
by the Unanimous Assembly's decision.

904
01:02:03,937 --> 01:02:04,772
She has left now.

905
01:02:19,745 --> 01:02:23,582
We were discussing what to do
with the ice stone within you.

906
01:02:23,665 --> 01:02:26,084
If we decide to retrieve it,

907
01:02:26,168 --> 01:02:30,881
Jin Bu-yeon, the priestess of Jinyowon,
will take it out of you.

908
01:02:30,964 --> 01:02:34,593
Did she say that she would abide by it?

909
01:02:34,676 --> 01:02:35,511
That is right.

910
01:02:36,094 --> 01:02:40,682
And she exposed
all the sins you have committed.

911
01:02:46,522 --> 01:02:47,397
Last night,

912
01:02:48,524 --> 01:02:50,984
he spared one soul shifter.

913
01:02:51,652 --> 01:02:53,987
He knew that individual
was a soul shifter,

914
01:02:55,322 --> 01:02:56,865
but he feigned ignorance.

915
01:02:56,949 --> 01:02:58,700
Is that true?

916
01:03:00,994 --> 01:03:01,829
Yes.

917
01:03:02,454 --> 01:03:03,789
I feigned ignorance.

918
01:03:09,503 --> 01:03:13,006
So did she want me
to slay that soul shifter?

919
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:16,969
Please tell him
to stop feigning ignorance.

920
01:03:19,137 --> 01:03:20,848
Tell him to confirm its existence

921
01:03:22,015 --> 01:03:23,392
and watch it…

922
01:03:26,061 --> 01:03:27,312
wither away.

923
01:03:29,439 --> 01:03:32,192
She gave me a reason
and an excuse to find that soul shifter.

924
01:03:32,276 --> 01:03:33,777
A reason and an excuse?

925
01:03:34,486 --> 01:03:37,239
That was your duty.

926
01:03:37,823 --> 01:03:38,657
In that case,

927
01:03:39,324 --> 01:03:40,951
I will fulfill my duty

928
01:03:41,577 --> 01:03:42,995
and no longer feign ignorance.

929
01:03:45,789 --> 01:03:47,583
I will confirm its existence

930
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:49,793
and watch it wither away.

931
01:03:50,586 --> 01:03:51,420
Now,

932
01:03:52,629 --> 01:03:54,214
I will leave.

933
01:03:55,007 --> 01:03:56,341
Where are you going?

934
01:03:56,425 --> 01:03:58,135
We are discussing what you have done!

935
01:03:58,218 --> 01:04:00,012
That is over now!

936
01:04:13,525 --> 01:04:15,694
I will accept your reason and excuse,

937
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:17,446
and I will leave.

938
01:04:22,868 --> 01:04:25,245
Stop uttering such words.

939
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:27,623
We are only telling you
to fulfill your duty!

940
01:04:29,625 --> 01:04:31,585
Are we not retrieving the ice stone?

941
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:43,555
What is going on?

942
01:04:44,389 --> 01:04:45,557
There is still a soul shifter?

943
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:49,144
That is right.

944
01:04:50,354 --> 01:04:51,480
Uk will not return

945
01:04:53,065 --> 01:04:54,274
until he catches them.

946
01:06:26,324 --> 01:06:27,284
In the end,

947
01:06:28,994 --> 01:06:31,872
you used what is between us
as a reason and excuse

948
01:06:34,082 --> 01:06:35,375
to bring me here.

949
01:06:37,711 --> 01:06:39,379
My merciless master.

950
01:06:42,257 --> 01:06:43,633
I am not your master anymore.

951
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:46,803
I have already…

952
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:50,724
let you go.

953
01:08:12,973 --> 01:08:15,350
I found him, Your Highness! I see Jin Mu!

954
01:08:16,059 --> 01:08:17,561
Gwanju!

955
01:08:27,237 --> 01:08:29,614
You are on the brink of death.

956
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:39,124
Jin Mu.

957
01:08:39,207 --> 01:08:40,792
Tell me one thing before you die.

958
01:08:41,418 --> 01:08:42,794
One last Soul Ejector remains.

959
01:08:43,378 --> 01:08:45,005
Where is it? Do you have it?

960
01:08:46,673 --> 01:08:48,925
Pull yourself together. Where is it?

961
01:08:58,643 --> 01:09:01,146
Jin Mu. Give me the Soul Ejector.

962
01:09:01,229 --> 01:09:02,856
You made a promise to me.

963
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:06,026
Hand it over before you die.

964
01:09:09,654 --> 01:09:10,488
Yes.

965
01:09:10,572 --> 01:09:12,616
Where is it?

966
01:09:15,368 --> 01:09:18,914
My last Soul Ejector

967
01:09:21,082 --> 01:09:25,462
is inside the blood
of the mage of the Choi family

968
01:09:26,755 --> 01:09:30,091
who created it in the first place.

969
01:09:36,139 --> 01:09:38,642
Are you saying it is inside of me?

970
01:09:54,824 --> 01:09:56,826
I put it inside your body

971
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:59,871
when I was shifting your soul.

972
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:03,833
I guess you did not remember that.

973
01:10:13,301 --> 01:10:16,930
It is all coming back to me now.

974
01:10:18,181 --> 01:10:20,892
The one who shifted my soul
and locked me up

975
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:22,894
was you,

976
01:10:24,437 --> 01:10:25,480
Jin Mu!

977
01:11:01,683 --> 01:11:02,892
Gwanju.

978
01:11:02,976 --> 01:11:06,313
I came here to rescue you.
Let us leave together.

979
01:11:06,396 --> 01:11:07,605
That is right.

980
01:11:08,315 --> 01:11:10,567
We will leave this place together.

981
01:11:12,068 --> 01:11:12,902
No.

982
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:16,948
I will leave this place in your body.

983
01:13:51,811 --> 01:13:53,062
Did you go to Gwido?

984
01:13:53,146 --> 01:13:55,440
Was Jin Mu still alive?

985
01:13:55,523 --> 01:13:58,568
So you were the one who sent me there
to save him, Your Majesty.

986
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,864
He had promised to give me immense powers,

987
01:14:02,947 --> 01:14:05,158
so I must at least know
how to acquire them.

988
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:07,869
So tell me. Did you meet him?

989
01:14:08,995 --> 01:14:10,914
You are looking at him right now,
Your Majesty.

990
01:14:12,707 --> 01:14:13,708
Your Majesty.

991
01:14:14,626 --> 01:14:16,002
Do you still not understand?

992
01:14:17,962 --> 01:14:19,547
I am Jin Mu.

993
01:14:24,135 --> 01:14:25,345
You have shifted souls!

994
01:14:30,433 --> 01:14:33,645
So this is the very power
that you have promised me.

995
01:14:33,728 --> 01:14:35,939
If we share the power of the ice stone,

996
01:14:36,481 --> 01:14:39,150
we will live forever
as the strong gain greater power.

997
01:14:42,278 --> 01:14:45,532
Now, come on out
and let us walk down the path together

998
01:14:46,574 --> 01:14:49,536
to acquire that very power.

999
01:16:14,912 --> 01:16:17,832
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

1000
01:16:18,583 --> 01:16:19,917
There is only one reply I can give you

1001
01:16:20,001 --> 01:16:22,253
in our last moment together.

1002
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:25,256
We must go to Jinyowon at once
and bring out the fire bird.

1003
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:27,425
-Bring me the ice stone.
-Your Majesty!

1004
01:16:27,508 --> 01:16:30,345
What are you trying to do by fooling
the King and Unanimous Assembly?

1005
01:16:31,054 --> 01:16:32,388
Uk.

1006
01:16:32,472 --> 01:16:35,475
Uk, Jin is…

1007
01:16:36,934 --> 01:16:40,938
I fear that the same kind of chaos
may occur once again.

1008
01:16:41,022 --> 01:16:42,023
The fire bird will awaken.

1009
01:16:42,106 --> 01:16:43,941
I was told that
it is going to happen no matter what.

1010
01:16:47,195 --> 01:16:52,200
