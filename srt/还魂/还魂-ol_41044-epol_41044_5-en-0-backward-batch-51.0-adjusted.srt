00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is inside my body?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,010
I would at least like to know…

5
00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:04,138
before I die.

6
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:12,938
When I was gravely hurt and unconscious,

7
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:16,108
I heard that you gave me your blood.

8
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:19,737
Is that right?

9
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,156
I was only trying to save you.

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,326
I thought the energy
of the blood parasite could save you.

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,869
The blood parasite?

12
00:00:31,582 --> 00:00:34,251
So there is a parasite inside my body.

13
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:36,378
I was told
the medicine would make it better.

14
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:37,797
That is why I kept sending them to you.

15
00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:39,840
But you did not take them?

16
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:45,221
Why not?

17
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:50,351
Did you not take what I sent you

18
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:54,271
because you could not
trust someone like me,

19
00:00:56,065 --> 00:00:56,899
Young Master Seo?

20
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:08,619
Put it back.

21
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:11,747
Put the parasite back into me.

22
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:16,210
-Put it back--
-Do not move.

23
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,295
The cut is quite deep.

24
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,342
You are truly reckless.

25
00:01:29,515 --> 00:01:31,892
Even someone like me gave it
by simply making a cut.

26
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:34,687
So why can you not do the same?

27
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,106
Once it entered my energy-filled body,

28
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,109
it entered the core of my energy.

29
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:42,695
It has settled there

30
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:45,114
and is eating away at my energy.

31
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,785
I will die once my energy runs out.

32
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:52,830
There must be a way.

33
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,416
Master Jin U-tak was the one
who gave it to me,

34
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:57,501
so it must be a relic from Jinyowon.

35
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:59,712
They must have a way to get rid of it.

36
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:06,218
Is Gwanju Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan the one
who is providing you with the medicine?

37
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,060
He must have been the one
who told you to spread

38
00:02:16,645 --> 00:02:17,813
those rumors about Naksu.

39
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:23,736
Does he know
that I have the blood parasite?

40
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,740
No one does.

41
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:34,079
Do not send me any more medicine.

42
00:02:34,663 --> 00:02:36,081
I will not be seeing you again.

43
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:41,170
I returned to settle things one last time.

44
00:02:42,046 --> 00:02:44,048
Please continue keeping this a secret.

45
00:02:52,097 --> 00:02:53,557
Why are you letting me go

46
00:02:54,183 --> 00:02:55,726
when I am the reason you will die?

47
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:58,479
Do you not want to kill me?

48
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,236
You said you only did it to save me,

49
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:07,321
and I believe you.

50
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:20,709
Maidservant Kim gave this to me.

51
00:03:20,793 --> 00:03:23,379
I see that they are precious diamonds.

52
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:26,173
Are you giving them back?

53
00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:30,552
-Please take them.
-So it is a rejection.

54
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:33,055
I understand.

55
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,396
Why are you trembling so much?

56
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,235
For the past three years,

57
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,990
I was anxious I would come face to face

58
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:53,200
with a situation like this.

59
00:03:56,328 --> 00:03:58,330
I teared up just from thinking about it.

60
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,709
Now that it is happening,

61
00:04:04,003 --> 00:04:05,963
the pain is unbearable.

62
00:04:06,964 --> 00:04:08,340
Was that

63
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:11,468
the only thought you had during that time?

64
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:18,851
Then see for yourself

65
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:21,186
what my past three years were like.

66
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:31,947
This is

67
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:35,409
the charm that helps
two people become lovers,

68
00:04:36,994 --> 00:04:38,912
Did you have it all along?

69
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:42,374
I have never thought

70
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,002
that you would forget me…

71
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,006
unless I abandoned you first.

72
00:04:50,716 --> 00:04:51,550
Then…

73
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:55,137
does this mean you wanted to show me…

74
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:00,517
that you had kept it

75
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:03,020
all this time?

76
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,022
I would have thrown it away
if I wanted to,

77
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:07,024
not brought it to show you.

78
00:05:11,153 --> 00:05:11,987
Thank you.

79
00:05:14,156 --> 00:05:16,575
Just knowing that you did not discard it

80
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,161
gives me a sense of relief.

81
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,498
I appreciate your heartfelt gift.

82
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:29,546
But I cannot wear this in public for now.

83
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:32,716
That is fine.

84
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,302
You can just hold on to it.

85
00:05:35,385 --> 00:05:37,346
But it is a gift, after all.

86
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:42,559
It would be a waste just to hold on to it.

87
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:46,063
Then would you like to wear it right now?

88
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:09,253
What do you think?

89
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:11,505
Do I look pretty?

90
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:16,969
Yes.

91
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:21,890
You are truly radiant

92
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:24,685
and beautiful.

93
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,743
Thank you for your help.

94
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:47,082
I did not want people
to keep talking about Naksu either.

95
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:52,588
With this, Uk erased Naksu
from this world once and for all.

96
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,341
I hope he erased her
from his heart as well.

97
00:06:57,926 --> 00:07:00,762
Everyone knows
that Naksu was Uk's true love.

98
00:07:00,846 --> 00:07:05,517
I understand why you do not welcome him
as your son-in-law.

99
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:09,730
Why did he take Bu-yeon?

100
00:07:09,813 --> 00:07:11,023
I understand that she went

101
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:13,650
because she did not want
to become the heiress.

102
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:17,112
But I cannot wrap my head around
why he accepted her.

103
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:20,949
Bu-yeon is a priestess who can see energy.

104
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:24,912
She saw the energy of the sky
in the ice stone that burdens Uk

105
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,916
at first glance.

106
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,878
The energy of the sky in the ice stone?

107
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:35,964
She said she would protect him.

108
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,011
I hope those two

109
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:44,765
will keep each other safe.

110
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:54,710
So you are still dreaming.

111
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,547
It breaks my heart.

112
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,605
I am not dreaming.

113
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,024
Do you

114
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:20,110
recognize me?

115
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,194
Yes.

116
00:09:22,404 --> 00:09:23,322
You woke me up.

117
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:34,291
I was not trying to wake you up.

118
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,460
You had mistaken me for someone else.

119
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:39,421
I only stayed because I could not
just leave you like that.

120
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:42,215
I thought you were still dreaming.

121
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,301
Then let us pretend that I am.

122
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,303
I will go back to bed, so leave.

123
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,763
I have not slept

124
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:50,682
so soundly in a long time.

125
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,896
You have me to thank for that.

126
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:58,065
Thanks to you, my sleep was interrupted.

127
00:10:00,651 --> 00:10:02,319
Can you not feel the warmth in here?

128
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,821
The wraiths fled because of me.

129
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,698
See? You are not cold anymore, are you?

130
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:15,082
If I leave,

131
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,584
you will not be able
to sleep well like you just did.

132
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,506
-Should I go?
-In that case,

133
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:25,676
stay.

134
00:10:28,637 --> 00:10:30,639
We both need to sleep.

135
00:10:32,182 --> 00:10:35,060
So sleep here and do not wake me up.

136
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:40,440
All right.

137
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:42,025
I will do that.

138
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,195
After all, it would be useful of me

139
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,656
to help you sleep better.

140
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:01,002
I heard that
the ice stone keeps you awake.

141
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:04,756
Is that not why you brought me here?

142
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,758
To sleep better?

143
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,302
Yes.

144
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,055
That is why.

145
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,016
I want to fall into a deep sleep.

146
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:21,314
Uk,

147
00:11:21,398 --> 00:11:22,649
are you having a hard time

148
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,569
because you have trouble going to sleep?

149
00:11:28,697 --> 00:11:30,157
I feel bad for waking you up.

150
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:35,203
Should I pat you again
so you can sleep well?

151
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,417
What?

152
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,253
I patted you as you fell asleep.

153
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:45,672
I patted you until my wrist hurt.

154
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:47,841
ShalI I do it again?

155
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:50,343
Forget it. You--

156
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:53,680
Here.

157
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:54,973
Do not cross this line.

158
00:12:32,636 --> 00:12:34,054
There, now you feel warm.

159
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:36,598
Yes.

160
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,268
It feels warm.

161
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:16,388
For the price of sparing Jang Uk,
who had the ice stone,

162
00:13:16,471 --> 00:13:18,014
the mages from all the other families

163
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:21,017
left Jeongjingak.

164
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,396
Master Seo Gyeong,
my former master, built this place.

165
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:26,231
But now it is empty.

166
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:30,569
They are excluding us
out of jealousy and fear

167
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:31,861
that Songrim has the ice stone.

168
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,072
Thanks to Jang Uk,

169
00:13:34,155 --> 00:13:36,366
Songrim's power has not
diminished even by a bit.

170
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,578
Yeom, you have not matured
despite growing three years older.

171
00:13:40,161 --> 00:13:42,497
Master Seo did not build Jeongjingak

172
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:44,541
to see which mage was the strongest,

173
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,127
but for unity and education.

174
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,378
I apologize, Master Lee.

175
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,464
I have failed to honor his wishes.

176
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:53,592
No, you did your best, Jin.

177
00:13:54,342 --> 00:13:56,261
You swore on your life and protected Uk.

178
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:59,055
You pacified the mages
from other families.

179
00:13:59,723 --> 00:14:01,975
You also retired at such a young age.

180
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:07,898
You always favor Jin over me.

181
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:16,156
I heard that you treated Jin Bu-yeon.

182
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:18,575
Right, remember what she said last time?

183
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:22,245
She said she was treated
by the best physician in Daeho Fortress.

184
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,916
And that physician was our master.

185
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:30,545
Lady Jin desperately begged me
to treat her daughter in secret.

186
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:33,256
Now that she has wedded Jang Uk
and her existence has been revealed,

187
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,758
there is nothing to hide anymore.

188
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:39,304
Jang Uk must be the one
who kidnapped her on her wedding day.

189
00:14:39,387 --> 00:14:42,515
He recklessly declared their marriage

190
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,809
and brought the Unanimous Assembly
into turmoil.

191
00:14:50,732 --> 00:14:52,400
So that is what you call fate.

192
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:54,778
Something…

193
00:14:55,654 --> 00:14:57,072
that humans cannot control.

194
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:06,998
How heartwarming.

195
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:08,959
Keep going.

196
00:15:31,523 --> 00:15:32,357
What was that?

197
00:15:32,941 --> 00:15:34,651
That memory was not from last night.

198
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:42,909
Was that also her memory?

199
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:56,172
Master,

200
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:57,924
I finally did it.

201
00:15:58,008 --> 00:15:59,843
I also missed you. That is my reply.

202
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,386
Did you want to look nice for me?

203
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:13,440
Young Master.

204
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:15,316
Young Master.

205
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,068
Young Master.

206
00:16:18,236 --> 00:16:19,279
Young Master.

207
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:34,753
The soul shifter you killed yesterday

208
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,421
was not Naksu, was it?

209
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:39,007
But everyone thinks it was her
due to the rumor.

210
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,592
To the public, Naksu is gone now.

211
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,969
She will never reappear.

212
00:16:43,053 --> 00:16:44,971
Jin Mu was the one who spread the rumor.

213
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,640
I know.

214
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:52,312
You had suspected him too.

215
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:58,109
In any case,

216
00:16:59,027 --> 00:17:01,071
we are talking about her at last
through this incident.

217
00:17:08,411 --> 00:17:09,245
Uk.

218
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:13,374
She sometimes appears in my dreams.

219
00:17:18,213 --> 00:17:20,215
In some of these dreams, she stabs me.

220
00:17:21,591 --> 00:17:22,509
While other times,

221
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,097
I stab her in the dream.

222
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:32,435
It must be due to the guilt I feel

223
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,396
for fleeing without doing anything.

224
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,238
She is still just as obnoxious.

225
00:17:43,822 --> 00:17:45,740
Why would she torment you in your dreams

226
00:17:46,658 --> 00:17:47,742
when you did nothing wrong?

227
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:53,915
Yul.

228
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,710
Everything was my responsibility

229
00:17:58,753 --> 00:17:59,963
from the moment I saw her eyes.

230
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,089
So you neither

231
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,675
did nothing

232
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:05,885
nor ran away.

233
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,514
Thank you for saying that.

234
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:13,226
Had I recognized her first,

235
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:16,396
I would have taken responsibility as well.

236
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:20,984
Uk, Yul, come and have breakfast.

237
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,319
Then take responsibility
and have breakfast.

238
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,446
I ate 100 of his dumplings recently.

239
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,157
There are about 50 left.

240
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,241
Good luck.

241
00:18:29,951 --> 00:18:31,744
Help me with just ten of them.

242
00:18:34,164 --> 00:18:35,081
You are on your own.

243
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:36,082
It is your responsibility.

244
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,043
-I have somewhere to go.
-Where?

245
00:18:39,127 --> 00:18:40,128
The palace.

246
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:42,463
The people who spread that rumor

247
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:44,716
should take responsibility as well.

248
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,345
Where in the world is she?
Did you find her?

249
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,763
Did you search thoroughly?

250
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,141
Where could she be?

251
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:56,102
Let us search again carefully.

252
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:57,562
-Let us go.
-Sure.

253
00:19:01,024 --> 00:19:03,109
-What is going on?
-Young Lady Bu-yeon is missing.

254
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:07,071
She complained of a headache,
so I thought she was in her room.

255
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:08,198
But she is not here.

256
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:10,950
-She was ill?
-Yes.

257
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:12,744
Strangely enough,

258
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:15,872
everyone slept well last night
due to the sudden warmth in the air.

259
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,415
But I guess she did not.

260
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,962
The wraiths fled because of me.

261
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:24,964
See? You are not cold anymore, are you?

262
00:19:26,424 --> 00:19:28,801
It was she who cast away the wraiths.

263
00:19:30,428 --> 00:19:31,971
Is that so?

264
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:33,097
Yes.

265
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:38,311
Does that mean
she took in all that cold energy?

266
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,188
Maybe that is why she is ill.

267
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:42,482
Where in the world did she go?

268
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:43,983
Do you have any ideas?

269
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:46,444
-How would I know?
-But she goes out every day.

270
00:19:46,527 --> 00:19:47,862
Do you not know where she goes?

271
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:48,863
No.

272
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:50,281
That makes sense.

273
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,786
You have never eaten with her
or gone out with her.

274
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:57,288
How would you know
when you are always away?

275
00:19:57,372 --> 00:19:58,206
Forget it.

276
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,416
She must not be here.

277
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,626
Goodness.

278
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,421
She is ill?

279
00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:09,550
Was I the only one who slept well?

280
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:25,900
That jerk.

281
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,069
That horrible, mean jerk.

282
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,447
Where could she be?

283
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,084
I am drawing a blank

284
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:45,837
since I do not know much about her.

285
00:20:49,257 --> 00:20:50,675
Should I go to Jinyowon?

286
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:00,101
Hello, you are back.

287
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:03,813
I will have the usual
and some honey biscuits too.

288
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:04,897
Sure thing.

289
00:21:13,156 --> 00:21:15,575
Goodness, you are so beautiful.

290
00:21:15,658 --> 00:21:17,910
We have many pretty ones. Pick one.

291
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,334
How much is this?

292
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,918
Just five nyang.

293
00:21:27,128 --> 00:21:28,046
That is expensive.

294
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:31,132
Not at all. It is actually quite cheap.

295
00:21:31,716 --> 00:21:32,800
Then three nyang.

296
00:21:32,884 --> 00:21:34,052
-Three nyang?
-Yes.

297
00:21:34,135 --> 00:21:35,636
I am selling this below the cost.

298
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,554
Three nyang?

299
00:21:36,637 --> 00:21:37,680
-Yes.
-I will take it.

300
00:21:40,808 --> 00:21:43,603
Goodness, they are fighting again.

301
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:45,646
-Here.
-Who were you with last night?

302
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,191
What were you doing outside
instead of coming home?

303
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:50,568
I fell asleep while I was out drinking.

304
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:52,028
You better not lie to me.

305
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:55,073
You were with some widows,
were you not? Come here!

306
00:21:55,156 --> 00:21:57,241
-Goodness! I am sorry!
-Just die!

307
00:21:57,325 --> 00:21:58,993
You scumbag!

308
00:21:59,077 --> 00:22:00,078
What is going on?

309
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:02,330
-He is never home.
-You will never stop, will you?

310
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:04,248
You got it all wrong!

311
00:22:04,332 --> 00:22:05,750
She must be so upset.

312
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,629
He is having an affair
with the oil mill widow.

313
00:22:20,515 --> 00:22:21,599
Jang Uk?

314
00:22:22,892 --> 00:22:26,104
The rice store man is having
an affair with the oil mill woman.

315
00:22:26,687 --> 00:22:28,272
That is why he is never home.

316
00:22:28,773 --> 00:22:30,274
He is a lost cause, right?

317
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:35,446
Are you comparing me to that guy?

318
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,074
It was satisfying
to see his hair get torn out.

319
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,242
Goodness.

320
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:42,286
But why are you here?

321
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,830
I heard you were sick,

322
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:46,332
but it seems you are fine.
You look ready to tear my hair out.

323
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,127
Did you come to find me
because you were worried?

324
00:22:50,962 --> 00:22:53,506
You left without telling anyone.
That is why.

325
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:55,675
It is urgent. We need to go somewhere.

326
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:57,218
No wonder.

327
00:22:57,885 --> 00:22:59,011
Where do we need to go?

328
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:09,147
I heard you had a headache.
You are neither hot nor cold.

329
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:10,773
Right.

330
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:13,985
I was a bit dizzy.

331
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,363
I thought staying home
would make it worse.

332
00:23:17,446 --> 00:23:18,823
You should express it if you are sick.

333
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:20,491
Do not go out without a word.

334
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:22,577
Everyone at my house worries

335
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,037
and will readily take care of you
if you are sick.

336
00:23:28,624 --> 00:23:29,458
Even you?

337
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,546
I am here, am I not?

338
00:23:39,093 --> 00:23:40,887
It is hot. Let us go.

339
00:23:43,264 --> 00:23:44,724
Uk, it is refreshing, right?

340
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:46,934
-I got it for cheap.
-Goodness.

341
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:49,103
She ripped you off. You paid double.

342
00:23:49,187 --> 00:23:51,564
Seriously? She said it was at a low price.

343
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,442
-Give that back.
-Hey, come on.

344
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:55,985
Your Royal Highness.

345
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:57,612
Come here.

346
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:02,158
Leave this turtle
at Chwiseonru for a few days.

347
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,452
The sudden change of environment
could shock it,

348
00:24:04,535 --> 00:24:06,454
so move its entire house.

349
00:24:06,537 --> 00:24:08,456
Do not let them overfeed it.

350
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:09,540
Understood?

351
00:24:09,624 --> 00:24:10,625
Right.

352
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:13,544
Do not say that it was from me.
Say that it was from you.

353
00:24:13,628 --> 00:24:15,963
Why would you suddenly move this turtle?

354
00:24:16,047 --> 00:24:19,759
I am showing kindness
to the poor Turtle Shaman

355
00:24:19,842 --> 00:24:21,260
who lost her husband to a peacock.

356
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:23,262
I will do as you say.

357
00:24:23,804 --> 00:24:24,639
But, Your Royal Highness,

358
00:24:25,223 --> 00:24:27,850
Jang Uk and Jin Bu-yeon
are at the palace right now.

359
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:29,310
Why?

360
00:24:29,393 --> 00:24:32,188
They want to apologize
for ruining the Queen's banquet.

361
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,898
Jang Uk is here to apologize?

362
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,276
-He must be demanding an apology.
-Will you be coming?

363
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,403
You were curious about Jin Bu-yeon.

364
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:40,529
Forget it.

365
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:42,531
Bring some people who can move the turtle.

366
00:24:43,407 --> 00:24:44,575
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

367
00:24:48,663 --> 00:24:52,500
I am the one who removed
Filthy Mu-deok from Jang Uk's side.

368
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:56,087
After what I have done,

369
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,423
I do not want to see Jin Bu-yeon
who took her place.

370
00:25:01,217 --> 00:25:04,220
If we are here to apologize,
should we bow and brownnose them?

371
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,055
We are not here to apologize.

372
00:25:06,847 --> 00:25:08,891
-Then?
-We are here to taunt them.

373
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:11,060
They tried to take what was mine,

374
00:25:11,894 --> 00:25:13,604
so I will show them what I have.

375
00:25:14,272 --> 00:25:15,106
And what is that?

376
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:20,903
You.

377
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:28,494
Do not bow or brownnose them.

378
00:25:29,537 --> 00:25:33,040
Just look at me
as if you love me to death.

379
00:25:40,548 --> 00:25:44,343
It was you two
who were in danger at my banquet.

380
00:25:44,927 --> 00:25:46,554
There is no need to apologize.

381
00:25:46,637 --> 00:25:49,307
No, Your Highness.
I am sorry for bringing Gwiseo

382
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,225
to a banquet you had not held in years.

383
00:25:51,976 --> 00:25:53,102
But you see,

384
00:25:53,978 --> 00:25:56,188
this woman is very precious to me.

385
00:25:56,939 --> 00:25:58,607
So I had to replace her with a relic

386
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,319
since I was
extremely worried about her safety.

387
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,199
I heard that this marriage was not
approved by her mother.

388
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:09,076
But I guess you two are deeply in love.

389
00:26:09,994 --> 00:26:11,662
She will approve of us soon.

390
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:15,249
I am the only one
who can protect her and Jinyowon.

391
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,918
You talk as if Jinyowon belongs to you.

392
00:26:18,002 --> 00:26:19,420
There are just too many people

393
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:23,007
who desire to take over Jinyowon.

394
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,718
I will protect it

395
00:26:26,677 --> 00:26:28,012
as my own.

396
00:26:33,184 --> 00:26:34,560
For her.

397
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:39,732
When I grab your hand,

398
00:26:40,316 --> 00:26:41,984
come up with a suitable excuse to leave.

399
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,528
-Just me?
-Yes.

400
00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:46,447
That is all that I need you to do.

401
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:48,240
Remember what I said.

402
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,326
It has to be a suitable excuse.

403
00:26:54,372 --> 00:26:57,291
A bee! I am sorry, Your Highness.
I am terrified of bees.

404
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,048
She is terrified of them

405
00:27:04,131 --> 00:27:06,133
since they swarm
to the sweetness of her beauty.

406
00:27:08,886 --> 00:27:11,389
She just looked plucky at the banquet,

407
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:13,516
but she is rather rude as well.

408
00:27:14,183 --> 00:27:16,060
That is her charm.

409
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:19,105
She keeps me on my toes
due to her unpredictability.

410
00:27:19,188 --> 00:27:22,024
You have a charming wife, Jinyowon,

411
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:25,027
and even the power of the ice stone.
You are quite greedy.

412
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:27,113
I would love
to use its power as I pleased.

413
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:30,699
But as you know, I am only allowed
to use it against soul shifters.

414
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:34,161
What a shame.

415
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:38,707
With my power, I would be able
to make your desperate wish come true.

416
00:27:40,668 --> 00:27:41,502
That is right.

417
00:27:41,585 --> 00:27:45,548
You can use Hwansu to shift my soul.

418
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:49,427
If you can help me,

419
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,929
I would not need
to summon another ice stone.

420
00:27:52,012 --> 00:27:55,349
How would you summon another ice stone?

421
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:57,768
I was told it was possible
by drying out this world.

422
00:27:57,852 --> 00:27:59,186
I see.

423
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:02,148
You wanted Jinyowon
so you could find a relic

424
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,400
that could do just that.

425
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:07,027
I finally get it now.

426
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:10,698
I knew you were trying
to hinder me by summoning Naksu.

427
00:28:11,282 --> 00:28:13,909
But I could not understand
why you wanted me away from Jinyowon

428
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,704
to the point of hurting Jin Bu-yeon.

429
00:28:16,787 --> 00:28:17,621
Jang Uk.

430
00:28:19,457 --> 00:28:21,417
Shift my soul with your power.

431
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:25,921
If you do, I will no longer
have a reason to dry up the world.

432
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,470
I do not care
about what happens to this world.

433
00:28:32,553 --> 00:28:34,305
But if you touch her ever again,

434
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:35,765
I will

435
00:28:36,432 --> 00:28:38,934
use my power as I please.

436
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:48,903
Please relay this message to those

437
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,114
who plotted this scheme with you.

438
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:31,529
The recent incident has made it clear
that Jang Uk and I are enemies now.

439
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:33,155
Your Royal Highness.

440
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:36,408
Gwanju Jin Mu has asked you
to come to Cheonbugwan.

441
00:29:36,492 --> 00:29:38,911
He is asking me to go there
instead of coming here

442
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:40,538
to see me?

443
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:43,332
He said it was regarding
the promise he made last time.

444
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:48,254
The first thing I will do
is to bring Jinyowon to the royal palace.

445
00:29:48,337 --> 00:29:50,506
I am doing this for you,
Your Royal Highness.

446
00:29:53,133 --> 00:29:55,427
I only kept Jin Mu by my side
to beat Jang Uk.

447
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:58,764
But now it seems like
I am nothing but Jin Mu's tool.

448
00:30:05,062 --> 00:30:06,772
Are you headed to Cheonbugwan?

449
00:30:06,856 --> 00:30:07,690
No.

450
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:10,025
I will be going to see Jang Uk's bride.

451
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:16,824
I think he was going
to talk about Jinyowon.

452
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:18,742
So why did he make me leave?

453
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:20,369
Why?

454
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:32,840
Be gentle with the turtle
so as not to shock it.

455
00:30:33,424 --> 00:30:34,758
Be careful.

456
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:38,637
Wait.

457
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,308
Does that turtle belong to Eunuch Go
who works in the palace?

458
00:30:42,391 --> 00:30:44,226
He serves the Crown Prince.

459
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,561
Right.

460
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,730
He is not Eunuch Go.

461
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:49,440
He is Eunuch Oh.

462
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:53,068
-Eunuch Oh.
-Yes, my lady.

463
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:54,945
I must have heard him wrong.

464
00:30:55,613 --> 00:30:58,699
Eunuch Oh has ordered us
to move this turtle.

465
00:30:59,283 --> 00:31:00,659
-Is that so?
-Yes, my lady.

466
00:31:04,538 --> 00:31:06,040
So it really is you.

467
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:08,751
They must be treating you well.

468
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:10,711
Put it down for a minute.

469
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,465
You see, we have met before.

470
00:31:14,548 --> 00:31:15,382
I see.

471
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:19,219
Goodness. How have you been?

472
00:31:19,303 --> 00:31:21,180
It seems to recognize you.

473
00:31:31,982 --> 00:31:33,901
The water is clean but cold.

474
00:31:34,944 --> 00:31:35,778
Are you all right?

475
00:31:55,172 --> 00:31:57,466
Goodness, it must be tough for you.

476
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:00,094
Your Royal Highness.

477
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:06,892
Did you change the water?

478
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:08,894
It could catch a cold in cold water.

479
00:32:08,978 --> 00:32:11,730
Young Master Jang Uk
said the water was cold,

480
00:32:11,814 --> 00:32:14,441
so he warmed it with his energy.

481
00:32:15,025 --> 00:32:16,527
He took care of my turtle?

482
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:20,280
-And he knew it was mine?
-Yes.

483
00:32:20,364 --> 00:32:23,158
I told him that Eunuch Oh
had ordered us to move it.

484
00:32:23,993 --> 00:32:26,870
So he warmed up the water
knowing that it was my turtle.

485
00:32:26,954 --> 00:32:28,163
Your Royal Highness,

486
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:31,291
Jang Uk must not feel hostile toward you.

487
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:35,129
If not, why would he bother
to take care of your turtle?

488
00:32:35,212 --> 00:32:36,046
You are right.

489
00:32:37,297 --> 00:32:39,091
He would hate my turtle if he hated me.

490
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:41,010
-Where is he?
-Where is he?

491
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:42,052
Where…

492
00:32:42,803 --> 00:32:45,681
He just left with his bride.

493
00:32:47,975 --> 00:32:48,892
I see.

494
00:32:48,976 --> 00:32:50,644
All right. You may go.

495
00:32:51,228 --> 00:32:52,062
Let us go.

496
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:58,944
He took care of my turtle?

497
00:32:59,987 --> 00:33:02,531
What should I make of this?

498
00:33:03,907 --> 00:33:05,242
Well…

499
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,161
Answer me.

500
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,418
I am sure he despises me.

501
00:33:15,544 --> 00:33:16,712
So why did he do that?

502
00:33:25,554 --> 00:33:28,015
I only did so because it was your turtle.

503
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:29,683
Exactly.

504
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:33,687
Why would you take care of my turtle?

505
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:34,605
Why?

506
00:33:34,688 --> 00:33:36,023
Because it was yours.

507
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:38,984
But you despise me.

508
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:41,862
So why would you suddenly
warm the water for my turtle?

509
00:33:41,945 --> 00:33:43,155
Do you still not get it?

510
00:33:44,406 --> 00:33:45,741
Because it was yours.

511
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:50,704
Jang Uk.

512
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:54,208
Why did you treat my turtle so kindly?

513
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,834
You are only

514
00:33:57,503 --> 00:33:59,671
giving me hope and making me think

515
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:02,382
that you do not hate me.

516
00:34:05,886 --> 00:34:07,596
Thank you for taking care of the turtle.

517
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:09,890
The eunuch will be pleased.

518
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:16,355
When did you befriend a eunuch?

519
00:34:17,106 --> 00:34:18,232
We met by chance.

520
00:34:18,315 --> 00:34:20,692
He is a kindhearted man
who saved the turtle for me.

521
00:34:20,776 --> 00:34:21,777
I see.

522
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:24,613
You saved a turtle, made a friend,

523
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,323
and even watched a couple fight.

524
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,033
You are having fun.

525
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:30,828
Only because you saved me.

526
00:34:31,787 --> 00:34:32,621
Goodness.

527
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,874
Jang Uk.

528
00:34:40,254 --> 00:34:41,380
I heard you got rid

529
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:43,882
of the tracking thread.

530
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,264
Thank you.

531
00:34:51,598 --> 00:34:53,517
I said it worries me if you are sick.

532
00:34:54,143 --> 00:34:54,977
Besides,

533
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,646
I thought you would go back home
due to the pain.

534
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:59,481
I will never go back.

535
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:09,241
I shall always stay by your side
at this distance.

536
00:35:23,672 --> 00:35:24,631
That is my promise.

537
00:35:34,141 --> 00:35:37,186
I will hold your hand as if it is a ring.

538
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,041
Jang Uk.

539
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:02,252
Let me explain.

540
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,341
When I woke up today,
I saw several memories.

541
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,677
They were as vivid as if they were mine.

542
00:36:13,722 --> 00:36:15,307
I was very confused and flustered.

543
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,225
So what?

544
00:36:17,267 --> 00:36:19,937
Did you grab my hand
so I could recall an unforgettable memory?

545
00:36:20,854 --> 00:36:22,189
So that I could reminisce and be happy?

546
00:36:22,272 --> 00:36:24,316
At least you got to cry last night.

547
00:36:26,193 --> 00:36:27,444
Did that not help you

548
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:30,155
feel better?

549
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,574
I guess so.

550
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:35,577
I guess

551
00:36:36,578 --> 00:36:38,455
I found another use for you.

552
00:36:40,624 --> 00:36:42,376
I could grab your hand and touch you.

553
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,169
I could embrace you if I miss her.

554
00:36:44,753 --> 00:36:47,297
I could hug you in my sleep
and not have to wait for her in my dreams.

555
00:36:49,424 --> 00:36:50,676
After all, you are offering

556
00:36:52,594 --> 00:36:53,845
to substitute for her.

557
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,229
Feel free to re-enact another memory.

558
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:04,273
This time,

559
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:07,192
I will not decline.

560
00:37:08,235 --> 00:37:09,069
Yesterday…

561
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,699
I was trying to comfort you.

562
00:37:16,493 --> 00:37:17,953
You seemed so sad.

563
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:23,166
And today,

564
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,211
I wanted to see…

565
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:30,132
if you had room for me in your heart.

566
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,429
It seems you do not, so I will stop.

567
00:37:52,321 --> 00:37:55,365
Did something bad happen at the palace?

568
00:37:57,451 --> 00:37:58,285
No.

569
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:02,164
Maidservant Kim, give me your hand.

570
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:04,082
-My hand?
-Yes.

571
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:05,000
Here.

572
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,597
You are dear to me as well.

573
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,057
Yes. Likewise.

574
00:38:24,978 --> 00:38:27,022
It should have felt different like now.

575
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,360
But it was just too similar.

576
00:38:31,985 --> 00:38:32,819
What do you mean?

577
00:38:33,862 --> 00:38:34,696
Nothing.

578
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,534
What did you say to her to make her cry?

579
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:42,037
-Is she crying?
-No, but she was teary-eyed.

580
00:38:42,913 --> 00:38:44,539
What did you say this time?

581
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:47,542
I do not know.
I just babbled out of shock.

582
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:48,877
Goodness.

583
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,213
I wish I could spank you
like I did in the past.

584
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:52,672
Goodness.

585
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,466
In any case,

586
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:58,178
at least you are arguing now
and not ignoring each other.

587
00:39:00,389 --> 00:39:03,350
Anyway, if you keep mistreating her,
you will end up

588
00:39:03,433 --> 00:39:05,352
-like a dog on a wild goose chase.
-A dog?

589
00:39:06,603 --> 00:39:08,855
Did you just call me a dog?

590
00:39:08,939 --> 00:39:10,357
Goodness, did I hurt your pride?

591
00:39:10,941 --> 00:39:13,985
When she is upset because you chose her
like choosing a chicken over a pheasant?

592
00:39:15,195 --> 00:39:17,239
You are unbelievable.

593
00:39:41,096 --> 00:39:42,806
Could it be because of this?

594
00:40:02,993 --> 00:40:04,411
I did not mean to imply

595
00:40:05,662 --> 00:40:07,706
that I settled for you over a pheasant.

596
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:11,168
I only wanted you to shut up

597
00:40:11,251 --> 00:40:13,587
because you made it seem like
that was my intention.

598
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:17,716
Anyway,

599
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,885
do not act like a chicken.

600
00:40:21,094 --> 00:40:22,471
And I will not act like a dog.

601
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:31,688
What was that?

602
00:40:32,272 --> 00:40:34,858
What did he say? Did you reconcile?

603
00:40:34,941 --> 00:40:35,901
I am not sure.

604
00:40:36,485 --> 00:40:38,320
He said I am a chicken and he is a dog.

605
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:46,119
Wait.

606
00:40:46,203 --> 00:40:48,413
Was he trying to reconcile
or pick another fight?

607
00:40:49,456 --> 00:40:50,540
Unbelievable.

608
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:53,919
Master Lee found several of these

609
00:40:54,002 --> 00:40:56,338
at the bottoms of dried-up wells.

610
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:58,340
This is heinous sorcery.

611
00:40:58,423 --> 00:41:02,052
Someone purposefully dried up the wells
out of resentment.

612
00:41:02,135 --> 00:41:03,887
The shamans at Gaema Village

613
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:06,640
create and sell such things.

614
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:08,892
It looks like a bird.

615
00:41:08,975 --> 00:41:10,644
The drought is ongoing.

616
00:41:10,727 --> 00:41:13,355
The lack of drinking water
will only worry everyone.

617
00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:19,027
It bothers me
that this was found in several wells.

618
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:22,906
Dang-gu, go to the merchants' association

619
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:25,825
and find out if there are
more dried-up wells in the capital.

620
00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:26,910
Yes, my lord.

621
00:41:27,536 --> 00:41:29,329
Where is Master Lee?

622
00:41:29,412 --> 00:41:32,582
He went to see Jang Uk
to tell him about this issue.

623
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:37,754
Then I will go and cook
Master Lee's favorite food,

624
00:41:37,837 --> 00:41:40,173
spicy beef soup with plenty of bracken.

625
00:41:40,257 --> 00:41:41,258
-No.
-No.

626
00:41:43,343 --> 00:41:46,096
He is probably at Jang Uk's place.

627
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:49,849
Maidservant Kim will surely cook
something for him.

628
00:41:49,933 --> 00:41:52,102
So do not bother
to cook anything. All right?

629
00:41:54,354 --> 00:41:55,897
That means Maidservant Kim

630
00:41:56,982 --> 00:41:58,400
will cater

631
00:41:59,568 --> 00:42:00,402
to him.

632
00:42:01,278 --> 00:42:02,821
They used to be very close

633
00:42:02,904 --> 00:42:05,448
when he stayed at Uk's house, right?

634
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,078
He even briefly stopped
drinking chaste herb tea

635
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:13,623
just because of her.

636
00:42:14,916 --> 00:42:16,084
Is that so?

637
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:19,087
Does that mean he had feelings for her?

638
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,840
I am quick with these things, you know?

639
00:42:22,382 --> 00:42:24,884
He wore the scarf

640
00:42:24,968 --> 00:42:29,514
that she had gifted to him
even when it was too hot.

641
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:32,350
He kept it on despite the heat?

642
00:42:32,434 --> 00:42:34,269
That is true love.

643
00:42:34,352 --> 00:42:35,437
Exactly.

644
00:42:40,567 --> 00:42:41,401
Look.

645
00:42:41,943 --> 00:42:43,945
It was just a fleeting emotion
that he felt

646
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:46,489
during his long lifetime.

647
00:42:46,573 --> 00:42:47,574
All right, Jin?

648
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:49,492
It is true love.

649
00:42:50,243 --> 00:42:52,704
It was the first time
he ever had feelings for a woman.

650
00:42:52,787 --> 00:42:54,414
It sure is true love.

651
00:42:54,497 --> 00:42:55,874
Stop that, you brat.

652
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:57,917
True love?

653
00:43:03,506 --> 00:43:04,841
I was going to make

654
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:08,303
spicy beef soup anyway.

655
00:43:09,095 --> 00:43:10,555
So instead of Master Lee,

656
00:43:12,098 --> 00:43:15,769
how about you two come and finish it all?

657
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:17,771
You too.

658
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:23,526
-What?
-You little…

659
00:43:25,153 --> 00:43:26,154
Hey!

660
00:43:36,748 --> 00:43:37,582
Who is it this time?

661
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:50,136
Jang Uk, it has been a long time.

662
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,889
It is nice to see you again, Master Lee.

663
00:43:54,182 --> 00:43:57,977
Are these the stone towers you raised
every time you killed a soul shifter?

664
00:43:59,145 --> 00:44:00,689
It is almost too many to count.

665
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:02,232
Why do you feign ignorance?

666
00:44:02,315 --> 00:44:03,817
You urged the Crown Prince

667
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,194
to reward me every single time.

668
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:10,365
Were you hurt
that I met with him but not you?

669
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:12,534
I did not pine for you that much.

670
00:44:14,035 --> 00:44:16,371
But it sure is nice to see you again.

671
00:44:19,249 --> 00:44:20,625
Is that Mu-deok's stone tower?

672
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:22,877
You should have been more meticulous.

673
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:24,963
It looks lousier than the others.

674
00:44:25,046 --> 00:44:26,381
I did not raise it.

675
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,383
Someone had destroyed it

676
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:30,677
and tried to rebuild it.

677
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,262
Who? Park Jin?

678
00:44:32,345 --> 00:44:34,389
No, it was a girl named Jin Bu-yeon.

679
00:44:35,765 --> 00:44:37,642
Jin Bu-yeon? She destroyed it?

680
00:44:41,354 --> 00:44:42,564
Do you know her?

681
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,024
Yes.

682
00:44:46,484 --> 00:44:47,861
I saved her life

683
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,530
and took care of her.

684
00:44:59,038 --> 00:45:01,583
Do not stay by Jang Uk's side anymore.

685
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:04,210
Mother, I am already married to him.

686
00:45:05,211 --> 00:45:06,379
I will not return home.

687
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,593
Why did he choose you?

688
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,929
Are the rumors
about how he desires Jinyowon true?

689
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:17,640
That is not true.
It was because he needed me.

690
00:45:19,726 --> 00:45:22,145
The ice stone draws wraiths to him,

691
00:45:22,812 --> 00:45:24,105
so he cannot sleep well.

692
00:45:24,856 --> 00:45:27,984
I can cast them away with my power.

693
00:45:29,736 --> 00:45:34,282
Are you saying
you have regained your power?

694
00:45:35,617 --> 00:45:36,618
I have.

695
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:39,454
The physician who took care of me
was right.

696
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:42,999
I am slowly regaining my memories
and divine powers.

697
00:45:48,755 --> 00:45:52,091
Why are you not asking me any questions
when I took care of Bu-yeon?

698
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:57,222
She already told me
about how she was ill, lost her memory,

699
00:45:57,305 --> 00:45:58,598
and was locked up.

700
00:45:59,432 --> 00:46:03,102
But I had no idea that you were
the great physician who treated her.

701
00:46:04,103 --> 00:46:07,565
I only agreed to keep it a secret
because her mother asked me to.

702
00:46:07,649 --> 00:46:10,735
Then did you just sit and watch
as Bu-yeon was trapped in that room

703
00:46:10,818 --> 00:46:13,696
with the tracking thread sewn into her?

704
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,907
There must have been
a reason for all that.

705
00:46:16,783 --> 00:46:19,410
You have taken what Jin Ho-gyeong

706
00:46:19,953 --> 00:46:21,871
has tried so hard to hide.

707
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:23,289
You have done so completely.

708
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:38,054
Let us go back home.

709
00:46:38,137 --> 00:46:40,431
I promise to let you do whatever you want.

710
00:46:40,515 --> 00:46:42,058
I will neither lock you up

711
00:46:42,141 --> 00:46:44,686
nor force you to get married.

712
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:46,563
In that case,

713
00:46:46,646 --> 00:46:49,524
there is no reason for you
to stay here and let him use you.

714
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:53,528
I promised

715
00:46:54,571 --> 00:46:55,822
to stay by his side.

716
00:46:57,532 --> 00:46:58,700
You are

717
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:01,494
in love with him.

718
00:47:08,334 --> 00:47:09,294
Poor thing.

719
00:47:09,377 --> 00:47:12,380
It is extremely painful
to long for someone

720
00:47:13,089 --> 00:47:14,173
who will never love you back.

721
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:17,677
End it here, Bu-yeon.

722
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:19,804
I do not want

723
00:47:20,847 --> 00:47:22,140
to stop here.

724
00:47:24,058 --> 00:47:26,978
In any case, I married him
because I wanted to.

725
00:47:28,354 --> 00:47:29,522
Is that right?

726
00:47:35,403 --> 00:47:36,863
In that case, fine.

727
00:47:37,864 --> 00:47:40,533
I would like you to bring him over.

728
00:47:42,118 --> 00:47:45,413
-What?
-You must do that if he is your husband.

729
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:47,457
He should apologize for his wrongdoings

730
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,959
and show his desire to get along with me.

731
00:47:50,585 --> 00:47:52,420
I will let him do that,

732
00:47:53,546 --> 00:47:54,380
so bring him over.

733
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:59,177
He is not the type
who would do such a thing.

734
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,054
He should at least do that much

735
00:48:01,137 --> 00:48:02,680
if he wants me
to approve of your marriage.

736
00:48:05,433 --> 00:48:07,810
I am being generous,

737
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:11,522
so make sure you bring him along with you.

738
00:48:24,661 --> 00:48:27,080
Jang Uk would not come, would he?

739
00:48:27,163 --> 00:48:28,706
I heard he does not come home either.

740
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:31,542
It is natural for a man
to visit his in-laws.

741
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,171
But I do not know
if he will try to apologize and reconcile.

742
00:48:37,131 --> 00:48:38,383
Young Master Park

743
00:48:39,592 --> 00:48:41,761
would have happily done so
if he had the chance.

744
00:48:48,768 --> 00:48:52,480
I suspect that this is a copy
of the fire bird in Jinyowon.

745
00:48:53,147 --> 00:48:53,981
The fire bird?

746
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:56,859
The bird that was born in a volcano?

747
00:48:56,943 --> 00:48:58,152
That is right.

748
00:48:58,236 --> 00:49:00,029
The biggest reason

749
00:49:00,113 --> 00:49:04,033
why Seo Gyeong and Jin Seol-ran built
Jinyowon was to lock up that bird.

750
00:49:04,117 --> 00:49:06,703
Why are you telling me this?

751
00:49:06,786 --> 00:49:09,664
Go there and check if that bird is safe.

752
00:49:09,747 --> 00:49:13,000
Only the members of the Jin family
can open that door.

753
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:14,836
And you are married to Jin Bu-yeon.

754
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:16,421
She was kicked out of there.

755
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,049
Do not try to involve me in their affairs.

756
00:49:28,725 --> 00:49:31,394
How would you summon another ice stone?

757
00:49:31,477 --> 00:49:34,063
I was told it was possible
by drying out this world.

758
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,155
There is no need to force them together,

759
00:49:42,864 --> 00:49:45,616
for they are already walking
the same path of fate.

760
00:49:49,328 --> 00:49:50,163
Goodness.

761
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:52,290
Uk…

762
00:49:55,668 --> 00:49:56,753
He stays

763
00:49:57,795 --> 00:50:00,131
in the very last guest room
in Jeongjingak.

764
00:50:01,007 --> 00:50:02,675
I wonder if he is there right now.

765
00:50:03,843 --> 00:50:04,969
Shall I come with you?

766
00:50:06,596 --> 00:50:09,432
No, thank you.
I have to speak with him in private.

767
00:50:28,701 --> 00:50:31,496
Just do as you practiced.

768
00:50:40,379 --> 00:50:41,214
Hold on.

769
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:42,632
Do not open this.

770
00:50:43,591 --> 00:50:44,801
Just listen.

771
00:50:44,884 --> 00:50:46,511
I have a favor to ask of you.

772
00:50:52,642 --> 00:50:54,393
My mother wants us to visit her.

773
00:50:55,394 --> 00:50:58,481
She wants you to apologize
and reconcile with her.

774
00:50:58,564 --> 00:51:01,567
You should at least do that much
if you need me by your side.

775
00:51:03,653 --> 00:51:06,364
I know I was just rejected
after trying to win your heart.

776
00:51:06,447 --> 00:51:09,116
So you should know
this really hurts my pride.

777
00:51:10,743 --> 00:51:11,869
I will count to three.

778
00:51:12,745 --> 00:51:13,955
Open the door if you agree to it.

779
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:15,331
If not, do not open it.

780
00:51:16,374 --> 00:51:17,375
And I will leave.

781
00:51:22,547 --> 00:51:23,381
One.

782
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:26,551
Two.

783
00:51:28,886 --> 00:51:29,720
Darn it.

784
00:51:41,023 --> 00:51:43,818
I could not stop you midway
because you gave me no time.

785
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:46,571
And I had to open the door

786
00:51:46,654 --> 00:51:48,072
to avoid any misunderstandings.

787
00:51:49,615 --> 00:51:51,325
I was told he would be here.

788
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:54,745
His room is
on the other end of this hallway.

789
00:51:56,372 --> 00:51:58,040
I had to muster up the courage
to say all that.

790
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:01,752
But I guess I will have to say it again.

791
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,047
I am sorry.

792
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:07,466
He is away

793
00:52:08,634 --> 00:52:10,011
at the moment.

794
00:52:10,595 --> 00:52:11,429
I see.

795
00:52:13,973 --> 00:52:16,475
So how was it? Did I sound desperate?

796
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:22,940
You did not sound desperate.

797
00:52:23,649 --> 00:52:25,359
Rather, it sounded like a threat.

798
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:26,277
Is that so?

799
00:52:29,238 --> 00:52:30,990
Then I should sound more obsequious.

800
00:52:31,073 --> 00:52:34,285
Why must you do that when you are
inviting him to your mother's house?

801
00:52:34,368 --> 00:52:35,328
You are married, after all.

802
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:40,124
We agreed to let our foolishness slide.

803
00:52:40,207 --> 00:52:41,375
So please understand.

804
00:52:41,459 --> 00:52:43,586
If you ask me to answer that,

805
00:52:45,254 --> 00:52:46,422
I would feel miserable.

806
00:53:08,569 --> 00:53:09,862
This is from Maidservant Kim.

807
00:53:09,946 --> 00:53:11,280
She said it was your favorite.

808
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:23,376
You do not even bother to thank me.

809
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,628
How miserable I feel.

810
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,507
You do not thank people, do you?

811
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:31,550
I bet you do not apologize
or ask for favors either.

812
00:53:31,634 --> 00:53:32,969
What is it this time?

813
00:53:33,052 --> 00:53:36,305
You always have an ulterior motive
when you say something unpredictable.

814
00:53:37,807 --> 00:53:38,641
Look.

815
00:53:40,101 --> 00:53:41,644
If you are free today,

816
00:53:41,727 --> 00:53:42,770
would you like

817
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:45,856
to go to Jinyowon with me?

818
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,068
Did Master Lee tell you
to go to Jinyowon with me?

819
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:50,695
What?

820
00:53:50,778 --> 00:53:52,655
I met the physician who treated you.

821
00:53:52,738 --> 00:53:53,781
He was Master Lee.

822
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:55,032
Do you know him?

823
00:53:55,116 --> 00:53:55,950
Yes.

824
00:53:56,033 --> 00:53:58,995
He told me to go to Jinyowon with you.

825
00:53:59,078 --> 00:54:00,079
He said that?

826
00:54:03,082 --> 00:54:04,500
Did my mother talk to him?

827
00:54:04,583 --> 00:54:07,586
Does your mother want me
to come to Jinyowon as well?

828
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:08,504
Yes.

829
00:54:09,797 --> 00:54:10,798
Can you do that?

830
00:54:15,011 --> 00:54:16,762
No, I do not want to get involved.

831
00:54:18,014 --> 00:54:19,015
Jang Uk.

832
00:54:20,182 --> 00:54:22,518
If I acted a bit more obsequiously,

833
00:54:24,311 --> 00:54:25,312
would you come with me?

834
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:27,982
I already said no to Master Lee.

835
00:54:29,316 --> 00:54:31,485
So there is no need for that.

836
00:54:35,531 --> 00:54:36,365
Fine.

837
00:54:37,491 --> 00:54:39,285
I was just trying to stay by your side.

838
00:54:41,287 --> 00:54:42,288
Forget it.

839
00:54:43,205 --> 00:54:44,040
I will go now.

840
00:55:09,607 --> 00:55:12,318
You should at least do that much
if you need me by your side.

841
00:55:14,445 --> 00:55:17,114
I know I was just rejected
after trying to win your heart.

842
00:55:17,698 --> 00:55:20,367
So you should know
this really hurts my pride.

843
00:55:41,097 --> 00:55:41,931
Hold on.

844
00:55:42,932 --> 00:55:45,643
Why is she upset
that I declined to go to Jinyowon?

845
00:55:45,726 --> 00:55:47,895
If anything, Master Lee should have been.

846
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:05,121
Where is Bu-yeon? Is she home?

847
00:56:05,204 --> 00:56:08,499
She just came and went to Jinyowon.

848
00:56:08,582 --> 00:56:11,335
-By herself?
-She said you declined to go with her.

849
00:56:11,418 --> 00:56:13,671
I offered to go with her,

850
00:56:13,754 --> 00:56:15,381
but she declined.

851
00:56:15,464 --> 00:56:17,091
Why would you go there?

852
00:56:17,174 --> 00:56:18,968
She must be so embarrassed and upset.

853
00:56:19,051 --> 00:56:20,719
Her mother came all the way here.

854
00:56:20,803 --> 00:56:23,848
She offered to forgive everything
and invited you two over.

855
00:56:23,931 --> 00:56:26,725
But I heard you refused immediately.

856
00:56:27,601 --> 00:56:30,104
-What?
-I sent her off with many gifts.

857
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:33,524
But she may never return.

858
00:56:33,607 --> 00:56:35,234
Lady Jin said she could do

859
00:56:35,317 --> 00:56:37,403
whatever she wanted
if she took the marriage back.

860
00:56:38,279 --> 00:56:39,447
Unbelievable.

861
00:56:45,035 --> 00:56:48,706
How dare you come here alone to see me?

862
00:56:48,789 --> 00:56:51,667
You have the wrong owner
of the eye mask that I gave to you.

863
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,377
So I am here to tell you the truth.

864
00:56:53,461 --> 00:56:55,754
But in return, please grant my wish too.

865
00:56:55,838 --> 00:56:59,717
You know I could easily kill you
for coming here.

866
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,010
But you have a request?

867
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:05,639
-Let me hear it.
-Before Master Jin U-tak brought me here,

868
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:07,892
he had put a blood parasite in my body.

869
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:09,894
A blood parasite?

870
00:57:09,977 --> 00:57:13,981
So that was how you had
our family's energy.

871
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:16,066
It has settled in the core of my energy.

872
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:18,861
Please tell me how to get it out.

873
00:57:18,944 --> 00:57:21,655
How is that possible
when you do not know any spells?

874
00:57:22,448 --> 00:57:23,657
But if that is the case,

875
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:26,160
there is no way to take it out.

876
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:28,579
I beg that you actively find a way.

877
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:31,624
As the leader of Jinyowon,
you could do anything.

878
00:57:31,707 --> 00:57:32,666
And in return,

879
00:57:33,501 --> 00:57:35,377
I will reveal the identity

880
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,546
of the real Jin Bu-yeon.

881
00:57:39,507 --> 00:57:40,382
That is not needed.

882
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:42,551
I have already found my daughter.

883
00:57:42,635 --> 00:57:43,469
That is not true.

884
00:57:44,553 --> 00:57:46,555
The eye mask clearly
belongs to someone else.

885
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:47,932
I do not want to hear it.

886
00:57:49,934 --> 00:57:51,060
Lady Jin.

887
00:57:51,143 --> 00:57:52,436
Young Lady Bu-yeon is here.

888
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,021
-Right now?
-That is great.

889
00:57:54,647 --> 00:57:56,690
I will prove that she is not the one.

890
00:58:00,444 --> 00:58:02,488
Keep her in the annex.

891
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:04,448
Yes, my lady.

892
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:16,752
These gifts are from the Jang family.

893
00:58:30,391 --> 00:58:31,559
So she came alone.

894
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,651
I am here, Mother.

895
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:43,779
I am here as well.

896
00:58:59,295 --> 00:59:01,088
Thank you so much for inviting us over.

897
00:59:02,047 --> 00:59:04,008
I apologize for my previous acts

898
00:59:04,592 --> 00:59:05,718
of impertinence.

899
00:59:05,801 --> 00:59:07,803
I hope we get along.

900
00:59:16,228 --> 00:59:17,146
Mother.

901
00:59:17,229 --> 00:59:18,522
We are here together.

902
00:59:23,777 --> 00:59:25,904
My grandfather told me
I would find Master Lee here

903
00:59:25,988 --> 00:59:27,781
and bring him to Sejukwon.

904
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:29,700
Is he back?

905
00:59:30,576 --> 00:59:32,077
He never came by.

906
00:59:32,161 --> 00:59:34,580
I heard he went to see Young Master Jang.

907
00:59:34,663 --> 00:59:35,497
Well,

908
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,752
our young master and Young Lady Bu-yeon

909
00:59:39,835 --> 00:59:41,545
are visiting her mother right now.

910
00:59:42,129 --> 00:59:42,963
I see.

911
00:59:43,589 --> 00:59:44,423
Is that so?

912
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,843
I will take good care of Master Lee
if he ever comes here.

913
00:59:47,926 --> 00:59:50,179
No, my lady.
We were told to escort Master Lee

914
00:59:50,262 --> 00:59:52,097
to save Lord Park Jin.

915
00:59:52,181 --> 00:59:53,932
Is he ill?

916
00:59:54,933 --> 00:59:55,768
It is critical.

917
00:59:55,851 --> 00:59:58,103
The spicy beef soup
he made absent-mindedly is tasty.

918
00:59:59,355 --> 01:00:00,939
His spicy beef soup is tasty?

919
01:00:10,658 --> 01:00:11,492
This is

920
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:13,619
tasty.

921
01:00:20,709 --> 01:00:21,627
My lord.

922
01:00:22,378 --> 01:00:23,712
Are you all right?

923
01:00:25,506 --> 01:00:27,758
I feel knots in my stomach.

924
01:00:28,509 --> 01:00:31,762
I think I have indigestion.

925
01:00:31,845 --> 01:00:33,806
You should go to Sejukwon.

926
01:00:33,889 --> 01:00:35,265
It is not that bad.

927
01:00:36,308 --> 01:00:37,643
But, Maidservant Kim,

928
01:00:38,477 --> 01:00:40,854
should you not be tending

929
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,440
to Master Lee?

930
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:47,444
Please.

931
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:51,740
How could I tend to him
when you are feeling ill?

932
01:00:51,824 --> 01:00:54,368
I am sure he will be fine without me.

933
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:55,285
Is that so?

934
01:00:55,369 --> 01:00:57,830
Where else does it hurt?

935
01:00:58,414 --> 01:01:00,666
My head is pounding as well.

936
01:01:00,749 --> 01:01:02,376
-Is that so?
-Yes.

937
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:03,335
Let me see.

938
01:01:03,419 --> 01:01:05,421
Goodness, I think you are running a fever.

939
01:01:05,504 --> 01:01:08,006
-Right.
-Shall I bring you a cold, wet towel?

940
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:12,678
You must be busy.

941
01:01:13,846 --> 01:01:16,223
Are you sure you can stay here?

942
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:18,475
How could I leave when you are sick?

943
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:19,810
I will stay right here.

944
01:01:21,228 --> 01:01:22,354
Thank you.

945
01:01:23,522 --> 01:01:25,023
-Gosh, my stomach.
-Goodness.

946
01:01:25,107 --> 01:01:27,359
-Does your stomach hurt?
-Gosh.

947
01:01:27,443 --> 01:01:28,485
Goodness.

948
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:33,574
Do not do anything foolish.

949
01:01:37,453 --> 01:01:40,414
I brought in this ruffian
who was causing a scene at the entrance

950
01:01:40,497 --> 01:01:42,458
and demanding to speak with you.

951
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:43,417
What is it?

952
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,294
Please save our madam.

953
01:01:45,919 --> 01:01:48,088
She is going to die because of you.

954
01:01:55,262 --> 01:01:58,515
So-i went to see Lady Jin at Jinyowon?

955
01:01:59,433 --> 01:02:01,769
She left this afternoon
and still has not returned.

956
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:02,686
Gosh.

957
01:02:03,395 --> 01:02:06,440
She told me to relay this message to you

958
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:08,358
if she was in danger.

959
01:02:09,026 --> 01:02:10,778
"Lady Jin's real daughter…

960
01:02:10,861 --> 01:02:13,614
was the blind girl from Sari Village."

961
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:15,365
Tell him that.

962
01:02:17,284 --> 01:02:19,161
If I die in Jinyowon,

963
01:02:19,828 --> 01:02:22,414
tell him to blackmail her
with my body and that secret.

964
01:02:22,498 --> 01:02:24,416
Tell him that he must find a way to live…

965
01:02:27,002 --> 01:02:28,462
at all costs.

966
01:02:34,843 --> 01:02:36,470
The blind girl from Sari Village.

967
01:02:38,096 --> 01:02:39,431
Is that really what she said?

968
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,311
Mu-deok…

969
01:02:44,394 --> 01:02:45,771
was Jin Ho-gyeong's daughter?

970
01:02:47,064 --> 01:02:49,525
I do not know who she is…

971
01:02:51,485 --> 01:02:53,403
but please save our madam.

972
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:57,866
How long has it been
since she entered Jinyowon?

973
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:29,147
The Queen told me to trust
and use you if necessary.

974
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:32,818
So I would like to entrust you
with something important.

975
01:03:32,901 --> 01:03:35,362
I will do my best, whatever it may be.

976
01:03:44,872 --> 01:03:48,250
These earthenwares are made
with soil from the southern volcano

977
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:50,502
and are in the shape
of the bird that was born there.

978
01:03:50,586 --> 01:03:52,379
The bird born from a volcano?

979
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:53,964
Do you mean the fire bird?

980
01:03:58,927 --> 01:04:02,598
A boat carrying dozens of these
earthenware boxes must enter the capital.

981
01:04:02,681 --> 01:04:05,642
But it is not easy to bring them
without Songrim noticing.

982
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:10,606
Use your family connections
to bring them in safe and sound.

983
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:14,234
That will be a cakewalk.

984
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:15,360
You can count on me.

985
01:04:20,824 --> 01:04:22,159
Uncle, are you asleep?

986
01:04:22,242 --> 01:04:23,869
I came to make an urgent report.

987
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:27,581
Uncle.

988
01:04:28,248 --> 01:04:30,334
My lord, please come out.

989
01:04:32,502 --> 01:04:33,337
My lord.

990
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:35,505
My lord!

991
01:04:37,591 --> 01:04:39,593
-What is it?
-Someone is outside.

992
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:40,510
What?

993
01:04:40,594 --> 01:04:41,470
Gosh.

994
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:44,348
Goodness.

995
01:04:52,481 --> 01:04:53,482
There is quite a lot.

996
01:04:54,066 --> 01:04:55,192
What could it be about?

997
01:04:56,193 --> 01:04:57,027
Wait.

998
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,238
What about me?

999
01:05:00,322 --> 01:05:02,783
What would they think if they saw me here

1000
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:04,660
in the middle of the night?

1001
01:05:06,203 --> 01:05:10,123
What do I do?

1002
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:12,584
What do I do?

1003
01:05:16,046 --> 01:05:17,255
I am coming in.

1004
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:19,549
What? What is it?

1005
01:05:21,301 --> 01:05:22,302
Why not?

1006
01:05:28,266 --> 01:05:30,978
My lord, we will go back for today.

1007
01:05:33,522 --> 01:05:34,356
Go.

1008
01:05:37,401 --> 01:05:39,111
What do I do?

1009
01:05:40,904 --> 01:05:42,239
They must have caught on.

1010
01:05:42,322 --> 01:05:44,700
Perhaps we should have just greeted them.

1011
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:47,577
I am so embarrassed. What should I do?

1012
01:05:49,454 --> 01:05:51,373
Is this funny to you?

1013
01:05:51,957 --> 01:05:53,041
It is just that you are pretty.

1014
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:57,004
Your shyness reminds me
of an adolescent girl.

1015
01:06:00,257 --> 01:06:02,300
Thanks to you,

1016
01:06:02,384 --> 01:06:07,431
I also feel like an adolescent boy
who was caught dating.

1017
01:06:09,808 --> 01:06:11,560
They say being together
makes you feel younger.

1018
01:06:12,853 --> 01:06:13,770
That is nice to hear.

1019
01:06:15,522 --> 01:06:16,356
Let us

1020
01:06:18,066 --> 01:06:20,527
stay together forever.

1021
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:37,919
I, Park Jin of Songrim,

1022
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:40,881
ask you, Kim Yeon of Wol Fortress,

1023
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:46,261
to be my lawfully wedded wife.

1024
01:06:51,725 --> 01:06:52,559
I,

1025
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:55,270
Kim Yeon of Wol Fortress,

1026
01:06:57,314 --> 01:06:58,940
accept the proposal

1027
01:07:00,525 --> 01:07:01,902
of Park Jin of Songrim.

1028
01:07:06,948 --> 01:07:09,117
My lord! Congratulations!

1029
01:07:09,201 --> 01:07:10,869
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

1030
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:13,413
I guess they did not leave.

1031
01:07:13,497 --> 01:07:15,540
I guess you did not leave yet.

1032
01:07:15,624 --> 01:07:19,044
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

1033
01:07:19,544 --> 01:07:21,129
The day has finally come!

1034
01:07:21,213 --> 01:07:23,507
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

1035
01:07:49,866 --> 01:07:52,035
Thank you for welcoming us with open arms

1036
01:07:52,119 --> 01:07:53,703
despite not being happy with us.

1037
01:07:53,787 --> 01:07:55,872
Do not mention it.
I invited you after all.

1038
01:07:57,082 --> 01:07:58,333
-All right, then.
-Then…

1039
01:07:59,626 --> 01:08:01,211
please show us to our room.

1040
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:06,633
You want to spend the night here?

1041
01:08:07,342 --> 01:08:09,636
This is our first time visiting
after our marriage,

1042
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:11,346
so we must fulfill our duties.

1043
01:08:11,429 --> 01:08:14,224
Maidservant Kim will give me an earful
if we just leave.

1044
01:08:14,808 --> 01:08:15,851
That is true.

1045
01:08:15,934 --> 01:08:18,228
It is only right for you
to spend the night.

1046
01:08:20,397 --> 01:08:23,567
But I have not prepared a room
for you to stay in.

1047
01:08:23,650 --> 01:08:26,111
We are just fulfilling our duties,
so it does not matter.

1048
01:08:26,194 --> 01:08:29,447
We will even be happy to stay
in her dreary former room.

1049
01:08:29,531 --> 01:08:30,824
So we will spend the night there.

1050
01:08:31,658 --> 01:08:33,326
No. How could I do that to you?

1051
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:36,288
I will quickly prepare a room.

1052
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:38,373
Will you do that?

1053
01:08:38,456 --> 01:08:40,667
But then again,
I am sure you can find a room

1054
01:08:41,626 --> 01:08:42,919
in this spacious abode.

1055
01:09:08,904 --> 01:09:10,864
I am grateful that you came.

1056
01:09:12,991 --> 01:09:14,743
But we do not need to spend the night.

1057
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:17,287
Yes, we do.

1058
01:09:17,996 --> 01:09:19,581
That is why I came.

1059
01:09:20,999 --> 01:09:22,709
You truly want
to spend the night together?

1060
01:09:24,169 --> 01:09:26,171
I only said I wanted
to spend the night here.

1061
01:09:26,922 --> 01:09:28,506
How could you interpret it like that?

1062
01:09:29,716 --> 01:09:30,592
How could I not?

1063
01:09:30,675 --> 01:09:32,177
You said we had our duties.

1064
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:34,971
We have alcohol and a newlyweds' bed.

1065
01:09:35,055 --> 01:09:38,058
Of course I would think that
you wanted to spend the night with me.

1066
01:09:38,141 --> 01:09:40,060
Sorry to disappoint you,

1067
01:09:40,143 --> 01:09:41,937
but I have something to do here.

1068
01:09:42,646 --> 01:09:44,231
Master Lee asked me for a favor.

1069
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:49,027
About coming here with me?

1070
01:09:50,362 --> 01:09:51,196
Yes.

1071
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:53,740
Earlier today, we had a misunderstanding.

1072
01:09:54,366 --> 01:09:56,159
Yet I did everything you asked for.

1073
01:09:56,243 --> 01:09:59,371
Now, we must do what I need to do.

1074
01:10:00,038 --> 01:10:00,872
And what is that?

1075
01:10:02,749 --> 01:10:04,000
When it gets darker,

1076
01:10:04,084 --> 01:10:06,002
I need you to open Jinyowon for me.

1077
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:09,798
What is it that you seek from Jinyowon?

1078
01:10:09,881 --> 01:10:11,967
If it is an artifact for the lake's rite,

1079
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:14,427
you could formally request it
from Lady Jin.

1080
01:10:14,511 --> 01:10:15,804
What I seek

1081
01:10:16,888 --> 01:10:18,932
is something even she cannot take out.

1082
01:10:19,599 --> 01:10:22,519
Jinyowon will crumble
if it is taken from there.

1083
01:10:22,602 --> 01:10:24,145
Are you perhaps

1084
01:10:25,939 --> 01:10:27,023
after the fire bird?

1085
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:29,985
Correct.

1086
01:10:31,361 --> 01:10:34,155
And I can only get it
if I take over Jinyowon.

1087
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,866
That rite that Cheonbugwan
had been preparing for

1088
01:10:37,909 --> 01:10:40,161
was not to call for rain.

1089
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:44,457
Are you after the ice stone again?

1090
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,504
Did we not agree
to obtain great powers together?

1091
01:10:49,587 --> 01:10:51,923
-That agreement ended three years ago.
-You are wrong.

1092
01:10:52,007 --> 01:10:56,011
You could have killed me
and ended everything, yet I was spared.

1093
01:10:56,094 --> 01:10:57,304
That meant

1094
01:10:58,888 --> 01:11:02,809
that you continued to support me,
thus our agreement never ended.

1095
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:03,852
In that case…

1096
01:11:07,397 --> 01:11:08,398
let me end it now.

1097
01:11:11,818 --> 01:11:12,986
You should stop as well, Gwanju.

1098
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:14,946
If you wish to stop me,

1099
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:17,866
you should go to Jang Uk
and reveal everything to him.

1100
01:11:17,949 --> 01:11:21,870
"I used and killed Naksu
so I could beat you."

1101
01:11:21,953 --> 01:11:25,332
And I, Jin Mu, did that solely for you,
Your Royal Highness.

1102
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:31,129
If you cannot tell him the truth,

1103
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:34,174
you cannot end this.

1104
01:11:56,613 --> 01:11:58,323
I had no idea

1105
01:11:59,741 --> 01:12:01,993
that you had saved
and kept your real daughter

1106
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,748
by your side all this time.

1107
01:12:07,457 --> 01:12:10,585
Who else knows about my daughter?

1108
01:12:12,796 --> 01:12:13,838
Answer me.

1109
01:12:15,673 --> 01:12:16,925
Jin Mu?

1110
01:12:17,717 --> 01:12:18,676
People of Songrim?

1111
01:12:24,224 --> 01:12:27,143
If you are curious,
you should go ask them yourself.

1112
01:12:27,227 --> 01:12:32,607
Ask them if they know that your daughter,
the one saved from Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,

1113
01:12:34,692 --> 01:12:36,152
is actually Naksu.

1114
01:12:37,612 --> 01:12:38,446
Ask them yourself.

1115
01:12:51,793 --> 01:12:52,627
Hey.

1116
01:12:53,253 --> 01:12:54,921
You can open Jinyowon's door, right?

1117
01:12:55,004 --> 01:12:56,297
Of course.

1118
01:12:57,048 --> 01:13:00,218
That was the first thing
my mother asked me to do when I woke up.

1119
01:13:01,511 --> 01:13:02,345
By the way,

1120
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:04,556
what will you do there?

1121
01:13:05,974 --> 01:13:08,601
I just need to check if the object
Master Lee mentioned is still there.

1122
01:13:09,185 --> 01:13:11,604
I am not dragging you into theft,
so do not worry.

1123
01:13:30,832 --> 01:13:32,167
There were people walking by.

1124
01:13:33,334 --> 01:13:35,670
I am not trying to do anything to you.
Do not worry.

1125
01:13:35,753 --> 01:13:37,505
We are guests here.

1126
01:13:37,589 --> 01:13:39,841
We can tell them
that we were taking a walk.

1127
01:13:39,924 --> 01:13:40,758
I see.

1128
01:13:41,885 --> 01:13:42,719
You are right.

1129
01:13:45,388 --> 01:13:47,390
It has become a habit for me to hide.

1130
01:13:49,767 --> 01:13:52,896
Were you not allowed to even walk
around this garden in the past?

1131
01:13:53,813 --> 01:13:54,647
No.

1132
01:13:56,399 --> 01:13:57,859
I felt so suffocated

1133
01:13:58,735 --> 01:14:00,153
when I was locked up.

1134
01:14:01,362 --> 01:14:04,782
So I imagined myself sitting alone
on top of a tall tree.

1135
01:14:05,783 --> 01:14:07,076
I knew no one

1136
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,579
and I was powerless and alone.

1137
01:14:11,831 --> 01:14:13,625
I had hoped
someone would come to rescue me.

1138
01:14:16,169 --> 01:14:17,253
And then you came.

1139
01:14:21,007 --> 01:14:21,841
What…

1140
01:14:23,968 --> 01:14:25,220
was that about?

1141
01:14:27,847 --> 01:14:29,849
That was my story.

1142
01:14:31,893 --> 01:14:34,604
It was a thought that I had
during my time in that room.

1143
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:37,815
I do not have
that stone with me right now.

1144
01:15:15,895 --> 01:15:16,896
I must be going crazy…

1145
01:15:19,732 --> 01:15:20,942
because of you.

1146
01:16:13,703 --> 01:16:16,623
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

1147
01:16:17,123 --> 01:16:19,042
Someone just entered.

1148
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:21,044
So-i, do you recognize me?

1149
01:16:21,127 --> 01:16:23,963
Has your husband still not come home
because of that peacock?

1150
01:16:24,047 --> 01:16:26,257
Sleeping separately?
That means it is over.

1151
01:16:26,341 --> 01:16:28,760
No, I am also going to stay here.

1152
01:16:29,636 --> 01:16:31,346
I plan to find my own room.

1153
01:16:31,429 --> 01:16:34,474
I hope that makes it easier
for you to find me.

1154
01:16:35,058 --> 01:16:38,186
All my pain and regrets derive from this.

1155
01:16:40,271 --> 01:16:43,858
The blood parasite given to So-i
is now inside Seo Yul.

1156
