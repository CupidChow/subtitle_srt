1
00:00:02,245 --> 00:00:04,664
What an insane thing to do!

2
00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:08,043
Is killing and bringing one
back to life entertaining to watch?

3
00:00:08,126 --> 00:00:10,003
We cannot even intervene

4
00:00:10,086 --> 00:00:12,797
because Mu-deok foolishly agreed to it.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,300
That girl…

6
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:19,053
smiled.

7
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:21,681
Yes. I will try it.

8
00:00:26,603 --> 00:00:28,396
She only said yes

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,316
because of the gold she would be getting.

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,110
Could gold really be the reason…

11
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:38,615
why she smiled?

12
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,962
I am not happy
about this situation either.

13
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:56,299
I will make sure you die a painless death.

14
00:00:56,382 --> 00:00:58,802
This is not to see me die.

15
00:00:59,886 --> 00:01:02,055
It is to see me come back to life.

16
00:01:04,307 --> 00:01:08,645
They will try to buy time with that book
and look for a way to expose you.

17
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:11,731
When she dies
and the ice stone's power is summoned,

18
00:01:11,815 --> 00:01:15,443
use the ice stone's power
to shift your soul into that girl's body.

19
00:01:15,527 --> 00:01:19,197
The Unanimous Assembly will come
to an end once the Queen dies.

20
00:01:20,115 --> 00:01:24,035
We will safely leave Songrim
with the ice stone.

21
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:30,375
I wonder why His Majesty
chose her of all people.

22
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,253
She is the weakest one among us.

23
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:34,963
He picked the right person.

24
00:02:43,114 --> 00:02:44,324
You look beautiful.

25
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:47,368
My Bu-yeon.

26
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,337
Mother.

27
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:29,869
No one is looking at you right now.

28
00:03:29,953 --> 00:03:31,704
Use that power to shift souls.

29
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:34,082
It is not me.

30
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:37,001
I am not the one controlling
the ice stone.

31
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:38,753
Then who?

32
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:26,634
You need to stop that.

33
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:40,815
Mother, are you all right?

34
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:46,112
Bu-yeon.

35
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:52,702
Did she recognize her? This is not good.

36
00:04:53,286 --> 00:04:55,204
They are going to bring her back to life.

37
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:57,123
That cannot happen.

38
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:58,541
She needs to die.

39
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:45,338
What is going on?

40
00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:47,590
Where is the ice stone?

41
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:52,595
What just happened?

42
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:06,567
Did you see that?

43
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:09,821
The power of the ice stone
and the power of the sky came together.

44
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:12,990
The heavens must have taken the ice stone
and made it disappear.

45
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:15,618
It did not disappear.

46
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:21,457
It is

47
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,501
still here.

48
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:27,505
Where exactly is it?

49
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,243
Lightning, thunder, and now fog
in broad daylight?

50
00:06:57,326 --> 00:06:58,953
That is not all.

51
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:00,413
Something has gone awry.

52
00:07:07,712 --> 00:07:10,339
-The cloth covering the ice stone, right?
-Yes.

53
00:07:10,423 --> 00:07:11,591
Could something have happened to it?

54
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,469
Is this a dream or something?

55
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:17,638
-There are flowers everywhere.
-This feels surreal.

56
00:07:18,347 --> 00:07:20,349
Are we dead?

57
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:23,436
-Are we in utopia?
-Hey.

58
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,146
Do not speak nonsense.

59
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:28,065
Then would that make me the Jade Emperor,
and him a fairy?

60
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:31,360
A fairy.

61
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:42,622
What is that?

62
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:44,957
I do not think it is a fairy.

63
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,001
Then is it a ghost?

64
00:07:56,135 --> 00:07:58,679
Are you mages?

65
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:01,641
Yes, we are from Jeongjingak.

66
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:07,021
You were here too, Young Lady Heo.

67
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:12,568
Please let go of me.

68
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,783
Jang Uk, remain here and stand guard.

69
00:08:19,492 --> 00:08:20,826
You three.

70
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:22,620
Patrol the area.

71
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:26,374
-I will head to the Training Center.
-Your Royal Highness, we will escort you.

72
00:08:29,126 --> 00:08:30,878
What is going on?

73
00:08:30,962 --> 00:08:32,213
I heard deafening thunder.

74
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:34,423
We do not know yet either.

75
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:38,219
We will find out soon once this fog lifts.

76
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,638
If we are not in utopia or the afterlife,

77
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:43,099
where did all these flowers come from?

78
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:45,768
Is this even a real fog?

79
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:23,180
What are you doing?

80
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:24,181
We do not know what happened.

81
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:27,727
The moment we reached the gate,
a strong gust of wind hit us.

82
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,936
Wind?

83
00:09:30,313 --> 00:09:31,564
There is no wind.

84
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:37,486
Do not go there. We cannot see it,

85
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,447
but there is great energy blocking us.

86
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,782
What in the world is going on?

87
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:42,825
It is a barrier.

88
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:46,954
I believe there is a barrier
around Jeongjingak.

89
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,040
A barrier?

90
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:50,625
Who would place a barrier here?

91
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,876
Your Royal Highness.

92
00:09:54,086 --> 00:09:55,338
Your Royal Highness.

93
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:57,715
A priestess from Jinyowon
is inside Jeongjingak.

94
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:00,801
Jin Bu-yeon,
who had brought the ice stone,

95
00:10:00,885 --> 00:10:02,553
was found collapsed in the building.

96
00:10:13,898 --> 00:10:14,774
Mu-deok.

97
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:34,794
The ice stone's energy entered Jeongjingak

98
00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:36,879
and created a barrier.

99
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,758
Who is inside Jeongjingak?

100
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:43,594
Jang Uk and Seo Yul
are nowhere to be seen.

101
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:44,970
They must be in there.

102
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,515
Young Lady Heo is inside as well.

103
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:50,101
-My dear Yun-ok!
-The Crown Prince.

104
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:51,727
He is in there!

105
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:55,940
-What?
-Was Beom in there as well?

106
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:58,150
Where is Jin-ho?

107
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,111
Lady Jin.

108
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:01,404
Do something.

109
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:04,698
The ice stone swallowed up your daughter,
so she must be in there too.

110
00:11:05,324 --> 00:11:07,326
We cannot be rash.

111
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,788
We all witnessed what happened
after Bu-yeon provoked it.

112
00:11:12,081 --> 00:11:14,834
This is all Jinyowon's fault.

113
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:18,838
You wanted to see
how powerful the ice stone was.

114
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:20,714
Why are you placing the blame on us?

115
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:24,301
Are you trying to pick a fight again?

116
00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:27,054
That is enough. The kids are in there!

117
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:28,722
Yun-ok!

118
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:48,159
Do you have anything to do

119
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:50,995
with the barrier around Jeongjingak?

120
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,872
What happened back at the Training Center?

121
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:55,207
You see…

122
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:07,303
It definitely all happened
because of Mu-deok.

123
00:12:07,386 --> 00:12:10,764
After all, she is the real Jin Bu-yeon,
the priestess of Jinyowon.

124
00:12:11,348 --> 00:12:13,267
But everyone thinks I am her.

125
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,603
I cannot say that it was because of her.

126
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:16,562
What do I do?

127
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:18,856
Answer me.

128
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,191
I…

129
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:22,985
do not know.

130
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:26,322
I am blind,
so I could not see what had happened.

131
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:29,158
I fainted when the wind struck
and just woke up.

132
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:31,160
You do not know how you came here?

133
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:33,704
I do not even know where I am,

134
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,582
so how am I to know how I came here?

135
00:12:41,003 --> 00:12:43,214
She does not look too well.

136
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:46,926
The color has drained from her face
and she is sweating.

137
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:48,594
What do you think?

138
00:12:50,387 --> 00:12:53,224
I think you should let her rest first,
Your Royal Highness.

139
00:12:56,685 --> 00:12:57,686
Let her rest.

140
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:00,022
Come.

141
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:06,946
She must be lying.

142
00:13:08,405 --> 00:13:09,698
What is she hiding?

143
00:13:09,782 --> 00:13:11,158
Mu-deok would know.

144
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:13,577
Mu-deok, you were with her, right?

145
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:17,873
How did you end up here?

146
00:13:19,124 --> 00:13:21,794
I was here all along.

147
00:13:24,922 --> 00:13:26,006
You were here?

148
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:29,510
Were you not pouring tea
at the Training Center?

149
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:33,889
I was, but then
I followed you here immediately.

150
00:13:33,973 --> 00:13:36,976
I do not know what happened back there.

151
00:13:37,935 --> 00:13:40,854
What is the point in asking a maid

152
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:45,234
who knows nothing
but to follow her master like a puppy?

153
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:46,860
Do not worry, Your Royal Highness.

154
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:49,822
The best mages have gathered
for the Unanimous Assembly.

155
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:52,283
This barrier will be broken in no time.

156
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,286
Bring some tea for the Crown Prince.

157
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:56,453
Yes, of course.

158
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:12,344
A puppy who only follows her master.

159
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:14,388
A maid who knows nothing.

160
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:17,641
That is Mu-deok.

161
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:25,316
Look at that.

162
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,109
There is no water to boil.

163
00:15:26,794 --> 00:15:29,755
Spell-brewed tea tastes the best.

164
00:15:31,507 --> 00:15:32,800
It has been a while.

165
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:39,974
I have finally regained my power
thanks to the ice stone.

166
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:51,819
What is going on? Where am I?

167
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,864
We did not lose it this time.

168
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,701
We are inside the ice stone.

169
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,204
This is the ice stone?

170
00:16:02,788 --> 00:16:05,958
The ice stone is not limited
in shape, size, or form.

171
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,794
It can be water, fire,

172
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:10,546
or wind.

173
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:17,011
Does this mean I have the ice stone now?

174
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:26,603
No one can truly own the ice stone.

175
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,065
You only use its power.

176
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:32,776
Pull and get pushed.

177
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,903
Earn one, and lose the other.

178
00:16:34,987 --> 00:16:37,948
That is the burden you will have to carry.

179
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:40,534
I can gladly endure that.

180
00:16:40,617 --> 00:16:42,202
Then try it.

181
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:44,329
Overflowing power means

182
00:16:44,955 --> 00:16:47,666
you will not be able to control
how much of it you use.

183
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:51,003
Desire rain, and you will get a flood.

184
00:16:51,837 --> 00:16:54,548
Desire wind, and you will get a typhoon.

185
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:56,592
Try to endure it.

186
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:58,302
What are you?

187
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:00,512
A relic of Jinyowon?

188
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,849
How dare a soul living off my body

189
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,226
call me a relic?

190
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:36,173
Jeongjingak?

191
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:43,889
What was that?

192
00:17:45,057 --> 00:17:48,268
A relic from Jinyowon
that had attached itself to the ice stone?

193
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:56,819
Mu-deok, what is this?

194
00:17:56,902 --> 00:17:59,571
The Crown Prince's teacup is chipped.

195
00:17:59,655 --> 00:18:01,365
I am sorry.

196
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:02,533
Let me get a new one.

197
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:06,411
No. I do not need
to be servile any longer.

198
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:07,955
-Mu-deok.
-Yes, young master.

199
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:10,958
The table is dirty. Wipe it clean.

200
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,168
I do not hesitate to be subservient.

201
00:18:13,752 --> 00:18:15,337
Have I become Mu-deok to the bone?

202
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:22,761
I am no longer Mu-deok.

203
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:23,762
Mu-deok.

204
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:31,937
We have not eaten anything all day
due to the Unanimous Assembly.

205
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,438
Do you have any food?

206
00:18:34,106 --> 00:18:36,733
The sujebi we have
as a late-night snack is tasty.

207
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:37,734
Can you make some?

208
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,952
I will only be Mu-deok
until I make this dish.

209
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:51,290
After this, I will no longer be her.

210
00:18:52,374 --> 00:18:54,710
Once I can shift souls,

211
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:57,171
I can choose any body I want.

212
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:00,966
I could even be the King.

213
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,184
Or should I kill my enemy

214
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:12,603
and take over his body?

215
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:22,988
How distasteful.

216
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:26,450
I would rather choose Park Jin.

217
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,378
I can pick any body I want.

218
00:19:38,962 --> 00:19:40,505
Let me think this through.

219
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:43,717
This is perfect.

220
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,094
It would be a waste
to make sujebi with this.

221
00:19:46,178 --> 00:19:47,763
Should I make noodles instead?

222
00:19:47,846 --> 00:19:49,806
Uk prefers noodles.

223
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,648
I do get a very faint taste of it.

224
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:08,325
This will be the last meal
Mu-deok makes for her young master.

225
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:19,878
-Young Master.
-Yes?

226
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:24,049
I made some noodles. Go and have some.

227
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:25,342
Sure.

228
00:20:29,054 --> 00:20:32,432
As your maid, I shall leave you now.

229
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:35,519
And…

230
00:20:37,396 --> 00:20:39,564
this will be the end, my pupil.

231
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:42,317
The end?

232
00:20:44,027 --> 00:20:46,071
You probably did not realize it.

233
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:48,448
But we are inside the ice stone.

234
00:20:49,157 --> 00:20:51,326
I regained my power like I did
back at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

235
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:55,789
I will use this ice stone to shift souls

236
00:20:56,748 --> 00:20:58,375
and leave this body.

237
00:21:00,377 --> 00:21:01,670
Are you saying

238
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:04,381
you will not ever see me again?

239
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,341
We agreed that it would be the end

240
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:08,885
once I regained my power.

241
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:11,847
But we agreed
to talk about our future as well.

242
00:21:18,854 --> 00:21:20,355
There is…

243
00:21:22,524 --> 00:21:23,775
no other future for us.

244
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:34,870
Earn one, and lose the other.

245
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:37,831
That is the burden you will have to carry.

246
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,418
If I need to lose you to regain my power,

247
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:44,421
I will bear it.

248
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,602
-Young Master.
-Yes?

249
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,771
I made some noodles. Go and have some.

250
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:03,065
-And--
-Mu-deok.

251
00:22:03,148 --> 00:22:05,233
I think the barrier around Jeongjingak

252
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:07,194
is actually the ice stone.

253
00:22:07,778 --> 00:22:08,612
What?

254
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:11,698
That is not something
he should have realized.

255
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,494
They said the ice stone
was water, fire, and wind.

256
00:22:16,036 --> 00:22:18,038
I think we are trapped
within a force created by wind.

257
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:21,374
If we are indeed inside the ice stone,

258
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:25,253
could there be a way to take the ice stone
without anyone knowing?

259
00:22:27,964 --> 00:22:29,174
I am not sure.

260
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:30,884
After all, I have reached Chisu.

261
00:22:31,635 --> 00:22:33,470
Could I snatch it
like I did with the Golden Fish?

262
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:36,014
Your current power cannot hold a candle

263
00:22:36,598 --> 00:22:37,808
to the ice stone.

264
00:22:40,102 --> 00:22:43,396
I wish you had regained your power
like you did at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

265
00:22:46,191 --> 00:22:47,567
You would be able to do it.

266
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:52,447
What if I regained my power

267
00:22:53,115 --> 00:22:55,283
and took the ice stone with me?

268
00:22:57,244 --> 00:22:59,996
If caught, you may even be killed for it.

269
00:23:01,206 --> 00:23:02,415
Are you not afraid?

270
00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:05,210
The fact that you could run away with it

271
00:23:05,293 --> 00:23:07,212
is always a possibility.

272
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:12,050
And I already told you
that I was going to take responsibility.

273
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:18,181
However,

274
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:20,559
I am still a bit afraid.

275
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:26,398
I am scared that you may break our promise
and abandon me without even looking back.

276
00:23:28,483 --> 00:23:29,442
Master.

277
00:23:29,526 --> 00:23:33,238
Please do not abandon me.
If you do, I will cry a river.

278
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:39,661
You say such embarrassing things
so openly.

279
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:42,998
You will regret it when you look back.

280
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:48,253
I can always say such things
if I endure the embarrassment.

281
00:23:48,336 --> 00:23:51,923
But I can never turn back time
even if I regret something.

282
00:23:53,592 --> 00:23:56,303
Master, endure the embarrassment

283
00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:57,888
and be honest with yourself.

284
00:23:57,971 --> 00:24:00,891
That way, you will not regret anything.

285
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,024
-Jang Uk, I--
-Young Master Jang.

286
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:13,737
I will be right there.

287
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,573
She has the key
to the room of forbidden books.

288
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:19,326
Since we are here,
I want to look up some things.

289
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:21,453
Right, here.

290
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:28,877
Have it all. Do not let others find out.

291
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:58,281
Are you looking
for forbidden books regarding sorcery?

292
00:24:58,365 --> 00:25:00,492
Yes, I heard that my father stored

293
00:25:00,575 --> 00:25:04,037
all the sorcery books that he had gotten
from a shaman here.

294
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,332
I want to look for them.

295
00:25:10,418 --> 00:25:12,420
So they were Lord Jang Gang's.

296
00:25:13,505 --> 00:25:14,965
I will help you.

297
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:18,510
I can do it alone.
You can leave the key with me and go.

298
00:25:19,928 --> 00:25:22,389
My grandfather entrusted me with it.

299
00:25:22,472 --> 00:25:24,432
How can I trust
that you will keep it safe?

300
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:28,520
You are right. I am not that trustworthy.
You can keep an eye on me.

301
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:48,415
Attention, everyone.

302
00:25:49,124 --> 00:25:53,753
We have enough spare rooms
and food at Jeongjingak.

303
00:25:53,837 --> 00:25:57,257
So do not worry too much.

304
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,425
Let us remain calm.

305
00:25:58,508 --> 00:25:59,634
All right?

306
00:26:08,643 --> 00:26:11,604
Go to Gisan and summon everyone there.

307
00:26:11,688 --> 00:26:14,441
We deserve some power
from the ice stone as well.

308
00:26:14,524 --> 00:26:15,608
Yes, master.

309
00:26:18,737 --> 00:26:20,947
Summon everyone who can cast spells.

310
00:26:21,031 --> 00:26:22,907
Even children and the elderly.

311
00:26:22,991 --> 00:26:24,242
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

312
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:35,295
Summon all the mages in Cheonbugwan
to Songrim.

313
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:37,922
A fight could break out
over the ice stone.

314
00:26:38,423 --> 00:26:39,924
We need to be prepared.

315
00:26:40,008 --> 00:26:41,217
Yes, Your Highness.

316
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:49,851
Your Majesty.

317
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:51,770
You do not look well.

318
00:26:51,853 --> 00:26:53,855
You should go back to the palace.

319
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:57,734
I must witness it myself.

320
00:26:58,777 --> 00:27:00,278
Since we have the ice stone,

321
00:27:01,363 --> 00:27:03,281
the King's Star will appear as well.

322
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:21,966
Everyone must be waiting
for Words of the Heart.

323
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,844
Let us hurry.

324
00:27:33,395 --> 00:27:34,437
Master.

325
00:27:34,521 --> 00:27:35,897
Here is Words of the Heart.

326
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,816
That is not the priority right now.

327
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:39,692
A barrier has been created
around Jeongjingak.

328
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:41,403
Pardon?

329
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:51,121
Will I eventually get caught?

330
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:55,333
Then I will meet my demise.

331
00:28:17,021 --> 00:28:18,356
It is a honey biscuit.

332
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,068
You were barely eating. Please have some.

333
00:28:26,614 --> 00:28:28,283
Thank you.

334
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,246
Were you surprised to find out
that I was the Jin family's daughter?

335
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:36,750
When we first met,
I hadn't found my parents yet.

336
00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:39,544
This is your umbrella.

337
00:28:41,171 --> 00:28:43,423
I have kept it with me at all times.

338
00:28:43,506 --> 00:28:45,717
I thought you would recognize it
if we met again.

339
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:52,140
Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu
helped you find your parents?

340
00:28:52,223 --> 00:28:53,224
Yes.

341
00:28:55,185 --> 00:28:59,439
Please do not tell him
that you and I have met in the past.

342
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:03,693
If my mother hears about it,

343
00:29:03,777 --> 00:29:06,404
she will be heartbroken
by the things I went through.

344
00:29:08,156 --> 00:29:10,116
Please do not tell him.

345
00:29:11,534 --> 00:29:13,661
Everyone who knew her has been killed.

346
00:29:14,245 --> 00:29:15,663
Did she spare me on purpose?

347
00:29:18,374 --> 00:29:21,503
Jin Mu does not know
that we know that girl's true identity.

348
00:29:22,045 --> 00:29:23,296
It will be a great weakness.

349
00:29:23,797 --> 00:29:27,425
He must have killed them all
just to hide her identity.

350
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:30,261
She will face the same fate eventually.

351
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:33,640
If the Queen is planning
to shift souls with her,

352
00:29:34,224 --> 00:29:35,558
they brought her here to be killed.

353
00:29:35,642 --> 00:29:38,311
She has no idea
and is doing everything she can.

354
00:29:38,394 --> 00:29:40,063
He is using her.

355
00:29:41,272 --> 00:29:43,233
Just like how he used Naksu.

356
00:29:46,945 --> 00:29:49,155
So-i is a pitiful girl as well.

357
00:29:51,616 --> 00:29:52,784
Young Master.

358
00:29:53,368 --> 00:29:54,619
Did you know

359
00:29:54,702 --> 00:29:57,038
this umbrella fails
to fulfill its purpose?

360
00:29:59,082 --> 00:30:02,293
Look here. It is already torn.

361
00:30:03,962 --> 00:30:05,046
You are right.

362
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:07,382
I was told to pay a large sum
as it is a high-quality umbrella.

363
00:30:07,465 --> 00:30:09,259
You must have been fooled.

364
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:17,016
I am quite gullible.

365
00:30:17,934 --> 00:30:19,185
Is that so?

366
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:01,686
The soul shifter, Master Kang,
has disappeared?

367
00:31:02,353 --> 00:31:05,231
After feeding on her energy,
he walked out on his own.

368
00:31:05,732 --> 00:31:08,234
We could not find him
anywhere in Sejukwon.

369
00:31:08,318 --> 00:31:11,362
Since the Unanimous Assembly
was held near the Training Center,

370
00:31:11,446 --> 00:31:12,655
I doubt he went there.

371
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:14,657
Things have been disorderly all day long.

372
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:16,451
We should have spotted him.

373
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:19,787
There is one place he could hide

374
00:31:20,455 --> 00:31:21,831
without being seen.

375
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:26,377
Inside the barrier of Jeongjingak.

376
00:31:27,462 --> 00:31:29,422
He could be there.

377
00:32:07,335 --> 00:32:08,628
A soul shifter.

378
00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:13,007
I am with Jin Mu.

379
00:32:17,845 --> 00:32:19,097
I know you.

380
00:32:19,764 --> 00:32:21,724
I saw you shift souls
in the Cheonbugwan Secret Room.

381
00:32:21,808 --> 00:32:24,102
Your soul shifted out of that old body.

382
00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:37,991
We are on the same side. Please spare me.

383
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,412
I need human energy this instant.

384
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:44,122
I will find someone for you.

385
00:32:44,205 --> 00:32:45,999
Would you not prefer feeding

386
00:32:46,082 --> 00:32:48,584
on a Jeongjingak mage's energy
instead of mine?

387
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,753
Wait here,

388
00:32:50,837 --> 00:32:52,797
and I will lure someone in.

389
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:56,592
-A mage of Jeongjingak?
-Yes.

390
00:32:56,676 --> 00:32:58,344
Due to a barrier,

391
00:32:58,428 --> 00:33:00,722
no one can leave
or enter Jeongjingak right now.

392
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:03,099
A barrier?

393
00:33:18,656 --> 00:33:20,033
Young Lady Jin?

394
00:33:20,616 --> 00:33:22,285
What are you doing there?

395
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:24,287
I was looking for something,

396
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,914
but then I lost the umbrella
that I use for walking.

397
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:29,917
There it is.

398
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:07,538
I will spare you.

399
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:10,124
Go bring more mages.

400
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:11,793
Yes, right.

401
00:34:15,505 --> 00:34:16,964
Is Seo Yul here

402
00:34:17,673 --> 00:34:19,217
in Jeongjingak as well?

403
00:34:21,886 --> 00:34:22,804
Why do you ask?

404
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:27,934
He cut me with his sword.

405
00:34:28,518 --> 00:34:30,103
He shall be the first person I kill.

406
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:32,605
He is

407
00:34:33,481 --> 00:34:34,649
not here.

408
00:34:38,111 --> 00:34:39,487
If you refuse,

409
00:34:41,197 --> 00:34:42,532
I will kill you first.

410
00:34:42,615 --> 00:34:43,616
I will obey.

411
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:47,745
There is someone here
that I would like to get rid of.

412
00:34:49,163 --> 00:34:50,832
I will bring her here first.

413
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,001
Please kill her.

414
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,184
Your snacks are not tasty.

415
00:35:10,268 --> 00:35:11,477
Even the noodles were bad.

416
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,772
Since I have yet to tell Jang Uk,

417
00:35:15,356 --> 00:35:17,108
I will be Mu-deok for a bit longer.

418
00:35:18,151 --> 00:35:19,694
I am sorry.

419
00:35:20,945 --> 00:35:22,864
Dang-gu stashed away our leader's liquor.

420
00:35:30,621 --> 00:35:31,956
How does it taste?

421
00:35:33,249 --> 00:35:34,792
It is not bad.

422
00:35:35,376 --> 00:35:37,044
I wonder what they are doing outside

423
00:35:37,128 --> 00:35:39,672
-that they still have not resolved this.
-But still,

424
00:35:39,755 --> 00:35:43,217
we are surrounded by flowers,
the weather is wonderful,

425
00:35:43,301 --> 00:35:45,970
and it is full of energy.
This is not that bad either.

426
00:35:47,138 --> 00:35:48,055
Your Royal Highness.

427
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:49,891
Watching flowers will bore you.

428
00:35:49,974 --> 00:35:51,934
Would you like to watch me
perform Hyeongong?

429
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,146
He has some fancy techniques.

430
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:56,272
Is that so?

431
00:35:57,064 --> 00:35:58,191
I will take a look.

432
00:35:58,774 --> 00:35:59,942
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

433
00:36:45,863 --> 00:36:46,906
What?

434
00:36:46,989 --> 00:36:48,783
-Beom!
-Beom.

435
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:51,410
Beom, wake up.

436
00:36:51,494 --> 00:36:52,703
-Hey!
-Hey.

437
00:36:52,787 --> 00:36:54,914
Let us carry him. Beom.

438
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:59,543
Your energy drained out
when you cast spells?

439
00:36:59,627 --> 00:37:00,461
Yes.

440
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,755
I felt my energy draining out.

441
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:03,923
It felt like

442
00:37:05,132 --> 00:37:07,301
my energy was draining out
like a broken vase.

443
00:37:08,177 --> 00:37:09,720
I examined his core of energy,

444
00:37:09,804 --> 00:37:11,555
and he has lost a lot of energy.

445
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:14,850
How could I lose my torrent of energy?

446
00:37:25,403 --> 00:37:26,862
Maybe this sword is the problem.

447
00:37:44,755 --> 00:37:47,174
My energy just drained from the sword.

448
00:37:47,758 --> 00:37:49,760
I think the barrier
is causing the problem.

449
00:37:51,804 --> 00:37:53,764
I think it takes the energy you use…

450
00:37:55,975 --> 00:37:57,518
when you cast spells.

451
00:38:11,532 --> 00:38:13,326
We cannot use spells

452
00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:15,036
or unsheathe our swords in here.

453
00:38:15,828 --> 00:38:17,413
Let us keep our swords here.

454
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,632
This is Naksu's sword
that Master Lee had taken from me.

455
00:38:29,175 --> 00:38:30,301
Did you have it?

456
00:38:30,384 --> 00:38:32,970
Yes, Your Royal Highness.
He wanted me to keep it safe.

457
00:38:33,054 --> 00:38:34,847
But Maidservant Kim
did not want it at home.

458
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,349
So I had kept it here.

459
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,865
Keep this with you

460
00:38:52,948 --> 00:38:54,617
and give it to him once he comes.

461
00:38:56,577 --> 00:38:59,163
I cannot leave the house
when I was entrusted with this.

462
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:01,499
Maidservant Kim.

463
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:03,876
So tell me.

464
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:06,420
Did the Unanimous Assembly go smoothly?

465
00:39:06,504 --> 00:39:07,838
Not at all.

466
00:39:07,922 --> 00:39:11,175
All the mages from different families
are headed to Songrim.

467
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:14,053
Something must have come up.

468
00:39:15,638 --> 00:39:18,933
He will have to show himself
with all the fuss going around.

469
00:39:26,232 --> 00:39:28,984
Will Gwanju Jang Gang really return?

470
00:39:53,092 --> 00:39:55,136
Who are you to come here?

471
00:39:58,222 --> 00:39:59,432
Gwanju.

472
00:40:04,437 --> 00:40:08,649
Who is Assistant Gwanju's right hand
at the moment?

473
00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:36,760
Cho Chung threatened to expose
the truth about Young Master Jang.

474
00:40:36,844 --> 00:40:40,097
I had no choice
but to teach him the alchemy of souls.

475
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,101
Since he has run wild and died,
is this not the end?

476
00:40:44,935 --> 00:40:48,272
I only did what I did
for you and your son.

477
00:40:49,106 --> 00:40:52,943
I have lost my closest friend
as well as my wife to sorcery.

478
00:40:54,195 --> 00:40:56,280
I will get rid
of all remaining Soul Ejectors

479
00:40:56,906 --> 00:40:59,158
and seal the ice stone
in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

480
00:40:59,783 --> 00:41:00,910
No.

481
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:04,497
After all that you have done to master it.

482
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,457
How could you let go of the ice stone?

483
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,666
You cannot do that.

484
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,295
Since you also learned
the alchemy of souls,

485
00:41:12,129 --> 00:41:14,965
I will destroy your energy flow
so you cannot perform sorcery.

486
00:41:15,049 --> 00:41:16,467
Destroy my energy flow?

487
00:41:17,718 --> 00:41:19,178
No, my lord.

488
00:41:26,227 --> 00:41:29,021
Please do not destroy my energy flow.

489
00:41:29,104 --> 00:41:32,274
I swear I will never perform
the alchemy of souls

490
00:41:32,775 --> 00:41:36,111
which you have taught me. I promise!

491
00:41:54,588 --> 00:41:57,841
I should have destroyed his energy flow.

492
00:42:00,135 --> 00:42:03,347
Instead of hiding the ice stone,
I should have come clean

493
00:42:03,931 --> 00:42:05,849
and destroyed the ice stone.

494
00:42:08,185 --> 00:42:10,896
How did he retrieve the ice stone

495
00:42:12,273 --> 00:42:14,233
from Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?

496
00:42:15,317 --> 00:42:16,902
Or did someone help him?

497
00:42:48,684 --> 00:42:50,436
I feel the same.

498
00:42:52,146 --> 00:42:54,565
But there is only one thing
that makes me different.

499
00:42:55,941 --> 00:42:57,192
It is that…

500
00:42:59,445 --> 00:43:00,946
I am a soul shifter.

501
00:43:04,325 --> 00:43:05,659
Hey, Beom.

502
00:43:06,535 --> 00:43:07,911
You can always train again.

503
00:43:08,495 --> 00:43:11,165
He is right. You will be fine.

504
00:43:11,248 --> 00:43:12,458
Cheer up.

505
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:15,628
The ice stone is draining their energy.

506
00:43:15,711 --> 00:43:18,672
If I shift souls
and take the stone's energy,

507
00:43:19,256 --> 00:43:21,925
will I be taking their energy as well?

508
00:43:22,635 --> 00:43:25,012
Earn one, and lose the other.

509
00:43:25,095 --> 00:43:27,848
That is the burden you will have to carry.

510
00:43:28,891 --> 00:43:30,726
If I want to regain my power,

511
00:43:32,853 --> 00:43:35,147
I will have to take their energy as well.

512
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,358
And if I do that,

513
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:39,485
they will die.

514
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:52,206
I will have to take responsibility

515
00:43:53,165 --> 00:43:55,042
for their deaths.

516
00:43:58,796 --> 00:44:01,548
Filthy Mu-deok, what are you doing here?

517
00:44:07,805 --> 00:44:09,348
He will die as well.

518
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,475
It is dangerous here.

519
00:44:11,558 --> 00:44:13,602
If someone like you touches the barrier,

520
00:44:13,686 --> 00:44:15,646
your bones could get crushed.

521
00:44:15,729 --> 00:44:17,231
Step back.

522
00:44:21,402 --> 00:44:23,112
Are you not going to thank me?

523
00:44:24,947 --> 00:44:27,241
I was showing my concern for you.

524
00:44:30,285 --> 00:44:32,329
You had lost your energy back there.

525
00:44:33,247 --> 00:44:34,540
Are you all right?

526
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:39,169
Is this how you are thanking me?
Worrying about me too?

527
00:44:40,254 --> 00:44:41,380
Not a bad idea.

528
00:44:42,506 --> 00:44:44,258
I am fine.

529
00:44:45,426 --> 00:44:46,593
I am sorry.

530
00:44:46,677 --> 00:44:47,928
For what?

531
00:44:48,011 --> 00:44:51,515
For making terrible noodles and snacks.

532
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:53,725
You could not eat anything.

533
00:44:59,356 --> 00:45:00,941
Please have some of this instead.

534
00:45:05,362 --> 00:45:06,989
Honey biscuits, Jang Uk's favorite.

535
00:45:07,489 --> 00:45:09,867
Are you sharing some
that you had gotten for him?

536
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:12,453
Forget it. You can have them.

537
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:17,374
Look. I know I should take them.

538
00:45:18,876 --> 00:45:22,671
But I have decided
to give them to you instead. All of those.

539
00:45:25,632 --> 00:45:27,259
I have given them to you.

540
00:45:28,802 --> 00:45:31,889
He may not be the nicest man,
but he has been very considerate.

541
00:45:35,476 --> 00:45:36,351
Take this.

542
00:45:36,435 --> 00:45:38,562
I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

543
00:45:39,938 --> 00:45:41,899
-Your heart?
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

544
00:45:42,566 --> 00:45:43,942
I mean it.

545
00:45:45,402 --> 00:45:47,237
I am always grateful.

546
00:45:51,658 --> 00:45:54,286
If you want to thank me sincerely,

547
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,332
give me something bigger than that.

548
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,335
I would prefer something grander.

549
00:46:08,634 --> 00:46:09,927
Just take this.

550
00:46:11,428 --> 00:46:13,347
This is just the right amount.

551
00:46:17,226 --> 00:46:19,144
You are unbelievable.

552
00:46:21,188 --> 00:46:24,149
You are always impertinent
and barge your way in.

553
00:46:24,733 --> 00:46:27,528
But whenever I reach for you,
you always back away.

554
00:46:30,656 --> 00:46:33,450
The reason why I am not persistent
in trying to hold on to you

555
00:46:34,117 --> 00:46:36,495
is that if you still refuse, I would…

556
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:44,545
Forget it. I will not accept
if it is only that amount.

557
00:46:58,016 --> 00:47:00,769
I would have felt
less terrible had he taken it.

558
00:47:04,773 --> 00:47:05,899
Fine.

559
00:47:06,692 --> 00:47:09,152
I do not have to feel entirely guilty.

560
00:47:33,468 --> 00:47:34,303
Mu-deok.

561
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,640
I have a favor to ask of you.

562
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:41,602
Can you go to the mages' quarters for me?

563
00:47:42,894 --> 00:47:44,062
What for?

564
00:47:44,146 --> 00:47:47,149
It is humid here.
Could you bring me a new blanket?

565
00:47:48,066 --> 00:47:49,651
I heard you can get it there.

566
00:48:03,832 --> 00:48:05,042
Yes, Young Lady.

567
00:48:25,187 --> 00:48:26,855
What are you doing?

568
00:48:26,938 --> 00:48:29,066
Trying to keep
the fire in the brazier alive.

569
00:48:48,001 --> 00:48:49,002
Darn it.

570
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,213
Really?

571
00:48:51,797 --> 00:48:53,048
Are you a moron?

572
00:48:55,717 --> 00:48:56,927
Wait.

573
00:49:00,013 --> 00:49:02,808
Did you just call me a moron?

574
00:49:02,891 --> 00:49:04,559
There are countless books here.

575
00:49:04,643 --> 00:49:06,228
You could have burned them all.

576
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:08,271
I could have cast a spell to control it.

577
00:49:08,355 --> 00:49:09,773
I was simply flustered…

578
00:49:11,024 --> 00:49:12,317
as I cannot do it right now.

579
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:15,779
Still, you could have
just closed the lid on it.

580
00:49:15,862 --> 00:49:17,572
They say you are a genius.

581
00:49:17,656 --> 00:49:19,574
But you do not know
what to do when flustered.

582
00:49:19,658 --> 00:49:22,035
-You are just a fool.
-Do not bad-mouth me.

583
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:23,662
I will get upset.

584
00:49:25,497 --> 00:49:27,082
So you do know how to be upset.

585
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:30,544
You were always so placid like water.

586
00:49:31,044 --> 00:49:33,797
Even water can boil or freeze.

587
00:49:34,673 --> 00:49:36,174
It does not always stay the same.

588
00:49:44,433 --> 00:49:46,852
It is humid due to the fog.

589
00:49:46,935 --> 00:49:49,479
Were you doing this
because your leg was hurting?

590
00:49:51,857 --> 00:49:54,401
You remembered.

591
00:49:55,861 --> 00:49:57,028
I am fine.

592
00:49:57,112 --> 00:49:58,280
Do not worry.

593
00:50:02,284 --> 00:50:04,661
You said you liked pine pollen tea snacks.

594
00:50:06,663 --> 00:50:08,165
But I never got to give you any.

595
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:10,709
You remembered that as well.

596
00:50:12,544 --> 00:50:14,087
What is the point?

597
00:50:14,796 --> 00:50:16,548
I never got you any.

598
00:50:17,424 --> 00:50:19,676
Then make some for me next time.

599
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:24,306
There is no next time.

600
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:28,518
If I shift souls, he will die as well.

601
00:50:28,602 --> 00:50:29,478
Better yet,

602
00:50:29,561 --> 00:50:31,855
teach me the recipe.

603
00:50:31,938 --> 00:50:34,900
Then I can make it myself. Like last time.

604
00:50:35,567 --> 00:50:36,860
Do you remember?

605
00:50:44,117 --> 00:50:45,243
I cherish

606
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:48,121
all the memories I had in Danhyanggok.

607
00:50:57,798 --> 00:51:00,759
Seo Yul will die.

608
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:08,600
I was on my way to the quarters
for some blankets.

609
00:51:08,683 --> 00:51:10,060
I will get going then.

610
00:51:18,151 --> 00:51:21,071
Let me do that. Go to Uk.

611
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,332
He has been looking for you.

612
00:51:44,928 --> 00:51:46,638
I just need to be Naksu again.

613
00:51:47,889 --> 00:51:50,183
I had cut ties with him back then.

614
00:51:52,227 --> 00:51:53,979
I will do the same with everyone.

615
00:52:07,242 --> 00:52:10,120
Glaring at it will not break the barrier.

616
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:17,794
Did you see that?

617
00:52:18,628 --> 00:52:20,213
The stone passed through.

618
00:52:21,047 --> 00:52:22,090
You are right.

619
00:52:23,008 --> 00:52:25,218
Maybe only things
that have liquid cannot pass.

620
00:52:25,302 --> 00:52:26,803
What a strange barrier.

621
00:52:26,887 --> 00:52:29,764
It filters what can and cannot pass.

622
00:52:29,848 --> 00:52:31,308
What kind of barrier is that?

623
00:52:32,017 --> 00:52:33,685
What are the others doing outside?

624
00:52:33,768 --> 00:52:37,522
Despite all the mages out there,
they have yet to break this barrier.

625
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,692
Is it because the ice stone made it?

626
00:52:40,775 --> 00:52:44,613
They are probably too busy
fighting over who gets the ice stone.

627
00:52:44,696 --> 00:52:47,824
Still, they know
that I am trapped in here.

628
00:52:49,451 --> 00:52:54,205
Perhaps you are not that important
to the Queen who has the ice stone.

629
00:52:55,665 --> 00:52:57,125
How could a mother be like that?

630
00:52:58,126 --> 00:53:00,045
Or is she similar to my father?

631
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:03,715
Fine.

632
00:53:03,798 --> 00:53:07,469
As you all know,
she is not my biological mother.

633
00:53:08,553 --> 00:53:10,472
Just like you and your father.

634
00:53:12,641 --> 00:53:14,142
That is what everyone says.

635
00:53:14,976 --> 00:53:16,895
I will not apologize even if you are hurt.

636
00:53:17,604 --> 00:53:19,481
Then I will not beat around the bush.

637
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:23,902
If the Queen and Jin Mu
offer the power of the ice stone to you,

638
00:53:23,985 --> 00:53:25,362
can you still get rid of them?

639
00:53:28,365 --> 00:53:32,661
It would be difficult
to decline such grand power.

640
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,829
You are brave.

641
00:53:36,331 --> 00:53:38,959
You need the courage
to be open about your greed.

642
00:53:43,296 --> 00:53:46,800
And you? What will you do
if you had the ice stone?

643
00:53:50,303 --> 00:53:52,180
I will do what Master Seo Gyeong did.

644
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:53,431
Seo Gyeong?

645
00:53:55,016 --> 00:53:57,769
Do you mean you wish to become
a hero with the fate of the King's Star

646
00:53:57,852 --> 00:53:59,771
by destroying every ice stone
and saving the world from chaos?

647
00:53:59,854 --> 00:54:03,441
I am sure he did
such a thing out of sincerity.

648
00:54:04,526 --> 00:54:07,862
But I believe he saved one stone
to save someone he loved

649
00:54:08,488 --> 00:54:10,115
out of sincerity as well.

650
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:13,076
You see, that part touches me more.

651
00:54:16,413 --> 00:54:18,915
So that is what he wrote in his book.

652
00:54:18,999 --> 00:54:22,293
It is just a poor excuse
for not being able to let go of the stone.

653
00:54:23,086 --> 00:54:24,379
Who would believe that?

654
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:25,839
I do.

655
00:54:27,799 --> 00:54:30,468
Because I would do the same.

656
00:54:48,028 --> 00:54:49,195
What?

657
00:54:49,279 --> 00:54:51,072
Stones pass through the barrier.

658
00:54:51,156 --> 00:54:53,616
Send a notice to urge them
to come to your rescue.

659
00:54:56,828 --> 00:54:57,662
Jang Uk.

660
00:54:59,122 --> 00:55:00,248
You are a genius.

661
00:55:04,252 --> 00:55:05,336
Let me see.

662
00:55:08,673 --> 00:55:10,842
-A barrier…
-Uk.

663
00:55:11,593 --> 00:55:13,428
Is there a bigger stone?

664
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:15,305
They just need to read your message.

665
00:55:15,388 --> 00:55:17,098
You do not need a bigger one.

666
00:55:17,182 --> 00:55:18,683
I need to write in big letters.

667
00:55:19,392 --> 00:55:21,561
Does this one not budge?

668
00:55:24,439 --> 00:55:25,690
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

669
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:29,277
By the way, why did Dang-gu never tell us

670
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,863
about his stash of liquor?

671
00:55:31,946 --> 00:55:34,282
We should drink it all. Drink up.

672
00:55:34,365 --> 00:55:36,785
-Let us drink.
-Let us drink.

673
00:55:41,498 --> 00:55:42,874
I brought another brazier.

674
00:55:45,251 --> 00:55:46,461
Mu-deok.

675
00:55:47,045 --> 00:55:48,838
Why are you here?

676
00:55:48,922 --> 00:55:50,006
What do you mean?

677
00:55:52,008 --> 00:55:54,594
Young Master Seo went
to get the blankets himself.

678
00:55:57,847 --> 00:55:59,641
Is Seo Yul here in Jeongjingak as well?

679
00:55:59,724 --> 00:56:01,601
He shall be the first person I kill.

680
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:34,592
Young Master Seo,
you cannot enter this room.

681
00:56:35,844 --> 00:56:38,179
-What is the matter?
-Please go back.

682
00:56:39,889 --> 00:56:42,308
Can you see me?

683
00:56:42,892 --> 00:56:44,435
You see, I…

684
00:57:15,383 --> 00:57:16,926
Young Master Seo!

685
00:57:47,373 --> 00:57:48,583
Young Master Seo!

686
00:57:50,543 --> 00:57:53,755
Young Master Seo! What do I do?

687
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,358
What do I do?

688
00:58:37,423 --> 00:58:38,675
What?

689
00:58:38,758 --> 00:58:40,843
Who are you?

690
00:59:09,497 --> 00:59:10,915
Yul!

691
00:59:10,999 --> 00:59:11,833
Yul.

692
00:59:18,298 --> 00:59:20,675
-Young Master Seo!
-Are you all right?

693
00:59:52,457 --> 00:59:53,583
Yul.

694
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:57,045
-What happened?
-A soul shifter.

695
00:59:57,128 --> 00:59:58,296
There is a soul shifter.

696
00:59:58,379 --> 00:59:59,631
What?

697
01:00:03,134 --> 01:00:04,469
A soul shifter is here.

698
01:00:04,552 --> 01:00:07,180
He fed on Yun-su and Jin-ho's energy.

699
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,990
Master Kang of Daegangtongun,
a very powerful man, is the soul shifter.

700
01:00:26,074 --> 01:00:29,410
And he was using his energy
to cast spells.

701
01:00:29,494 --> 01:00:31,746
None of us could use spells in here.

702
01:00:32,413 --> 01:00:33,831
So why can he?

703
01:00:33,915 --> 01:00:36,292
This place drains our energy,

704
01:00:36,376 --> 01:00:37,835
but it must be the opposite for them.

705
01:00:40,797 --> 01:00:42,632
What if I regained my power

706
01:00:43,257 --> 01:00:45,426
and took the ice stone with me?

707
01:00:46,094 --> 01:00:48,846
If caught, you may even be killed for it.

708
01:00:50,306 --> 01:00:51,516
Are you not afraid?

709
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,685
I am still a bit afraid.

710
01:00:53,768 --> 01:00:56,270
I am scared that you may break our promise

711
01:00:56,354 --> 01:00:58,189
and abandon me without even looking back.

712
01:01:00,608 --> 01:01:02,902
-Jang Uk, I--
-Young Master Jang.

713
01:01:07,365 --> 01:01:10,326
Where is Mu-deok?

714
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:12,704
She was with us up until a while ago.

715
01:01:13,329 --> 01:01:14,580
Where did she go?

716
01:01:21,295 --> 01:01:23,172
There was a nuisance roaming around.

717
01:01:33,641 --> 01:01:35,977
If he is not stopped,
they will all die in there.

718
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:40,898
They are going to die
once I shift souls anyway.

719
01:01:40,982 --> 01:01:42,900
It would be ridiculous to save them.

720
01:01:44,026 --> 01:01:45,903
This is how I will cut ties with them.

721
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,952
I just feel too guilty.

722
01:01:53,536 --> 01:01:56,289
This will be the last time I save them.

723
01:01:57,206 --> 01:01:58,374
Just this once.

724
01:02:00,835 --> 01:02:01,919
You.

725
01:02:03,212 --> 01:02:05,923
-Where have you been?
-I am here, am I not?

726
01:02:06,424 --> 01:02:07,508
Uk…

727
01:02:08,134 --> 01:02:09,343
Jang Uk could die!

728
01:02:30,782 --> 01:02:32,575
No one can beat him here right now.

729
01:02:33,284 --> 01:02:34,911
We cannot all die.

730
01:02:34,994 --> 01:02:37,455
I will lure and trap him
in the secret room.

731
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:44,128
Once he traps the soul shifter
and himself in the secret room,

732
01:02:44,212 --> 01:02:45,546
Uk will die.

733
01:02:46,088 --> 01:02:47,173
Why?

734
01:02:47,924 --> 01:02:49,509
Why did he go alone?

735
01:02:50,426 --> 01:02:52,804
He said he had to.

736
01:02:52,887 --> 01:02:54,305
He said he was responsible.

737
01:03:01,687 --> 01:03:04,273
-Where are you going?
-To the secret room.

738
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:07,652
If the door to the secret room is open,

739
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:11,614
that means Uk died after failing
to lure the soul shifter there.

740
01:03:11,697 --> 01:03:13,199
If it is closed,

741
01:03:14,116 --> 01:03:15,743
he is probably already dead.

742
01:03:16,494 --> 01:03:17,703
There is no use.

743
01:03:19,997 --> 01:03:22,875
You said you would not be persistent
in trying to hold on to me.

744
01:03:23,835 --> 01:03:25,586
You cannot stop me.

745
01:03:26,587 --> 01:03:27,964
So please let me go.

746
01:04:26,606 --> 01:04:30,192
If it is closed,
he is probably already dead.

747
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:38,075
But I can never turn back time
even if I regret something.

748
01:04:39,535 --> 01:04:40,745
Jang Uk.

749
01:07:34,627 --> 01:07:36,045
You are still alive,

750
01:07:38,214 --> 01:07:39,632
my pupil.

751
01:07:58,818 --> 01:08:00,444
Why did you hide it?

752
01:08:04,698 --> 01:08:05,825
Because…

753
01:08:07,827 --> 01:08:09,078
I wanted you to die.

754
01:08:10,871 --> 01:08:12,039
Then…

755
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:14,583
why did you come for me?

756
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,046
Because…

757
01:08:23,259 --> 01:08:24,760
I thought you would die.

758
01:08:31,433 --> 01:08:33,185
Since you have unsheathed the sword,

759
01:08:34,562 --> 01:08:35,896
make your decision.

760
01:08:38,858 --> 01:08:40,609
I know you have been avoiding me.

761
01:08:40,693 --> 01:08:43,320
I also know that everyone's lives
are in your hands.

762
01:08:47,741 --> 01:08:49,076
Like you promised,

763
01:08:50,161 --> 01:08:51,745
point your sword at me first.

764
01:09:06,135 --> 01:09:07,178
If you stab me,

765
01:09:07,887 --> 01:09:10,472
then I will die as the one

766
01:09:11,223 --> 01:09:12,600
who released the assassin.

767
01:09:14,768 --> 01:09:16,061
If you withdraw your sword,

768
01:09:16,896 --> 01:09:18,898
I will make you another promise.

769
01:09:42,296 --> 01:09:43,422
Fine.

770
01:09:47,885 --> 01:09:49,762
Make me another promise

771
01:09:51,347 --> 01:09:53,182
just like you said you would.

772
01:11:06,505 --> 01:11:09,800
What human would choose
to give up on such immense power?

773
01:11:09,883 --> 01:11:12,177
To protect what we must…

774
01:11:12,261 --> 01:11:13,679
What if I give it all away?

775
01:11:13,762 --> 01:11:15,556
I am trying to protect as well.

776
01:11:16,307 --> 01:11:18,142
Why is he here?

777
01:11:18,225 --> 01:11:20,728
Jin Bu-yeon's immense divine powers

778
01:11:20,811 --> 01:11:22,896
not only came from her mother,
a member of the Jin family.

779
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:26,275
Park Jin! You hid the truth,
despite knowing everything.

780
01:11:28,193 --> 01:11:32,698
Then those leaving shall leave,
and those returning shall return.

781
01:11:32,781 --> 01:11:35,367
Young Master. Do what you must.

782
01:11:35,451 --> 01:11:38,620
I will be trying something
not out of stupidity, but out of vigor.

783
01:11:38,704 --> 01:11:40,205
Just as my master has taught me.

784
01:11:40,289 --> 01:11:42,624
-I look quite nice.
-Goodness.

785
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:45,044
I heard there was a bride
about to get married soon.

786
01:11:47,755 --> 01:11:52,760
