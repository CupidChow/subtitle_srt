00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We are married.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,386
Please give us your blessings.

4
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,388
Nonsense. I did not allow this marriage.

5
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:08,309
Jang Uk, I will never allow you
to take my daughter.

6
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:10,269
I am not asking for your permission.

7
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:12,146
Like I said,

8
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,398
we are already married.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,320
Bu-yeon.

10
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:21,530
Answer me.

11
00:00:22,364 --> 00:00:23,199
This cannot be, right?

12
00:00:23,783 --> 00:00:25,117
My kindhearted daughter

13
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:28,162
could not have possibly deceived me
and married that man.

14
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,331
Am I right?

15
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,667
I will never abandon you, Mother.

16
00:00:34,376 --> 00:00:36,253
Yes. Right.

17
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,589
You are so precious to me.

18
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:41,300
However,

19
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:45,429
I cannot live the life you want for me.

20
00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:48,766
That is why I married him.

21
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:50,810
And from now on,

22
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,188
we will be together.

23
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:55,523
I do not believe you.

24
00:00:56,482 --> 00:00:59,610
He is holding my daughter hostage
and forcing her to lie.

25
00:01:00,444 --> 00:01:01,821
This wedding is a lie.

26
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:04,907
Are you all going to sit back
and watch this nonsense?

27
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:24,301
Jang Uk.

28
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:28,097
You vowed never to abuse your power

29
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:31,642
on the life of Park Jin,
the former leader of Songrim.

30
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:34,228
How dare you wed the heiress of Jinyowon

31
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:35,646
without Jinyowon's consent?

32
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,898
Leave her here and go.

33
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:39,733
If not,

34
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:43,195
Park Jin will pay
for all the deeds you have committed.

35
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:45,281
I did not use any of my powers.

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,993
Are you so terrified
that you would use him to threaten me?

37
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:51,412
Terrified?

38
00:01:53,622 --> 00:01:56,917
You must have nothing to fear
due to those powers of yours.

39
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,586
But this is the Unanimous Assembly.

40
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:00,629
We are not fearful of you.

41
00:02:00,713 --> 00:02:01,547
In that case,

42
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,008
watch closely

43
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,511
as I take her away from here.

44
00:02:19,523 --> 00:02:21,734
I thought being
the acting leader was enough.

45
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:24,570
So why must I come here
on my uncle's behalf as well?

46
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:26,780
We must hurry.
The Unanimous Assembly must have begun.

47
00:02:26,864 --> 00:02:27,698
Right.

48
00:02:40,753 --> 00:02:42,129
I heard you were the acting leader.

49
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:44,423
So you are attending
the Unanimous Assembly as well.

50
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,967
I did not know you would be here.

51
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,221
I heard that your sister was found

52
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:51,972
and she will be introduced as the heir.

53
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:55,517
I heard you posted her portrait
throughout Daeho Fortress.

54
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:58,062
It was nothing.

55
00:02:58,646 --> 00:02:59,647
Your sister was missing.

56
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,774
That was the least I could do.

57
00:03:01,857 --> 00:03:04,026
Why did you do that
when no one asked you to?

58
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,197
Now that her face has been revealed,
she will be locked up forever.

59
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:11,659
Poor thing.

60
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:14,745
Locked up?

61
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:26,924
Something must have happened
at the Unanimous Assembly.

62
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:41,313
He has incredible skills.

63
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:42,356
Did you see that?

64
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,858
He unleashed such power
when he did not even unsheathe his sword.

65
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:46,777
The ice stone has the energy of the sky.

66
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:49,488
If Jang Uk wants to,

67
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:51,865
he could take all of our souls
using his powers!

68
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:55,452
Still, we have here with us
some of Daeho's most powerful mages.

69
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,454
We will be a laughingstock
if we let him go!

70
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:59,498
Please calm down.

71
00:04:03,752 --> 00:04:05,671
One party does not believe
that they are married,

72
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:08,048
and the other party claims that they are.

73
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,134
I have an idea.

74
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,970
Bring forth a witness
who can verify your marriage.

75
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,723
Why is a witness necessary?

76
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:18,559
Because no one believes you.

77
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:21,061
Bring forth a witness,

78
00:04:21,145 --> 00:04:22,563
and we will let you go with our blessings.

79
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:24,023
But if you do not,

80
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:27,609
you are not justified
to take Jinyowon's heiress with you,

81
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:28,861
and you must leave alone.

82
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,449
I see that you are still
hung up on justifications.

83
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:39,079
If my powers can be
considered justification,

84
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:41,707
I would like

85
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,376
to see you try arguing with that.

86
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:48,672
Gosh.

87
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:54,219
I guess you cannot prove it.

88
00:04:57,473 --> 00:04:58,557
I can.

89
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,202
And we have

90
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:20,662
a witness.

91
00:05:31,924 --> 00:05:32,758
Right here.

92
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,945
She is with child?

93
00:05:53,695 --> 00:05:54,696
Do you not consider

94
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,949
this baby to be the best witness

95
00:05:58,784 --> 00:05:59,618
to our wedding?

96
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:00,911
How can we believe you?

97
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:01,829
Right.

98
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:04,164
We have a physician here.

99
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:06,542
Master Heo, please take a look.

100
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,671
I can only tell
if at least 21 days have passed.

101
00:06:10,754 --> 00:06:11,839
Uk.

102
00:06:11,922 --> 00:06:15,092
When did you two become intimate?

103
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:19,263
Why would you ask such a thing?

104
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,931
How embarrassing.

105
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,558
We need to be sure.

106
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,519
Lady Jin.

107
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:29,106
Seeing how they are close,

108
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,316
should you not give them your permission?

109
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,820
Marriage is a family affair.

110
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:38,073
The Unanimous Assembly does not
need to talk further about this.

111
00:06:38,157 --> 00:06:39,700
Let us put an end to this.

112
00:06:39,783 --> 00:06:40,909
End it.

113
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:08,812
Hey, Uk.

114
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,105
You were here too?

115
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:14,693
Bu-yeon.

116
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:15,903
Why are you leaving?

117
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:17,821
I am married to him.

118
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:20,199
So I will be moving in

119
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:21,492
with my husband.

120
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:22,493
Your husband?

121
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:26,413
I told you before that I was waiting
for my groom to take me away.

122
00:07:27,873 --> 00:07:30,834
He came, and I am leaving with him.

123
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:40,928
So he was the one

124
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,223
who got her out of that room.

125
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,352
Did your sister just say

126
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,230
that she got married to Uk?

127
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:55,359
I see.

128
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,410
If Jang Uk has become
Lady Jin's son-in-law,

129
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:08,830
I do not see the need
to move Jinyowon to another family.

130
00:08:08,914 --> 00:08:10,332
I agree.

131
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:11,708
It is Jang Uk, after all.

132
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,877
No one would dare to attack Jinyowon.

133
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:14,962
Ho-gyeong.

134
00:08:16,505 --> 00:08:19,550
You have put on quite a show
introducing Bu-yeon to everyone.

135
00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:24,263
In any case,
Jinyowon will remain safe and strong

136
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,974
thanks to your great son-in-law.

137
00:08:38,777 --> 00:08:40,070
Young Master, welcome home.

138
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:41,488
Hey.

139
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:44,324
You are back again, my lady.

140
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,702
Yes, I am.

141
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:50,289
Young Master.

142
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:52,374
Where did you go without telling me?

143
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:56,253
-And why are you--
-Maidservant Kim.

144
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,755
She must be exhausted today as well,

145
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,757
so please prepare her a room.

146
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:07,764
Today, you have dressed appropriately
as a member of the Jin family.

147
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:11,268
I attended the Unanimous Assembly.

148
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,394
The Unanimous Assembly?

149
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:17,983
Is that where our young master
picked you up?

150
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:20,485
Yes.

151
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:23,155
But this time,
I will be settling here for good.

152
00:09:24,406 --> 00:09:26,366
I hope we get along, Maidservant Kim.

153
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,243
Right.

154
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,665
So the person
Bu-yeon gave her heart to was Uk.

155
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:34,750
Does this mean

156
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:37,544
the two were dating?

157
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:39,212
When did they first meet?

158
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:41,006
It must have been that day

159
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:43,342
when Uk entered Jinyowon.

160
00:09:44,343 --> 00:09:47,763
Was that already 21 days ago?

161
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,932
-Twenty-one days?
-It is a long story.

162
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:53,852
Could that be true too?

163
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,487
-But Dang-gu,
-What?

164
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,197
do you really believe it?

165
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,283
That Uk finally let go of Mu-deok…

166
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,245
and fell in love with someone else?

167
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,626
Of course not.

168
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:20,337
That is absurd.

169
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:23,965
I am sure there is a reason for all this.

170
00:10:28,637 --> 00:10:29,596
But what could it be?

171
00:10:49,324 --> 00:10:50,951
You are a relic of Jinyowon, right?

172
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:55,163
Thanks to you, I was able to get married.

173
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,376
Wait…

174
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:05,507
Did I really turn you off?

175
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:06,925
Or…

176
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:09,428
did Uk turn you off

177
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:11,513
so he could take me away?

178
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,685
Of course not.

179
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:22,190
If I could turn it off,
then could I turn it back on again?

180
00:11:49,134 --> 00:11:51,303
This is his sword.

181
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:54,598
How pretty.

182
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,531
What is going on?

183
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:15,785
That lantern.

184
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:18,205
Did you turn it on?

185
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:22,042
Was it you?

186
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,128
I was the only one here…

187
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:27,964
so probably.

188
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,425
Why are you not sure?

189
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:34,471
Something just flashed before my eyes.

190
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:35,889
I think it was a memory.

191
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,976
It must be true that regaining my memories
will bring back my powers.

192
00:12:42,354 --> 00:12:43,438
Do it again.

193
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:59,496
See? I did that.

194
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,872
Well done.

195
00:13:00,956 --> 00:13:03,833
I could not recover my memories until now
since I was locked up.

196
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,001
Look.

197
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,505
Now that there are external stimuli,
it is all coming back to me.

198
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,175
This way, you can continue
regaining your memories and divine powers.

199
00:13:12,884 --> 00:13:13,927
I am glad I brought you here.

200
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:17,222
Thank goodness.

201
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:21,309
I was worried because you seemed mad.

202
00:13:21,393 --> 00:13:24,229
That was because
you made up a fake witness.

203
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,441
Was it not because of my mother?

204
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,236
Was it because of the baby?

205
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,781
We got out of there safely
thanks to our baby.

206
00:13:35,365 --> 00:13:38,243
I already expected your mother
to react that way.

207
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:39,870
As for the baby--

208
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,836
You are making it seem like
you are actually pregnant.

209
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,088
What do we do now?

210
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:51,923
That physician, Heo Yeom,

211
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:54,593
wants to check up on me
after the twenty-first day.

212
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:56,469
I cannot tell him the truth.

213
00:13:56,553 --> 00:13:57,554
Then what?

214
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,180
Do you want us to make a baby by then?

215
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:14,321
Why? What is it?

216
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:22,704
I was hoping

217
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:24,497
for this.

218
00:14:25,373 --> 00:14:27,918
I hoped you were the one
who turned off the lantern

219
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,794
and I hoped that you would come for me…

220
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:34,257
despite being of no use to you.

221
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:38,929
Even if I did turn it off,

222
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:41,848
it would not be
due to the reasons you were hoping for.

223
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:44,142
You know that.

224
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:51,733
So what are you going to do?

225
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:55,028
If you want, I can help you create
that witness you must bring

226
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:56,947
to Sejukwon by the twenty-first day.

227
00:14:58,073 --> 00:15:00,784
That is, if you give up
on that futile hope of yours.

228
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,109
Let us say this was
how we created our witness.

229
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:36,236
We are married, after all.

230
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:38,947
I cannot say I did it alone.

231
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:41,866
You said you would help.

232
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:44,744
Do not resent me for this.

233
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:48,081
Will you keep lying about a witness?

234
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:52,836
What is it now?

235
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:54,838
Stop being unpredictable.

236
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,555
-What is it?
-Do not mind me.

237
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:14,482
-What is this?
-My mother sewed the tracking thread

238
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:16,526
into my flesh.

239
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:19,738
It is tightening and causing me pain.

240
00:16:20,655 --> 00:16:21,865
She must be…

241
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:25,493
calling for me.

242
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:46,639
I cannot let you stay with him.

243
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:48,808
Come back,

244
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:51,144
my dear daughter, Bu-yeon.

245
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,412
Regardless of the circumstances,

246
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,290
how could a mother sew
such a thing onto her daughter?

247
00:17:13,374 --> 00:17:14,375
I cannot believe this.

248
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:18,421
Goodness, you must be feeling
excruciating pain.

249
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,174
How about you return to Jinyowon for now?

250
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:23,551
I will tell our young master
to escort you.

251
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,596
Do not do that.

252
00:17:27,388 --> 00:17:29,015
I said I would endure the pain.

253
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:31,559
Please do not send me away.

254
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:34,145
How could you possibly endure such pain?

255
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:38,108
It is brazen to desire something

256
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,027
without being willing

257
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:44,030
to endure the pain.

258
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,494
A pain that does not kill me

259
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:51,538
will eventually…

260
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,292
set me free.

261
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:09,097
Young Master.

262
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,224
Young Lady Bu-yeon is in a lot of pain.

263
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:12,142
So?

264
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:13,726
Does she want to return?

265
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,270
No, she vehemently refuses.

266
00:18:15,353 --> 00:18:18,523
I applied some ointment for the pain,
but it is not helping.

267
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,278
She said she would endure it.

268
00:18:24,195 --> 00:18:25,196
Just give her more ointment.

269
00:18:29,534 --> 00:18:31,494
I thought she was his wife.

270
00:18:32,036 --> 00:18:33,454
Why is he being so cold to her?

271
00:18:41,838 --> 00:18:43,006
Mother.

272
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,507
Please stop.

273
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:50,471
It is too painful.

274
00:19:23,755 --> 00:19:26,299
Her face was
shockingly identical to Naksu's,

275
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,843
but her build and aura
were completely different.

276
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:32,847
Naksu was neither that dainty nor small.

277
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:36,809
I need to find out more about Jin Bu-yeon.

278
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,689
-So-i should be coming for her medicine.
-Yes, my lord.

279
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:46,861
I will use her.

280
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:50,740
-Here we go.
-Let me see.

281
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,200
-One more.
-Really?

282
00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:54,577
-I got it!
-Darn it.

283
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:57,413
-Here you go.
-Where is it?

284
00:19:57,497 --> 00:20:00,291
Wait here. Goodness.

285
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:05,755
Ninety-three.

286
00:20:06,464 --> 00:20:07,674
Ninety-four.

287
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,343
Ninety-five.

288
00:20:11,094 --> 00:20:12,804
Ninety-six.

289
00:20:13,763 --> 00:20:15,306
Ninety-seven.

290
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,600
Ninety-eight.

291
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,061
Ninety-nine.

292
00:20:20,144 --> 00:20:21,604
One hundred.

293
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,399
Sang-gu, are you all right?

294
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:25,858
What do I do?

295
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:28,111
Do you want to save your brother?

296
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:31,239
Then pay me back.

297
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:35,994
You sold your farmland.
Give me the money you got.

298
00:20:36,077 --> 00:20:38,955
I do not have any. I already used it all.

299
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:39,956
Is that so?

300
00:20:41,124 --> 00:20:42,333
I will count to 200 this time.

301
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:44,669
Try hard to remember where the money is.

302
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:46,713
Dunk him.

303
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:48,881
Sang-gu!

304
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:50,258
Two.

305
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:51,718
-Three.
-Sang-gu!

306
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:54,012
-Madam.
-Four.

307
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:55,805
Five.

308
00:20:57,598 --> 00:20:58,558
Six.

309
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:01,519
Seven.

310
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,564
Eight.

311
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:07,817
Nine.

312
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,653
Ten.

313
00:21:28,338 --> 00:21:29,213
Bu-yeon.

314
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:32,425
Why are you making me hurt you?

315
00:21:33,301 --> 00:21:34,135
Come back.

316
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:51,694
What have you done?

317
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:56,115
My wife cannot sleep.

318
00:21:57,366 --> 00:22:00,578
Please refrain from calling her
in the middle of the night.

319
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:01,788
As you already know,

320
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,957
we are newlyweds.

321
00:23:20,908 --> 00:23:22,326
There is no pain anymore.

322
00:23:25,746 --> 00:23:27,748
Mother must have stopped.

323
00:23:35,256 --> 00:23:36,507
In return for the medicine,

324
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:40,595
he wants you to bring her to him.

325
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,181
Jin Bu-yeon?

326
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,433
Lady Jin's daughter?

327
00:23:48,853 --> 00:23:49,979
Is it really her?

328
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,105
That is not important.

329
00:23:51,189 --> 00:23:53,816
Just follow the Gwanju's orders.

330
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:57,737
You are alive to this day
despite the blood parasite in you

331
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,072
only because of his medicine.

332
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:06,245
And I am showing my gratitude
by doing everything he wants.

333
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:09,207
I will take her to that room
in Cheonbugwan.

334
00:24:21,552 --> 00:24:23,763
Have you told the person
who has been giving me this medicine

335
00:24:23,846 --> 00:24:26,224
that I wanted to see them?

336
00:24:26,307 --> 00:24:29,143
They said there was no need for that
and refused.

337
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:33,689
But I do know who they are
and what they do.

338
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:36,067
Is her name So-i?

339
00:24:37,902 --> 00:24:39,237
So you two have met.

340
00:24:40,488 --> 00:24:43,908
She is the owner
of a notorious gambling den.

341
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:47,078
Rumor has it she does illegal business,
and Cheonbugwan has her back.

342
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:51,540
I felt extremely uneasy
knowing that I was giving you medicine

343
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,626
from a woman like her.

344
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:56,087
Where is this gambling den?

345
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,505
It is in Gaema Village.

346
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:01,926
Are you taking that medicine
because you are ill?

347
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:05,137
Are you staying here instead of at Songrim
to hide your illness?

348
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:06,555
That is not true.

349
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:10,685
I feel more comfortable here.
You do not need to worry about me.

350
00:25:18,943 --> 00:25:19,819
Young Master.

351
00:25:21,404 --> 00:25:22,488
Did you go somewhere?

352
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:24,865
Why are you still up, Maidservant Kim?

353
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:26,867
How can I sleep in this situation?

354
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:30,871
Would you rather watch me lose sleep
and explain everything tomorrow?

355
00:25:31,622 --> 00:25:32,540
Well…

356
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:35,835
Maidservant Kim.

357
00:25:37,128 --> 00:25:40,298
I am sorry for getting married abruptly.
I should have asked for your permission.

358
00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:43,134
In that case,
you should have a proper wedding ceremony.

359
00:25:43,217 --> 00:25:44,635
Before then, I will not consider her

360
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:46,220
to be the lady of the house.

361
00:25:46,304 --> 00:25:48,848
I will continue calling you "young master"
instead of "my lord."

362
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:52,435
All right, then. Prepare for a wedding.

363
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:57,898
Do you mean that?

364
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:01,360
Not mine, but yours.

365
00:26:01,944 --> 00:26:04,530
-Young Master.
-I am already married.

366
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,658
So you can get married to him as well.

367
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:10,244
You can do that.

368
00:26:10,328 --> 00:26:11,912
What will you do

369
00:26:12,913 --> 00:26:14,081
after I get married?

370
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:16,250
She and I will get what we desire.

371
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:19,253
She was locked up
and hidden from everyone.

372
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:21,672
Now, she will be free.

373
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:24,258
As will I.

374
00:26:24,342 --> 00:26:27,136
Can I interpret that
as you trying your best

375
00:26:28,095 --> 00:26:29,513
to let go of the past?

376
00:26:33,684 --> 00:26:34,560
In that case,

377
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:39,440
I will say what I have kept to myself
for the past three years.

378
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:46,697
Please get rid of
the red bird egg that you keep

379
00:26:48,616 --> 00:26:50,159
where you have been stabbed.

380
00:26:52,036 --> 00:26:55,414
Why do you keep the yin-and-yang jade
you shared with the dead?

381
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:56,707
That jade

382
00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:59,293
brings two people to each other.

383
00:27:01,462 --> 00:27:02,296
I am terrified

384
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,800
that the dead girl will come

385
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,552
to take you away.

386
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,444
Do not worry.

387
00:27:26,028 --> 00:27:26,904
She has never

388
00:27:28,406 --> 00:27:29,990
called me with this.

389
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,120
She is dead.

390
00:27:34,203 --> 00:27:37,373
The egg that you nurtured
with great care hatched

391
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:39,667
into an atrocious bird of prey.

392
00:27:41,168 --> 00:27:45,131
And it gravely wounded you before it died.

393
00:27:45,214 --> 00:27:46,215
So please

394
00:27:47,258 --> 00:27:48,634
destroy it.

395
00:27:50,094 --> 00:27:51,720
The reason why I still have this is

396
00:27:53,514 --> 00:27:55,474
so that I will know
that she really is dead.

397
00:27:57,685 --> 00:27:59,895
I can only believe
that she will never come back

398
00:28:01,731 --> 00:28:03,441
if I can see it with my own eyes.

399
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:06,819
Because…

400
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,322
I did not witness her death.

401
00:28:21,792 --> 00:28:23,753
Who are they talking about?

402
00:28:24,628 --> 00:28:25,546
A bird egg?

403
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:37,308
I can finally sleep in peace
since the pain is gone.

404
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,733
Should I tell him
that I am no longer in pain?

405
00:28:46,317 --> 00:28:47,943
He could be worried about me.

406
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,472
He does not worry about me.

407
00:29:33,489 --> 00:29:34,365
Young Lady Bu-yeon.

408
00:29:35,115 --> 00:29:37,868
They are like family to Young Master Jang.

409
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:41,789
I am Jin Bu-yeon,
the eldest daughter of the Jin family.

410
00:29:42,706 --> 00:29:43,541
It is nice to meet you.

411
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:49,171
Is it really true
that you and Uk are married?

412
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:51,048
That is why she is here.

413
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:55,135
Since you are married,
let me congratulate you.

414
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:57,012
They are not married yet.

415
00:29:57,096 --> 00:29:59,014
We will have a formal wedding ceremony.

416
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:02,017
Until then, she is still
the eldest daughter of Jinyowon

417
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:04,478
and Young Master Jang's betrothed.

418
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:07,648
Seeing how you are still his betrothed,

419
00:30:07,731 --> 00:30:09,692
you must not be with child after all.

420
00:30:10,693 --> 00:30:11,861
I am sorry.

421
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:14,029
I lied to prevent a fight from occurring.

422
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:15,906
You are very daring.

423
00:30:18,993 --> 00:30:22,246
Have I ever treated you before?

424
00:30:22,746 --> 00:30:23,914
You seem familiar.

425
00:30:23,998 --> 00:30:25,249
I doubt it.

426
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:29,461
I was treated
by the best physician in Daeho Fortress.

427
00:30:29,545 --> 00:30:31,422
I am the best physician here.

428
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:33,507
Who else could it be? Tell me their name.

429
00:30:33,591 --> 00:30:36,051
Master Heo, please stop.

430
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:38,095
She never left Jinyowon.

431
00:30:38,762 --> 00:30:41,223
From what I heard,
she suffers from memory loss.

432
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:43,976
Memory loss?

433
00:30:45,436 --> 00:30:48,314
I was seriously ill,
and I have no recollection of the past.

434
00:30:48,397 --> 00:30:49,440
However,

435
00:30:49,523 --> 00:30:53,027
I still have the ability to see energy
as I did as a child.

436
00:30:55,362 --> 00:30:58,032
I see some impressive energy
within you two.

437
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:03,203
You are of the few mages
with exceptionally strong powers.

438
00:31:03,287 --> 00:31:06,040
Anyone could sense that.

439
00:31:06,874 --> 00:31:08,125
As for you,

440
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:10,502
your energy may not be impressive.

441
00:31:11,128 --> 00:31:13,213
But it is pure and bright.

442
00:31:13,297 --> 00:31:15,758
Anyone can see
that Dang-gu has a good personality.

443
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:18,302
That cannot be considered a special power.

444
00:31:18,385 --> 00:31:20,554
You have a similar energy
to my sister, Cho-yeon.

445
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:22,598
They are both pure and light.

446
00:31:23,474 --> 00:31:26,018
I believe Cho-yeon has told you
about me, right?

447
00:31:27,561 --> 00:31:30,022
Are you seeing Cho-yeon again?

448
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,399
-No.
-No.

449
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,736
-We just met to discuss Bu-yeon.
-Dang-gu.

450
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:37,154
-Did you meet her?
-Pardon?

451
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,906
Yes.

452
00:31:38,989 --> 00:31:43,410
And I have been sensing
two people's energy back there.

453
00:31:43,494 --> 00:31:45,329
Do not be absurd.

454
00:31:45,412 --> 00:31:47,957
Come out if you are back there!

455
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:58,550
Young Lady Heo.

456
00:31:58,634 --> 00:31:59,969
What are you doing there?

457
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:14,483
Then what did you see in Uk?

458
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:16,944
He had the energy of the sky.

459
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:18,529
That is right.

460
00:32:19,363 --> 00:32:22,282
Uk had died and was only revived

461
00:32:22,992 --> 00:32:24,159
thanks to that energy.

462
00:32:27,121 --> 00:32:28,288
I heard.

463
00:32:29,331 --> 00:32:31,792
Since I can see his energy,

464
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:34,128
I promise to stay by his side
and protect him.

465
00:32:38,507 --> 00:32:40,968
What do you think about her?

466
00:32:41,051 --> 00:32:44,346
I do believe that she is a priestess
with unique powers.

467
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:47,307
I believe she got married
to our young master

468
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:48,892
to avoid becoming an heiress.

469
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,479
And our young master

470
00:32:53,814 --> 00:32:55,733
wants to get married for my sake.

471
00:32:57,067 --> 00:32:58,777
For your sake?

472
00:32:58,861 --> 00:33:01,238
He said I do not need
to worry about him anymore.

473
00:33:01,321 --> 00:33:03,949
He is encouraging me to get married.

474
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:09,371
You understood that, right?

475
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:19,506
I am always prepared
to welcome you with open arms.

476
00:33:29,183 --> 00:33:33,020
But your heart still seems to be troubled.

477
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,898
You do not need to rush.

478
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,817
I will not pull you toward me
if you are not ready.

479
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:43,489
But your heart is racing, my lord.

480
00:33:43,572 --> 00:33:45,324
Despite what I just said,

481
00:33:46,033 --> 00:33:50,370
How can I possibly hide
even my longing for you?

482
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:01,006
I…

483
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:03,342
have desires too.

484
00:34:12,392 --> 00:34:16,897
Master Heo does not seem
to like Young Lady Bu-yeon very much.

485
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,899
He was disapproving
and said she looked familiar.

486
00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:22,528
To be honest,
she seemed familiar to me as well.

487
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:24,780
I believe I have seen her before.

488
00:34:25,572 --> 00:34:26,698
How fascinating.

489
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:29,368
You recognized it at first glance.

490
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:32,329
Right? I have seen her before.

491
00:34:32,412 --> 00:34:33,247
That is right.

492
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:35,707
That dress belonged to Madam Do-hwa.

493
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:39,419
She often wore it before she got married.

494
00:34:39,503 --> 00:34:40,462
That is right.

495
00:34:41,588 --> 00:34:43,882
No wonder she seemed familiar.

496
00:34:43,966 --> 00:34:46,677
After seeing Do-hwa in that dress,

497
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,512
I wrote a poem for her.

498
00:34:56,645 --> 00:34:58,438
They do say
that first love is unforgettable.

499
00:34:58,522 --> 00:35:00,149
Even a slow-witted person like you

500
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:02,067
recognized her dress at first glance.

501
00:35:03,152 --> 00:35:05,112
-Your heart must have fluttered.
-That is not true.

502
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,867
This heart is racing right now
because of you.

503
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,909
Forget it.

504
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:19,001
Listen carefully.

505
00:35:20,169 --> 00:35:22,171
Can you not hear my heart?

506
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:26,717
I know.

507
00:35:27,968 --> 00:35:29,303
I was just joking.

508
00:35:29,887 --> 00:35:30,929
You can let me go.

509
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,894
I am finally embracing you,

510
00:35:37,728 --> 00:35:39,646
so how could
I possibly let go that easily?

511
00:35:56,038 --> 00:35:57,623
You do not need to walk me home.

512
00:35:58,207 --> 00:36:00,000
I may have lost my memory,
but I am not stupid.

513
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,669
Please do not misunderstand.

514
00:36:02,753 --> 00:36:05,047
She only said it out of concern for you.

515
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,591
She has a hard time believing
that you are married to Uk.

516
00:36:07,674 --> 00:36:09,968
To be honest,
I find it hard to believe as well.

517
00:36:11,053 --> 00:36:13,513
She asked me to check on you.

518
00:36:13,597 --> 00:36:15,390
She could not defend me

519
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:17,559
out of fear of our mother.

520
00:36:18,602 --> 00:36:20,187
But she is pure and kindhearted.

521
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,651
Has your wound
from the tracking thread healed?

522
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:29,112
She is glad that it will not hurt anymore.

523
00:36:29,196 --> 00:36:33,283
Did Cho-yeon hide the thread somewhere?

524
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:35,202
Without my mother's knowing?

525
00:36:37,955 --> 00:36:39,623
So that is why it stopped hurting.

526
00:36:39,706 --> 00:36:40,540
Pardon?

527
00:36:42,084 --> 00:36:45,629
You must not know
about last night's incident.

528
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,839
What do you mean?

529
00:36:47,923 --> 00:36:49,258
The thread is gone.

530
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:53,512
Uk broke into Jinyowon last night
and destroyed it.

531
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:00,269
Jinyowon was in chaos

532
00:37:01,228 --> 00:37:03,480
because of him.

533
00:37:03,563 --> 00:37:05,899
Were you really not aware of it?

534
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:07,859
I was not.

535
00:37:08,986 --> 00:37:09,820
He just told me…

536
00:37:12,406 --> 00:37:13,490
to endure the pain.

537
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:34,052
Uk spends most of the day
in the Dark Forest,

538
00:37:34,136 --> 00:37:38,598
which gets its name
from the dense cypress trees.

539
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,564
You will see stone towers
deep in the forest.

540
00:37:45,647 --> 00:37:49,026
Every time he kills a soul shifter,
he builds one.

541
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,278
It is like a graveyard.

542
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:56,158
People are too scared
to even go near them.

543
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,786
He seems to prefer that

544
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:01,830
as he is often there.

545
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:31,234
I was told he would be here.

546
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:32,527
But he is not.

547
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:36,114
Are these the soul shifters' graves?

548
00:38:49,252 --> 00:38:50,462
One of the graves

549
00:38:51,755 --> 00:38:53,048
belongs to Naksu.

550
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,802
She will end up finding it.

551
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,019
You must have killed
the infamous soul shifter as well.

552
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:08,397
She died.

553
00:39:09,272 --> 00:39:11,858
That soul shifter's grave

554
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:14,945
must be here as well.

555
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:22,244
-They are bird's eggs.
-We can have one each.

556
00:39:23,912 --> 00:39:25,789
I pick red. You can have the blue one.

557
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:37,968
I did not even touch the tower.

558
00:39:39,261 --> 00:39:40,720
But why did it collapse?

559
00:40:08,957 --> 00:40:11,835
This is not just any stone.

560
00:40:18,175 --> 00:40:20,343
I saw this stone in my memory back there.

561
00:40:21,011 --> 00:40:22,512
Did I see it in Jinyowon?

562
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:24,848
Did I see it as a child?

563
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:33,982
Who could she be?

564
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:37,235
Jin Bu-yeon is Mu-deok,
and Mu-deok is already dead.

565
00:40:44,618 --> 00:40:46,244
If this came from Jinyowon,

566
00:40:47,204 --> 00:40:48,997
should I ask Cho-yeon about it?

567
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:00,467
Hey! Stop right there!

568
00:41:03,386 --> 00:41:04,429
Stop!

569
00:41:04,513 --> 00:41:06,264
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

570
00:41:06,348 --> 00:41:07,641
Gosh.

571
00:41:08,391 --> 00:41:11,186
-I am sorry.
-Watch where you are going.

572
00:41:11,853 --> 00:41:12,896
I am sorry.

573
00:41:21,404 --> 00:41:23,698
Lure her toward Cheonbugwan's back door.

574
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:25,617
Yeom-su will be waiting there.

575
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,701
Yes, my lady.

576
00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:30,497
Once So-i lures Jin Bu-yeon,
I will bring her here.

577
00:41:37,921 --> 00:41:40,882
Once I read her mind
with this soul incense,

578
00:41:41,883 --> 00:41:46,096
I will know for sure
if she really is Jin Bu-yeon.

579
00:42:05,198 --> 00:42:06,157
That is strange.

580
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,952
The stone's energy
is in the other direction.

581
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:29,389
How did she know to follow me here?

582
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:09,095
Seeing how you are hiding,
you must know that I was tailing you.

583
00:43:21,274 --> 00:43:23,193
You must be wondering
how I knew to follow you.

584
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,779
I can see energy.

585
00:43:26,946 --> 00:43:28,865
I can see yours even when you are hiding.

586
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:31,451
And I can see this stone's energy too.

587
00:43:53,807 --> 00:43:54,683
I sense bad energy.

588
00:43:56,059 --> 00:43:58,061
I should not inhale this.

589
00:44:00,647 --> 00:44:01,981
She can see energy?

590
00:44:03,066 --> 00:44:05,318
That is Jin Bu-yeon's divine power.

591
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:08,613
I should wait until she falls unconscious,

592
00:44:09,322 --> 00:44:11,116
then take her to Cheonbugwan.

593
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:13,910
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

594
00:44:17,455 --> 00:44:18,790
I am here to see the owner.

595
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:22,252
Go to the last room on that side.

596
00:44:35,515 --> 00:44:37,058
There you are, Madam.

597
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:38,935
Someone is looking for you.

598
00:45:09,299 --> 00:45:10,216
I smell soporifics.

599
00:45:29,319 --> 00:45:30,445
Jin Bu-yeon?

600
00:45:34,782 --> 00:45:36,034
Why are you here?

601
00:45:36,117 --> 00:45:39,078
I was chasing a pickpocket.

602
00:45:39,162 --> 00:45:40,622
Why are you here?

603
00:45:41,414 --> 00:45:42,582
I am here to see someone.

604
00:45:47,253 --> 00:45:48,254
Darn it.

605
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:56,888
Darn it.

606
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:00,808
You can hold onto me.

607
00:46:02,185 --> 00:46:04,062
Then you will get wet too.

608
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,482
-That is fine.
-Thank you.

609
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:23,831
Hold on.

610
00:46:32,882 --> 00:46:35,301
I stayed underwater
after smelling the soporifics.

611
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,347
I almost drowned.

612
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:52,277
Cover yourself.

613
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,778
But I am not cold.

614
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:00,743
I must have been mortifying to look at.

615
00:47:05,415 --> 00:47:06,958
Thank you once again.

616
00:47:10,253 --> 00:47:12,046
Should I help you catch the thief?

617
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,756
I retrieved my property.

618
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,009
I do not want to cause a scene,
so I will leave.

619
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:19,178
Go on and meet whomever you came here for.

620
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:22,140
It is not urgent, so let me walk with you.

621
00:47:23,016 --> 00:47:25,602
This is a dangerous neighborhood
to walk alone in.

622
00:47:30,356 --> 00:47:31,858
This is Gaema Village.

623
00:47:32,817 --> 00:47:35,320
Many fortune-telling shamans live here.

624
00:47:35,403 --> 00:47:38,906
There are also those who practice sorcery.

625
00:47:40,116 --> 00:47:43,036
That must be
why it feels so dark and cold here.

626
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,205
You should ask Uk to accompany you
to dangerous places like this.

627
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,583
Do you know Jang Uk--

628
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:50,668
I mean, do you know my husband?

629
00:47:52,587 --> 00:47:54,672
Dang-gu, Uk, and I are childhood friends.

630
00:47:54,756 --> 00:47:56,966
-I see.
-For the past three years,

631
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:59,510
I was in Seoho Fortress, my hometown,
but I recently returned.

632
00:47:59,594 --> 00:48:01,095
I have already met Dang-gu.

633
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:03,431
He had bright energy.

634
00:48:05,475 --> 00:48:06,809
As for you…

635
00:48:16,778 --> 00:48:19,530
I envy you for having childhood friends.

636
00:48:21,783 --> 00:48:23,034
By the way,

637
00:48:24,911 --> 00:48:27,455
I think we have been circling
the same path.

638
00:48:31,626 --> 00:48:33,920
I lose my sense of direction
when I am flustered.

639
00:48:34,003 --> 00:48:35,046
I apologize.

640
00:48:38,007 --> 00:48:39,384
I think it is that way.

641
00:48:42,595 --> 00:48:43,763
We already went down that path.

642
00:48:45,973 --> 00:48:47,058
Let us go that way.

643
00:48:50,144 --> 00:48:52,480
I have now become familiar
with these paths.

644
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:53,564
So follow me.

645
00:49:00,697 --> 00:49:02,573
It is my fault that we went in circles.

646
00:49:02,657 --> 00:49:03,491
I am sorry.

647
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:04,867
That is fine.

648
00:49:05,702 --> 00:49:07,412
There is nothing wrong
with being airheaded

649
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,415
-as long as you are handsome.
-I was simply flustered.

650
00:49:10,498 --> 00:49:11,999
I am not airheaded.

651
00:49:12,834 --> 00:49:13,668
All right.

652
00:49:14,669 --> 00:49:16,045
I do not think you understand.

653
00:49:19,173 --> 00:49:21,926
I was always the top pupil
during my training in Jeongjingak.

654
00:49:22,009 --> 00:49:23,553
I have mastered all the books,

655
00:49:23,636 --> 00:49:25,763
so people always ask me for help.

656
00:49:26,347 --> 00:49:27,181
That is who I am.

657
00:49:28,182 --> 00:49:29,434
I see.

658
00:49:30,852 --> 00:49:31,853
So you are smart?

659
00:49:33,771 --> 00:49:34,939
That is a pity.

660
00:49:38,484 --> 00:49:39,694
As you can see,

661
00:49:40,987 --> 00:49:42,488
my beauty is unmatched.

662
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:45,450
But I am not the brightest.

663
00:49:47,869 --> 00:49:51,247
You also seemed like a fool
despite your good looks.

664
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:52,665
So I felt a sense of kinship.

665
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:55,793
It is a shame that you are smart.

666
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,546
In that case,

667
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,592
I can deem myself a fool
so we can be two foolish friends.

668
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:05,595
Thank you.

669
00:50:10,516 --> 00:50:12,518
I am asking because I do not know.

670
00:50:13,936 --> 00:50:16,606
Was there a soul shifter
who could see despite having been blind?

671
00:50:18,107 --> 00:50:19,692
She had blue marks in her eyes,

672
00:50:19,776 --> 00:50:21,819
and Uk saw them from up close.

673
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:24,113
Do you know who she was?

674
00:50:26,032 --> 00:50:27,950
I believe you are talking about Naksu.

675
00:50:28,034 --> 00:50:29,452
Naksu?

676
00:50:30,703 --> 00:50:31,871
I heard she died.

677
00:50:33,122 --> 00:50:33,956
Correct.

678
00:50:34,957 --> 00:50:36,918
And Uk died by her hands as well.

679
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:38,544
I see.

680
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,883
She was his enemy.

681
00:50:48,137 --> 00:50:49,847
You must not have known about this.

682
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:52,308
I did not.

683
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:57,939
I should be careful not to mention
her name in front of him.

684
00:51:02,735 --> 00:51:04,111
Thank you for letting me know.

685
00:51:23,756 --> 00:51:25,591
She could see energy?

686
00:51:27,426 --> 00:51:29,303
Then she really is Jin Bu-yeon.

687
00:51:30,429 --> 00:51:31,264
Did you not say

688
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:34,642
that you threw her into a lake
when she was a girl?

689
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:37,103
Are you worried
that people will find out about that?

690
00:51:39,105 --> 00:51:40,940
It was her dead father who threw her in.

691
00:51:42,608 --> 00:51:45,486
That blind girl did not know
that I was there as well.

692
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:48,197
Thanks to Jin U-tak
being murdered by Naksu,

693
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:50,783
everything was swept under the rug.

694
00:51:50,867 --> 00:51:52,994
And that is why you are still alive.

695
00:51:55,121 --> 00:51:57,373
You were a swindler who killed many.

696
00:51:57,456 --> 00:52:01,502
You even put a blood parasite inside you
and pretended to be their fake child.

697
00:52:01,586 --> 00:52:03,629
And yet, I turned you

698
00:52:03,713 --> 00:52:07,216
into an innocent victim
who was controlled by Jin U-tak.

699
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,261
That is right.

700
00:52:11,178 --> 00:52:12,722
I am forever indebted to you.

701
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:16,809
I know you do not mean that.

702
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:19,645
But as long as
that parasite lives within you,

703
00:52:19,729 --> 00:52:21,606
you will never be able to leave me.

704
00:52:22,148 --> 00:52:23,691
Because without my medicine,

705
00:52:24,483 --> 00:52:27,904
you will writhe in pain
as your insides melt, and you will die.

706
00:52:28,696 --> 00:52:32,116
Anyway, both of us
and my secret organization

707
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:35,620
were able to get out alive
thanks to Naksu.

708
00:52:35,703 --> 00:52:38,456
However, I cannot believe
how much she resembles her.

709
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:41,792
What do you mean?

710
00:52:41,876 --> 00:52:44,879
Bu-yeon is the spitting image of Naksu.

711
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:47,465
That was why I was wary of her.

712
00:52:48,174 --> 00:52:51,260
Seeing how that girl
does indeed have divine powers,

713
00:52:51,886 --> 00:52:55,556
she must not be a fake daughter
like you were.

714
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,807
So that woman truly is…

715
00:52:58,809 --> 00:52:59,977
Jin Bu-yeon.

716
00:53:09,362 --> 00:53:10,404
I heard there was a drought.

717
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:13,032
But these flowers are still fresh.

718
00:53:13,115 --> 00:53:15,159
I remembered the flowers you used to love.

719
00:53:15,242 --> 00:53:17,411
I searched throughout Daeho Fortress
to find them.

720
00:53:17,495 --> 00:53:19,455
They are full of energy
since Lake Gyeongcheondaeho's water

721
00:53:19,538 --> 00:53:20,998
flows within them.

722
00:53:30,216 --> 00:53:31,759
My former body

723
00:53:32,927 --> 00:53:34,428
was just like this flower.

724
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:36,472
The flower is full of moisture.

725
00:53:36,555 --> 00:53:38,683
It is very fresh and beautiful.

726
00:53:38,766 --> 00:53:41,644
The flowers outside
have shriveled up due to lack of energy.

727
00:53:41,727 --> 00:53:43,354
They do not emit a scent either.

728
00:53:43,437 --> 00:53:46,440
Shriveled up due to lack of energy?

729
00:53:48,234 --> 00:53:49,652
They are just like me.

730
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,619
All you have to do is water these flowers

731
00:53:58,703 --> 00:54:00,871
to make them look fresh!

732
00:54:01,956 --> 00:54:05,001
But no matter how much energy I consume,

733
00:54:05,084 --> 00:54:07,628
I am still shriveling up!

734
00:54:10,673 --> 00:54:12,133
You want me to petrify and die

735
00:54:13,175 --> 00:54:15,219
in this body that is not mine.

736
00:54:16,137 --> 00:54:19,098
How dare you mock me?

737
00:54:22,435 --> 00:54:25,104
I am sorry, Your Highness!
Please spare me!

738
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:26,856
You are

739
00:54:26,939 --> 00:54:29,483
young and fresh.

740
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:38,242
Would you like to switch bodies with me?

741
00:54:40,411 --> 00:54:43,080
Why would you want
to switch bodies with a mere court lady?

742
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:46,333
You are our noble Queen.

743
00:54:56,719 --> 00:54:59,263
He is a close cousin of mine
from Seoho Fortress.

744
00:55:00,306 --> 00:55:01,974
He was to marry into the Jin family.

745
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:06,353
I heard about the Unanimous Assembly.

746
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:09,398
So Jang Uk became
Jin Ho-gyeong's son-in-law?

747
00:55:09,482 --> 00:55:10,566
Because of that,

748
00:55:11,484 --> 00:55:14,236
it has become more difficult
to take Jinyowon

749
00:55:15,237 --> 00:55:16,572
from the Jin family.

750
00:55:18,657 --> 00:55:20,034
Then what about the rite for the lake?

751
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,162
You said we needed Jinyowon's relic

752
00:55:23,245 --> 00:55:25,456
to get the ice stone from the sky.

753
00:55:28,751 --> 00:55:33,297
How will we open Jinyowon's doors
if that man is there?

754
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,300
We will have to remove
the priestess from his side.

755
00:55:36,383 --> 00:55:37,593
But they are married.

756
00:55:37,676 --> 00:55:39,178
Who will acknowledge that

757
00:55:39,261 --> 00:55:40,763
when they did not even have a wedding?

758
00:55:40,846 --> 00:55:42,098
In addition,

759
00:55:42,181 --> 00:55:45,684
everyone in Daeho knows
that he was betrothed to someone else.

760
00:55:50,272 --> 00:55:51,107
Naksu?

761
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:53,734
The third anniversary of her death
is around the corner.

762
00:55:53,818 --> 00:55:56,320
I shall summon Naksu's soul once again

763
00:55:56,403 --> 00:55:58,906
to distract Jang Uk.

764
00:56:00,241 --> 00:56:01,158
After that,

765
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,540
Jin Bu-yeon will get married
to her former betrothed.

766
00:56:16,257 --> 00:56:18,592
None of the mages
at the Unanimous Assembly

767
00:56:18,676 --> 00:56:21,011
could stop Jang Uk
from leaving with that priestess.

768
00:56:21,095 --> 00:56:23,931
Is he truly more powerful
than all the mages there?

769
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:26,267
They let him go
because he said they were married.

770
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:27,184
Goodness.

771
00:56:27,935 --> 00:56:29,603
They always have their excuses.

772
00:56:30,396 --> 00:56:32,815
I heard that Jin Bu-yeon
has some great divine powers.

773
00:56:32,898 --> 00:56:34,733
Did he marry her
because he needed those powers?

774
00:56:34,817 --> 00:56:37,027
Her portrait was posted throughout Daeho.

775
00:56:37,111 --> 00:56:38,404
Apparently, she is a great beauty.

776
00:56:39,113 --> 00:56:40,114
Because of her looks?

777
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:42,199
I know Jang Uk pretty well.

778
00:56:42,283 --> 00:56:44,034
He would only seduce a woman to use her,

779
00:56:44,118 --> 00:56:45,661
not because he fell for her looks.

780
00:57:00,634 --> 00:57:01,760
Did they fight?

781
00:57:01,844 --> 00:57:03,804
Something must have happened

782
00:57:03,888 --> 00:57:05,431
between the Queen and her court ladies.

783
00:57:07,558 --> 00:57:09,351
Since His Majesty is avoiding her,

784
00:57:09,435 --> 00:57:12,021
she is venting her anger at the innocent.

785
00:57:12,104 --> 00:57:14,398
To be honest, there is a lot of gossip

786
00:57:14,482 --> 00:57:17,318
about the powder
the Queen has given to the concubines.

787
00:57:18,027 --> 00:57:18,861
Powder…

788
00:57:19,528 --> 00:57:21,614
as in cosmetics? Why?

789
00:57:21,697 --> 00:57:23,782
They think it is cursed

790
00:57:23,866 --> 00:57:26,535
with sorcery that dries out their skin.

791
00:57:30,706 --> 00:57:32,458
Go and retrieve all that powder

792
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,461
and find out where the Queen got it from.

793
00:57:36,462 --> 00:57:37,630
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

794
00:57:44,637 --> 00:57:46,514
Look at these pretty shoes.

795
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:48,807
You are so beautiful.
Please have a look around.

796
00:57:48,891 --> 00:57:51,018
Here. They suit you.

797
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:53,103
I bet they will look great on you.

798
00:57:53,687 --> 00:57:56,148
You are pretty.
Gosh, then come again next time.

799
00:58:00,694 --> 00:58:01,779
That looks delicious.

800
00:58:11,705 --> 00:58:12,873
I apologize.

801
00:58:24,635 --> 00:58:26,637
Is there something you are looking for?

802
00:58:28,764 --> 00:58:31,141
I heard you sold powder
to the royal palace.

803
00:58:31,225 --> 00:58:32,351
Powder?

804
00:58:37,147 --> 00:58:38,357
I am a eunuch.

805
00:58:39,775 --> 00:58:41,902
She must have sent you.

806
00:58:42,444 --> 00:58:43,988
This way, please.

807
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:56,375
Goodness. Are you interested in the rouge?

808
00:58:56,959 --> 00:58:59,795
Try it on yourself.
It has a beautiful color.

809
00:58:59,878 --> 00:59:02,131
There is no need.
I am just looking at them.

810
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:05,551
This is not just any rouge.

811
00:59:05,634 --> 00:59:07,845
This rouge has the power

812
00:59:07,928 --> 00:59:11,390
to sway the men around you.

813
00:59:13,809 --> 00:59:14,643
Is that true?

814
00:59:15,477 --> 00:59:17,646
Do you have a lover
that you want to attract?

815
00:59:19,815 --> 00:59:21,191
I have a husband.

816
00:59:29,158 --> 00:59:31,410
This rouge is quite distinct.

817
00:59:31,493 --> 00:59:34,872
All of our products are one of a kind.

818
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:36,540
Look.

819
00:59:36,624 --> 00:59:38,834
That eunuch was sent
from the royal palace.

820
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:43,172
Even the royal palace buys our products.

821
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:45,257
I guess you did not know.

822
00:59:45,341 --> 00:59:46,800
I sense ominous energy.

823
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,765
The energy here is similar
to that of Gaema Village.

824
00:59:54,475 --> 00:59:56,435
Are you also a shaman from there?

825
00:59:56,518 --> 00:59:58,937
Many shamans buy our products.

826
00:59:59,813 --> 01:00:00,689
I do not need them.

827
01:00:05,444 --> 01:00:07,488
Are you selling this turtle too?

828
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:10,783
It is not for sale.
It is an ingredient used for our products.

829
01:00:10,866 --> 01:00:12,034
An ingredient?

830
01:00:12,117 --> 01:00:15,162
There are many uses for its shell.

831
01:00:15,245 --> 01:00:18,624
It is quite expensive and rare to find.
You should not touch it.

832
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:21,210
-Ok-sim!
-Coming.

833
01:00:21,293 --> 01:00:23,796
An ingredient? You poor thing.

834
01:00:27,341 --> 01:00:30,260
Eunuch, do you have some money?

835
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:34,723
Me?

836
01:00:35,432 --> 01:00:38,060
-Were you referring to me?
-If you do, buy this turtle.

837
01:00:38,977 --> 01:00:40,562
It has good energy.

838
01:00:40,646 --> 01:00:42,106
It will bring you luck.

839
01:00:43,982 --> 01:00:46,110
Do shamans read
turtles' physiognomy as well?

840
01:00:46,193 --> 01:00:47,486
Why would I take it with me?

841
01:00:48,404 --> 01:00:51,198
It will be killed if it stays here.
That would be a pity.

842
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:53,659
Forget it. You should purchase it, not me.

843
01:00:53,742 --> 01:00:55,369
I have no money right now.

844
01:00:55,452 --> 01:00:58,914
And I am living at someone else's place,
so I cannot be that shameless.

845
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:01,917
Look.

846
01:01:02,543 --> 01:01:06,004
It is stretching its neck to look at you.
Will you just let it die?

847
01:01:10,843 --> 01:01:12,594
All turtles look like that.

848
01:01:12,678 --> 01:01:14,930
It is not doing that just to look at me.

849
01:01:16,682 --> 01:01:17,850
Raise it yourself.

850
01:01:17,933 --> 01:01:18,767
Since…

851
01:01:19,435 --> 01:01:21,520
you cannot have any children as a eunuch.

852
01:01:22,604 --> 01:01:24,148
It will be worth it.

853
01:01:24,815 --> 01:01:26,024
Children?

854
01:01:28,026 --> 01:01:29,153
Hey, shaman.

855
01:01:29,236 --> 01:01:31,697
You have poor skills,
and that is why you make no money.

856
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,949
Do I look like someone
who would raise a turtle as his own?

857
01:01:34,533 --> 01:01:37,202
I cannot see one's physiognomy,
but I can see their energy.

858
01:01:37,286 --> 01:01:39,246
You may talk coldly,

859
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:43,083
but your warm heart wants
to save this turtle.

860
01:01:46,962 --> 01:01:48,505
You have rare energy.

861
01:01:49,423 --> 01:01:50,549
It must be because you live at the palace.

862
01:01:52,718 --> 01:01:54,678
That is right. I am…

863
01:01:56,638 --> 01:01:57,806
Go from the royal palace.

864
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,231
Then, Eunuch Go,
please take good care of the turtle.

865
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:16,992
I pretty much revealed to her

866
01:02:17,075 --> 01:02:18,994
that I was a part of the royal family.

867
01:02:20,078 --> 01:02:21,663
How could she not know that?

868
01:02:21,747 --> 01:02:23,207
Is she a fool?

869
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:28,420
Your Royal Highness.

870
01:02:29,129 --> 01:02:30,714
I found the powder.

871
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:39,014
The well suddenly dried up
in a matter of days.

872
01:02:39,097 --> 01:02:41,767
We asked Cheonbugwan to look into it,

873
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:43,936
but they have not done anything so far.

874
01:02:44,019 --> 01:02:45,896
The drought may have been ongoing,

875
01:02:45,979 --> 01:02:48,398
but a well could not
have dried up so quickly.

876
01:02:51,568 --> 01:02:53,153
Why did you bring him here?

877
01:02:53,987 --> 01:02:56,323
You should have brought
a powerful mage instead.

878
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:59,451
He said he would look into it
if I paid for his food.

879
01:02:59,535 --> 01:03:01,119
-Who knew he would be incompetent?
-Goodness.

880
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:26,353
Goodness. The well is filling up again!

881
01:03:26,436 --> 01:03:27,980
What a relief!

882
01:03:28,063 --> 01:03:30,065
Goodness! Thank you!

883
01:03:30,148 --> 01:03:31,233
He is incredible.

884
01:03:31,316 --> 01:03:34,236
I have found five of these
in every well so far.

885
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:36,488
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

886
01:03:36,572 --> 01:03:38,365
Who in the world is doing this?

887
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:40,158
This is a relief.

888
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:44,913
Noodles and celebrations go hand in hand.

889
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:49,251
You fool.

890
01:03:49,334 --> 01:03:51,461
Had you had a proper wedding,

891
01:03:51,545 --> 01:03:54,882
I would have served this dish
to everyone in Songrim.

892
01:04:12,107 --> 01:04:14,651
No. You better not
serve this dish to anyone.

893
01:04:14,735 --> 01:04:16,987
If you serve this on your wedding day
with Maidservant Kim,

894
01:04:18,071 --> 01:04:18,906
I will be angry.

895
01:04:22,326 --> 01:04:23,160
I heard from her.

896
01:04:27,289 --> 01:04:28,957
Did you think marrying her off to me

897
01:04:30,334 --> 01:04:31,209
would help you

898
01:04:32,294 --> 01:04:34,671
die in peace?

899
01:04:39,718 --> 01:04:42,179
Your bride does not
seem to know about this.

900
01:04:42,262 --> 01:04:43,847
Have you not told her yet?

901
01:04:43,931 --> 01:04:45,682
She lacks her divine powers as of now.

902
01:04:46,308 --> 01:04:49,478
She needs to regain her memory to do that.

903
01:04:49,561 --> 01:04:50,520
I already confirmed it.

904
01:04:52,189 --> 01:04:53,899
Then it will not happen anytime soon.

905
01:04:56,401 --> 01:04:57,235
Eat up.

906
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:03,992
These noodles will be the death of me.

907
01:05:04,076 --> 01:05:07,537
Is that so?
I followed the recipe used in the kitchen.

908
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:12,542
Apparently, Mu-deok used
to enjoy making those noodles.

909
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,214
I avoided mentioning
her name all this time

910
01:05:17,297 --> 01:05:19,424
because I did not want to hurt you.

911
01:05:20,926 --> 01:05:21,760
However,

912
01:05:22,844 --> 01:05:25,097
I think it failed instead.

913
01:05:29,601 --> 01:05:30,435
You did not visit

914
01:05:31,937 --> 01:05:34,147
the cliff where she met her demise,
did you?

915
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:38,402
Then why did you raise
that stone tower in the mountain?

916
01:05:38,485 --> 01:05:40,320
Were you not mourning her death?

917
01:05:40,404 --> 01:05:42,239
Were you praying she would come back?

918
01:05:47,452 --> 01:05:48,912
Sang-ho was the one…

919
01:05:50,914 --> 01:05:53,792
who witnessed her getting petrified

920
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:56,503
and saw her fall
into Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

921
01:05:58,046 --> 01:05:59,548
Let him recount the incident,

922
01:06:00,632 --> 01:06:01,675
see for yourself,

923
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:05,012
and then mourn for her.

924
01:06:05,887 --> 01:06:09,349
And if you still want to die after that…

925
01:06:14,021 --> 01:06:14,980
come back here.

926
01:06:16,898 --> 01:06:18,275
I will make you

927
01:06:19,735 --> 01:06:21,111
another dish.

928
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:16,333
He is not coming home.

929
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:26,718
Jang Uk.

930
01:07:27,677 --> 01:07:29,096
Goodness.

931
01:07:30,222 --> 01:07:32,432
Young Master Jang is often away

932
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:34,434
for days on end
without telling us in advance.

933
01:07:35,227 --> 01:07:37,062
Do not wait for him and just go to bed.

934
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:00,669
He is still not home.

935
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:02,420
When is he coming?

936
01:08:03,964 --> 01:08:04,798
Gosh.

937
01:08:10,512 --> 01:08:13,056
I wanted to thank him
for destroying the tracking thread.

938
01:08:20,772 --> 01:08:22,983
He will be delighted to hear…

939
01:08:25,318 --> 01:08:26,736
that I regained another memory.

940
01:08:49,718 --> 01:08:52,470
Wait there. I will go to you soon.

941
01:08:52,971 --> 01:08:54,556
Make me another promise

942
01:08:55,765 --> 01:08:57,184
just like you said you would.

943
01:08:57,851 --> 01:09:01,104
I will keep you by my side forever.

944
01:09:01,188 --> 01:09:03,190
If you find yourself
in a life or death situation,

945
01:09:03,273 --> 01:09:05,275
give up on love and choose your life.

946
01:09:06,401 --> 01:09:07,736
That is an order from your master.

947
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,381
Are you done, my lady?

948
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:39,434
Why is he not coming home?

949
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,603
My lady.

950
01:09:42,187 --> 01:09:43,939
You have been summoned to the study.

951
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:45,482
Is that so?

952
01:09:47,525 --> 01:09:49,027
How many days has it been?

953
01:09:49,861 --> 01:09:52,614
It is not the young master.

954
01:09:58,954 --> 01:09:59,788
It is not him.

955
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:03,250
Young Lady Bu-yeon.

956
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:06,211
Young Master Jang is at Jeongjingak.

957
01:10:07,504 --> 01:10:09,547
I guess you did not know that.

958
01:10:10,131 --> 01:10:11,424
You must be worried.

959
01:10:11,508 --> 01:10:13,385
He has been staying there

960
01:10:13,468 --> 01:10:15,720
ever since you visited Songrim last time.

961
01:10:15,804 --> 01:10:18,223
That must mean you two have not met since.

962
01:10:18,306 --> 01:10:21,351
No one will be able to take care of him
since that place is empty.

963
01:10:21,935 --> 01:10:23,478
So why is he there all by himself?

964
01:10:23,561 --> 01:10:25,355
Maybe someone makes him
uncomfortable at home.

965
01:10:30,944 --> 01:10:32,112
Young Lady Bu-yeon.

966
01:10:32,195 --> 01:10:34,781
Let us bring some clothes for him.

967
01:10:34,864 --> 01:10:36,866
He is there because he feels comfortable.

968
01:10:37,492 --> 01:10:38,952
If you ever get to see him,

969
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:42,372
please let him know

970
01:10:43,915 --> 01:10:45,500
that I am doing well here.

971
01:10:57,345 --> 01:11:00,390
Please give me anything that he may need,

972
01:11:00,473 --> 01:11:01,850
and I will deliver it to him.

973
01:11:01,933 --> 01:11:04,728
There is no need for me
to give anything to you.

974
01:11:05,687 --> 01:11:07,939
After all, Young Lady Bu-yeon
is betrothed to him.

975
01:11:09,649 --> 01:11:10,900
You do not need to worry

976
01:11:10,984 --> 01:11:12,902
about him from now on.

977
01:11:16,031 --> 01:11:16,865
I understand.

978
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:23,246
Why is he not coming home?

979
01:11:24,998 --> 01:11:26,958
Could it really be because of me?

980
01:11:27,042 --> 01:11:28,543
Let us go, my dear husband.

981
01:11:28,626 --> 01:11:30,378
I was telling you
to take off that impractical robe.

982
01:11:30,462 --> 01:11:32,088
Why in the world…

983
01:11:32,172 --> 01:11:35,050
If you drink that,
it means we are officially married.

984
01:11:36,092 --> 01:11:37,552
I do not wish to go back.

985
01:11:37,635 --> 01:11:40,305
I like it here. And I like you too.

986
01:11:44,601 --> 01:11:46,978
He is uncomfortable
that I might throw myself at him.

987
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:50,357
Darn it. He would not
be happy to see me then.

988
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:53,360
This way, you can continue
regaining your memories and divine powers.

989
01:11:53,443 --> 01:11:54,944
I am glad I brought you here.

990
01:11:56,404 --> 01:11:58,448
He will be delighted if I tell him

991
01:11:59,157 --> 01:12:00,450
that I remembered something.

992
01:12:05,413 --> 01:12:06,247
Maidservant Kim.

993
01:12:07,999 --> 01:12:09,417
I must go see him.

994
01:12:10,502 --> 01:12:12,170
Please pack his things for me.

995
01:12:18,843 --> 01:12:19,677
Young Lady Heo.

996
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,805
Let me come with you.

997
01:12:22,972 --> 01:12:24,766
I miss him too much to just wait.

998
01:12:24,849 --> 01:12:26,810
He seems to be avoiding you.

999
01:12:26,893 --> 01:12:28,353
What if he does not welcome you?

1000
01:12:28,978 --> 01:12:31,064
I do not mind that.

1001
01:12:31,648 --> 01:12:35,610
I am simply going there
because I miss him.

1002
01:12:35,693 --> 01:12:39,030
And Sun-i, it seems like
you want him to feel that way about me.

1003
01:12:39,906 --> 01:12:40,740
Why is that?

1004
01:12:42,367 --> 01:12:43,993
Is that what your young lady wants?

1005
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:48,832
-She was the first to--
-There seems to be a misunderstanding.

1006
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:51,835
I am worried about you, not jealous.

1007
01:12:52,585 --> 01:12:56,256
I know he will not welcome either of us.

1008
01:12:58,758 --> 01:13:00,176
You think we are the same.

1009
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:02,137
Are you being humble or condescending?

1010
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:03,638
I am simply giving you advice.

1011
01:13:04,389 --> 01:13:06,057
But never mind if you do not get it.

1012
01:13:12,188 --> 01:13:14,482
What is that in your hand?

1013
01:13:17,444 --> 01:13:18,278
Do you recognize this?

1014
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:19,195
That is

1015
01:13:20,113 --> 01:13:21,406
a yin-and-yang jade.

1016
01:13:21,489 --> 01:13:22,407
A yin-and-yang jade?

1017
01:13:23,116 --> 01:13:25,535
There is a red one and a blue one.

1018
01:13:25,618 --> 01:13:27,954
They are drawn to each other's energy.

1019
01:13:29,497 --> 01:13:31,207
How is it that you have it?

1020
01:13:31,291 --> 01:13:32,208
I picked it up.

1021
01:13:33,501 --> 01:13:35,712
I kept it after the stone tower
of the jade's owner fell.

1022
01:13:36,296 --> 01:13:38,631
-But I will return it.
-What do you mean?

1023
01:13:38,715 --> 01:13:41,050
The owner of that blue jade is dead.

1024
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:43,720
The owner of that jade

1025
01:13:44,596 --> 01:13:46,931
is Naksu, the one who stabbed
Young Master Jang in the heart.

1026
01:13:47,015 --> 01:13:48,308
Naksu?

1027
01:13:50,018 --> 01:13:51,269
I have heard of her before.

1028
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:53,188
She was his enemy.

1029
01:13:55,315 --> 01:13:57,901
You really do not know anything.

1030
01:14:02,947 --> 01:14:05,241
Put energy into the jade and call for him.

1031
01:14:06,117 --> 01:14:07,494
Then you will understand

1032
01:14:07,577 --> 01:14:11,164
why no one believed
that you were his bride.

1033
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:13,750
See for yourself.

1034
01:14:47,367 --> 01:14:49,494
So you know nothing about him,
yet you followed him here?

1035
01:14:49,577 --> 01:14:52,163
I never thought he would even consider
getting married again.

1036
01:14:52,247 --> 01:14:56,209
Is it really true
that you and Uk are married?

1037
01:14:56,292 --> 01:14:57,752
That is why she is here.

1038
01:14:57,835 --> 01:15:00,296
She has a hard time believing
that you are married to Uk.

1039
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:02,715
To be honest,
I find it hard to believe as well.

1040
01:15:02,799 --> 01:15:04,592
You must not have known about this.

1041
01:15:04,676 --> 01:15:07,887
Then you will understand why no one
believed that you were his bride.

1042
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:09,013
See for yourself.

1043
01:15:16,104 --> 01:15:16,938
Young Master.

1044
01:15:17,772 --> 01:15:18,982
Did you just come home?

1045
01:15:19,065 --> 01:15:20,608
Yes, draw a bath for me.

1046
01:15:20,692 --> 01:15:22,277
What about Young Lady Bu-yeon?

1047
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:24,779
Did you not see her?

1048
01:15:25,363 --> 01:15:26,698
She went to see you,

1049
01:15:26,781 --> 01:15:28,992
so I hurriedly packed
some honey biscuits for her.

1050
01:15:30,994 --> 01:15:32,870
You must have missed each other.

1051
01:15:32,954 --> 01:15:36,457
She seemed to be worried
because she could not find you.

1052
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:49,429
She could be looking for you there.

1053
01:17:22,605 --> 01:17:24,315
I regained another memory,

1054
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:26,192
and now I am able to do this.

1055
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:29,696
Was it you who called me?

1056
01:17:31,197 --> 01:17:32,824
Yes, I heard they were a set.

1057
01:17:39,664 --> 01:17:40,957
I was the one who called for you.

1058
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:42,917
But you did not come…

1059
01:17:45,294 --> 01:17:46,295
for me, did you?

1060
01:17:50,383 --> 01:17:52,051
Yes, I frantically rushed over here.

1061
01:17:53,344 --> 01:17:54,971
You better have
a good explanation for this.

1062
01:17:55,054 --> 01:17:56,889
What if I shared some good news

1063
01:17:58,099 --> 01:17:59,058
with you?

1064
01:18:03,438 --> 01:18:05,064
I regained another memory.

1065
01:18:09,152 --> 01:18:10,695
You and I…

1066
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:15,366
have liked each other for a long time.

1067
01:19:00,077 --> 01:19:02,997
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

1068
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,501
People were massacred on a boat
crossing Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,

1069
01:19:06,584 --> 01:19:08,002
and they say it was Naksu's doing.

1070
01:19:08,085 --> 01:19:10,505
The soul shifter that appeared this time
is Naksu.

1071
01:19:10,588 --> 01:19:13,174
If you are so worried,
I will catch her myself.

1072
01:19:13,257 --> 01:19:15,593
How can he get rid of something
that does not exist?

1073
01:19:15,676 --> 01:19:19,013
That ridiculous rumor
could end up killing your daughter.

1074
01:19:19,096 --> 01:19:21,599
By any chance, are you not feeling well?

1075
01:19:21,682 --> 01:19:23,142
What is inside my body?

1076
01:19:23,226 --> 01:19:25,728
I would like to hold a banquet
outside the palace walls.

1077
01:19:25,812 --> 01:19:28,898
If Jin Bu-yeon gets attacked,
it will become Naksu's doing.

1078
01:19:28,981 --> 01:19:31,692
Then everything will become
Jang Uk's responsibility.

1079
01:19:33,736 --> 01:19:38,741
