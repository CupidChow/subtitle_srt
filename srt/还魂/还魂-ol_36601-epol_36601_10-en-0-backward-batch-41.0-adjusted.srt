1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,043
This room will be vacant
while our young master stays in Songrim.

2
00:00:02,126 --> 00:00:04,920
Clean up his books and clothes.

3
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:06,130
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

4
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:13,012
He had left home a dozen times
and returned every time.

5
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:16,056
You should wait a few days
in case he comes back again.

6
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,142
It is different this time.

7
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,854
He is a changed man.

8
00:00:23,147 --> 00:00:25,357
And he may bring home a wife soon.

9
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,610
That is why we need to clean up.

10
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:30,446
Is he getting engaged again?

11
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:34,700
If this one falls through yet again,
he will never be able to get married.

12
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:36,869
It is different this time.

13
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:41,832
Young Master Jang has a lady
he has deep feelings for.

14
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,460
Right, Mu-deok?

15
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,756
The bird egg that he mentioned.

16
00:00:49,757 --> 00:00:53,803
I believe it is that lady
I met in Songrim.

17
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:57,264
A bird egg on top of a tree.

18
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,892
She must be a sophisticated woman

19
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:02,269
whom he wants to protect.

20
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,064
She must be someone like an egret.

21
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:06,190
Like me.

22
00:01:06,273 --> 00:01:07,566
Who knows?

23
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:13,030
Once it hatches,
it may turn out to be a vicious eagle,

24
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,199
not a sophisticated egret.

25
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:16,867
Is that so?

26
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,245
A vicious eagle, how frightful.

27
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,456
I hope it is not a woodpecker
or a cuckoo either.

28
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,125
Do not worry.

29
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:27,711
Once it hatches,
I am sure it will fly away.

30
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:32,383
How could she
when she has feelings for him?

31
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:38,347
If they were that close,
I am sure the feelings were mutual.

32
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:41,392
The bird must be in love with him as well.

33
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:46,397
I really hope it is Young Lady Heo.

34
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,816
She resembles Madam Do-hwa too.

35
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:52,987
-Mr. Lee.
-Yes?

36
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,281
Leave those there.
They are Master Jang's books.

37
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,117
Hurry up.

38
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,165
What Uk and I shared

39
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,543
was the desperate feeling of survival

40
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,465
and the earnestness of finding ourselves.

41
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,019
Once we got what we wanted,

42
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:29,023
we promised to part ways
without looking back.

43
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:34,069
The love that Maidservant Kim mentioned

44
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,741
may have seeped in between us.

45
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:44,496
But it is nothing but a shell
that I will leave behind once I hatch.

46
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,939
You have already memorized
and written all of this down?

47
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:13,817
Yes, please feel free to check.
I am certain I memorized everything.

48
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:17,905
Even so,

49
00:03:17,988 --> 00:03:20,241
it should have taken you at least a month.

50
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:24,036
I have served 12 masters so far
and thus have read the same book 12 times.

51
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,746
You could say

52
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,207
that this task was a piece of cake,
to say the least.

53
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,710
I was wondering
why he agreed to obey the rules.

54
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,337
He had his reasons.

55
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,715
Now that I can leave Songrim
whenever I want, I will go home.

56
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:38,509
Not so fast.

57
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:48,060
Why not?

58
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:51,272
The rules say that I can leave
once I master the basic education.

59
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:53,524
When I asked you to read that,

60
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:55,651
I did not simply mean to memorize it.

61
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:57,653
I wanted you to engrave it in your heart.

62
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:00,781
But since you were sly enough
to deceive us,

63
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:04,159
I do not believe
that you have mastered this learning.

64
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:07,162
I did not know

65
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:10,749
that the leader could change
Songrim's rules however he wanted.

66
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:13,043
Here you go.

67
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:15,671
I have another task for you.

68
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,507
If you read this book as well,

69
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:23,137
then I will allow you
to leave Songrim whenever you wish.

70
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:27,975
No!

71
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:37,359
Are you sure that I can go outside

72
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,070
after reading this book?

73
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,238
That is right.

74
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:44,867
I hope reading this book

75
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:48,203
will be another piece of cake for you.

76
00:04:49,663 --> 00:04:51,332
This is terrible.

77
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:53,751
Mu-deok will not be able
to see Uk for a while.

78
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:09,058
What? This is empty.

79
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,522
No, it is not.
There are words written on those papers.

80
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,775
No, there are not.

81
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:19,359
Do you see anything here?

82
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:22,196
It is you who cannot see.

83
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:25,657
You can only read it
once you focus your energy.

84
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:28,243
That is Master Seo Gyeong's book,
Words of the Heart,

85
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:32,915
I see.

86
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:36,710
So there are actual words on these papers?

87
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,505
So I am the only one who cannot read it?

88
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:46,595
Your friend, Uk,

89
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:48,430
must have not known what that book was.

90
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,059
He has never received proper training.
Of course he would not know.

91
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:54,019
He will be stuck in the Training Center

92
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,562
until he can read it.

93
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:57,439
I feel bad for him.

94
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,399
He will probably
be stuck there for half a year.

95
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:02,861
Even six months
would be too short for him.

96
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:06,406
He mastered Ryusu
due to pure luck, not training.

97
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:09,743
It will take him more than a year.

98
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,463
How do you know that
when you were never given that book?

99
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,424
I know you need
ample training to read that book.

100
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:27,010
Then know that he is far ahead of you.

101
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:29,429
Unlike him who received that book,

102
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,640
you have not touched it yet.

103
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,523
He is right. You should not gossip.

104
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:40,691
Bye.

105
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:43,527
Darn it.

106
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,076
I wonder why my uncle
gave him that book already.

107
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,954
I am baffled as well.

108
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:57,791
He will not be able to do anything
while he is stuck there.

109
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:05,716
I have

110
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,677
no intention of training Uk.

111
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,639
I am going to keep him near me
and check up on him

112
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,559
so that he will not cause
any trouble outside.

113
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:20,564
So you did not take him under your wing.
You just locked him up in Songrim.

114
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,651
Since Uk has entered Songrim with a fuss,

115
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:26,862
his father will be coming.

116
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:29,031
By "father", do you mean Jang Gang?

117
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:32,117
Jang Gang's biggest fear
was that Uk's gate of energy would be open

118
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,330
and that he would go out into the open.

119
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,290
Once he gets wind of this,

120
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,084
he will come.

121
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:45,506
The Gwanju needs to return
in order to get rid of Jin Mu.

122
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,675
Everything will be solved

123
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:52,304
once he returns.

124
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,016
I feel bad for Uk.

125
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,769
He came this far

126
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:01,104
without receiving any training.

127
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:02,564
How can he read Words of the Heart?

128
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,899
It is an impossible task.

129
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:14,868
Why would you give him these snacks?

130
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,746
I heard some things
about Young Master Jang.

131
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:20,123
He has a complicated family history,
barely any skills,

132
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:22,501
-and a terrible personality.
-That is not true.

133
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:25,879
He is a good man.

134
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,048
Why would you think that?

135
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:29,675
He is so fussy

136
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:32,970
that the only person who can put up
with him is the maid Mu-deok.

137
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:36,765
-Mu-deok?
-Yes.

138
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:39,810
She is the maid who is always by his side.

139
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,149
Mu-deok.

140
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,486
I heard you stayed by my side all night.

141
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,698
I thought you were Mu-deok.
I apologize for the trouble.

142
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:56,952
So that is why he thought I was her.

143
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,167
Hello.

144
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:07,796
We are from Sejukwon.

145
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:10,090
This way, my lady.

146
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:50,422
Wait. The fire…

147
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:17,699
Here you go.

148
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,409
I have another task for you.

149
00:10:24,831 --> 00:10:26,083
He deceived me.

150
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,126
He did a number on me!

151
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:47,104
Hey, we meet again.

152
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:50,941
Hello. Are you going somewhere?

153
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:53,402
Well, yes. I need to meet someone outside.

154
00:10:54,694 --> 00:10:56,571
But why are you leaving that way?

155
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:00,200
Because I am running away.

156
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,996
Please turn a blind eye to this as well.

157
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,796
My gosh. Young Lady Heo is so impatient.
Why did she not wait for me?

158
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,215
Why did she leave me behind?

159
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,221
What is the matter?

160
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,391
Is Jang Uk not in his room?

161
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,560
Yes, he is.

162
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:28,520
Let us go upstairs then.

163
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:32,315
I need to talk to him.

164
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,109
In private, please.

165
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:39,781
This will take some time. Wait outside.

166
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:02,596
Mu-deok, the young master
from Songrim is here.

167
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,181
He is looking for you.

168
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:23,533
Hello, Young Master Seo.

169
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:27,829
You must have been expecting Uk.

170
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:31,833
He will not be back for some time.

171
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,544
He was given a difficult task to complete.

172
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:36,796
He will do well.

173
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:39,758
It is most crucial for him to remain there

174
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,844
and receive training as of now.

175
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:46,598
I was concerned after how you left
that day, but you look fine.

176
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,518
What have you been doing?

177
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:53,980
I am just a maid here,
so I have been doing housework.

178
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,983
Maidservant Kim is away at the moment.

179
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,568
You can wait in the study.

180
00:12:59,152 --> 00:13:00,904
I am here to see you, not her.

181
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:03,949
Me?

182
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,327
Why would you want to see me?

183
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:09,204
Well…

184
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:11,039
The umbrella.

185
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,710
I came to get the umbrella
I had lent you that day.

186
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,463
That umbrella?

187
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,341
The wind tore it open
on my way home, so I threw it away.

188
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,718
Is that so?

189
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:27,013
Then let us go.

190
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:28,557
What?

191
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,225
We should get a new one.

192
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:32,936
You need to buy me a new umbrella.

193
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,358
UMBRELLAS

194
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:44,447
This looks exactly like
the umbrella you lent me.

195
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:45,907
That is made of low-quality…

196
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:50,120
That is a disposable umbrella
made of low-quality paper.

197
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:52,372
Mine was made
from high-quality sheepskin and bamboo.

198
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:55,375
High-quality, you say?

199
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:58,378
Why did you give a maid
such an expensive umbrella?

200
00:13:58,461 --> 00:14:00,380
I had only lent it to you.

201
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:02,632
You should compensate for losing it.

202
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:07,596
And that was my one and only umbrella.

203
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,807
Why would a young master like you
only have one umbrella?

204
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,018
I rarely go out when it is raining.

205
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:18,148
I had hurt my leg as a child,
and it still hurts when it rains.

206
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,444
Is your broken leg still giving you pain?

207
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:29,618
Young Master Park told me
about how you had broken your leg.

208
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,871
Yes, back in Danhyanggok.

209
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:36,583
I pity you for being a mage
who has a weak leg.

210
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,794
Your leg probably did not heal properly.

211
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:43,506
There was a friend

212
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:46,676
who used to wait for me in Danhyanggok.

213
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:51,473
She saved me and treated my wound.

214
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,976
My leg must not have healed properly

215
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,104
because I had not thanked her.

216
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:13,620
-I like this one.
-Pardon?

217
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:15,789
I will take this one. Go and pay for it.

218
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,167
Yes, Young Master Seo.

219
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,507
-We will take this one.
-All right.

220
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,051
Please put it on Master Jang Gang's tab.

221
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:31,513
Why would you do that?
You should pay for it.

222
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:34,557
A maid like me has no money.

223
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:35,892
Of course, you do.

224
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,019
I saw you go out

225
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,397
and buy clothes
with the money you keep hidden.

226
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,856
That was because…

227
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:49,572
-How much is it?
-You have a good eye.

228
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:52,117
That is our most expensive umbrella.

229
00:15:57,455 --> 00:15:58,540
Darn it.

230
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:05,255
Mu-deok is not here?

231
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,300
Why did she have to be away
now of all times?

232
00:16:09,384 --> 00:16:11,886
Young Master Jang,
were you kicked out again?

233
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,973
No, I was not.
I only stopped by for a minute.

234
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:16,891
I will be going back soon.

235
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:17,809
I see.

236
00:16:17,892 --> 00:16:19,728
Mu-deok will be here soon.

237
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:22,772
Should I prepare a bath for you
in the meantime?

238
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:24,399
That sounds nice.

239
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:26,901
It has been a while
since I last bathed in this house.

240
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:29,154
-I will get it ready then.
-Sure.

241
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:46,379
Hold on.

242
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,799
Were our honey biscuits always this sweet?

243
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,387
Why does Songrim not have any snacks?

244
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:57,098
Our leader also had a sweet tooth
back in the day.

245
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:18,203
Are we breaking up today?

246
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,538
Yes.

247
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:24,167
The three big-mouthed sisters will be done
with their floriculture class

248
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,460
and will pass us by soon.

249
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:28,338
If we argue in front of them then,

250
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:31,049
they will gossip about how we broke up.

251
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,515
As I promised,

252
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:41,017
I will be the reason for our breakup.

253
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,062
First, slap me hard across my face.

254
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:46,940
Then push me away
when I cling onto you and leave.

255
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,567
That seems a bit extreme…

256
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,361
We have to go that far

257
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:54,447
for them to believe
that we really broke off our engagement.

258
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:58,034
Then people will bad-mouth you.

259
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,621
There will be no matchmaking for you
if you have a bad reputation.

260
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,708
I do not wish

261
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:08,461
to get married by matchmaking.

262
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,758
I will marry the woman

263
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:16,094
who I like.

264
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,187
Still, slapping is too much.

265
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,150
I will pour this on you instead.

266
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:33,653
Sure. You can do that.

267
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,616
The tea is too hot.

268
00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:41,911
Your face will burn.

269
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,710
Goodness.

270
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:50,795
It is fine.

271
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:56,301
There will be a magic show in a few days.

272
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,762
I really wanted to watch it.

273
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:03,349
But I will not be able to
if we break up today.

274
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:06,227
Wait. Why not?

275
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:10,148
Up until now,
I stayed home for at least a month

276
00:19:11,065 --> 00:19:13,401
after breaking off an engagement.

277
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:17,197
I see.

278
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:25,163
Then should we postpone
our breakup for a few days?

279
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:26,080
Should we?

280
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:32,295
But those three sisters will be there too.

281
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:36,549
I do not think I should go there alone.

282
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,221
Then since they think
we are a couple, I will go with you.

283
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:45,808
Well, I suppose.

284
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:53,566
I would like
some pumpkin taffy, rice taffy,

285
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,693
and honey biscuits.

286
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:56,945
Sure.

287
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:00,657
My young master is like a child.

288
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,867
He gets cranky
when there are no snacks around.

289
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,994
Please give them to him.

290
00:20:07,997 --> 00:20:10,291
I like these pine pollen tea snacks.

291
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,002
I suspected you would have
expensive tastes.

292
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,463
-Would you like some of that too?
-No, thank you.

293
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:28,935
RECRUITING SERVANTS FOR SONGRIM

294
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:32,355
RECRUITING SERVANTS FOR SONGRIM

295
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:35,400
QUALIFICATIONS: HEALTHY, LITERATE,
CAN CALCULATE, NO CRIMINAL RECORD

296
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,946
I will put this on the Jang family's tab.

297
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,079
Please give these to Young Master Jang.

298
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:52,792
I have some business
to take care of. Goodbye.

299
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:10,935
Here you go.

300
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,437
-Have a look around.
-I will.

301
00:21:13,229 --> 00:21:14,355
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

302
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,606
Goodbye.

303
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,864
It is her, right?

304
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:24,115
It is her.

305
00:21:25,908 --> 00:21:27,118
Hey.

306
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:29,370
-You took my purse, right?
-Give me back my ring.

307
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,877
-Goodness!
-Where is she?

308
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,421
-Hey! Stop right there!
-Hey!

309
00:21:38,504 --> 00:21:39,672
Stop right there!

310
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,050
-You!
-Stop that swindler!

311
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:44,510
-Thief!
-Hey, come back here!

312
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,889
-Goodness!
-Just wait until I get my hands on you!

313
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,516
-Hey! Stop!
-Wait for me!

314
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,685
-Darn it.
-Hey!

315
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,437
-Hurry up!
-What are you doing?

316
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,646
You little…

317
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,356
Catch that swindler!

318
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,567
-She got away.
-Hey.

319
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,486
-That is her, right?
-Yes.

320
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:10,328
That is Mu-deok.

321
00:22:10,411 --> 00:22:11,245
Mu-deok!

322
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:18,336
There you are, you…

323
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,088
-You.
-Catch that thief!

324
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:23,216
Come here.
Wait until I get my hands on you.

325
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:24,550
Hey!

326
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,802
You little…

327
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:39,607
It was definitely her.

328
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,236
But how can she see now?

329
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,210
She had always covered her eyes with this.

330
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:02,964
Was it not her?

331
00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:24,527
We finally meet again,

332
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:26,487
So-i.

333
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:30,074
I went all the way to Sari Village
because I heard you were there.

334
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,784
But you were long gone.

335
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,620
Did you think hiding
in the capital would work?

336
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,331
What is this?

337
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:42,295
Were you pretending to be blind?

338
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,008
But then again,
you did put up a nice, pitiful front.

339
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:50,511
Then you would betray others
behind their backs.

340
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:54,182
How dare you steal

341
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:57,435
my money?

342
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,230
I do not know what you are--

343
00:24:02,982 --> 00:24:04,901
Jeez…

344
00:24:05,693 --> 00:24:09,030
Look at you trying to deceive me again.

345
00:24:09,655 --> 00:24:10,531
Take her.

346
00:24:15,077 --> 00:24:16,287
Help me!

347
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,039
Somebody, please help me!

348
00:24:20,374 --> 00:24:22,627
I am blind!

349
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,087
I do not know them,

350
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:27,548
yet they are trying to kidnap me!

351
00:24:28,257 --> 00:24:31,886
Someone, please help me!

352
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:34,555
Look at you trying real hard.

353
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,434
Please help me!

354
00:24:38,517 --> 00:24:39,769
What are you all looking at?

355
00:24:39,852 --> 00:24:42,271
-Come here.
-Let me go!

356
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,493
You cannot drag her against her will.

357
00:24:56,619 --> 00:24:59,288
I have a good reason for doing this,

358
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,831
so just go on your way.

359
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,376
I cannot see,

360
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:05,419
-and I do not know who they are.
-You little--

361
00:25:08,047 --> 00:25:09,298
Get him!

362
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:23,104
He is a mage.

363
00:25:23,187 --> 00:25:24,313
Let us go!

364
00:25:32,613 --> 00:25:33,990
Can you stand?

365
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:40,788
Thank you.

366
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:42,623
They look like dangerous men.

367
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,917
You should ask the authorities for help.

368
00:25:45,668 --> 00:25:46,711
I will take you there.

369
00:25:46,794 --> 00:25:49,588
That is all right.
I do not need their help.

370
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,758
Your cane is broken.

371
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,349
This is an umbrella.

372
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:02,685
You can use this as a cane.

373
00:26:19,618 --> 00:26:22,204
Master, it is best to just let her be.

374
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:24,832
She refused to be taken
to the authorities.

375
00:26:24,915 --> 00:26:27,209
I do not know what kind of past she has,

376
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:29,045
but those were thugs.

377
00:26:29,712 --> 00:26:33,883
Nothing good will come out
of involving yourself in their affairs.

378
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,643
I will take you there.

379
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,938
You should ask the authorities for help.

380
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,070
Maybe I should have said yes.

381
00:27:15,132 --> 00:27:17,718
Number 125.

382
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,722
Did these many people
already sign up for it?

383
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,140
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE

384
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,060
They are only picking five people.

385
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:29,355
Do I have hope?

386
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,065
Hey, Mu-deok.

387
00:27:32,691 --> 00:27:33,901
Were you here all along?

388
00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:35,444
The young master was looking for you.

389
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,988
Did Young Master Seo come by again?

390
00:27:38,072 --> 00:27:40,157
Not him. Young Master Jang.

391
00:27:40,908 --> 00:27:43,828
Young Master Jang snuck out
and has come home.

392
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:56,632
I need to go back before sundown.
Where in the world is she?

393
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,426
Where is Young Master Jang?

394
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:42,678
He just left,
but I did not see him either.

395
00:28:45,222 --> 00:28:47,266
He said he would be obedient,
so why did he escape?

396
00:28:49,143 --> 00:28:50,936
I hope he does not get caught.

397
00:28:53,939 --> 00:28:55,357
He just left.

398
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:56,942
Just now.

399
00:28:58,861 --> 00:29:00,654
What is with her?

400
00:29:25,137 --> 00:29:26,305
Jang Uk.

401
00:29:26,889 --> 00:29:27,807
Young Master!

402
00:29:32,561 --> 00:29:35,314
Where have you been?
I thought I would not get to see you.

403
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,762
I finally got to see you. I am glad.

404
00:30:09,348 --> 00:30:11,809
I need to go.
They cannot know that I am gone.

405
00:30:12,726 --> 00:30:15,354
Wait there. I will go to you soon.

406
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:21,235
I found a way,
so do what you need to do in there.

407
00:30:21,318 --> 00:30:23,028
I will do what I can out here.

408
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:27,074
All right. But what way is that?

409
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,369
Songrim is hiring.

410
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:52,266
Do not get caught and get back safely.

411
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:21,503
Your Royal Highness,
instead of going to Sejukwon yourself,

412
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:23,589
you should summon
Master Heo to your palace.

413
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,385
That is all right.
It gives me a reason to come out.

414
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,970
I like taking strolls.

415
00:31:35,976 --> 00:31:37,061
Is that not Jang Uk?

416
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:48,864
Why are you out here?

417
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,033
I heard you could not leave
the Training Center

418
00:31:51,116 --> 00:31:52,826
until you could read Words of the Heart.

419
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,329
Not only did you follow me
to where I was drinking,

420
00:31:55,412 --> 00:31:57,081
but you are also keeping tabs on me.

421
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,960
Why are you so interested in me?
It is making me uncomfortable.

422
00:32:01,043 --> 00:32:03,045
Master Heo from Sejukwon told me.

423
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:07,633
Right. I heard you fell ill
after drinking the liquor I had given you.

424
00:32:07,716 --> 00:32:10,010
Then why did you come to Sejukwon?

425
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:15,224
Does it still hurt where I hit you?

426
00:32:15,307 --> 00:32:16,392
Oh, dear.

427
00:32:16,475 --> 00:32:19,561
Not at all. I am all better now.

428
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:22,106
I only go there to get some supplements.

429
00:32:22,898 --> 00:32:26,360
I hope you take many good supplements.
You must live a long, healthy life.

430
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,115
What were you hiding just a while ago?

431
00:32:32,199 --> 00:32:33,200
Let me see it.

432
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:51,885
It is a honey biscuit.

433
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:55,139
I wanted to eat it for myself.
How did you know?

434
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,849
You can have it.

435
00:33:03,188 --> 00:33:06,275
Songrim does not have
these kinds of snacks.

436
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,861
Did you go home?

437
00:33:15,784 --> 00:33:18,912
You will be in trouble
if they find out you have sneaked out.

438
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:22,791
You even gave me a congratulatory drink
and complimented me.

439
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,836
Will you seriously tattle on me
for this little misdeed?

440
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,884
After all, I even gave you
that honey biscuit.

441
00:33:37,222 --> 00:33:41,602
Stay away from that big pine tree.
I saw a group of mages there.

442
00:33:44,563 --> 00:33:46,690
Thank you, Your Royal Highness. Goodbye.

443
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:53,072
I do not understand
why I am being nice to him.

444
00:33:57,576 --> 00:33:59,119
This is tasty.

445
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,080
Is it?

446
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,877
-Is it tasty, Your Royal Highness?
-Yes.

447
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:09,421
I thought the Crown Prince

448
00:34:10,297 --> 00:34:13,008
would be hostile
toward Songrim after the match.

449
00:34:14,176 --> 00:34:16,095
Rather, he has sheathed his sword

450
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:18,931
and become closer to them.

451
00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:22,810
He must have decided to befriend them
so that they could be of use

452
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:24,520
when he becomes the next king.

453
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,608
Are you sure we do not need
to do anything about it?

454
00:34:29,691 --> 00:34:30,943
Do not worry.

455
00:34:31,026 --> 00:34:32,986
We can easily change his mind.

456
00:34:33,612 --> 00:34:35,948
We have Jang Uk's constellation plate.

457
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:41,203
The Crown Prince will have no choice
but to kill him eventually.

458
00:34:52,172 --> 00:34:56,760
Is that what we will use
to subdue Jin Ho-gyeong?

459
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:00,180
Jinyowon will be ours soon.

460
00:35:20,826 --> 00:35:23,412
It has been four hours
since Young Lady Heo went inside.

461
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:27,374
Do not bother them.

462
00:35:27,457 --> 00:35:28,792
They must have a lot to talk about.

463
00:35:32,504 --> 00:35:35,299
Hey! Wait!

464
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,552
You should not bother them.

465
00:35:38,635 --> 00:35:39,803
Something is not right.

466
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,097
I must check whether or not
Jang Uk is in there.

467
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,391
Are you doubting my lady?

468
00:35:46,268 --> 00:35:47,311
Gosh.

469
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,024
Why is he not here yet?

470
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:57,154
It will be awkward
if they find out he is not here.

471
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:09,166
Why are you here? What are you doing?

472
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:14,296
I told them we were in here together
so they would not catch you leaving.

473
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,216
I have been waiting for your return.

474
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,767
See? They are together.

475
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,145
I will go now.

476
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,732
I had a great chat with you today.

477
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:36,318
Likewise.

478
00:36:36,902 --> 00:36:38,195
Goodbye.

479
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:50,958
What were you doing here
for the past four hours?

480
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,585
Beats me.

481
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,798
What were we doing here for that long?

482
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,738
She must have been bored.

483
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:28,620
You want to become a servant of Songrim?

484
00:37:29,204 --> 00:37:31,248
Yes, ma'am. Look what happened today.

485
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:35,627
Young Master Jang needs me
by his side at all times.

486
00:37:36,461 --> 00:37:37,421
I agree.

487
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:41,800
He must have been so uncomfortable
that he came here to bathe and eat snacks.

488
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:45,929
Our young master is very sensitive
and has been doted on growing up.

489
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,223
Living with others in Songrim
does not suit him.

490
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:50,058
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE

491
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,351
I already signed up.

492
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,395
I will get in at all costs.

493
00:37:54,396 --> 00:37:56,315
Hey, you do not need that.

494
00:37:56,982 --> 00:37:58,483
This is the Jang family.

495
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,027
We can easily put you in there.

496
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:01,570
Is that true?

497
00:38:01,653 --> 00:38:04,656
Does that mean
I do not need to take the test?

498
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,284
Of course not. Just trust me.

499
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:11,955
That is not possible.

500
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:16,460
Songrim's servants are only chosen
through open recruitments.

501
00:38:16,543 --> 00:38:17,794
There is no exception.

502
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,047
I am not asking you
to give her a free position.

503
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,883
She just needs the entrance plaque.
Just register her name

504
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:24,551
so she can get one.

505
00:38:24,634 --> 00:38:26,386
We will pay you monthly.

506
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:31,183
Also…

507
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:32,893
Here.

508
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:37,564
I thought it would suit you,
so I got you one, Maidservant Park.

509
00:38:42,402 --> 00:38:43,612
Here.

510
00:39:08,595 --> 00:39:12,474
Word has it that you bribed

511
00:39:12,557 --> 00:39:16,436
Maidservant Park of Songrim with this.

512
00:39:17,062 --> 00:39:20,148
-It was purely a gift…
-I heard you asked her

513
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:23,402
to give Mu-deok a spot there.

514
00:39:23,485 --> 00:39:26,530
Since our young master is so sensitive,

515
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:28,573
I thought having Mu-deok by his side

516
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:32,619
would help him with his training,
so I asked for a favor.

517
00:39:34,162 --> 00:39:35,372
So this truly was a bribe!

518
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:40,043
I apologize. It was thoughtless of me.

519
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,170
When Maidservant Park brought this to me,

520
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:45,090
I vehemently told her
that you were not one to do such a thing.

521
00:39:45,882 --> 00:39:47,008
I defended you.

522
00:39:47,092 --> 00:39:51,096
How will I dare face her ever again?

523
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:52,431
I…

524
00:39:56,726 --> 00:39:59,187
I will apologize to her.

525
00:39:59,813 --> 00:40:01,022
What will everyone think?

526
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:05,318
They will think you abused
your relationship with me

527
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:07,279
to bribe someone.

528
00:40:07,362 --> 00:40:10,824
I did give her that scarf,
but I never mentioned you to her.

529
00:40:10,907 --> 00:40:12,075
Even so,

530
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,786
everyone in Songrim knows
that you and I are close.

531
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:18,540
If you do this, I can no longer…

532
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:25,964
have a close relationship with you.

533
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:31,511
In that case, I will stop coming here.

534
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:33,889
And what did you say?

535
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:37,601
Was our relationship ever that deep?

536
00:40:38,226 --> 00:40:40,020
If we were truly close,

537
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:43,148
you would not have mentioned
cutting ties with me so easily.

538
00:40:43,231 --> 00:40:44,566
Fine.

539
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:48,612
-Maidservant Kim, I…
-I will tell Maidservant Park

540
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:51,114
that I, who bribes people,

541
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,616
am not close

542
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:55,827
with the leader of Songrim even one bit.

543
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,204
-Look--
-All right.

544
00:40:57,787 --> 00:40:59,789
I am terribly sorry

545
00:40:59,873 --> 00:41:01,249
that I made you lose face.

546
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:03,627
Maidservant Kim.

547
00:41:05,378 --> 00:41:07,297
You cannot just leave like that.

548
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:15,388
Take this.

549
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:20,852
I would be accepting this bribe
if I were to keep it.

550
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:39,538
Also…

551
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,791
I did not mean

552
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:47,629
that I did not want you to come…

553
00:41:47,712 --> 00:41:48,797
Maid--

554
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,549
Maidservant Kim!

555
00:41:55,887 --> 00:41:57,097
This is difficult.

556
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,491
You cannot do it yet.

557
00:42:19,244 --> 00:42:20,370
Master Lee.

558
00:42:21,037 --> 00:42:23,957
You cannot read that book
with the concentration you have now.

559
00:42:24,624 --> 00:42:27,794
You have never trained diligently
like the others have.

560
00:42:27,877 --> 00:42:30,880
How long will it take
if I start training now?

561
00:42:30,964 --> 00:42:33,383
The earliest would be in a year.

562
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,637
I cannot do that. I refuse
to be stuck in here for that long.

563
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,849
I think that is exactly the reason
why Park Jin gave you that book.

564
00:42:45,395 --> 00:42:46,855
You could shorten that time

565
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:51,359
if you become my pupil
and receive my teachings.

566
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,611
Do you mean

567
00:42:53,987 --> 00:42:55,697
by drinking that chaste herb tea?

568
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,286
Please give me some time to think.

569
00:43:02,704 --> 00:43:05,123
This book contains my master,

570
00:43:05,206 --> 00:43:09,544
Master Seo Gyeong's poem.

571
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:10,795
Poem?

572
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,881
It is not that long.

573
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:16,468
Once you read the first word,

574
00:43:16,551 --> 00:43:18,511
the rest will come easily to you.

575
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:22,724
Right. You cannot read this yet, can you?

576
00:43:23,683 --> 00:43:26,728
Are you having fun teasing me?
It is not like you will tell me.

577
00:43:26,811 --> 00:43:28,104
It is quite entertaining to watch.

578
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:32,609
Shall I help you again this time?

579
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,320
Yes, please.

580
00:43:36,237 --> 00:43:39,616
Let me tell you one secret
about this book that no one knows of.

581
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:44,496
This poem is actually a love letter.

582
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,457
A love letter?

583
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,583
That is right.

584
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:52,587
Countless mages have read this,
but no one knows that fact.

585
00:43:56,508 --> 00:44:00,553
Master Seo Gyeong wrote this
for a lady who could not see

586
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:03,473
so that she could read it with her heart.

587
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:11,314
You can read it by training
your concentration skills.

588
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:15,402
But try to think of another way
since I told you it was a love letter.

589
00:44:16,986 --> 00:44:20,698
How does a love letter begin?

590
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,124
What is this?

591
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,378
Was he a pervert?

592
00:44:33,461 --> 00:44:37,048
Why would he make others
read his love letter?

593
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,260
Why must I read this?
It is invisible to me.

594
00:44:41,094 --> 00:44:42,637
Was he really a pervert?

595
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:50,019
Master Lee, it is getting colder now.
Instead of returning to Danhyanggok,

596
00:44:50,103 --> 00:44:53,231
how about you stay here?
I will treat you well.

597
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,024
Yeom.

598
00:44:55,108 --> 00:44:59,821
I cannot train by wearing warm clothes
and feeling comfortable.

599
00:44:59,904 --> 00:45:04,075
I am just a pupil
who wants his master to be warm.

600
00:45:07,662 --> 00:45:10,540
I guess you have matured with age.

601
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,144
That is Maidservant Kim
from the Jang family.

602
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:34,731
Seeing how she looks unhappy,
she must have fought with Jin again.

603
00:45:36,232 --> 00:45:38,109
Goodness. Hello.

604
00:45:42,655 --> 00:45:43,907
Master Lee.

605
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:47,160
Why did you leave so quickly last time?

606
00:45:47,243 --> 00:45:48,953
I did not have the chance to thank you.

607
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:52,248
Have you two met before?

608
00:45:52,874 --> 00:45:55,585
We met at the party in Chwiseonru.

609
00:45:56,669 --> 00:45:58,171
How are your clothes?

610
00:45:58,254 --> 00:46:00,465
I made your seam run.

611
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:02,967
I am fine.

612
00:46:03,468 --> 00:46:04,719
Seam?

613
00:46:04,802 --> 00:46:06,095
I see.

614
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:07,805
It is very cold.

615
00:46:07,889 --> 00:46:09,766
Do you not feel cold in those clothes?

616
00:46:11,267 --> 00:46:13,061
Wear this.

617
00:46:13,144 --> 00:46:15,522
I wanted to get you a thank-you gift.

618
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:21,694
This is a gift, not a bribe.

619
00:46:22,278 --> 00:46:23,404
Here.

620
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,467
It suits you.

621
00:46:54,727 --> 00:46:57,522
Will you be all right wearing that?

622
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:10,285
SONGRIM SERVANT CONTEST

623
00:47:13,454 --> 00:47:14,497
We will now begin

624
00:47:15,248 --> 00:47:17,750
the Songrim Servant Contest

625
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:21,754
and pick those of you
who will work in Songrim.

626
00:47:22,338 --> 00:47:24,591
I will read the name list.

627
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,552
Answer me when I call your names.

628
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,515
Number one, Park Jun-hwa.

629
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:33,975
Here.

630
00:47:34,058 --> 00:47:35,977
Number two, An So-jeong.

631
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,145
Here!

632
00:47:38,938 --> 00:47:40,023
An So-jeong.

633
00:47:40,106 --> 00:47:41,357
TWO

634
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,442
An…

635
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,446
-Number three, Lee Yeong-ok.
-Here.

636
00:47:46,529 --> 00:47:48,406
-Number four, Park Hyeon-su.
-Here.

637
00:47:49,407 --> 00:47:51,701
-Number five, Bae Hui-young.
-Here.

638
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:00,168
What is this?

639
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:01,753
I am looking at it just in case.

640
00:48:05,548 --> 00:48:07,884
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE, MU-DEOK

641
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,887
There you are.

642
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:13,848
Number 125, Mu-deok.

643
00:48:15,266 --> 00:48:16,309
Over here!

644
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:25,401
Your maid, Mu-deok, is in Songrim today.

645
00:48:26,611 --> 00:48:28,363
Let me warn you in advance.

646
00:48:28,446 --> 00:48:29,947
Do not try to leave this room.

647
00:48:30,031 --> 00:48:31,407
Can you keep it down…

648
00:48:34,285 --> 00:48:35,828
Could you be quiet, please?

649
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:38,373
I need all the concentration
I can get to read this.

650
00:48:38,456 --> 00:48:39,874
I will let you be then.

651
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:57,141
I will see you again in three days,
Your Royal Highness.

652
00:48:57,225 --> 00:49:01,062
Why is Songrim so busy today?
It is teeming with people.

653
00:49:01,896 --> 00:49:06,150
They are holding a contest
to pick out some servants.

654
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:09,612
-Do they need to turn it into a contest?
-Your Royal Highness.

655
00:49:10,196 --> 00:49:12,490
Many people
want to work here as a servant.

656
00:49:12,573 --> 00:49:15,702
I saw the maid from the Jang family too.

657
00:49:17,078 --> 00:49:19,163
-Filthy Mu-deok?
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

658
00:49:32,468 --> 00:49:34,095
Your first test

659
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:39,225
will require you to read and calculate.

660
00:49:40,017 --> 00:49:41,728
You must get all of them right.

661
00:49:41,811 --> 00:49:44,480
One wrong answer,
and you will be disqualified!

662
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:49,902
SONGRIM SERVANT CONTEST

663
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,741
Yul!

664
00:49:57,076 --> 00:49:58,411
I found the test papers.

665
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:02,832
There are many questions.
Even short-answer ones.

666
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,959
Mu-deok is smart,

667
00:50:05,042 --> 00:50:06,544
but will she get them all right?

668
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,132
This is pretty difficult?

669
00:50:11,215 --> 00:50:14,010
Eunuch Oh, what do you need
to wash clothes that have ink on them?

670
00:50:14,093 --> 00:50:15,219
That is a question here.

671
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,680
Rice paste does the trick.

672
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,557
What do you do with it?

673
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,477
First, you apply it on…

674
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,608
SONGRIM SERVANT CONTEST

675
00:50:28,691 --> 00:50:31,694
"You invited 20 individuals each
from 3 different families."

676
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:35,156
"One table can seat four people.
How many tables do you need?"

677
00:50:37,116 --> 00:50:40,578
Twenty individuals from three families
mean sixty in total.

678
00:50:42,663 --> 00:50:46,292
Since one table can fit four of them,

679
00:50:47,168 --> 00:50:48,419
-it is fifteen.
-No.

680
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,380
They said "three families" on purpose.

681
00:50:52,298 --> 00:50:56,344
Those from the same family
must sit together.

682
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:59,388
We need more tables
if they will be placed together.

683
00:50:59,472 --> 00:51:01,766
Each family would need nine tables.

684
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,602
That is 27 in total.

685
00:51:11,025 --> 00:51:12,485
This was an invitation.

686
00:51:12,568 --> 00:51:14,111
NINE × THREE = TWENTY-SEVEN

687
00:51:14,195 --> 00:51:16,864
The host needs a table as well.

688
00:51:17,615 --> 00:51:19,158
TWENTY-SEVEN + HOST
= TWENTY…

689
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,743
Twenty-eight in total.

690
00:51:23,162 --> 00:51:25,331
You are right.

691
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,959
TWENTY-EIGHT

692
00:51:28,459 --> 00:51:31,212
Next question is about running errands
and not getting lost.

693
00:51:32,004 --> 00:51:34,382
Let me get a map of the capital.

694
00:51:35,633 --> 00:51:37,802
HOW DO YOU WASH CLOTHES
THAT HAVE INK ON THEM?

695
00:51:38,469 --> 00:51:40,763
What should you do
if there is ink on the clothes?

696
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,474
Should you not just dispose of them?
Eunuch Oh.

697
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:45,643
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

698
00:51:45,726 --> 00:51:48,729
How do you wash clothes
that have ink on them again?

699
00:51:48,813 --> 00:51:50,898
You need some warm rice paste.

700
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,859
-Smear it on the--
-That is right.

701
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,194
Write it.

702
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,822
"Warm rice paste."

703
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,700
SONGRIM SERVANT CONTEST

704
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,287
We probably got all of them right.

705
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:06,497
I did not expect to do this with you,
but it was fun.

706
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:09,458
I can assure you that Mu-deok will fail.

707
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:18,259
That is why we should deliver
this perfect test paper to her.

708
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,264
But how can we do that?
It will look too obvious if we do it.

709
00:52:24,265 --> 00:52:28,561
Perhaps someone who is more conspicuous
will avoid suspicion.

710
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:47,121
SONGRIM SERVANT CONTEST

711
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,665
This is hard.

712
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:52,043
This is more difficult than I thought.

713
00:52:54,086 --> 00:52:56,172
Do not look at other people's papers.

714
00:52:59,258 --> 00:53:02,678
The Crown Prince is here! Bow before him!

715
00:53:06,098 --> 00:53:07,600
Goodness. Your Royal Highness!

716
00:53:07,683 --> 00:53:10,728
-Your Royal Highness!
-Your Royal Highness!

717
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:20,112
I heard there was an important test,
so I wanted to encourage you.

718
00:53:22,156 --> 00:53:23,699
We are honored to have you here.

719
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:26,869
Do not mind me and focus on the test.

720
00:53:44,887 --> 00:53:45,805
Focus!

721
00:53:47,264 --> 00:53:48,599
Focus!

722
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,393
Focus!

723
00:53:50,476 --> 00:53:51,811
-You too.
-Focus--

724
00:53:52,353 --> 00:53:53,521
Get back to what you were doing.

725
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:39,650
I will now announce
those of you who have passed.

726
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:45,322
Park Jun-hwa, you have passed.

727
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,325
Lee Yeong-ok, failed.

728
00:54:48,409 --> 00:54:51,495
Hwang Yeon-ji, failed.

729
00:54:52,329 --> 00:54:54,373
Oh Jae-ho, you have passed.

730
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,544
Number 125.

731
00:54:58,627 --> 00:54:59,962
Mu-deok.

732
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,348
Your Royal Highness!

733
00:55:13,684 --> 00:55:15,144
She got in!

734
00:55:15,227 --> 00:55:16,771
Yes!

735
00:55:21,025 --> 00:55:22,276
Good work.

736
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:27,198
Forty of you have passed the first test.

737
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:30,826
Now comes the practical test.

738
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:37,708
The practical test
will evaluate them on their duties.

739
00:55:38,584 --> 00:55:39,919
They will prepare ingredients,

740
00:55:40,002 --> 00:55:42,838
clean, and wash clothes.

741
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,382
Lastly, there will be a fitness test.

742
00:56:14,703 --> 00:56:17,331
Number 125, Mu-deok.

743
00:56:17,414 --> 00:56:18,833
You have passed.

744
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:49,947
Number 125, Mu-deok.

745
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:50,948
You have passed!

746
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,161
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE

747
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,840
Number 125, Mu-deok.

748
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:09,675
You have passed!

749
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:15,514
Gosh, Mu-deok is impressive.

750
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,391
Now, it is the fitness test.

751
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,393
We should go and cheer for her.

752
00:57:20,144 --> 00:57:23,063
I saw many fit individuals back there.

753
00:57:23,147 --> 00:57:25,399
I highly doubt she will be
one of the last five.

754
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,735
Your Royal Highness,
thank you for helping us.

755
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,278
Goodbye.

756
00:57:31,572 --> 00:57:33,699
-Let us go.
-All right.

757
00:57:36,243 --> 00:57:40,164
That was his way of telling me
not to come, right?

758
00:57:40,247 --> 00:57:42,666
Goodness, why did they have to be so mean?

759
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,877
Unbelievable.

760
00:57:45,794 --> 00:57:47,379
Forget it. Let us go.

761
00:57:48,172 --> 00:57:49,465
Your Royal Highness, it is this way.

762
00:57:52,468 --> 00:57:54,470
-I know.
-Of course, Your Royal Highness.

763
00:57:55,471 --> 00:57:59,892
You will travel five ri
and bring back some water.

764
00:57:59,975 --> 00:58:01,435
Those who are the first five

765
00:58:02,102 --> 00:58:05,397
to arrive will be the final winners.

766
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,900
This is the last hurdle.

767
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:11,111
I must be in the first five.

768
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:24,124
Go!

769
00:58:32,716 --> 00:58:35,844
He has been looking
at Words of the Heart for days on end.

770
00:58:37,596 --> 00:58:38,722
Is that so?

771
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,983
It will not happen that soon.

772
00:58:49,066 --> 00:58:50,526
Have patience.

773
00:58:52,736 --> 00:58:54,029
Yes, my lord.

774
00:58:54,738 --> 00:58:58,033
Maidservant Kim is worried sick about you.

775
00:58:58,909 --> 00:59:00,703
Let me know if you need anything.

776
00:59:00,786 --> 00:59:04,957
I will prepare your bed, food,
and clothes to your liking.

777
00:59:06,792 --> 00:59:08,210
I am fine.

778
00:59:17,386 --> 00:59:19,722
The wind is getting chillier now.

779
00:59:19,805 --> 00:59:22,224
Keep the windows closed.

780
00:59:23,767 --> 00:59:27,938
Master Seo Gyeong wrote this
for a lady who could not see

781
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:30,983
so that she could read it with her heart.

782
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,236
I have one question.

783
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:39,199
Did Master Seo Gyeong know
of a woman who could not see?

784
00:59:43,078 --> 00:59:45,456
During the Great Chaos
that occurred 200 years ago,

785
00:59:46,123 --> 00:59:48,375
the first leader of Jinyowon

786
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:50,836
was the one who helped
Master Seo Gyeong by his side.

787
00:59:50,919 --> 00:59:53,881
And she could not see.

788
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:58,844
He had written this love letter
for the leader of Jinyowon.

789
01:00:00,721 --> 01:00:04,808
By the way, are you sure
you can let others read this?

790
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:07,603
What if these are his private thoughts

791
01:00:07,686 --> 01:00:09,772
that you are making everyone read?

792
01:00:13,817 --> 01:00:16,820
You must be trying to use me
to read what is written in there.

793
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,281
I will tell you this.

794
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:24,411
Those words have nothing to do
with his private thoughts.

795
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:31,210
Countless mages have read this,
but no one knows that fact.

796
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,630
Right. No one knows
that it is a love letter.

797
01:00:34,713 --> 01:00:36,674
Instead of coming up with tricks,

798
01:00:36,757 --> 01:00:39,218
you should focus more
on training yourself.

799
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:43,222
How could no one know
that this is a love letter?

800
01:00:48,143 --> 01:00:51,480
You can read it by training
your concentration skills.

801
01:00:51,563 --> 01:00:56,151
But try to think of another way
since I told you it was a love letter.

802
01:00:56,985 --> 01:01:00,656
There must be a different way
to read this love letter.

803
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,867
Those who read this
through training do not know.

804
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,453
Only those who are aware
that it is a love letter can read it.

805
01:01:07,037 --> 01:01:08,414
But how?

806
01:01:08,497 --> 01:01:11,667
How does a love letter begin?

807
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,138
I have one last question.

808
01:01:25,097 --> 01:01:26,765
What was the name

809
01:01:27,766 --> 01:01:29,309
of the first leader of Jinyowon?

810
01:01:41,613 --> 01:01:43,532
All love letters begin

811
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,869
with the recipient's name.

812
01:01:47,786 --> 01:01:48,912
Her surname

813
01:01:49,496 --> 01:01:52,666
was Jin, and her first name was Seol-ran.

814
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:56,003
The recipient's name was Seol-ran.

815
01:01:56,086 --> 01:01:57,713
"An orchid that blooms

816
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,174
in the white snow."

817
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:02,968
Her name

818
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:06,054
will open this letter.

819
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:38,837
YOU CANNOT GRASP WATER
BUT IT IS INSIDE THE SOIL

820
01:02:44,551 --> 01:02:45,761
I can read it.

821
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,938
Hey, there she is.

822
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,566
There is Mu-deok.

823
01:03:14,122 --> 01:03:15,666
"You cannot grasp water,

824
01:03:17,167 --> 01:03:18,710
but it is inside the soil."

825
01:03:20,504 --> 01:03:22,548
"You cannot touch fire,

826
01:03:22,631 --> 01:03:24,049
but it is inside the tree."

827
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,262
"You cannot hold the wind,

828
01:03:29,888 --> 01:03:31,348
but it is resting on the rock."

829
01:03:33,058 --> 01:03:36,812
"If you let them be,
they will exist everywhere."

830
01:03:38,605 --> 01:03:40,023
"The faint, blue light

831
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:43,026
makes me sigh."

832
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:48,031
"My white breath

833
01:03:48,615 --> 01:03:50,826
turned into snow and tears."

834
01:03:51,952 --> 01:03:54,746
"I could not let them drop and hid them."

835
01:03:56,331 --> 01:03:59,084
"Despite knowing that
they will fill up once again,

836
01:03:59,793 --> 01:04:04,131
I am a fool
who dares not shed a single tear."

837
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,054
Those two are already back.

838
01:04:13,682 --> 01:04:14,892
I do not see Mu-deok.

839
01:04:23,483 --> 01:04:25,569
There are six people in front of Mu-deok.

840
01:04:25,652 --> 01:04:27,863
She needs to beat
at least two of them to win.

841
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:41,418
I AM A FOOL
WHO DARES NOT SHED A SINGLE TEAR

842
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:50,928
YOU CANNOT GRASP WATER
BUT IT IS INSIDE THE SOIL

843
01:04:57,559 --> 01:04:58,644
Where are you going?

844
01:04:59,686 --> 01:05:00,854
Right.

845
01:05:03,315 --> 01:05:04,399
I read it.

846
01:05:26,838 --> 01:05:27,839
Number 29,

847
01:05:27,923 --> 01:05:29,800
Jang Jeong-do. You have passed.

848
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:33,011
Only one more remains.

849
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:08,088
I do not need a pupil
who does not improve.

850
01:06:08,588 --> 01:06:10,674
Just die if you are
not going to do anything.

851
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:13,719
Hey! That is dangerous!

852
01:06:13,802 --> 01:06:15,512
You are no longer Naksu.

853
01:06:22,185 --> 01:06:24,146
No matter how pathetic you feel,

854
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:27,315
you must do what you can at the moment.

855
01:06:29,776 --> 01:06:31,653
If I am not willing to do anything,

856
01:06:33,238 --> 01:06:34,698
I might as well just die.

857
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:56,053
Number 125, Mu-deok.

858
01:06:58,472 --> 01:06:59,806
You have passed!

859
01:07:07,355 --> 01:07:08,940
YOU CANNOT GRASP WATER
BUT IT IS INSIDE THE SOIL

860
01:07:09,024 --> 01:07:11,818
It is exactly identical
to Words of the Heart.

861
01:07:12,527 --> 01:07:14,446
Jang Uk accomplished the task.

862
01:07:16,865 --> 01:07:18,325
He accomplished the task?

863
01:07:23,163 --> 01:07:26,333
-Where is he right now?
-He is at Sejukwon.

864
01:07:26,416 --> 01:07:29,711
The maid who was always with him
collapsed while taking the test,

865
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:31,004
so he took her there.

866
01:07:32,172 --> 01:07:33,340
His maid?

867
01:07:34,007 --> 01:07:35,967
-Do you mean Mu-deok?
-Yes, my lord.

868
01:07:36,051 --> 01:07:38,011
She passed the test today.

869
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,931
She did pass out at the finish line,

870
01:07:41,014 --> 01:07:43,058
but she did indeed make it.

871
01:07:43,767 --> 01:07:45,018
Is that so?

872
01:07:49,314 --> 01:07:52,651
My maid only risked her life
by doing what she was told to do.

873
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,736
It was all my doing.

874
01:08:07,749 --> 01:08:09,084
Now that I think of it,

875
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:13,004
she was always beside Uk.

876
01:08:15,048 --> 01:08:16,716
His maid, Mu-deok…

877
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:26,351
The book that I read was actually
Master Seo Gyeong's love letter.

878
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:30,313
Really?

879
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:33,233
Then why did he make it invisible?

880
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:37,571
The woman could not see.
He wanted her to read with her heart.

881
01:08:38,947 --> 01:08:40,407
How wistful.

882
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:42,117
I do not think

883
01:08:42,951 --> 01:08:44,703
the letter was sent.

884
01:08:45,453 --> 01:08:47,539
If it was, it would have been in Jinyowon,

885
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,875
not Songrim.

886
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:53,628
An invisible love letter
that was never sent?

887
01:08:55,755 --> 01:08:56,840
What a coward.

888
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,136
He wrote down his feelings
without her knowing.

889
01:09:02,637 --> 01:09:04,014
What a foolish

890
01:09:05,348 --> 01:09:06,892
and pitiful love letter.

891
01:09:12,522 --> 01:09:14,441
You are right. He should have…

892
01:09:17,527 --> 01:09:19,362
delivered the letter like you did.

893
01:09:20,822 --> 01:09:23,450
RECRUITING SERVANTS FOR SONGRIM

894
01:09:24,826 --> 01:09:26,286
That is not a letter.

895
01:09:26,369 --> 01:09:27,746
What is there to a letter?

896
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:30,540
As long as it delivers your feelings.

897
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:34,586
Wait there. I will go to you soon.

898
01:09:34,669 --> 01:09:36,421
Do not get caught and get back safely.

899
01:09:45,805 --> 01:09:49,976
You must have pitied me
for trying to get in here as a servant.

900
01:09:50,977 --> 01:09:53,605
You used to be
an incredibly experienced master.

901
01:09:54,105 --> 01:09:55,899
I did feel bad for you.

902
01:09:56,858 --> 01:09:59,361
I guess I helped you learn
about loyalty and duties.

903
01:09:59,444 --> 01:10:01,488
Seeing how far you would go as my master,

904
01:10:01,571 --> 01:10:04,950
I did think that I should do my best.

905
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:08,954
You must have felt pressured.

906
01:10:09,746 --> 01:10:12,540
Not really. But I was in a dilemma.

907
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:18,088
I did not know if I should reply
as your young master or pupil.

908
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:21,424
Or just reply based on what I read.

909
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:28,807
What did you read?

910
01:10:29,724 --> 01:10:33,436
Then should I also reply
based on what I read?

911
01:10:35,063 --> 01:10:36,606
Also? What do you mean?

912
01:10:37,148 --> 01:10:41,278
It is written here.
"I will go this far just to see you."

913
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:45,282
"I can do anything
if it means being able to see you."

914
01:10:45,907 --> 01:10:47,284
And this is my reply.

915
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:56,876
I should have braced myself
before letting him get this close to me.

916
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:02,507
I also missed you.

917
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:07,762
That is my reply.

918
01:11:16,938 --> 01:11:18,732
What I gave him

919
01:11:20,275 --> 01:11:24,279
should not have been read
or delivered in the first place.

920
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:27,782
It was my foolish and pathetic

921
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:31,161
love letter.

922
01:12:02,567 --> 01:12:04,194
I miss you first thing in the morning,

923
01:12:04,277 --> 01:12:06,196
-all throughout the day--
-Stop.

924
01:12:06,279 --> 01:12:08,365
It is a terrible poison you cannot escape,

925
01:12:08,448 --> 01:12:10,408
as its only antidote is
the person it is from.

926
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:11,868
Are you out of your mind?

927
01:12:11,951 --> 01:12:13,828
This is just a symptom.
I have been poisoned.

928
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:17,040
So the only one in your mind
has been Jang Uk, Naksu.

929
01:12:17,123 --> 01:12:19,250
You did not believe me
when I said I was in love with you.

930
01:12:19,334 --> 01:12:21,294
Then do a better job
and make me believe it.

931
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:23,838
That is the most precious object
I have ever received.

932
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:26,841
Please do your best
so you can win it back.

933
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:29,719
I have made a bet with your maid, Mu-deok.

934
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:32,013
Fight and perish, Jang Uk.

935
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:33,181
When I said I missed you,

936
01:12:33,264 --> 01:12:34,682
is this what you meant
when you said you had my weakness?

937
01:12:34,766 --> 01:12:36,101
Do not go.

938
01:12:36,768 --> 01:12:40,397
I like Mu-deok a lot.

939
01:12:44,025 --> 01:12:49,030
