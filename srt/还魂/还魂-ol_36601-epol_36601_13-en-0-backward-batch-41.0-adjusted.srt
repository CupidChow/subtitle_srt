1
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:11,719
Is it possible to treat soul shifters

2
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:14,847
and turn them back into humans
even after they have run wild?

3
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,185
We are not treating him
to turn him back into a human being.

4
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:23,731
We are merely trying to keep him
conscious enough for him to speak.

5
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:29,737
So you are not looking for a way
to bring them back.

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,990
Once a soul shifter runs wild,
they are no longer human.

7
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:35,242
They are monsters.

8
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,039
They either feed off
the energy of human beings,

9
00:00:40,122 --> 00:00:42,291
or they get petrified.
It is one or the other.

10
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:51,300
We cannot stop them from running wild.

11
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:56,722
The ice stone.

12
00:00:58,849 --> 00:01:01,268
I heard the ice stone
carries the power of Hwansu.

13
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,354
Maybe that could stop them
from running wild.

14
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,982
Yes, maybe. However,

15
00:01:08,192 --> 00:01:12,029
that kind of power
should be forbidden to mankind.

16
00:01:25,584 --> 00:01:27,378
It looks like it is going to rain.

17
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:32,299
I did not even get to use
the energy of the Soul Ejector.

18
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,344
It looks like it will
get washed away by the rain.

19
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:38,389
Can the energy of the Soul Ejector
disappear due to the rain?

20
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:41,058
The power of the ice stone
came from the skies.

21
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,727
Thus, its power can
also be taken away by the skies.

22
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:07,626
I wonder if that girl tried to summon
the power of the skies

23
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,171
to make the ice stone disappear.

24
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:16,468
Jin Bu-yeon.

25
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:20,973
If she were alive,
she would have become a great priestess

26
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:24,226
who could even control
the energy of the skies.

27
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,835
You are fine.

28
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,380
Look. I am all right too.
You did not run wild.

29
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:14,026
The ceiling above the constellation basin
has opened.

30
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:16,987
-Was it not always open?
-No.

31
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:19,031
It may seem like it,

32
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,784
but I was told that it was not.

33
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:24,119
Who told you that? Your father?

34
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:28,749
He said the only way to open
the ceiling above the constellation basin

35
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:31,293
is by the energy
of a constellation recorder mage.

36
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,671
How did this open?

37
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:37,007
In any case, it seems like
we did something we should not have.

38
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,425
I wonder what happened.

39
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:41,512
It was me.

40
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:44,974
I opened it.

41
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,851
My energy seeped inside the water.

42
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,437
Just like at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho

43
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,898
and inside the Mirror of Longing.

44
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:57,027
This water enabled me
to get my energy back.

45
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,464
What do you mean lightning struck?

46
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,591
There was a loud noise coming from
the Constellation Recording room.

47
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:23,429
That is where Eunuch Kim
and Jang Uk are right now.

48
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:33,355
It is the energy of the Soul Ejector.

49
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,942
I felt the same dark energy
when Gil-ju attempted to shift souls.

50
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:40,612
What is the matter?

51
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:44,283
I cannot see just like how I could not
when I came out of the mirror.

52
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:46,368
I feel dizzy and nauseous.

53
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,537
Jin Mu will be back soon. We must leave.

54
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:02,342
Oh, right. The door.

55
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:07,389
The door is locked with his energy,
the constellation basin is damaged,

56
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,891
and the soul shifter is dead.

57
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:11,393
This is bad.

58
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,646
There is an exit for servants
next to the constellation basin.

59
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:17,858
My father used to take me out
through that exit.

60
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:20,444
But we will still be inside Cheonbugwan.

61
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,618
You cannot see,
and I do not know my way around here.

62
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:32,372
If we get lost,
the mages here will catch us.

63
00:05:32,456 --> 00:05:34,708
If we stay here,
Jin Mu will come and kill us.

64
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,543
I am not strong enough to defeat him.

65
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,966
I am going to call my savior for help.

66
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:46,095
-Your savior?
-It is someone I know.

67
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:51,642
A person who will come running over
with a fluttering heart.

68
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:53,769
My savior.

69
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,254
Uk, you must be mad.

70
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,553
You heard a loud noise inside?

71
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:30,681
Yes, but you told us not to go inside,
so we did not.

72
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:33,475
Yeom-su, follow me.
The rest can stay and guard the door.

73
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,368
Jang Uk broke the barrier and escaped.

74
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,286
Assistant Gwanju.

75
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:54,371
The constellation basin…

76
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:57,416
What happened to the constellation basin?

77
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,002
I must find him.

78
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:01,962
I cannot let Uk leave this place alive.

79
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,339
Move this body to the Secret Room.

80
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,050
-Do not let anybody see you.
-Yes, sir.

81
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,809
Seal all the exits of Cheonbugwan.

82
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,686
Then find Jang Uk and his maid.

83
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,772
If they try to fight, you may kill them.

84
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:21,815
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

85
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:40,167
Uk will never manage to find his way
out of this maze-like place.

86
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,961
He will get lost and get caught.

87
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:46,298
But then again,

88
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:51,178
maybe he knew he would get lost
and just decided to hide instead.

89
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,266
You almost fooled me.

90
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:58,769
Are you here?

91
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:02,523
I noticed you broke
the water barrier I had made.

92
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:04,650
How about I make one with fire this time?

93
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:09,071
If I surround this place with fire,

94
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,907
maybe it will get hot enough

95
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:14,284
for you to finally show yourself.

96
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:18,413
Try to convince me like you did earlier
instead of trying to blackmail me.

97
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:22,626
Why should I when I have nothing to lose?

98
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,964
You are a trespasser who came unannounced
and broke the constellation basin.

99
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:29,091
And as the Assistant Gwanju
of Cheonbugwan,

100
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:31,134
it is my duty to get rid of trespassers.

101
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:37,266
You are being too harsh
to a guest who came bearing gifts.

102
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:40,811
Are you angry that we turned
your friend here into stone?

103
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:41,979
What friend?

104
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:47,192
I do not recall seeing anyone else here
other than you, your maid, and myself.

105
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:50,070
I see you plan to hide that mass of rock.

106
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:52,364
But here is some bad news.

107
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,368
-You will get caught.
-That will not happen.

108
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:59,746
Because you and your maid will soon die.

109
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:01,915
Now show yourself.

110
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:03,625
Come on out!

111
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,738
Did you see it?

112
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:35,115
A bolt of lightning struck
near Cheonbugwan.

113
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:37,784
Cheonbugwan is right next to the palace.

114
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,537
I must go and see
if everyone is all right.

115
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,456
That bolt of lightning was enormous.

116
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:44,958
I do hope Jin Mu got hit by it.

117
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:01,475
It is a pity.

118
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,103
I bet you came here elated,

119
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,397
hoping to become the Gwanju one day.

120
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,066
But instead, your death awaits.

121
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:10,901
You are one unlucky man.

122
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,403
That is too bad.

123
00:10:14,154 --> 00:10:15,280
If I were to die,

124
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,616
you would have easily become the Gwanju.

125
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:19,284
However, that will not happen.

126
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,369
What?

127
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:24,623
Have you heard of the yin-and-yang jade?

128
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:28,627
It consists of
a pair of red and blue jade.

129
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,296
If you fill one with energy,
the other reacts to it.

130
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,714
If they are close by,

131
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,550
the two will find each other
no matter what.

132
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,761
What about that?

133
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:39,304
Of the two,

134
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,140
the blue jade is
in the Crown Prince's possession.

135
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,352
That is a nice jade.

136
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:47,979
I got it in exchange for ten gold toads.

137
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:49,231
Is it something valuable?

138
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,026
So what if he has that?

139
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,320
I had the other red jade.

140
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,948
I filled it with energy,
which means the Crown Prince

141
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,409
is on his way here to find it.

142
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:12,045
Are you going to kill me and take it?

143
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:16,174
I figured you would do that,
so I hid it somewhere else.

144
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,138
I filled the red jade
with energy and hid it

145
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:23,181
inside the robe
of the eunuch that ran wild.

146
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:36,653
The Crown Prince is
probably on his way to that mass of rock.

147
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,325
Imagine how he would react
when he sees that body.

148
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:45,829
Gosh, he will get quite the shock.

149
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,301
Cheonbugwan.

150
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:03,889
Jang Uk is somewhere inside Cheonbugwan.

151
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:13,023
Rather than killing me,

152
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:15,901
you should go stop the Crown Prince.

153
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,115
I will be back.

154
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,702
You will never be able
to leave this place anyway.

155
00:12:37,464 --> 00:12:39,466
-Where did you put Eunuch Kim?
-In the Secret Room.

156
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:42,093
If you give me your order,
I will take his body outside.

157
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:53,063
Where…

158
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:59,611
It is not here.
That little punk fooled me again.

159
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:04,032
Assistant Gwanju, sir.

160
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:06,910
I know you ordered not to let anyone in,
but we had no choice.

161
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:10,163
What? Is the Crown Prince here?

162
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,206
Yes.

163
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,502
So he was not lying about
the yin-and-yang jade.

164
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:33,228
Assistant Gwanju.

165
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,398
Did a eunuch serving the royal family
really turn out to be a soul shifter?

166
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,195
And I heard you tried to kill Uk
to keep that a secret.

167
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,197
That is a big misunderstanding,
Your Royal Highness.

168
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,527
You even tried

169
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,238
to use my maid
as prey for that soul shifter.

170
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:29,242
You better have a good excuse
for this to be a misunderstanding.

171
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:44,507
Are you asking about Cho Chung,
the man who used to work

172
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:46,801
as a constellation mage at Cheonbugwan?

173
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:51,056
I heard Jang Gang
and Cho Chung were very close.

174
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:52,182
Yes, they were.

175
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,601
They were very good friends.

176
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:56,937
He visited our home often.

177
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,066
He made funny jokes,
and he was a warm-hearted man.

178
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,860
Cho Chung got involved with sorcery,

179
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,571
and that eventually wiped out
his entire family.

180
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,239
He was such a good man.

181
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,410
It is still hard to believe
that such a thing happened to him.

182
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:17,666
Cho Chung had a daughter.
Did you also know her?

183
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,001
Yes, I remember her.

184
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:24,255
She was always right beside her father
and was very close with him too.

185
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:26,383
I heard she also disappeared
amid the chaos.

186
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:28,176
I am guessing

187
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,470
that she is dead.

188
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:33,765
Why do you think so?

189
00:15:33,848 --> 00:15:37,769
Master Jang Gang tried to find that girl
for a very long time.

190
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,982
If she was still alive,
he would have found her already,

191
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:44,025
unless someone was purposely hiding her.

192
00:15:45,276 --> 00:15:46,695
Madam Do-hwa had passed away.

193
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:49,698
His best friend had
ended up in such a state.

194
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:52,993
Master Jang was not
in his right mind back then.

195
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,913
He blamed himself for both their deaths

196
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,165
and was in great agony.

197
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,836
He left home
to find his friend's daughter,

198
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:05,130
and I thought
he would come back once he did.

199
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:06,673
But…

200
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:11,261
it is odd that he would leave home
for 20 years just to find a little girl.

201
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:14,723
I am starting to worry that maybe
he has not returned

202
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:16,266
because of another reason.

203
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:20,478
If he had found the girl 20 years ago,

204
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,898
her life would not have been so hard.

205
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:27,944
And Jang Gang would not have had
to feel so guilty.

206
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,571
"Guilty"?

207
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:33,616
Are you implying that what Master Jang did
to his friend was wrong?

208
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:36,327
He punished someone who practiced sorcery.

209
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,371
That was the right thing to do as a mage.

210
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:42,542
No matter how close they may have been,
it was not wrong of him to punish him.

211
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:46,880
You cannot judge what is right or wrong
merely based on the things you see.

212
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,966
There are stories to everything.

213
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,261
And fate is made up of
many stories and relationships.

214
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:55,221
Are you implying that
the ill-fated relationship

215
00:16:55,305 --> 00:17:00,226
between the Cho family and the Jang family
has not yet ended?

216
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:02,896
By any chance,

217
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:07,901
are you saying that a member
of the Cho family is in this household?

218
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,196
Did Songrim find the girl?

219
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,075
That girl…

220
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:18,536
is dead.

221
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,085
I see.

222
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,087
Poor thing.

223
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:30,256
I should hold a memorial service for her.

224
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:34,761
Maidservant Kim.

225
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:37,430
You are very warm-hearted.

226
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,474
It is not a gesture of kindness.

227
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:42,727
I just do not wish her spirit
to remain in this world

228
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:44,729
and harass Young Master Jang.

229
00:17:45,313 --> 00:17:49,609
What if her spirit
is indeed lingering by Uk?

230
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:52,654
I should get rid of it.
She would have become an evil spirit.

231
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:54,572
I cannot let such a thing linger by him.

232
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,951
An evil spirit?

233
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:03,540
Where is Mu-deok?

234
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:04,833
Mu-deok?

235
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,503
I sent her to Cheonbugwan
to run an errand.

236
00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:17,053
Are you all right? Can you see?

237
00:18:17,804 --> 00:18:19,639
Yes, I can see now.

238
00:18:20,223 --> 00:18:21,307
And you, Young Master?

239
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,643
Did you get hurt anywhere?

240
00:18:23,726 --> 00:18:24,853
I am all right.

241
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:27,313
What does it mean when two people
share something that should be a pair?

242
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,607
It means they are married or a couple.

243
00:18:33,027 --> 00:18:36,197
Songrim's leader has come to Cheonbugwan
as you have ordered, Your Royal Highness.

244
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:58,511
You came to Cheonbugwan

245
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:01,931
to give honey biscuits
to the Assistant Gwanju?

246
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,852
Yes, I heard you two had an argument
over honey biscuits.

247
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:08,771
Maidservant Kim did not want him
to stay upset,

248
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:10,857
so I brought what she had sent him.

249
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,358
What a feeble excuse.

250
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:14,569
The leader of Songrim

251
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:17,655
and Assistant Gwanju of Cheonbugwan
fighting over honey biscuits?

252
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,701
Even if that were true,
you could have left right away.

253
00:19:21,784 --> 00:19:23,995
Why were you in the main room
with the constellation basin?

254
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:26,414
I wanted to see the constellation basin.

255
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:29,292
However, I ended up seeing something
that I should not have.

256
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:34,130
Are you sure you saw a soul shifter?

257
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,675
Yes, he locked me inside a barrier
to hide that fact

258
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,303
and threw Mu-deok to
the soul shifter so he could feed on her.

259
00:19:40,386 --> 00:19:41,846
He is lying.

260
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,517
Jang Uk entered the main room
of Cheonbugwan without permission

261
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:48,519
and damaged the constellation basin.

262
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:50,939
Now that he finds himself in trouble,

263
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:53,942
he is making up an absurd lie
about a soul shifter.

264
00:19:55,818 --> 00:19:57,528
I am sure it was a soul shifter.

265
00:19:57,612 --> 00:19:59,572
He ran wild and got petrified.

266
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,783
My maid and I both saw it.

267
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,952
When I arrived,
I did not see the body of a soul shifter.

268
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:05,620
He probably hid it somewhere.

269
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:07,455
You need to block all the exits

270
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:10,375
and find the body of the soul shifter
before he takes it out.

271
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,590
I guess the truth will be revealed
once we find the soul shifter's body.

272
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,429
I shall summon the mages of Songrim
and investigate Cheonbugwan.

273
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,933
No. I cannot let him
search through Cheongbugwan

274
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:29,352
based on a ridiculous lie.

275
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,317
Jang Uk.

276
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:39,529
Did you say the soul shifter
was a royal eunuch?

277
00:20:39,612 --> 00:20:40,488
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

278
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:44,200
I saw him beside the Queen
the day you came to Songrim for a duel.

279
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,828
Eunuch Oh,
which eunuch was there that day?

280
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:49,497
Eunuch Kim, Your Royal Highness.
He serves the Queen.

281
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,835
Then we just need to check
whether or not he is in the palace.

282
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,045
Go and check if he is there.

283
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,172
That will be unnecessary.

284
00:21:21,362 --> 00:21:22,613
The Queen is here!

285
00:21:22,697 --> 00:21:24,282
Bow before her!

286
00:21:31,914 --> 00:21:32,999
Mother.

287
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,627
The Assistant Gwanju
told me what happened.

288
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:38,629
I was shocked, so I came here myself.

289
00:21:42,258 --> 00:21:45,219
Is it true that a soul shifter
was found here?

290
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,264
The eunuch who served you
was a soul shifter.

291
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,933
He ran wild and got petrified
here at Cheonbugwan.

292
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:55,021
-Is that so?
-That is not true.

293
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,982
No soul shifter ran wild here.

294
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,275
It is simply a lie

295
00:22:00,568 --> 00:22:02,236
that Jang Uk is making up.

296
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,949
Let us see if it is a lie or not
after we search for the eunuch's body.

297
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:13,623
Who is this soul shifter eunuch
that he claims to have seen?

298
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:16,000
Eunuch Kim.

299
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:26,969
Eunuch Kim came here with me.

300
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,524
Eunuch Kim, come inside.

301
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,223
Is he the eunuch

302
00:23:13,307 --> 00:23:15,226
that you claim to have seen

303
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,478
run wild?

304
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,273
Yes.

305
00:23:20,356 --> 00:23:22,984
You said he got petrified.

306
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:25,403
But he is well and alive.

307
00:23:26,821 --> 00:23:28,072
You are right.

308
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:33,619
He is completely fine.

309
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,463
The only way to get out of this situation…

310
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:50,011
is to bring this thing back to life.

311
00:24:06,152 --> 00:24:07,778
He is fine even after he ran wild.

312
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,948
If that is the power of the ice stone,

313
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,492
it means I can save Mu-deok
even if she ever runs wild.

314
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,411
Mu-deok.

315
00:24:16,704 --> 00:24:18,581
We must have been mistaken.

316
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:21,792
I guess so, Young Master.

317
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,631
You were not mistaken. You blatantly lied.

318
00:24:26,714 --> 00:24:28,799
He is standing there completely fine,

319
00:24:29,675 --> 00:24:31,844
so I guess that means I was lying.

320
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:38,267
He tried to lie his way out

321
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,562
because he got scared that
he broke the constellation basin.

322
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,855
Uk.

323
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,983
Is that true?

324
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,239
Yes, it is true.
Everything I said was a lie.

325
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:57,286
You entered Cheonbugwan without permission
and broke a valuable possession.

326
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,207
Then you made up a lie
to get yourself out of the situation?

327
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,001
I apologize. I am sorry.

328
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:08,464
This was done by a mage of Songrim,

329
00:25:08,547 --> 00:25:11,384
so allow me to apologize on his behalf.

330
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,013
I would also like to apologize
to Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu.

331
00:25:20,184 --> 00:25:24,814
Songrim will fix
the broken constellation basin.

332
00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:28,401
That is unnecessary.

333
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:29,694
Do not refuse.

334
00:25:29,777 --> 00:25:32,238
It is only right that
we take full responsibility.

335
00:25:33,948 --> 00:25:35,408
-No.
-Your Highness.

336
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,661
Please give Songrim a chance
to make up for our mistake.

337
00:25:40,955 --> 00:25:42,498
You should let them do that, Mother.

338
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,419
You may do as you wish.

339
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,630
I shall head back now.

340
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:15,406
I will send our people to Cheonbugwan
starting from tomorrow

341
00:26:15,489 --> 00:26:17,366
and have them fix what has been damaged.

342
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:21,412
As for now,
I should head back to punish our mage

343
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:24,707
for having deceived the royal family
and the people of Cheonbugwan.

344
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,209
-Let us go.
-Nonsense.

345
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:31,213
Jang Uk will stay and get punished here.

346
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,262
I also think that is…

347
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:41,098
My goodness, Your Royal Highness.

348
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,601
Please help my young master.

349
00:26:44,226 --> 00:26:46,395
Do not let him get taken to Songrim.

350
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,818
If he gets taken there,
he might get flogged to death.

351
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,697
Last time,

352
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,908
he got flogged 100 times in Songrim.

353
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,702
This time, it will only be worse.

354
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,913
Please do not let that happen.

355
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,124
Mu-deok, that is enough.

356
00:27:09,126 --> 00:27:12,254
What I did was wrong.
It is only right for me to get punished.

357
00:27:15,883 --> 00:27:18,052
I failed to show courtesy
to His Royal Highness.

358
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,431
I have no right to ask for mercy.

359
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:26,352
Then are you going to let them
drag you away and kill you?

360
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:29,271
If that is what the leader wants,
then yes.

361
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:32,983
Oh, goodness.

362
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,408
You can take me.

363
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,578
My goodness, Young Master!

364
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,288
But you will die!

365
00:27:46,914 --> 00:27:50,960
Goodness, you will die if you go back!

366
00:27:53,587 --> 00:27:58,050
I will punish him adequately.

367
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,931
Hey. You there.

368
00:28:08,477 --> 00:28:10,521
Uk will be punished severely.

369
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:12,231
So just forget about what happened.

370
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,817
How ridiculous.

371
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,943
But then again,

372
00:28:16,485 --> 00:28:18,988
the honey biscuit story
was absurd to begin with.

373
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,324
The leader of Songrim
and Assistant Gwanju of Cheonbugwan

374
00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:24,034
fighting over honey biscuits?

375
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:25,995
Goodness.

376
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,164
What an outrageous excuse.

377
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:30,833
Right.

378
00:28:33,252 --> 00:28:35,171
But how did the constellation basin break?

379
00:28:38,132 --> 00:28:40,092
If it got struck by lightning,

380
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,636
it means the ceiling
above the constellation basin was open.

381
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,931
But I thought only those
who have reached Chisu could open it.

382
00:28:46,932 --> 00:28:48,142
That is correct.

383
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,689
Jang Uk could not have reached Chisu.

384
00:28:57,985 --> 00:29:00,029
I wonder how this broke.

385
00:29:05,993 --> 00:29:09,955
Was there another mage here
who had reached Chisu?

386
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:12,374
But that would be impossible.

387
00:29:28,891 --> 00:29:32,144
We were able to get out of there
thanks to you, Mu-deok.

388
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,021
If you try to hold on, people let go.

389
00:29:34,104 --> 00:29:36,273
If you let go, people try to hold on.

390
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:40,152
So you caused a fuss on purpose?
That was clever of you.

391
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:43,155
I did not think
they would be convinced by you,

392
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,449
so I got involved without any permission.

393
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,576
I am sorry to have flustered you.

394
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:51,497
I did not expect that,
so it is true that I was flustered.

395
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:54,667
But you did well.

396
00:29:56,335 --> 00:29:57,545
My lord.

397
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:59,588
We were not lying.

398
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:03,342
We clearly saw Eunuch Kim run wild
and get petrified.

399
00:30:03,425 --> 00:30:04,718
I know you were not lying.

400
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:07,721
I may be slow-witted at times,

401
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:09,682
but I can tell lies from the truth.

402
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:12,393
A petrified soul shifter
came back to life.

403
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:16,105
Does that mean they have the ice stone?

404
00:30:16,897 --> 00:30:18,566
Songrim has been

405
00:30:19,525 --> 00:30:22,278
keeping our eyes on Jin Mu.

406
00:30:22,945 --> 00:30:24,446
It is just as expected.

407
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,701
I guess they really do have the ice stone.

408
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:38,586
Did you insert the ice stone
inside my body?

409
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:41,005
Its power is truly astounding.

410
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,425
It really feels like I am still alive.

411
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,138
Was it Jang Uk who caused you
to become petrified?

412
00:30:50,055 --> 00:30:53,100
Just as I was about to suck out
his servant's energy,

413
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:57,688
my energy suddenly started
to leave my body,

414
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,982
and I lost consciousness.

415
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,653
Did you also not see Jang Uk open
the ceiling above the constellation basin?

416
00:31:05,362 --> 00:31:06,572
No, I did not.

417
00:31:07,823 --> 00:31:10,367
Was there another mage there
other than Jang Uk?

418
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,578
No, there was not.

419
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,915
What if Jang Uk has reached Chisu already?

420
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:17,958
Maybe he is just hiding it.

421
00:31:19,668 --> 00:31:23,297
When he tried to attack me,
he did not seem that skilled.

422
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,508
He mastered Ryusu
in an extremely short amount of time.

423
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,677
So it is possible.

424
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,682
Now that I have the ice stone,

425
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:36,977
does that mean I am capable of Hwansu?

426
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,399
You do possess the power of it.

427
00:31:43,442 --> 00:31:46,320
However, you do not know
how to practice spells.

428
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:49,281
Therefore, you are unable to use it.

429
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,790
But this ice stone is mine now.

430
00:31:57,873 --> 00:32:00,834
I only brought you back to life
momentarily because it was urgent.

431
00:32:54,763 --> 00:32:56,765
So the ice stone
really does have the ability

432
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,351
to stop a soul shifter
from getting petrified.

433
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,854
We must find it and destroy it.

434
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:06,275
We should be getting rid of soul shifters,
but it brings them back to life.

435
00:33:06,358 --> 00:33:08,193
Its power is truly evil.

436
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:10,904
But that is…

437
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,243
Uk, word will get out
about your punishment,

438
00:33:16,326 --> 00:33:18,162
so you should not be in Songrim.

439
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,247
Stay at home for a while.

440
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,168
Yes, my lord.
Mu-deok and I will head home.

441
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:28,589
Be careful not to cross paths with Jin Mu.

442
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,841
I will.

443
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,011
Let us go.

444
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:44,396
He will get rid of the ice stone
as soon as he finds it.

445
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,398
We need to find it before he does.

446
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,067
Gil-ju was right.

447
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,487
The ice stone is inside the palace.

448
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:55,199
Then the Danju who possesses the ice stone

449
00:33:56,158 --> 00:33:57,451
must be that person.

450
00:34:01,747 --> 00:34:04,124
Take care of everything quietly.

451
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,794
I will have Court Lady Han take his place.

452
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:09,088
You may relay your messages through her.

453
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:10,923
Yes, Your Highness.

454
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:15,803
Because of what happened today,
Songrim will start suspecting me.

455
00:34:16,386 --> 00:34:21,016
This all happened
because you underestimated Jang Uk.

456
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,436
I had no idea
he would break free so easily.

457
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,772
He is a genius
who instantly reached Ryusu.

458
00:34:26,855 --> 00:34:29,024
He was born with the energy
of the King's Star.

459
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,734
I did not underestimate him
from the start.

460
00:34:31,693 --> 00:34:33,320
I also figured he might be special

461
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:36,198
because he was born
with the energy of the King's star.

462
00:34:36,281 --> 00:34:39,535
However, Jang Uk turned out to be
a complete disappointment.

463
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:42,329
He was just an average boy
with nothing special about him.

464
00:34:45,415 --> 00:34:49,086
He was angry at the world,
and he hid his helplessness and indolence

465
00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:53,298
by putting on a cold-hearted mask.
He never did anything with a goal.

466
00:34:53,882 --> 00:34:56,343
He was just a young master
who was full of himself,

467
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:59,263
so all one ever had to do was appease him.

468
00:35:00,222 --> 00:35:02,141
That means he has changed.

469
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:04,852
I thought he was weak.

470
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:07,729
But he opened his gate of energy
by consuming poison.

471
00:35:07,813 --> 00:35:11,150
I thought he liked to show off,
but he actually beat the Crown Prince.

472
00:35:12,192 --> 00:35:14,278
Why do you think
he changed all of a sudden?

473
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:16,196
People change…

474
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,158
because of other people.

475
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,203
Find out who showed up
just when he began to change.

476
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:27,416
That will be your answer.

477
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,840
Jang Uk was rejected by 12 masters,
but has finally found his way…

478
00:35:38,468 --> 00:35:40,137
Who could have helped him do that?

479
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,476
Master, should we go straight
to Danhyanggok?

480
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:50,439
Thanks to my punishment,
we have some time.

481
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,774
Let us train at Danhyanggok.

482
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:55,652
We can also try climbing up that tree.

483
00:35:59,781 --> 00:36:01,742
It is freezing right now at Danhyanggok.

484
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:05,120
If we get stuck there due to the snow,

485
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:07,581
we could starve to death.

486
00:36:07,664 --> 00:36:10,667
I thought it was warm during the winter
and had a lot to eat.

487
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:13,086
I heard you say that to Yul last time.

488
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:20,344
I only said that to put him at ease.

489
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:28,227
He was worried that his pet bird
might have suffered during the winter,

490
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,728
so I told him that.

491
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:34,942
You mean the bird he always called
using his whistle at Danhyanggok?

492
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,967
Uk was almost killed by Jin Mu.

493
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:05,389
I apologized for what Uk did
and got him out of there.

494
00:37:05,472 --> 00:37:08,225
But Jin Mu might try to harm Uk.

495
00:37:11,353 --> 00:37:14,606
Fortunately, I insisted on
fixing the constellation basin,

496
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,400
so we have access to Cheonbugwan.

497
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:22,030
I want you to go to Cheonbugwan
along with Songrim's laborers

498
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,366
and keep an eye on Jin Mu.

499
00:37:25,742 --> 00:37:27,077
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

500
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,671
Sang-ho.

501
00:37:38,588 --> 00:37:41,341
I heard Mu-deok was
also at Cheonbugwan today.

502
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,093
Is she all right?

503
00:37:43,176 --> 00:37:44,469
She is fine.

504
00:37:47,973 --> 00:37:51,643
By the way, did the soul shifter
who ran wild and got petrified

505
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,562
really come back to life?

506
00:37:53,645 --> 00:37:57,107
That is why the leader had to leave
without being able to say anything.

507
00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:01,403
How did Uk react to that?

508
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:03,864
He actually did not seem too flustered.

509
00:38:04,406 --> 00:38:07,200
He kept asking the leader
if the soul shifter who ran wild

510
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:09,911
was able to come back to life
thanks to the ice stone.

511
00:38:09,995 --> 00:38:12,039
He already seemed to know
about the ice stone.

512
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:17,544
So he saw a soul shifter come back to life
with his own two eyes.

513
00:38:17,627 --> 00:38:20,088
The leader told him
that they must be destroyed.

514
00:38:21,256 --> 00:38:23,258
Both the soul shifters and ice stones.

515
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,510
He said we must
get rid of all things that are evil.

516
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,807
What did Uk say to that?

517
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,809
This is just my hunch,

518
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,312
but he seemed to disagree.

519
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:39,399
Uk is always carefree and easygoing.

520
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:43,445
However, he should not keep that attitude
toward sorcery as well.

521
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:46,490
You and Uk are close.

522
00:38:46,573 --> 00:38:48,575
So you should warn him about it.

523
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:03,256
Not only is Danhyanggok cold,

524
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,675
but it would also mean
we would have to be alone.

525
00:39:06,551 --> 00:39:08,887
We should refrain from doing that
from now on.

526
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:11,223
Why all of a sudden?

527
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:15,143
I am scared that…

528
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:19,314
I might devour your energy.

529
00:39:19,898 --> 00:39:23,151
You did not run wild.
Nothing happened even after we touched.

530
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,570
I clearly absorbed
the energy of that eunuch.

531
00:39:26,154 --> 00:39:27,572
I may seem fine now,

532
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,117
but we never know
when that might happen again.

533
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,412
Feel free to run away,

534
00:39:34,204 --> 00:39:35,956
or kill me if you must.

535
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,335
But if I devour your energy until you die…

536
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,047
That will be unbearable.

537
00:39:53,098 --> 00:39:54,307
Why are you laughing?

538
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,476
Is this funny to you?

539
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,603
No, it is not that.

540
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,732
You made my heart race.

541
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,903
What you just said…

542
00:40:08,196 --> 00:40:10,574
holds a deeper meaning
than saying, "I missed you."

543
00:40:13,618 --> 00:40:15,996
The cruel assassin has finally replied

544
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,958
to my naive and sincere love confession.

545
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,052
I will find the ice stone

546
00:40:31,761 --> 00:40:35,015
so that you will never feel the need
to devour my energy.

547
00:40:42,063 --> 00:40:44,191
You will have to go against Park Jin.

548
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:47,110
Then I will become just as strong.

549
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,493
You lost nine duels in a row
to the mages of Jeongjingak.

550
00:40:55,785 --> 00:40:57,120
Stop putting on airs.

551
00:41:00,415 --> 00:41:03,960
Right, the yin-and-yang jade.
I should get that back first.

552
00:41:05,128 --> 00:41:08,715
But how did you call the Crown Prince
through the yin-and-yang jade?

553
00:41:10,592 --> 00:41:12,802
There is a way to do that. It really…

554
00:41:13,887 --> 00:41:15,597
It really makes your heart race.

555
00:41:35,742 --> 00:41:38,411
Jang Uk, the so-called intruder,
had no sword.

556
00:41:39,871 --> 00:41:42,832
But Jin Mu had one
although he claimed to be innocent.

557
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,138
Young Master.

558
00:41:57,222 --> 00:42:00,100
Master Lee, what are you doing
at our house?

559
00:42:00,183 --> 00:42:02,227
What about you?
Should you not be at Songrim?

560
00:42:03,478 --> 00:42:05,063
He is here on probation.

561
00:42:07,482 --> 00:42:09,192
"Probation"? Did you get punished?

562
00:42:09,943 --> 00:42:11,778
What did you do this time?

563
00:42:11,861 --> 00:42:13,238
No, that is not it.

564
00:42:13,321 --> 00:42:16,157
Maidservant Kim, do not get too shocked.

565
00:42:16,241 --> 00:42:17,576
This is sort of like…

566
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,996
fake probation.

567
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:24,207
It is more like a vacation
disguised as probation.

568
00:42:27,502 --> 00:42:28,837
He is right.

569
00:42:30,338 --> 00:42:31,381
That is good to hear.

570
00:42:32,632 --> 00:42:35,802
Let us fish at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho
starting from tomorrow.

571
00:42:37,262 --> 00:42:38,513
Good idea.

572
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:42,934
You should enjoy your time here
by spending time with Young Master Jang.

573
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:43,977
Gosh.

574
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,647
No, Maidservant Kim.
I am in no position to slack around.

575
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,107
Master Lee, I apologize.

576
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,735
I have already lost nine out of ten duels.

577
00:42:51,818 --> 00:42:53,612
I only have one more duel left.

578
00:42:54,279 --> 00:42:57,032
I plan to use this time to train.
I hope you understand.

579
00:42:58,366 --> 00:43:01,411
You have become very diligent
all of a sudden.

580
00:43:01,494 --> 00:43:04,664
Yes, my goal is
to make Maidservant Kim proud.

581
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,708
I cannot slack around and go fishing.

582
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:11,838
These days, you touch me
with your words every single day.

583
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:13,590
All right.

584
00:43:13,673 --> 00:43:15,133
Go ahead and train.

585
00:43:15,216 --> 00:43:18,053
Meanwhile, I will cook
a delicious late-night snack.

586
00:43:26,811 --> 00:43:29,981
Tell me the truth.
Why are you on probation?

587
00:43:34,027 --> 00:43:36,279
I went to Cheonbugwan
and broke the constellation basin.

588
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,199
Please do not tell Maidservant Kim.

589
00:43:39,282 --> 00:43:42,243
I did see the lightning strike
from the skies right above Cheonbugwan.

590
00:43:42,327 --> 00:43:43,787
I guess that hit the constellation basin.

591
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:48,375
We cannot tell you anything in detail,
but it was not Young Master Jang's fault.

592
00:43:49,876 --> 00:43:52,337
The leader of Songrim
will tell you what happened.

593
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,548
I will lend you my fishing rods.

594
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:57,467
Back when I used to enjoy fishing,

595
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,136
I collected several
high-quality fishing rods.

596
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,096
I will bring them.

597
00:44:06,434 --> 00:44:07,644
What a pity.

598
00:44:09,354 --> 00:44:13,108
I was going to teach him
how to catch a Golden Fish.

599
00:44:14,067 --> 00:44:15,110
A Golden Fish?

600
00:44:15,693 --> 00:44:19,197
You mean the legendary golden fish
that can only be found

601
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,865
in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?

602
00:44:21,574 --> 00:44:22,826
Do you know what it is?

603
00:44:22,909 --> 00:44:26,121
I have heard of it.
A fish that grows with the lake's energy.

604
00:44:26,204 --> 00:44:30,417
I heard it can only be caught
by mages who have mastered Chisu or above.

605
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,669
You really are knowledgeable.

606
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,296
That feeling of catching a Golden Fish
as you control

607
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,006
the energy of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho…

608
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,759
It is ecstatic.

609
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:44,764
Please teach Young Master Jang
what that feels like.

610
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:45,849
He said he is busy.

611
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:48,226
Master Lee.

612
00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:50,186
Master Lee, look at this.

613
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,355
This is the best one.
It was made with bamboo--

614
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,983
He is not busy. Starting tomorrow,

615
00:44:55,066 --> 00:44:57,944
Young Master Jang
will go fishing with you.

616
00:44:59,487 --> 00:45:01,489
What do you mean? I need to train.

617
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:04,868
Right now, you need to fish,
not practice with a sword.

618
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:09,247
Go to Lake Gyeongcheondaeho
and catch a Golden Fish.

619
00:45:09,914 --> 00:45:11,082
What?

620
00:45:23,636 --> 00:45:25,096
This looks like a nice spot.

621
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:27,140
No, Master Lee.

622
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:31,519
I have fished here before.
The water is too cold here.

623
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:34,355
Fish do not swim here
because there are no lake weeds.

624
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,901
On top of that, we did not even bring
any of the nice fishing rods.

625
00:45:37,984 --> 00:45:41,404
When catching a Golden Fish,
you must use a rod that bends easily.

626
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:43,990
Just like this one.

627
00:45:45,658 --> 00:45:47,869
Is this bait for the Golden Fish?

628
00:45:48,453 --> 00:45:49,621
They are snacks.

629
00:45:49,704 --> 00:45:53,124
Maidservant Kim packed some snacks
for Master Lee.

630
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:56,753
Maidservant Kim is a very kind woman.

631
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,255
Where is the bait?

632
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,424
We need worms or mudfish as bait.

633
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:02,926
What? My goodness.

634
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,679
Do you fish with no bait?

635
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:10,058
I told you already.
Golden Fish feed off of energy.

636
00:46:10,808 --> 00:46:13,478
My energy will
flow along this bamboo stick,

637
00:46:14,103 --> 00:46:16,022
and that will act as bait.

638
00:46:17,607 --> 00:46:18,608
Your energy?

639
00:46:19,692 --> 00:46:22,779
Young Master Jang, go ahead
and follow what he is doing.

640
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,364
Go on.

641
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:35,375
Now we just need to control
the energy of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho

642
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:37,669
and wait until a Golden Fish bites.

643
00:46:45,176 --> 00:46:46,261
Mu-deok.

644
00:46:46,844 --> 00:46:49,931
I feel like a fool doing this.
Must I continue?

645
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,523
It bit!

646
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:11,369
That is what you call a Golden Fish.

647
00:47:12,036 --> 00:47:15,665
It is a mass of water that is formed
with the energy of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

648
00:47:16,332 --> 00:47:19,586
Only masters of Chisu and above
who have the ability to control water

649
00:47:19,669 --> 00:47:21,337
are able to catch it.

650
00:47:24,048 --> 00:47:25,466
I have not fished in a long time.

651
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:28,845
But I must say, it still feels great
to catch a Golden Fish.

652
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,683
So it is not an actual fish?

653
00:47:34,267 --> 00:47:36,561
Master Lee did not bring you here to fish.

654
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:40,315
He is here to teach you
how to master Chisu.

655
00:47:41,232 --> 00:47:42,567
Only those who are able

656
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:45,528
to fish out the mass of energy
from Lake Gyeongcheondaeho

657
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,364
can master Chisu.

658
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,451
"Chisu"?

659
00:47:59,917 --> 00:48:02,211
Slowly.

660
00:48:02,295 --> 00:48:03,171
All right.

661
00:48:03,254 --> 00:48:06,257
No, you are too hasty. Slow and steady.

662
00:48:06,966 --> 00:48:08,468
-Slowly.
-No.

663
00:48:21,522 --> 00:48:23,733
Cheonbugwan must have found
another blind lady.

664
00:48:23,816 --> 00:48:26,235
Young Lady Jin says
they bring in several blind ladies

665
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,196
from all over the country every day.

666
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,659
-Let us go.
-All right.

667
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,131
So are you saying

668
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:50,093
there could be a soul shifter
hidden inside every family

669
00:48:50,176 --> 00:48:52,220
that took part in murdering Naksu's father

670
00:48:52,303 --> 00:48:54,305
and that we should use Jinyowon's relics

671
00:48:55,348 --> 00:48:56,516
to find them?

672
00:48:56,599 --> 00:48:58,810
We were going to wait
until the soul shifter

673
00:48:58,893 --> 00:49:01,312
that ran wild at Daegangtongun
regained consciousness,

674
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,189
but we cannot do nothing until then.

675
00:49:03,272 --> 00:49:04,691
The truth is,

676
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:07,777
last night, we found another soul shifter.

677
00:49:09,028 --> 00:49:10,363
Yes, I heard.

678
00:49:10,446 --> 00:49:14,033
The soul shifter of a eunuch
was found in Cheonbugwan.

679
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:17,412
Jin Mu must have already paid you a visit.

680
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:22,875
My brother, Jin Mu, told me that
Songrim sent an intruder to Cheonbugwan

681
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:26,754
and tried to frame him. He was very upset.

682
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,966
If we want to find out if he is innocent
or is actually using sorcery,

683
00:49:30,675 --> 00:49:34,679
we need the relics of Jinyowon
and the power of its leader.

684
00:49:34,762 --> 00:49:36,097
Please help me.

685
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:38,933
I am sorry,

686
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,811
but I refuse.

687
00:49:43,813 --> 00:49:47,567
It is extremely disgraceful for a mage
to be accused of sorcery.

688
00:49:48,401 --> 00:49:49,861
If we go around

689
00:49:49,944 --> 00:49:54,198
investigating mages with our relics
without any kind of clear evidence,

690
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,910
it will anger many people
and cause them to resent Jinyowon.

691
00:49:57,994 --> 00:49:59,328
I heard Jin Mu

692
00:50:00,204 --> 00:50:02,915
has been in search
of your eldest daughter.

693
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:07,170
Did he ask you
not to cooperate with Songrim

694
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,922
in return for helping you
find your daughter?

695
00:50:10,506 --> 00:50:12,383
-That is irrelevant.
-No, it is not.

696
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:16,971
Your recent attitude toward Songrim
has suddenly changed.

697
00:50:17,054 --> 00:50:20,516
Do you always expect me
to do what you tell me to do?

698
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,976
Is that the attitude you want?

699
00:50:23,394 --> 00:50:27,315
We, the people of Jinyowon,
do not take orders

700
00:50:27,398 --> 00:50:28,900
from Songrim.

701
00:50:28,983 --> 00:50:30,818
-Lady Jin--
-Please leave.

702
00:50:31,402 --> 00:50:34,489
There is someone I must meet.

703
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:48,252
Once they find your older sister,

704
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:51,756
there will no longer be
any obstacles to our love.

705
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:55,176
That is because Songrim and Jinyowon
have a close relationship.

706
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,011
Oh, and…

707
00:50:59,597 --> 00:51:00,723
Here.

708
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,811
This is the ornament
that I said was pretty last time.

709
00:51:05,478 --> 00:51:07,772
I thought someone had already bought it.

710
00:51:07,855 --> 00:51:09,440
How did you get it?

711
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:12,610
I paid that person
four times its original price.

712
00:51:12,693 --> 00:51:14,403
I thought you might like it.

713
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:16,572
I am extremely happy.

714
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:20,243
The fact that you are happy

715
00:51:20,326 --> 00:51:24,038
makes me the happiest man in the world.

716
00:51:35,132 --> 00:51:37,051
Why does Uncle look so upset?

717
00:51:37,134 --> 00:51:38,469
Did something happen?

718
00:51:39,512 --> 00:51:42,139
I think he had a big argument
with the leader of Jinyowon.

719
00:52:01,951 --> 00:52:04,328
I drew a dark red mole
behind her left ear.

720
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:10,084
Bu-yeon fell as a child,
which left a scar on her left arm.

721
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:15,047
Its length was
about one-third of a finger.

722
00:52:47,413 --> 00:52:50,583
You must go through this
to become Jin Bu-yeon, so endure it.

723
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:53,502
We will engrave every little mole, scar,

724
00:52:53,586 --> 00:52:56,756
and any other detail that
a mother would remember.

725
00:52:58,674 --> 00:52:59,759
Yes.

726
00:52:59,842 --> 00:53:03,387
I will pour acid on your skin
so that the scar will become more clear.

727
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:50,518
What kind of fish is Young Master Jang
trying to catch?

728
00:53:50,601 --> 00:53:52,353
All he does is go to that lake.

729
00:53:52,937 --> 00:53:55,481
I should go and bring them their food.

730
00:53:55,564 --> 00:53:57,566
I will ask Mr. Lee to do that.

731
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:59,777
I want you to stay
and help me with something.

732
00:54:01,612 --> 00:54:05,533
We need to clean the house
and cook for a memorial service.

733
00:54:07,034 --> 00:54:08,285
Whose memorial service?

734
00:54:08,369 --> 00:54:10,579
A young girl who died a pitiful death.

735
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,332
She had an ill-fated relationship
with our family,

736
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,418
so I wish to hold
a memorial service for her.

737
00:54:16,961 --> 00:54:18,295
Maidservant Kim.

738
00:54:18,379 --> 00:54:19,880
I am back from the temple.

739
00:54:19,964 --> 00:54:21,132
-All right.
-Here.

740
00:54:21,215 --> 00:54:23,551
The Buddhist monk wrote an oration.

741
00:54:24,885 --> 00:54:26,595
Goodness, this is great.

742
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,306
But where are their names?

743
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,559
He should have written the names
of the spirits.

744
00:54:31,642 --> 00:54:32,935
Goodness.

745
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,813
It is right there.
"Cho Chung and Cho Yeong."

746
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:39,358
Cho Yeong? That is my name.

747
00:54:39,942 --> 00:54:41,944
Oh, yes. I see it now.

748
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,571
"Cho Chung and Cho Yeong."

749
00:54:44,989 --> 00:54:46,323
What a nice oration.

750
00:54:46,407 --> 00:54:48,784
Mr. Lee, come with me.

751
00:54:49,326 --> 00:54:50,911
I need you to deliver food
to Young Master Jang.

752
00:54:50,995 --> 00:54:52,121
All right.

753
00:54:53,622 --> 00:54:55,708
Is Maidservant Kim
holding a memorial service

754
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:58,627
for me and my father?

755
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:39,543
It is mushroom rice, my favorite.

756
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:42,880
Maidservant Kim is such a great cook.

757
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,514
It bit! I got one!

758
00:56:02,024 --> 00:56:04,485
I put a worm on the hook earlier.
That is what it bit.

759
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,238
We can have it as a side dish.

760
00:56:12,785 --> 00:56:14,161
My gosh.

761
00:56:32,012 --> 00:56:33,013
Here.

762
00:56:38,936 --> 00:56:40,646
Do not rush yourself.

763
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:44,817
One day, you will feel
the same feeling that you feel

764
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,278
when a fish bites into a hook.

765
00:56:47,361 --> 00:56:50,948
That is what you call Chisu,
the ability to control energy.

766
00:56:52,658 --> 00:56:53,659
I see.

767
00:56:54,743 --> 00:56:57,705
Master Lee, you even taught me
how to read Words of the Heart.

768
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,708
May I ask why you keep trying to help me?

769
00:57:01,959 --> 00:57:04,837
By any chance, is it because of a reason

770
00:57:05,337 --> 00:57:08,382
that must be kept a secret?

771
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,760
It is not your concern.

772
00:57:11,844 --> 00:57:13,512
Did you think I would not know?

773
00:57:16,056 --> 00:57:17,516
It is regarding my family.

774
00:57:22,521 --> 00:57:24,106
It is because of Maidservant Kim?

775
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:29,320
I mean, you compliment her nonstop.

776
00:57:29,403 --> 00:57:31,739
And that scarf you are wearing.

777
00:57:31,822 --> 00:57:34,116
That is from the shop
that Maidservant Kim goes to.

778
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:36,368
She gave it to you, right?

779
00:57:37,411 --> 00:57:38,621
And most importantly,

780
00:57:38,704 --> 00:57:42,416
I saw the dried wildflowers
in Maidservant Kim's room.

781
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,752
There were a lot of them at Danhyanggok.

782
00:57:44,835 --> 00:57:46,378
You gave them to her, did you not?

783
00:57:47,963 --> 00:57:50,591
-Yes, I did.
-Gosh, I knew it.

784
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,969
But I thought you practiced chastity…

785
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:57,306
My feelings for her are not worldly.

786
00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:00,518
I just think she is beautiful
and warm-hearted.

787
00:58:00,601 --> 00:58:02,019
That is all there is to it.

788
00:58:02,561 --> 00:58:05,606
That is the same thing
as saying you like her.

789
00:58:05,689 --> 00:58:07,733
How can love between
a man and a woman not be worldly?

790
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:09,193
What about you?

791
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,905
You are a man and Mu-deok is a woman.
What does that make you two?

792
00:58:14,907 --> 00:58:16,492
Well, as for me…

793
00:58:18,118 --> 00:58:19,286
I do like her.

794
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:27,711
I cannot believe I am talking about this
with a man who practices chastity.

795
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:31,257
Anyway, Maidservant Kim
has feelings for someone else.

796
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,716
I hope you do not get hurt.

797
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,385
I should be saying that to you.

798
00:58:35,219 --> 00:58:37,846
I heard Mu-deok likes Yul.

799
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:40,516
Did Dang-gu tell you that?
What kind of worldly conversation is that?

800
00:58:40,599 --> 00:58:42,518
I do not just spend time with you.

801
00:58:44,645 --> 00:58:46,313
I learned that worldly conversations

802
00:58:47,147 --> 00:58:49,024
can sometimes be of help.

803
00:58:51,151 --> 00:58:53,237
Thanks to Yul's story
about his first love,

804
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,240
I was able to learn about Naksu,
the assassin.

805
00:58:59,243 --> 00:59:02,246
The girl he met at Danhyanggok
when he was young

806
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,707
turned out to be Naksu.

807
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,293
He knew it was her

808
00:59:07,376 --> 00:59:10,087
when he saw the whistle he gave her
on Naksu's dead body.

809
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:16,343
I know you overheard my conversation
with Jin at Sejukwon.

810
00:59:19,096 --> 00:59:21,724
Then I am guessing
you also know about Naksu's story.

811
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:27,396
You should go home early today.

812
00:59:28,355 --> 00:59:29,940
Maidservant Kim is going to hold

813
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:34,111
a memorial service for the little girl
who died a pitiful death.

814
00:59:50,586 --> 00:59:51,962
This is good enough.

815
00:59:52,546 --> 00:59:53,881
The constellation basin is fixed.

816
00:59:53,964 --> 00:59:56,925
So take all your laborers back to Songrim.

817
00:59:57,009 --> 01:00:00,137
No, it is not perfect yet.

818
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:01,680
We think it is good enough.

819
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,015
What is with you?

820
01:00:03,098 --> 01:00:04,475
Goodness, look at that.

821
01:00:04,558 --> 01:00:08,354
The lower part of the basin
is a different color from the top.

822
01:00:08,937 --> 01:00:10,981
We should exchange the lower part.

823
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,108
You have exchanged it many times already.

824
01:00:13,609 --> 01:00:14,943
We think it is fine.

825
01:00:15,027 --> 01:00:16,445
The leader of Songrim promised

826
01:00:16,528 --> 01:00:19,406
to return the constellation basin
to its original form.

827
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:21,784
We cannot let a single mistake slide.

828
01:00:23,285 --> 01:00:25,871
The construction normally takes
a day or two at most.

829
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:28,207
But it is taking quite a long time.

830
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:30,668
Do you feel uneasy
that we keep coming here?

831
01:00:30,751 --> 01:00:32,670
What is there to feel uneasy about?

832
01:00:32,753 --> 01:00:37,383
I just think Songrim is
wasting its time and money.

833
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,431
Do not worry about money
when it comes to Songrim.

834
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:49,395
Yul, the last time I saw you,
you seemed quite skilled.

835
01:00:49,478 --> 01:00:51,146
Have you mastered Chisu?

836
01:00:52,981 --> 01:00:54,066
Yes.

837
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:57,403
Then you must be
the first mage in Jeongjingak

838
01:00:57,486 --> 01:00:59,655
to have mastered Chisu.

839
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,325
Like father like son.
Your father, Seo Il, must be proud.

840
01:01:04,326 --> 01:01:06,078
He was a Jeongjingak mage?

841
01:01:07,746 --> 01:01:09,790
You cannot drag her against her will.

842
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:16,922
Can you stand?

843
01:01:19,174 --> 01:01:20,300
What are you looking at?

844
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:25,639
Is he a Jeongjingak mage?

845
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:28,183
-Is his name Seo Yul?
-Yes.

846
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:30,936
They are sons of prestigious families
and are out of your league.

847
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,439
Do not roam around and stay hidden.

848
01:01:39,903 --> 01:01:42,781
He may be out of my league
when I am So-i, a swindling vagabond.

849
01:01:46,034 --> 01:01:48,954
But once I become Jin Bu-yeon,
the future leader of Jinyowon,

850
01:01:50,622 --> 01:01:52,166
I might have a chance.

851
01:02:00,924 --> 01:02:03,635
It is for Master Jang's friend
and that friend's daughter.

852
01:02:05,971 --> 01:02:07,723
There are no graves for them,

853
01:02:08,724 --> 01:02:11,226
and I bet no one has held
a memorial service for them.

854
01:02:11,977 --> 01:02:13,812
So I figured I should at least hold one.

855
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:16,857
Maidservant Kim.

856
01:02:19,735 --> 01:02:20,986
Thank you.

857
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:23,322
What?

858
01:02:25,449 --> 01:02:26,909
That is what they would say.

859
01:02:27,993 --> 01:02:30,412
I bet they are extremely grateful.

860
01:02:32,122 --> 01:02:33,791
It relieves me to hear that.

861
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:37,753
Leave the incense sticks
until they burn out.

862
01:03:05,697 --> 01:03:07,908
CHO CHUNG, CHO YEONG

863
01:03:24,508 --> 01:03:28,470
CHO CHUNG, CHO YEONG

864
01:03:36,603 --> 01:03:37,813
Father…

865
01:03:50,158 --> 01:03:52,286
Young Master Jang went fishing.

866
01:03:52,369 --> 01:03:55,080
He will be back soon,
so you can wait for him inside.

867
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:58,417
Did Mu-deok also go with him?

868
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,711
Mu-deok is at home.

869
01:04:00,794 --> 01:04:02,337
She had to prepare for a memorial service.

870
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:19,229
CHO CHUNG, CHO YEONG

871
01:04:21,815 --> 01:04:23,150
If I had not left you there

872
01:04:24,484 --> 01:04:26,069
in the mountains,

873
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:34,036
you would not have to suffer this fate
where you have to hold your tears

874
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:37,247
and pretend to be someone else.

875
01:04:42,586 --> 01:04:44,171
But even now,

876
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:48,634
I cannot seem to step up

877
01:04:49,593 --> 01:04:51,637
and tell you that
I know who you really are.

878
01:05:04,691 --> 01:05:06,318
CHO CHUNG, CHO YEONG

879
01:05:12,407 --> 01:05:13,659
The incense sticks have burned out.

880
01:05:15,285 --> 01:05:16,328
Yes.

881
01:05:16,995 --> 01:05:18,038
They have.

882
01:05:18,622 --> 01:05:19,539
Were you here all along?

883
01:05:23,043 --> 01:05:24,378
Let us clean up.

884
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:07,212
When did you come back?
I heard you went fishing.

885
01:06:07,295 --> 01:06:09,339
Yes, I just got back.

886
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:10,757
Are you here alone? Where is Dang-gu?

887
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:13,593
He is busy for some reason.
I think he is meeting someone.

888
01:06:13,677 --> 01:06:14,928
I see.

889
01:06:16,179 --> 01:06:17,431
What brings you here?

890
01:06:17,514 --> 01:06:20,517
The leader ended your probation
and asked you to come back to Songrim.

891
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:23,520
That was faster than expected.

892
01:06:24,479 --> 01:06:27,691
Have a seat. Let us enjoy some drinks.
I need to talk to you anyway.

893
01:06:27,774 --> 01:06:29,401
Unfortunately, I cannot drink.

894
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,696
-I have to go back to Songrim.
-All right.

895
01:06:32,779 --> 01:06:35,907
Then I will tell you what I wanted to say
tomorrow at Jeongjingak.

896
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,160
You will be surprised.

897
01:06:39,828 --> 01:06:43,415
Uk, I will be returning
to Seoho Fortress soon.

898
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,044
I promised my father that

899
01:06:47,127 --> 01:06:49,713
I would only train at Jeongjingak
until I mastered Chisu.

900
01:06:50,422 --> 01:06:52,883
Master Heo wrote my father a letter,

901
01:06:52,966 --> 01:06:54,843
so he might order me to return soon.

902
01:06:55,427 --> 01:06:56,511
Then I will have to go.

903
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:58,180
But that place is too far away.

904
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:01,975
Dang-gu and I are
going to miss you so much.

905
01:07:03,643 --> 01:07:05,312
When I return to Seoho Fortress,

906
01:07:07,022 --> 01:07:08,857
there is someone I wish to take with me.

907
01:07:11,568 --> 01:07:13,528
-Who?
-I cannot tell you now.

908
01:07:15,655 --> 01:07:16,907
I will tell you once it is time.

909
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:20,869
I will be off now. See you tomorrow.

910
01:07:21,995 --> 01:07:23,080
All right. Bye.

911
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:58,782
Because I missed them.

912
01:07:58,865 --> 01:08:00,951
I liked them a lot.

913
01:08:04,746 --> 01:08:07,749
They can prevent that
by feeding on others' energy.

914
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:09,126
But once they do that,

915
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:11,795
they will no longer be humans,
but monsters.

916
01:08:13,004 --> 01:08:14,923
And it is our duty to protect this world…

917
01:08:15,882 --> 01:08:17,217
from such monsters.

918
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:23,431
I wonder if Yul knows everything.

919
01:08:24,724 --> 01:08:26,560
When I return to Seoho Fortress,

920
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:29,020
there is someone I wish to take with me.

921
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:36,903
Young Master.

922
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:38,113
Yes?

923
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:44,035
Is Seo Yul gone?
Maidservant Kim sent this for him.

924
01:08:51,334 --> 01:08:52,836
I guess he was talking about you.

925
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:56,673
What do you mean?
Did Seo Yul say something?

926
01:09:00,218 --> 01:09:01,845
I was told to return to Songrim tomorrow.

927
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:04,055
Is that why you look upset?

928
01:09:04,848 --> 01:09:06,933
Cha Beom will ask you

929
01:09:07,475 --> 01:09:09,936
to fight him for your last duel
as soon as you return.

930
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,146
You must be afraid of losing again.

931
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:13,523
I will not lose tomorrow.

932
01:09:16,276 --> 01:09:17,485
I finally caught it.

933
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:39,007
Today is Jang Uk's last duel.

934
01:09:42,177 --> 01:09:44,429
I have talked to the person
who I have made this bet with,

935
01:09:44,512 --> 01:09:46,264
and the prize for today's winner

936
01:09:47,098 --> 01:09:49,392
will not be a gold toad.
It will be something else.

937
01:10:03,823 --> 01:10:05,367
The winner of today's duel

938
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:08,078
will be winning that maid.

939
01:10:14,417 --> 01:10:16,086
I have agreed to serve…

940
01:10:18,004 --> 01:10:20,215
the winner of today's duel as my master.

941
01:10:29,849 --> 01:10:32,018
-What is going on?
-All right, then.

942
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:34,312
The person fighting Jang Uk
for his last duel.

943
01:10:35,063 --> 01:10:36,022
Step forward.

944
01:11:04,467 --> 01:11:05,385
Uk.

945
01:11:07,304 --> 01:11:09,097
The person you will be fighting against

946
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:11,599
is me.

947
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:10,992
Uk is someone who can potentially
bring chaos to the world.

948
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:13,286
What if he becomes the center
of the world's attention?

949
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:15,205
I only need those
who will definitely win the duel.

950
01:12:15,288 --> 01:12:17,791
Then I will beat Uk
and take her in as my maid.

951
01:12:17,874 --> 01:12:21,753
Did he master all of his opponents' spells
from his previous nine duels?

952
01:12:21,836 --> 01:12:22,796
I must find it.

953
01:12:22,879 --> 01:12:24,005
You must lose something as well.

954
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:26,091
Your heartwrenching love
will be thrown away.

955
01:12:26,174 --> 01:12:29,010
Only then can I see him without shame.

956
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:32,847
Ask around about Mu-deok.
Find out what kind of girl she is.

957
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:35,100
"Eyes brimming with sweetness," my foot.

958
01:12:35,183 --> 01:12:36,351
I am not a woman to you.

959
01:12:36,434 --> 01:12:38,937
-You better not say otherwise.
-Fine, do it!

960
01:12:40,146 --> 01:12:43,817
I like Young Master Jang very much.

961
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:51,825
