1
00:00:15,097 --> 00:00:17,141
Yul from the Seo family.

2
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:20,436
Do not come back here ever again.

3
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:28,235
If we meet again,

4
00:00:29,653 --> 00:00:31,280
I will kill you.

5
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:37,578
Wait--

6
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:06,440
I could not stop her from leaving.

7
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:09,693
I could not ask her why.

8
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:14,198
The moment she sliced
my sincerity in half,

9
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:18,285
I could no longer cherish
our memories together.

10
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:22,206
It became a secret
that I had to bury within my heart.

11
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,966
You are up early. Why are you out here?

12
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,555
Why…

13
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,015
did you come here?

14
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:45,104
I caught a bird. I will cook it for you.

15
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,483
I do not enjoy eating.

16
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,527
I will be cooking rice with chestnuts.

17
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:54,905
The chestnuts here are very sweet.

18
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,579
Danhyanggok has very sweet chestnuts.

19
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:16,218
I do not enjoy sweet things.

20
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:21,765
You could have just declined.

21
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:24,226
Given your power,
you could have killed me just now.

22
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,188
Do not overreact.

23
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:32,484
While it is true I pushed you away,
it was with no intention to kill.

24
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:34,153
So you did push me away.

25
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:36,697
Do not bother to prepare breakfast.

26
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,240
I will leave once Dang-gu wakes up.

27
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,868
Be my guest if you do not wish to eat.

28
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:58,886
Why are you still here?

29
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,014
I will eat before I go.

30
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:03,682
Prepare some food for me.

31
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,392
I thought you did not wish to eat.

32
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:08,270
I never said that.
Do not put words in my mouth.

33
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:15,319
Since you were drunk yesterday,
I thought you would still be hungover.

34
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:17,947
I only declined
because I did not want to burden you.

35
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:20,241
I understand.

36
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,201
In that case,

37
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:24,870
-I should rinse some more rice.
-Where is it?

38
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:28,249
-I will do it.
-Have you cooked rice before?

39
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:31,627
I have not, but I can do it
as long as you teach me.

40
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:34,171
It is quite simple.

41
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:38,300
Rinse it in water,
then pour in a decent amount of water,

42
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,843
and cook it on high heat.

43
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,846
Then let it sit for some time.

44
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:45,891
It is pretty simple.

45
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:57,069
You said you could do it if I taught you.

46
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:58,862
You said it was simple.

47
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,492
I was wrong. I am sorry.

48
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:06,704
Jeez. Look at this.

49
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:08,372
It is all burnt.

50
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:11,250
Let me make it up to you.

51
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,378
How about those vegetables?

52
00:04:14,461 --> 00:04:15,879
Teach me how to chop them.

53
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,470
-Jeez, what a waste of rice.
-Goodness.

54
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:31,687
Dang-gu.

55
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:33,689
Hey.

56
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:35,941
You should bathe here before you go.

57
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,901
The mineral water makes your skin soft.

58
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:39,570
Have some breakfast too.

59
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:40,988
Right.

60
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:43,198
Mu-deok and Yul
are making breakfast together.

61
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:45,492
-Together?
-Yes.

62
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,870
Yul is cooking rice with Mu-deok.

63
00:04:58,547 --> 00:04:59,423
Goodness.

64
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:03,927
I told you to cut
the green onions into big pieces.

65
00:05:08,932 --> 00:05:10,017
-This big?
-No.

66
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:13,228
Do you not understand
what "big pieces" mean?

67
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:14,897
Big pieces.

68
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:19,026
Big pieces…

69
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:20,402
You are wrong.

70
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,196
Those are too small.

71
00:05:23,947 --> 00:05:24,907
Like this.

72
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:28,911
Big pieces. Like this.

73
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,040
You should have elaborated more.

74
00:05:33,123 --> 00:05:36,043
How was I to know
when all you said was "big pieces"?

75
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:38,462
I thought you were
the best mage of Jeongjingak.

76
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:42,007
How could you not differentiate
what is big from small?

77
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,134
Forget it.

78
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,637
Pour a bowl of water into that soup.

79
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:55,437
Wait…

80
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,190
Which bowl are you talking about?

81
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,235
This one?

82
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,823
Or do you mean

83
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:07,449
this one?

84
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:11,495
That one.

85
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,587
Why does it look like
Mu-deok is scolding him?

86
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,840
Are you sure she likes him?

87
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:24,383
That is the type of girl she is.

88
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:28,595
She does not easily like
or feel shy in front of others.

89
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,060
Goodness. Look at Yul.

90
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,564
He is still learning well
despite being scolded.

91
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:43,068
-Learning?
-Look.

92
00:06:43,777 --> 00:06:45,571
I said that was enough.

93
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:48,407
I do not enjoy salty food.

94
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:50,075
Jeez.

95
00:06:52,035 --> 00:06:53,412
He was never like that

96
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:56,415
-Taste it yourself.
-in front of Master Heo or my uncle.

97
00:06:56,498 --> 00:06:57,708
This is interesting.

98
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,211
Does he not look like
an intimidated pupil?

99
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,671
It is bland, right?

100
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:06,508
See? You should have stopped
when I told you to.

101
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,012
-I am sorry.
-A cute master and her diligent pupil.

102
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:13,432
That is enough. It needs to boil down.

103
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:15,642
-A master and her pupil?
-Let it sit.

104
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,020
Why were you so stubborn

105
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:20,230
when this was your first time cooking?

106
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:28,363
All right.

107
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:32,075
Let me see how well you taught him
and how well you learned from her.

108
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,161
Let me have a taste.

109
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,834
It is tasty.

110
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,211
Tasty?

111
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,840
I seasoned it just as Mu-deok told me to.

112
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:51,011
Well done.

113
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:54,890
You must have been elated
to be complimented by your master.

114
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:58,769
I thought I was good at everything
since people called me a genius.

115
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:01,730
But I learned that there are things
I am not good at.

116
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:02,773
Mu-deok.

117
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:04,483
Thank you for helping me realize this.

118
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:08,737
It was frustrating
since he could not understand me at all.

119
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,490
But he was determined to keep learning.

120
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,825
That is why I kept teaching him.

121
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,745
Look at you exaggerating.

122
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,665
Is this a royal meal or something?

123
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:22,543
There are things you can learn
from preparing a meal.

124
00:08:22,626 --> 00:08:24,211
-You should learn as well.
-Sadly,

125
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:27,005
I do not have a great master like he does.

126
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:30,926
I am sorry, but the rice is a bit burnt.

127
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,679
-I see.
-You can learn how to do it again.

128
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:37,224
Mu-deok, do you think
Yul can do better next time around?

129
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:39,851
He is not completely hopeless.

130
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,603
Thank you for your words.

131
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,995
Why are you washing them alone?

132
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:00,205
Ask your wonderful pupil to help you.

133
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:04,001
He prepared the meal,
so I ought to clean up.

134
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:06,920
Were you happy to teach him?

135
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,797
Do you want him

136
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:10,549
to be your pupil?

137
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:12,634
It would have been easier
had he been my pupil.

138
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:15,304
He is diligent and obedient.

139
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:18,265
He is not lazy or reckless like you.

140
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:20,851
Master, do not cheat on me.

141
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,270
What?

142
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:25,647
I get that you like him
since he is diligent and obedient.

143
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,066
But I am your one and only pupil.

144
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,612
A master should not have
multiple pupils and vice versa.

145
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:34,906
Are you upset
because I taught Yul how to cook?

146
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,908
Yes, I am. How could you
teach someone else

147
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:39,036
when your pupil is standing
right in front of you?

148
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,788
If you are going to teach someone
how to cook, it should be me.

149
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,498
Teaching someone else
is betrayal and cheating.

150
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,294
I can try to understand the betrayal part.

151
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:48,587
But cheating?

152
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,130
I am speechless.

153
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,301
I am certain

154
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,220
that I sensed cheating.

155
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:05,771
What was that?

156
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:07,731
What is it this time?

157
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:09,566
Mu-deok, do not cheat on me.

158
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,068
It hurts and upsets me.

159
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:13,945
I did not know
my pupil was this possessive.

160
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,531
Fine. My one and only pupil

161
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:19,701
will be you who spews nonsense
first thing in the morning. Happy?

162
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,411
-But--
-Mu-deok!

163
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:23,413
Mu-deok!

164
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,916
Young Master.

165
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:30,337
Would I be cheating
if I addressed others as Young Masters

166
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:32,297
and answered their calls?

167
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,132
That cannot be helped.

168
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,718
But when you address them,

169
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,221
be a bit indifferent.

170
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:42,349
How ridiculous.

171
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:48,355
Young Master Park! I am coming!

172
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:51,483
Mu-deok, you are hurting my feelings.
I told you to be indifferent.

173
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,910
That is one tall tree.

174
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:06,373
Yul, was this the tree you wanted to see?

175
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:08,959
I think so.

176
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:12,421
I cannot believe it really exists.

177
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:23,515
How did you know that I was injured?

178
00:11:24,224 --> 00:11:27,018
There is a really tall tree nearby.

179
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,149
I can see the entirety
of Danhyanggok from up there.

180
00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:40,532
You can see the entirety
of Danhyanggok from up there.

181
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:45,996
Does that mean you have climbed up

182
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,415
that tree before, Mu-deok?

183
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:55,380
That was just my guess
since the tree was so tall.

184
00:11:57,257 --> 00:11:59,426
Then do you want to climb it?

185
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:01,178
Should I help you get up there?

186
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:04,473
Dang-gu, you cannot climb that tree.

187
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:07,893
You need to have mastered
at least Chisu to go up there.

188
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:10,145
Is that so?

189
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,272
Should I try?

190
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:13,857
Yes.

191
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,859
Maybe you could do it.

192
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:17,736
Mu-deok, go with him.

193
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:22,532
Do you want to go up there?

194
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:29,122
No, thank you.

195
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,334
I do not want to climb
such a special tree with just anyone.

196
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:38,089
"Just anyone"?

197
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:44,471
I guess she is too afraid to go up there.

198
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:45,889
Let us go.

199
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:59,277
I examined the core of his energy.

200
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,323
He was a commoner, not a mage.

201
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:07,494
I am certain that there are more victims.

202
00:13:07,577 --> 00:13:10,956
There is a soul shifter among us.

203
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,458
What should we do, Master Lee?

204
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,378
Locating the origin of
this sorcery is direr

205
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:17,963
than catching the soul shifter.

206
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,340
I suspect Cheonbugwan.

207
00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:25,178
This soul shifter
who had entered Songrim recently

208
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,056
was a constellation recorder mage there.

209
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:31,810
Also, the one who killed Naksu,
who died while soul shifting,

210
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:33,770
and destroyed all traces of her men

211
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,481
was Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu.

212
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:39,651
Naksu…

213
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:49,369
We identified him
with the possessions he had.

214
00:13:49,452 --> 00:13:50,579
Who was he?

215
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:53,039
He was a low-ranking servant
from Cheonbugwan.

216
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:56,585
What? Cheonbugwan was involved once again.

217
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:59,337
I will confront Jin Mu right now.

218
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,006
Follow me.

219
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:02,299
Yeom!

220
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:03,925
Yes?

221
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,719
Do not do anything.

222
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,724
You used to ruin everything
due to your recklessness back in the day.

223
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:12,893
You may have aged now,
but your temper remains.

224
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,478
I am sorry, Master Lee.

225
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:17,188
It is not the time yet.

226
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:21,234
We must observe Cheonbugwan discreetly.

227
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,611
Jin.

228
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,155
You have grown up well.

229
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,575
You used to wear a diaper and roam around.

230
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:31,912
I cannot believe you are all grown up
and leading your people.

231
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,792
Master Lee.

232
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,675
Who is he?

233
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:48,345
He was the pupil

234
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:52,307
of Master Seo Gyeong,
the founder of Songrim.

235
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,809
But he is so young.

236
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,270
He is not.

237
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:59,856
I still remember singing…

238
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:03,944
at his 100th birthday party.

239
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:09,074
I even danced.

240
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:15,705
Is this dog Gwigu?

241
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:22,379
So it was you
who took Gwigu from Jinyowon.

242
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,715
He will find the soul shifter.

243
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,969
Naksu was the one
who died while soul shifting, right?

244
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:29,886
Yes, Master Lee.

245
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,431
She was a notorious assassin
who was talented in spells.

246
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,353
Was it Naksu's soul that I sensed?

247
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,201
The one who has Jang Gang's sword

248
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:55,453
-is his son, Jang Uk, right?
-Yes.

249
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:59,374
Have you seen him before?

250
00:15:59,457 --> 00:16:01,334
I met a boy with a binding bracelet

251
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,587
and his maid who followed him around.

252
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:07,632
It was interesting.

253
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,267
Mu-deok packed us some chestnuts.

254
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,978
Yes, they are sweet.
Give some to Maidservant Kim as well.

255
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:20,937
Sure.

256
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:31,489
Why did you bring your father's sword?

257
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:34,367
Oh, that? Mu-deok brought it.

258
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,537
You are not going to train,
so why did you bring this precious sword?

259
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,664
Should I give it to Maidservant Kim?

260
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,459
You…

261
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:44,794
are not

262
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:47,297
his son.

263
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,926
Do as you wish.

264
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:57,307
-Let us go.
-Sure.

265
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:02,645
Did you say
you came here often to pick herbs?

266
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,859
Have you ever encountered someone
who lived here?

267
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:10,945
No, Young Master Seo.
Who would live in a place like this?

268
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,573
I see.

269
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:19,496
One more thing.

270
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:23,666
Did it get pretty cold during the winter?

271
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:26,544
Why do you ask?

272
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:30,423
I never came here during the winter.

273
00:17:33,426 --> 00:17:35,428
I worried whenever it started snowing.

274
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,015
I worried if it was too cold

275
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,852
or if things were all right amid the snow.

276
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:54,864
It is actually warmer

277
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,951
than you think.

278
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:04,040
The snow quickly melts in the sunny spots.

279
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,920
Is that so? I am relieved.

280
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:17,470
There is a variety of food
to eat during the winter

281
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:21,099
and many places
to take refuge from the snow.

282
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,354
-I bet this will be tasty.
-They are really sweet.

283
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:30,733
Should we stay a day more?

284
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,654
Mu-deok must really like him.

285
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,952
She does not

286
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:43,413
like him.

287
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:45,999
I am telling you. She does.

288
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,625
Look.

289
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:51,796
She does not look at us
the same way she looks at him.

290
00:19:00,263 --> 00:19:01,931
The wind keeps blowing.

291
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,317
Is it coming from her?

292
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,030
Dang-gu, let us go.

293
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:18,740
All right.

294
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,787
Goodbye, Mu-deok.

295
00:19:30,251 --> 00:19:31,294
Let us go.

296
00:19:38,676 --> 00:19:40,220
I will see them off.

297
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:55,151
-Bye.
-Bye.

298
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,279
Try to remember
where you had lost your Spirit Plaque.

299
00:19:58,863 --> 00:20:00,949
-I will.
-Lie low.

300
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:03,618
The Unanimous Assembly
was summoned because of you.

301
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:06,621
I guess all 12
of my former masters attended it.

302
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:09,540
They were all so heartless
to their former pupil.

303
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,086
They even mentioned
cutting off your energy flow.

304
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:16,089
-Why would they say that?
-What?

305
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:20,343
Because you avoided your duel by fleeing.

306
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:23,805
But it is a ridiculous duel.

307
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,723
And you did not want it either.

308
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,017
Nobody is expecting you
to come to that duel.

309
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:31,771
So just stay here
and be laid-back like always.

310
00:20:34,148 --> 00:20:35,858
The leader wanted to know something.

311
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,487
He asked if you were doing
as you were told.

312
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:42,740
You are

313
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:46,286
the result of your mother's love affair.

314
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:48,913
But we cannot allow you
to lead Cheonbugwan after your father.

315
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,166
So stop dreaming of becoming…

316
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,504
like your father.

317
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:59,132
Just stay a clueless Young Master

318
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:03,219
of the Jang family.

319
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:08,933
Can I tell him that you are?

320
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,935
Have I ever listened to anyone?

321
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,439
Tell him I am doing
the very opposite and being reckless.

322
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:18,860
Dang-gu, leave that here.

323
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:20,778
Why?

324
00:21:21,654 --> 00:21:23,948
I want to help Mu-deok catch a pheasant.

325
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:29,579
Goodbye.

326
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,628
Did we hurt his pride?

327
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:38,588
Let him be.

328
00:21:38,671 --> 00:21:41,174
We cannot ask him to come
and meet a dignified death.

329
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,476
So you retrieved the sword you threw away.

330
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,022
It hurt my pride to hear
that I was a laughingstock.

331
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:00,902
In that case, let us train
as if your life depended on it.

332
00:22:02,236 --> 00:22:03,362
You seem happy

333
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,866
to hear that your pupil
became a laughingstock.

334
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:10,078
Since we are on the topic,
let me add more motivation.

335
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:14,624
Your friends did not ask you
to return home with them.

336
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:17,460
Had they been in your shoes,
they would have fought to their deaths.

337
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:20,463
But they told you to hide and run away.

338
00:22:21,547 --> 00:22:22,673
Can you guess why?

339
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:27,720
That is because you are worthless.

340
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,599
Your tongue is sharp like a sword.

341
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:35,478
You do not hesitate to cut me
with your words. How merciless.

342
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:37,814
I would not hesitate
to stab you with a sword

343
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:39,899
if that could get you back on your feet.

344
00:22:39,982 --> 00:22:41,025
Yes, Master.

345
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,361
Keep stabbing your worthless pupil.

346
00:22:46,072 --> 00:22:48,116
Why are you not motivated
after what I said?

347
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,492
Why are you dispirited?

348
00:22:51,994 --> 00:22:54,205
Your spiteful words demotivated me.

349
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,415
I need to bathe and cool myself down.

350
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:00,169
Why does he bathe so much in one day?

351
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,754
You worthless and lazy scumbag.

352
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,172
I hope you burn yourself in hot water!

353
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:08,010
Unbelievable. What kind of a master
says such a thing to her pupil?

354
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:17,395
Did Uk not know
how he lost his Spirit Plaque?

355
00:23:18,354 --> 00:23:20,481
Maybe someone sold it
after he had dropped it,

356
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,817
and that is how those men got hold of it.

357
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,861
I heard there was a place
where they sold such plaques.

358
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,865
Keep tracking his Spirit Plaque.

359
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:31,325
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

360
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,660
How…

361
00:23:34,787 --> 00:23:37,081
is Uk doing?

362
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,253
He is doing well. He fishes and drinks.

363
00:23:43,337 --> 00:23:45,464
He has yet to unfasten
the binding bracelet.

364
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,885
You may go.

365
00:24:10,156 --> 00:24:11,616
It is not that heavy anymore.

366
00:24:11,699 --> 00:24:13,242
It does not hinder my movement either.

367
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,912
Some mages train with an iron rod
to strengthen their arms

368
00:24:15,995 --> 00:24:18,039
to better wield their swords.

369
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,709
You were unknowingly
strengthening yourself

370
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:24,003
by wearing that heavy bracelet all day.

371
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:25,504
It was not intentional,

372
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:27,882
but you found yourself
an excellent training tool.

373
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:30,718
You are extraordinarily lucky.

374
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:34,180
If I take this off,
I will be faster and stronger.

375
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:38,226
But if you fail to control yourself,
you will become even more reckless.

376
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:41,020
I…

377
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:42,688
Never mind.

378
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:49,695
What did you and Yul talk about?

379
00:24:52,114 --> 00:24:53,616
About Danhyanggok.

380
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:58,621
He asked how it was during the winter.

381
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,669
You have met Naksu

382
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:07,088
when you were young?

383
00:25:09,048 --> 00:25:12,093
I was still unsure after seeing her body.

384
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:14,720
But going to Danhyanggok
helped me confirm it.

385
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:15,888
That is why I am telling you now.

386
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:20,768
Danhyanggok is
a deep and dangerous valley.

387
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:23,521
A young girl cannot possibly
survive there on her own.

388
00:25:23,604 --> 00:25:26,315
It seemed like she was living in hiding.

389
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:30,111
After she learned
of my name and my family,

390
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:32,780
I was not able to see her again.

391
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,450
That must mean she recognized your name.

392
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:40,329
Tell me everything you know about her.

393
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,500
There is nothing.

394
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,877
I do not know her name or age.

395
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,422
Other than the cliff
where we called out for birds,

396
00:25:49,505 --> 00:25:51,173
I have never been to her abode.

397
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,262
There is one thing.

398
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:01,100
She once mentioned her father.

399
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,906
My father wrote down the stars.

400
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:20,244
I did not think much of it back then.

401
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,955
But writing down the stars
is what a constellation recorder

402
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,623
from Cheonbugwan does.

403
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,126
My lord.

404
00:26:27,626 --> 00:26:29,670
Among their constellation recorder mages,

405
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,673
do any of them have a grudge against us?

406
00:26:35,676 --> 00:26:36,969
A constellation recorder

407
00:26:38,304 --> 00:26:39,638
from Cheonbugwan?

408
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,725
A mage?

409
00:26:47,563 --> 00:26:51,233
Twenty years ago, there was
one constellation recorder mage who died

410
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:54,570
in the hands of the four families.

411
00:26:56,447 --> 00:26:59,742
His entire family
lost their lives that day.

412
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:01,827
Except for one member.

413
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,705
His one and only daughter disappeared.

414
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,983
So our family was involved

415
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,861
in her father's death.

416
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:38,155
She must have been hostile toward you

417
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,574
because your family was involved
in her father's death.

418
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:43,577
Is there anything else that you remember?

419
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:45,830
This was a very long time ago.

420
00:27:46,872 --> 00:27:48,582
I do not remember anything else.

421
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,274
Because I missed them.

422
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,777
The broken leg did not bother me.

423
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,654
And I was not scared to get scolded.

424
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:24,910
I liked them a lot.

425
00:28:34,128 --> 00:28:38,257
I saw you using that
to summon your bird a few times.

426
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,427
I would also like to try.

427
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:44,346
Can I have that?

428
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,862
The Crown Prince is powerful.

429
00:29:42,488 --> 00:29:46,909
There is only one way
my pupil can subdue him and stay alive.

430
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,203
Tansu.

431
00:30:23,237 --> 00:30:24,989
What do you want me to do?

432
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,617
Slice through the water drops
as they fall.

433
00:30:30,035 --> 00:30:31,328
They are not raindrops.

434
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,789
Even someone unskilled as you

435
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,333
can slice through
such slow-moving water drops.

436
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:37,877
Go on.

437
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:01,066
Only three drops in one breath.

438
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:03,110
That does not matter.

439
00:31:03,193 --> 00:31:06,739
Tansu, the skill you will master,
will only require you to slice one.

440
00:31:06,822 --> 00:31:07,948
Tansu?

441
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:10,659
Look here.

442
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,663
I understand that I am a quick study,

443
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,081
but mastering Tansu is pushing it.

444
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,751
I guess having 12 masters
in the past has taught you something.

445
00:31:18,834 --> 00:31:19,835
That is correct.

446
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,713
You can only learn that skill
once you have mastered Chisu.

447
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,341
You barely mastered Ryusu,

448
00:31:25,424 --> 00:31:28,052
yet you are still struggling
to control your energy.

449
00:31:28,135 --> 00:31:29,970
A subpar pupil like you cannot learn it.

450
00:31:31,305 --> 00:31:32,431
But?

451
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,391
But that is the only way

452
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,356
for you to fight against the Crown Prince
and come out alive.

453
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,935
Tansu is swordsmanship that involves
flicking energy with your sword.

454
00:32:18,018 --> 00:32:19,812
Your right arm may lack the skills,

455
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,107
but it has become stronger
thanks to the binding bracelet.

456
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,109
Just one drop.

457
00:32:26,193 --> 00:32:29,196
Hit one waterdrop
so you can gather and flick your energy.

458
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,293
You will not master it that quickly.

459
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,421
Let us eat and resume.

460
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,762
Tansu?

461
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:37,347
He will never master that skill.

462
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,895
That is not a relationship
of a maid and her young master

463
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,647
but that of a master and her pupil.

464
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:26,081
Mu-deok.

465
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,335
So you are training him.

466
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,257
I see he was studying Tansu.

467
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:37,342
Where did you learn that?

468
00:35:37,926 --> 00:35:41,930
Young Master Jang is quite knowledgeable
thanks to his former 12 masters.

469
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,057
Is he trying to run
before learning to walk?

470
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:46,268
He has a long way to go.

471
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:48,604
In any case, he should try.

472
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,899
His next step could lead him to his death.

473
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,113
Is your young master aware of that?

474
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,484
Why did you not dodge it?

475
00:36:35,567 --> 00:36:36,652
Seriously.

476
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,753
That is the result
of forcing your energy to come out.

477
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:57,965
Your arm could burst if this continues.

478
00:37:04,137 --> 00:37:07,474
It looks like it could rot.
Then you will have to cut it off.

479
00:37:08,141 --> 00:37:09,268
Are you serious?

480
00:37:13,438 --> 00:37:16,525
If the rotten energy spreads
throughout your body,

481
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,402
you could die.

482
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,382
The heat has subsided. You are fine.

483
00:37:40,465 --> 00:37:42,092
Rest up. That is the best remedy.

484
00:37:42,884 --> 00:37:43,885
What a liar.

485
00:37:46,054 --> 00:37:47,848
Everything he said was true, right?

486
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,225
But then again, whether I die of poison,

487
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,103
flogging, being stabbed,
or my hand exploding,

488
00:37:53,812 --> 00:37:57,190
this merciless master does not
worry about her pupil.

489
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:00,193
That is right.

490
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:05,115
It is because you are
extremely lucky and worthy.

491
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,201
Lying is becoming second nature to you.

492
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:13,457
I am just not trying to dispirit you.

493
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:17,210
I see. Thank you, my cruel master.

494
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:19,880
But stay away
when I am holding a sword from now on.

495
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:21,548
You almost got stabbed back there.

496
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:25,010
I only stood still
because I wanted you to control it.

497
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:26,928
I was not trying to hinder you.

498
00:38:27,012 --> 00:38:29,765
You were not hindering me.
I am just worried about you.

499
00:38:36,396 --> 00:38:38,440
Think of me as a mother bird
who is worried

500
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:40,567
about her egg cracking.
Can you even relate?

501
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,195
Whatever. What you did
barely made me crack.

502
00:38:43,278 --> 00:38:44,404
I could have dodged it.

503
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:46,365
It was not dangerous?

504
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:48,658
How could you have dodged it
when I was so fast?

505
00:38:48,742 --> 00:38:50,410
You were not that fast.

506
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,454
You little…

507
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:55,874
Could not dodge that, could you?

508
00:38:55,957 --> 00:38:57,459
You attacked without warning!

509
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:59,294
Really? Then I will warn you.

510
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,462
Mu-deok, your eyes.

511
00:39:01,463 --> 00:39:02,297
Jeez…

512
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,132
You bastard.

513
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,218
I cannot believe you fell for that again.

514
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:12,432
Do that again.

515
00:39:13,475 --> 00:39:14,935
From this up close?

516
00:39:15,018 --> 00:39:16,603
-Really?
-Try me.

517
00:39:21,316 --> 00:39:22,442
Mu-deok.

518
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:25,862
The blue marks are barely visible now.

519
00:39:26,738 --> 00:39:28,073
They were quite pretty.

520
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:35,539
And you should not provoke me
when we are this close.

521
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:37,499
Do you not think I would do

522
00:39:37,582 --> 00:39:39,000
something else from this distance?

523
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,257
I guess you understood what I meant.

524
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,260
Maybe there are things
I can teach you in this field.

525
00:39:52,722 --> 00:39:53,890
Jang Uk.

526
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:00,856
You must think I am naive
for having lived alone here.

527
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,567
Well, I guess.

528
00:40:05,527 --> 00:40:08,530
I will have you know
I can teach you in other ways too.

529
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:10,866
Such as?

530
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,291
Hey! You…

531
00:40:19,374 --> 00:40:21,543
A truly skilled individual attacks

532
00:40:21,626 --> 00:40:24,754
when their enemy least expects it.

533
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,132
Keep that in mind, my pupil.

534
00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:31,803
Unlike me, you poked me really hard!

535
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,513
Mu-deok.

536
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,517
Hey. Mu-deok.

537
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,529
Is that a new concubine?

538
00:40:50,363 --> 00:40:53,450
He does not even bother
to follow the formalities anymore.

539
00:40:54,075 --> 00:40:56,328
She is from a small family of mages
from the east.

540
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:59,664
A comet brushed past the Big Dipper
the day she was born.

541
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:03,460
At this rate, he will summon every woman
born with strange horoscopes.

542
00:41:03,543 --> 00:41:06,171
He just wants the King's Star.

543
00:41:17,182 --> 00:41:19,100
When the late king ascended the throne,

544
00:41:19,184 --> 00:41:23,396
it was prophesized that the next king
would have the energy of the King's Star.

545
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:27,275
The people of Daeho were delighted.

546
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,235
However,

547
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:31,446
your father who had an ordinary horoscope
ascended the throne next.

548
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,323
And you are no different either.

549
00:41:34,115 --> 00:41:35,659
So people started talking.

550
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,370
The divination was incorrect.

551
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:42,165
Gwanju Jang Gang fled
after giving such a ridiculous divination.

552
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,292
Your father believes in it.

553
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:46,628
That is why you are afraid.

554
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,549
I am not afraid.

555
00:41:50,632 --> 00:41:53,426
You are afraid that someone
with that energy will appear

556
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,679
or that your father
may have a son like that.

557
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,390
I am aware of that.

558
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,563
Your duel against Jang Uk
is around the corner.

559
00:42:04,646 --> 00:42:07,983
Eliminate the son of that man
who gave such a terrifying divination.

560
00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:12,404
You must get rid of your fears
when you can.

561
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:16,199
Do you think

562
00:42:17,075 --> 00:42:18,535
he will even show up that day?

563
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:20,620
I heard he fled.

564
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:25,000
Rumor has it that he is even
contemplating marriage to avoid it.

565
00:42:26,167 --> 00:42:27,460
Marriage?

566
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:31,464
I heard he is marrying into the Jin family
so he can earn the Jin family's plaque.

567
00:42:37,887 --> 00:42:39,889
Uk and Cho-yeon are getting married?

568
00:42:40,682 --> 00:42:42,517
Did they not break off
their engagement before?

569
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,395
That is why
it is easier to prepare for it.

570
00:42:46,187 --> 00:42:49,399
She still had the marriage gifts

571
00:42:49,482 --> 00:42:51,651
from last time.

572
00:42:54,696 --> 00:42:55,780
I see.

573
00:42:56,281 --> 00:42:59,159
After the marriage ceremony, Jang Uk…

574
00:42:59,242 --> 00:43:02,203
I mean, my husband will move in here.

575
00:43:02,704 --> 00:43:05,206
But my current room
is too small for both of us.

576
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:09,753
Can we use
the big room in the east instead?

577
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:13,089
But that is your sister's room.

578
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:17,135
It is the best room we have.

579
00:43:17,218 --> 00:43:20,263
It is such a waste
to keep it vacant for over a decade.

580
00:43:21,264 --> 00:43:22,724
It was never vacant.

581
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:25,143
Bu-yeon will return.

582
00:43:26,561 --> 00:43:28,313
I am sorry, Mother.

583
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,942
Your father is looking for her.

584
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:37,197
Your sister will return home soon.

585
00:43:39,616 --> 00:43:41,993
Bring me the yin-and-yang jade
from Jinyowon.

586
00:43:44,412 --> 00:43:45,705
The yin-and-yang jade?

587
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,165
You have been wanting that.

588
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:51,753
They say when you and your lover
wear rings made of that jade,

589
00:43:51,836 --> 00:43:53,546
your love for each other deepens.

590
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,677
Craft your wedding rings with it.

591
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,846
Thank you, Mother.

592
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,747
What an annoying pot.
It was you, was it not?

593
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,791
How annoying.

594
00:44:36,756 --> 00:44:38,007
I guess it annoys you

595
00:44:38,091 --> 00:44:40,176
that I am getting married.

596
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,302
But wait and see.

597
00:44:41,386 --> 00:44:42,971
I will become even more annoying

598
00:44:43,054 --> 00:44:44,806
once I wear a ring made of this jade.

599
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:58,695
Eat up.

600
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:00,989
All right.

601
00:45:03,366 --> 00:45:05,869
I had brought home a pheasant earlier.

602
00:45:05,952 --> 00:45:07,912
So why are there only greens?

603
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,414
It is inside--

604
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:10,999
It is in the soup.

605
00:45:11,082 --> 00:45:12,834
The pheasant was so tiny.

606
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:14,669
There was not much left
after making that broth.

607
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,682
I do get a very faint taste of it.

608
00:45:32,687 --> 00:45:35,482
I overheard this
while selling herbs in Songrim.

609
00:45:35,565 --> 00:45:37,942
Two prominent families
will be marrying off their kids.

610
00:45:38,526 --> 00:45:40,445
Who will be getting married?

611
00:45:40,528 --> 00:45:43,448
Lady Jin's daughter is getting married.

612
00:45:44,157 --> 00:45:47,202
Cho-yeon is getting married? To whom?

613
00:45:47,285 --> 00:45:49,412
To the son of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju.

614
00:45:51,706 --> 00:45:53,082
Is that not you?

615
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:07,222
I was never told I was getting married.
What is going on?

616
00:46:07,305 --> 00:46:08,973
What is up Maidservant Kim's sleeve?

617
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,809
Most hastened weddings
tend to be shotgun weddings.

618
00:46:11,893 --> 00:46:12,936
That is not true.

619
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,104
You were previously engaged to her.

620
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:17,357
Maybe you could not control yourself.

621
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,652
How could she be pregnant
when we were never this close?

622
00:46:21,486 --> 00:46:23,613
Right. You are all talk.

623
00:46:23,696 --> 00:46:24,864
What?

624
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,824
Then why did you refuse
the chaste herb tea?

625
00:46:26,908 --> 00:46:27,909
That is because…

626
00:46:30,328 --> 00:46:31,996
I have plans to marry later on.

627
00:46:33,831 --> 00:46:35,583
You must want to get married one day.

628
00:46:36,876 --> 00:46:38,419
Yes, I do.

629
00:46:38,503 --> 00:46:39,629
I truly want to.

630
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,924
I will get married at all costs.

631
00:46:43,007 --> 00:46:44,259
Wait up.

632
00:46:59,482 --> 00:47:01,192
Why did you want to see me?

633
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:05,405
When will the mother-of-pearl cabinet
that I ordered from Songrim come?

634
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,282
It is for Uk and me.

635
00:47:07,365 --> 00:47:11,369
The trade from the south
will arrive in two weeks.

636
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,413
That will be too late.

637
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:15,873
I should have ordered sooner.

638
00:47:15,957 --> 00:47:17,834
Forget about the mother-of-pearl cabinet.

639
00:47:18,376 --> 00:47:20,295
You should inform Uk first.

640
00:47:21,629 --> 00:47:22,964
He has no idea about this.

641
00:47:25,049 --> 00:47:27,677
That is why
I have written a letter to him.

642
00:47:28,469 --> 00:47:29,929
Read it and share your thoughts.

643
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:32,765
Sure.

644
00:47:36,477 --> 00:47:37,604
It is fragrant.

645
00:47:37,687 --> 00:47:39,981
This is a perfume
that incurs the feeling of love.

646
00:47:40,898 --> 00:47:42,358
A treasure of Jinyowon.

647
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,738
Gosh, it is very fragrant.

648
00:48:08,551 --> 00:48:10,303
Why are you sniffing it?

649
00:48:10,386 --> 00:48:11,346
Stop that!

650
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,390
Hold your nostrils shut!

651
00:48:26,736 --> 00:48:28,571
I almost wasted the precious perfume.

652
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,493
Please give this to him.

653
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:37,288
And make sure there are no women
around him when he opens it.

654
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:40,917
I will.

655
00:48:46,255 --> 00:48:47,382
What are you doing?

656
00:48:47,465 --> 00:48:52,136
Uk's hand size is similar to yours, right?

657
00:48:54,138 --> 00:48:55,348
Why do you ask?

658
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,643
Come with me to get our wedding rings.

659
00:48:58,726 --> 00:49:00,061
Lend me your hand.

660
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,272
Why would I go there with you?

661
00:49:03,356 --> 00:49:04,524
Go with your groom.

662
00:49:05,566 --> 00:49:09,696
Marriage should only happen
when both sides agree to it.

663
00:49:10,321 --> 00:49:13,074
I pity you for being like this.

664
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:15,201
Why?

665
00:49:16,786 --> 00:49:18,746
Do you think I am getting ahead of myself?

666
00:49:19,455 --> 00:49:21,499
Do you think he will break it off again?

667
00:49:26,462 --> 00:49:29,173
Whether you are getting ahead
of yourself or not,

668
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,135
I will help you.

669
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,137
Just make sure it pans out.

670
00:49:39,183 --> 00:49:40,935
And I will lend you my hand.

671
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:51,696
Come to think of it,

672
00:49:51,779 --> 00:49:54,407
Maidservant Kim was against the
idea of me living with the wife's family

673
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,576
the last time we discussed
marriage with Cho-yeon.

674
00:49:57,952 --> 00:50:01,247
There is only one reason
why this is being discussed again.

675
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:02,957
She wants to save me.

676
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:05,793
She must have made
a deal with the Jin family

677
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,212
to avoid your duel with the Crown Prince.

678
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,298
She probably needed Lady Jin's help.

679
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,384
If that were the case,

680
00:50:14,427 --> 00:50:15,845
will you get married?

681
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,600
What should I do, Master?
Should I get married?

682
00:50:22,977 --> 00:50:24,103
Can I?

683
00:50:25,938 --> 00:50:29,650
If you do, we can
no longer stay in Danhyanggok.

684
00:50:30,234 --> 00:50:32,153
Right. I should return home.

685
00:50:32,236 --> 00:50:34,447
Even still,
we cannot have this relationship.

686
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:37,408
Why not? I can still keep you
by my side as my maid.

687
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,288
I have no plans
to stay by your side as just a maid.

688
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:02,141
You can go ahead alone.

689
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,726
I will be at Chwiseonru.

690
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:08,147
If you do not pick me up,
I will go back alone.

691
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:24,622
CHWISEONRU

692
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,087
What is going on?

693
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:32,839
We are from Cheonbugwan.

694
00:51:32,922 --> 00:51:34,799
We were told to escort you.

695
00:51:34,882 --> 00:51:35,716
Let us go.

696
00:51:39,136 --> 00:51:41,055
This is the Crown Prince's sachet.

697
00:51:41,138 --> 00:51:44,809
I have His Royal Highness' protection.
You cannot touch me.

698
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,481
What are you doing? Let me go!

699
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,441
This is the Crown Prince's sachet.

700
00:52:04,453 --> 00:52:06,664
We brought her
from Chwiseonru like he wanted.

701
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,083
Chwiseonru?

702
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,303
The girl you wanted is here,
Your Royal Highness.

703
00:52:20,928 --> 00:52:22,054
Where?

704
00:52:25,766 --> 00:52:26,851
Over here.

705
00:52:29,186 --> 00:52:30,146
Her?

706
00:52:30,688 --> 00:52:32,273
Lift your head up.

707
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,249
Why are you dressed like that?

708
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:52,335
I do not know.

709
00:52:52,877 --> 00:52:56,088
She did this to me
after I was dragged here.

710
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,216
Did you do that?

711
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,385
Is she not the gisaeng

712
00:53:02,261 --> 00:53:03,512
from Chwiseonru?

713
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,848
No, she is not.

714
00:53:07,391 --> 00:53:09,810
-She is Filthy Mu-deok.
-Filthy?

715
00:53:11,896 --> 00:53:13,147
Get out.

716
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,316
Go.

717
00:53:18,444 --> 00:53:19,695
Look at you.

718
00:53:23,908 --> 00:53:25,910
Why did you want to see me?

719
00:53:25,993 --> 00:53:29,830
I had something to tell you,
so I told them to get you.

720
00:53:29,914 --> 00:53:31,916
But you are not Filthy Mu-deok right now.

721
00:53:31,999 --> 00:53:33,626
Filth and silk do not go hand in hand.

722
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,921
Maybe in your dictionary, it does.

723
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,340
Did you just snap at me?

724
00:53:39,423 --> 00:53:40,967
No, Your Royal Highness.

725
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:44,011
I am grateful that you dressed someone
as filthy as me in silk.

726
00:53:45,638 --> 00:53:48,891
All right. This new look…

727
00:53:50,768 --> 00:53:52,144
does not suit you.

728
00:53:54,939 --> 00:53:58,401
Since you do not like it
and I am uncomfortable in this,

729
00:53:58,484 --> 00:53:59,735
let me go get changed.

730
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:00,903
No.

731
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:04,657
It is all right. Just keep it on.

732
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:11,205
Tell me what you want, and I will do it.

733
00:54:11,288 --> 00:54:13,582
Tell your young master

734
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:15,501
not to show up that day.

735
00:54:16,669 --> 00:54:18,004
I do not want to kill him

736
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:21,257
and become enemies with Songrim
or the Jang family.

737
00:54:21,966 --> 00:54:24,260
It is best that he fled,
and let us keep it that way.

738
00:54:25,803 --> 00:54:28,264
So he just needs to be the laughingstock.

739
00:54:28,931 --> 00:54:29,974
That is right.

740
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:33,894
If he becomes stubborn, dissuade him.

741
00:54:33,978 --> 00:54:35,896
He will die if he fights me.

742
00:54:38,482 --> 00:54:41,610
Tell him to stay hidden,
then get married to the Jin family.

743
00:54:42,903 --> 00:54:45,990
So it is true
that getting married will save his life.

744
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:51,037
What will happen to you
if he gets married?

745
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,246
Will you go with him?

746
00:54:52,913 --> 00:54:54,206
No, I will not.

747
00:54:54,832 --> 00:54:57,501
Why not? Did he refuse?

748
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,798
You were even willing
to drink filthy chamber pot water for him.

749
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,550
He knows neither loyalty

750
00:55:04,633 --> 00:55:05,968
nor duty.

751
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:11,390
He does know a bit, Your Royal Highness.

752
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,893
Are you taking his side?
You were always bad-mouthing him.

753
00:55:13,976 --> 00:55:15,770
I am sorry, Your Royal Highness.

754
00:55:16,729 --> 00:55:19,023
It would please you if I bad-mouthed him.

755
00:55:19,857 --> 00:55:23,611
But I have no energy
to run my mouth right now.

756
00:55:25,154 --> 00:55:27,782
You are a filthy mutt
who will be abandoned by its owner.

757
00:55:39,126 --> 00:55:40,169
Should I take you in?

758
00:55:42,296 --> 00:55:43,547
I can do that.

759
00:55:44,131 --> 00:55:46,425
There must be things you can do here too.

760
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,636
No, thank you.

761
00:55:50,054 --> 00:55:52,932
I may be a filthy girl
whom everyone avoids,

762
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,310
but I refuse to serve just anyone.

763
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:02,441
Forget it. I do not want
someone filthy by my side either.

764
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:05,111
-You may leave.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

765
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,201
I will go now,

766
00:56:12,785 --> 00:56:14,036
Your Royal Highness.

767
00:56:23,587 --> 00:56:24,964
"Just anyone"?

768
00:56:26,298 --> 00:56:27,591
But I am the Crown Prince.

769
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,677
Filthy Mu-deok does not know

770
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,303
to whom she is speaking.

771
00:56:48,779 --> 00:56:51,532
-Be gentle. Take your time.
-Yes, ma'am.

772
00:56:53,659 --> 00:56:54,493
Maidservant Kim.

773
00:56:55,911 --> 00:56:56,787
How have you been?

774
00:56:58,038 --> 00:56:59,123
Young Master!

775
00:56:59,748 --> 00:57:01,250
My dear Young Master!

776
00:57:03,252 --> 00:57:05,129
-Young Master!
-Were you worried?

777
00:57:05,212 --> 00:57:06,422
Have you been eating well?

778
00:57:06,505 --> 00:57:08,132
Yes, I have. I have been well.

779
00:57:08,215 --> 00:57:09,675
Goodness.

780
00:57:09,758 --> 00:57:11,260
Your skin is radiating.

781
00:57:11,343 --> 00:57:12,470
Oh, please.

782
00:57:12,553 --> 00:57:13,846
Let us go inside.

783
00:57:17,516 --> 00:57:19,351
Was she the one who tried to sell…

784
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,397
Songrim's Spirit Plaque?

785
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,407
It was not me. It was Mu-deok.

786
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,410
Mu-deok tried to sell Uk's Spirit Plaque?

787
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:38,746
I just introduced her to the seller.

788
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:40,831
In the end, Ae-hyang snatched it herself.

789
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:42,875
So Mu-deok and I are innocent.

790
00:58:00,601 --> 00:58:01,894
What is this?

791
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:05,523
Why are you dressed like that?

792
00:58:06,273 --> 00:58:07,983
It is a long story.

793
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,819
Have you returned to Chwiseonru?

794
00:58:11,695 --> 00:58:13,948
Did Uk send you back
since he is getting married?

795
00:58:14,031 --> 00:58:15,324
No, Young Master Seo.

796
00:58:15,407 --> 00:58:19,328
Even if that was the case,
I would never come back here.

797
00:58:19,411 --> 00:58:21,413
Ju-wol finally caved in and told me

798
00:58:21,497 --> 00:58:23,207
that you tried to sell Uk's Spirit Plaque.

799
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,379
Yes, I did.

800
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,172
Why?

801
00:58:31,298 --> 00:58:33,050
Because I needed money.

802
00:58:33,133 --> 00:58:35,844
I wanted to wear pretty clothes,
have good food,

803
00:58:35,928 --> 00:58:38,430
and have fun at places like this.

804
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:42,017
Was that the case
when you were drunk last time?

805
00:58:42,935 --> 00:58:46,188
That is correct. I stole
Young Master Jang's money and drank.

806
00:58:50,776 --> 00:58:52,820
I am just so puzzled by you.

807
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:57,032
I cannot understand you.

808
00:59:00,452 --> 00:59:02,746
You do not need to.

809
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,623
Just stay that way.

810
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,335
I am going inside.

811
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,087
Would you like to come with me?

812
00:59:10,879 --> 00:59:11,797
That is all right.

813
00:59:13,048 --> 00:59:14,174
Goodbye, then.

814
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:23,475
CHWISEONRU

815
00:59:27,354 --> 00:59:28,814
The Spirit Plaque…

816
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:33,360
So it was you, Naksu.

817
00:59:43,495 --> 00:59:44,622
Young Master.

818
00:59:46,415 --> 00:59:48,417
Why do you not want to get married?

819
00:59:50,252 --> 00:59:51,795
Do you dislike Young Lady Jin?

820
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:54,214
It is not that I dislike her.

821
00:59:55,257 --> 00:59:57,134
I am just not interested.

822
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,887
You have feelings
for someone else, do you not?

823
01:00:01,263 --> 01:00:02,473
Who is it?

824
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,558
Do I know her?

825
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:07,603
No, you do not.

826
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,396
So there is one.

827
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,731
I knew it.

828
01:00:10,814 --> 01:00:11,857
Who is she?

829
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,443
Well…

830
01:00:14,526 --> 01:00:17,446
She is like
a single bird egg on top of a tree.

831
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:21,617
I am the only one she has,
so how could I possibly get married?

832
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:24,620
Those kinds of girls
are the most dangerous!

833
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,955
Those who have nothing to brag about
but are just clingy!

834
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:28,540
She is not like that.

835
01:00:28,624 --> 01:00:31,085
Who is she? Tell me this instant.

836
01:00:31,168 --> 01:00:32,461
I will take care of it.

837
01:00:32,544 --> 01:00:33,712
Exactly how?

838
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,256
Once I give her
a silk pouch full of money,

839
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,926
she will crack out of her egg
and fly away.

840
01:00:39,009 --> 01:00:42,429
She cannot fly anywhere.
It is not that easy.

841
01:00:43,722 --> 01:00:45,849
In any case, I cannot get married.

842
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,142
So take care of it for me.

843
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:50,270
You better take care of it, got that?

844
01:00:51,063 --> 01:00:52,398
Young Master.

845
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,611
What is wrong? Are you hurt?

846
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:58,946
Let me see.

847
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,033
What happened to your arm?

848
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,495
Did it get out of control again?

849
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:15,337
Please sell that dress.

850
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:19,049
-It is made of silk, so make it worth it.
-All right.

851
01:01:19,633 --> 01:01:22,094
Our madam is tending
to a customer at the moment.

852
01:01:22,177 --> 01:01:23,887
Young Lady Jin from Jinyowon is here.

853
01:01:24,638 --> 01:01:28,183
She is looking for someone
who can craft her wedding rings.

854
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:30,102
She is marrying
a young master from Songrim.

855
01:01:34,064 --> 01:01:36,316
Then how about this one?

856
01:01:39,319 --> 01:01:43,031
These are the works
of Daeho's best craftsmen?

857
01:01:44,825 --> 01:01:47,703
They are stylish but a bit tacky.

858
01:01:49,329 --> 01:01:51,582
Then may I see the yin-and-yang jade?

859
01:01:51,665 --> 01:01:54,334
Seeing it for myself will help me
give you better recommendations.

860
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:01,175
They say when you and your lover
wear rings made of that,

861
01:02:01,258 --> 01:02:03,761
your love for each other deepens.

862
01:02:17,983 --> 01:02:19,693
Why did the jade break?

863
01:02:20,527 --> 01:02:22,905
It was fine when I took it with me.

864
01:02:28,702 --> 01:02:31,413
I see. That is when it broke.

865
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:35,501
Mu-deok.

866
01:02:42,174 --> 01:02:43,425
Young Lady Jin.

867
01:02:44,009 --> 01:02:46,303
Why are you suddenly leaving?

868
01:02:46,386 --> 01:02:49,473
That is Mu-deok. Is Uk here as well?

869
01:02:49,556 --> 01:02:50,766
No.

870
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,728
-I see.
-Since they are attached at the hip,

871
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:56,605
he must be somewhere in the fortress.

872
01:02:56,688 --> 01:02:58,482
Attached at the hip?

873
01:02:58,565 --> 01:03:00,275
As his maid, she is serving him.

874
01:03:01,401 --> 01:03:02,820
Watch what you say.

875
01:03:04,279 --> 01:03:07,866
Mu-deok is not just
any ordinary maid to him.

876
01:03:09,034 --> 01:03:12,496
He came by to pick Mu-deok up
when she was drunk recently.

877
01:03:13,163 --> 01:03:14,957
He adores her so much.

878
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,543
He even carried her on his back.

879
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:19,127
It is obvious

880
01:03:19,211 --> 01:03:22,923
that he picked her from the get-go
because she won his heart.

881
01:03:23,465 --> 01:03:26,760
Is Mu-deok from here? Was she a gisaeng?

882
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:28,303
She is one poor girl.

883
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:32,266
No wonder he cares about her so much.

884
01:03:46,613 --> 01:03:47,656
Hey.

885
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:50,075
You know who I am, right?

886
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:53,579
Of course, I do.

887
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:56,123
You are Young Lady Jin from Jinyowon.

888
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:01,253
You will have to address me
as "Lady" soon.

889
01:04:02,462 --> 01:04:06,133
Because I will marry
your young master soon.

890
01:04:07,676 --> 01:04:10,387
Goodness. Congratulations, my lady.

891
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:13,682
As your master's wife,
you will serve me too.

892
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,643
There is something you must do.

893
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,606
First, carry this.

894
01:04:21,648 --> 01:04:23,275
What is this?

895
01:04:30,115 --> 01:04:31,408
What was that?

896
01:04:32,576 --> 01:04:34,244
A broken stone?

897
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:39,249
It is a precious object.

898
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:41,460
If it breaks or cracks,

899
01:04:41,543 --> 01:04:43,587
you will have to take responsibility.

900
01:04:44,713 --> 01:04:47,382
Is she saying that
when it is already broken?

901
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,343
Take that and follow me.

902
01:04:50,594 --> 01:04:51,720
My lady.

903
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:54,306
You are not someone I must serve yet.

904
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:57,643
I must go
to Young Master Jang now. Goodbye.

905
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:04,483
Is she looking down on me?

906
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,785
Was that real back there?

907
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:27,756
It is best that
I do not cross paths with him.

908
01:05:29,883 --> 01:05:31,927
Hey! You!

909
01:05:34,012 --> 01:05:34,930
The dangerous man?

910
01:05:36,765 --> 01:05:38,225
Or this mean brat?

911
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:40,894
My lady.

912
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:44,064
Give that to me. I will carry it.

913
01:05:47,275 --> 01:05:48,402
Sure.

914
01:05:48,485 --> 01:05:51,029
Make sure you do not break it.

915
01:05:55,617 --> 01:05:57,119
So it is broken.

916
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,913
She is going to put the blame on me.

917
01:06:28,817 --> 01:06:30,819
Is this the Jin family's abode?

918
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:05,062
Why are you not coming?

919
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:18,366
Mother.

920
01:07:40,055 --> 01:07:41,681
You cannot leave like this.

921
01:07:42,974 --> 01:07:46,353
Say that you will marry her
in front of your late mother's portrait.

922
01:07:46,436 --> 01:07:48,980
That is the only way
to protect your father's position.

923
01:07:51,399 --> 01:07:52,734
Maidservant Kim.

924
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,027
Do you think

925
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:57,197
I really am my father's son?

926
01:08:00,742 --> 01:08:02,119
Do you know

927
01:08:03,411 --> 01:08:05,080
who my real father is?

928
01:08:06,748 --> 01:08:08,416
What do you mean?

929
01:08:09,334 --> 01:08:11,545
You are Gwanju Jang Gang's son.

930
01:08:13,463 --> 01:08:15,674
Yes. That is what I believed all my life.

931
01:08:15,757 --> 01:08:17,592
I do not want to deny it now.

932
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:18,635
So…

933
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,722
I will not sit still.

934
01:08:24,182 --> 01:08:25,559
Do not stop me

935
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:28,019
no matter what I do.

936
01:08:36,027 --> 01:08:39,156
Maidservant Kim,
the Jin family sent someone.

937
01:08:39,739 --> 01:08:42,075
From Jinyowon? What is it about?

938
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:43,618
Something happened there.

939
01:08:44,494 --> 01:08:47,581
They want Young Master Jang to hurry over.

940
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:29,748
You were looking for me?

941
01:09:29,831 --> 01:09:31,124
What is this about?

942
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:34,419
A precious treasure of ours
has disappeared.

943
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:36,338
And an individual

944
01:09:37,672 --> 01:09:39,799
has disappeared with it.

945
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,893
So this is Jinyowon.

946
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,444
Hey.

947
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:08,203
So it is you.

948
01:10:12,332 --> 01:10:13,917
It has been a long time.

949
01:10:44,197 --> 01:10:45,490
You are saying Mu-deok

950
01:10:46,366 --> 01:10:49,035
-disappeared here?
-Yes.

951
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:51,037
Your maid, Mu-deok,

952
01:10:51,746 --> 01:10:54,165
stole our yin-and-yang jade and ran away.

953
01:11:26,364 --> 01:11:28,658
You have been thinking about me,
Your Royal Highness,

954
01:11:28,742 --> 01:11:30,201
so I came to see you.

955
01:11:30,285 --> 01:11:32,912
You were longing for
the one you met at Danhyanggok.

956
01:11:32,996 --> 01:11:34,331
I was longing for you?

957
01:11:34,414 --> 01:11:35,665
I have never done that.

958
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:37,000
Open the door.

959
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:40,045
Open the door to Jinyowon,
where relics and artifacts reside.

960
01:11:40,128 --> 01:11:42,213
You could be possessed by sorcery
and be unable to return.

961
01:11:42,297 --> 01:11:44,049
You are just too scared to touch them.

962
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:46,801
What was that?

963
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:48,470
Bring Jang Uk.

964
01:11:48,553 --> 01:11:50,638
I must hand you over so I can live.

965
01:11:50,722 --> 01:11:51,681
It is what must be done.

966
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:55,435
So Mu-deok was Naksu.

967
01:11:58,563 --> 01:12:00,815
Fight like your life depends on it,
my pupil.

968
01:12:03,401 --> 01:12:08,406
