1
00:00:01,077 --> 00:00:02,954
Who are you and why are you following me?

2
00:00:03,747 --> 00:00:04,706
I said…

3
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:08,126
who are you?

4
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:30,023
Seeing that you recognize this sword,

5
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:31,816
you must be a mage.

6
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:36,196
Put down your sword.

7
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:41,910
It is dangerous to unsheathe
a sword of Cheonbugwan here.

8
00:00:44,913 --> 00:00:46,956
This is Gaema Village.

9
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:51,127
Cheonbugwan mages who patrol for sorcery
are considered enemies.

10
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,047
If you get into a fight

11
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,591
and people find out that you are here,

12
00:00:57,634 --> 00:00:59,677
you will not be safe.

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,686
It looks as though

14
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:11,439
you know who I am.

15
00:01:13,316 --> 00:01:15,610
You carry the sword
of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju,

16
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:18,863
so you must be his son.

17
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:29,207
Does Uk not know
what his father looks like?

18
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:35,421
Are there no portraits of his father
like the one here of his mother?

19
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:37,882
We do not have any portraits
of the Gwanju.

20
00:01:38,842 --> 00:01:40,802
Young Master never seemed
curious about him.

21
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:44,973
He only saw his father as a baby,
so there is no way he would remember.

22
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:48,351
He would not recognize his father

23
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:50,103
even if he were to run into him.

24
00:01:53,523 --> 00:01:56,568
I only followed you
because I recognized the sword.

25
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:02,907
Do you know the owner of this sword?

26
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:08,246
The man who abandoned that sword
was a madman.

27
00:02:09,873 --> 00:02:11,916
His wife had an affair and died.

28
00:02:13,126 --> 00:02:16,129
Then he abandoned his own son
and public post and just ran away.

29
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:19,883
Jang Gang, the man who went mad.

30
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:25,805
Everyone secretly talks about him,

31
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:28,766
but no one has ever said that to my face.

32
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:31,895
Do you hold a grudge against him?

33
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:35,857
What if I do?

34
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:39,903
Will you take vengeance on me
on behalf of your father?

35
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:45,366
No.

36
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,410
Even if I am his son, it is not my place.

37
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:49,954
He would not want that.

38
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:55,043
Then why do you carry your father's sword?

39
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:57,128
If I go around
denying that he is my father,

40
00:02:58,087 --> 00:02:59,213
it would make my mother

41
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:01,674
seem too pitiful.

42
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:06,888
Do-hwa…

43
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,061
Do-hwa was the biggest victim of it all.

44
00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:24,572
Do you also know my mother?

45
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:30,078
Do-hwa was the most beautiful woman
in all of Daeho.

46
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:34,999
Everyone in Daeho knew who she was.

47
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,670
It seems like everyone in my family
is famous for something.

48
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:41,673
I must say,

49
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:45,301
I did not expect to run into anyone
who recognized me at a place like this.

50
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:15,790
This is where people
secretly practice sorcery

51
00:04:15,873 --> 00:04:17,750
despite it being banned by Songrim.

52
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,213
What is the son of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju
doing at a place like this?

53
00:04:22,297 --> 00:04:23,840
Well, I was told I would be able

54
00:04:23,923 --> 00:04:27,010
to witness sorcery
such as curses and soul magic.

55
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:28,803
You are a mage of Jeongjingak,

56
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:31,347
yet you go around
in search of such sorcery?

57
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,725
Not exactly.

58
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:37,437
I am here to find a shaman
who performs such sorcery.

59
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,523
A shaman?

60
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,985
She was a shaman
who was very good at soul magic,

61
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,571
which bewitches souls
and drives people mad.

62
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:50,116
She was caught 20 years ago

63
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,453
by the mages of Cheonbugwan
and ran away after her house burned down.

64
00:04:55,872 --> 00:04:57,874
What business do you have
with Shaman Choi?

65
00:04:58,374 --> 00:05:00,460
How did you know that was Shaman Choi?

66
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,507
By any chance, were you
one of the Cheonbugwan mages

67
00:05:07,258 --> 00:05:08,885
who worked with my father?

68
00:05:10,803 --> 00:05:13,097
The Choi family was a family of mages

69
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:17,435
that was destroyed by Master Seo Gyeong
a long time ago.

70
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:21,606
Your curiosity will put you in danger.

71
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:25,068
If you become consumed
by your curiosity for sorcery,

72
00:05:26,194 --> 00:05:29,155
its darkness will take over your soul,

73
00:05:29,238 --> 00:05:31,115
and you could end up losing everything.

74
00:05:33,284 --> 00:05:34,744
Once that happens,

75
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:37,622
it will be too late to go back.

76
00:05:44,462 --> 00:05:47,256
Stop looking for those
who perform sorcery.

77
00:05:48,174 --> 00:05:50,426
The world does not approve of such things,

78
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:52,929
and you will never be forgiven.

79
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:00,812
Wait.

80
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:07,401
Here.

81
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:14,367
Are you hurt?

82
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:17,161
Yes, I am hurt.

83
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:21,541
I am damaged
to the very depths of my soul.

84
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,806
Did he end up that way because of sorcery?

85
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:09,130
Bu-yeon!

86
00:07:10,548 --> 00:07:11,716
My goodness, Bu-yeon!

87
00:07:33,362 --> 00:07:35,990
Did she just look at me?

88
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:39,952
I am sorry.

89
00:07:40,036 --> 00:07:42,163
Could you pick up the cane for me?

90
00:07:43,206 --> 00:07:45,500
She is the girl I ran into
in front of the house.

91
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:05,311
Mother!

92
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:11,943
Mother.

93
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,695
Is she really Bu-yeon?

94
00:08:15,613 --> 00:08:18,032
Yes, she is your sister.

95
00:08:19,242 --> 00:08:20,660
Bu-yeon.

96
00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:28,918
Bu-yeon, let me take you to your room.

97
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:04,120
You are Jang Uk's maid.

98
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:06,872
What are you doing here?

99
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:12,128
I came to help Young Lady Jin run away
from home due to her relationship.

100
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:14,714
But it looks like I just should leave.

101
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:16,424
I will be off now.

102
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:28,769
Why was Mu-deok here?

103
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:31,188
I was sure she did not recognize me.

104
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:34,108
Should I have just killed her?

105
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,779
Bu-yeon, I left your room untouched.

106
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,783
After all, I knew that
this day would come.

107
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:55,338
Let us go inside.

108
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:14,857
All your belongings

109
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,443
are still here.

110
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:21,072
After I almost died
when I was washed up in the lake,

111
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:26,369
I always had to wander,
unable to find a proper place to stay.

112
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:28,829
But now, I have my own room.

113
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,211
I had no idea I had a mother
waiting for me to return.

114
00:10:38,047 --> 00:10:42,176
Every day was full of misery and distress.

115
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,808
My poor daughter.

116
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:52,603
I will make sure
you are always happy from now on.

117
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,439
Do not worry.

118
00:10:59,318 --> 00:11:00,486
Mother.

119
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:21,173
Did Jin Mu really bring home
Lady Jin's daughter?

120
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:26,512
Yes, the girl he brought
opened the doors of Jinyowon.

121
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,473
-What?
-She opened the doors?

122
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:32,935
It takes more than a mere trick
to open those doors.

123
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:36,439
They can only be opened
by the members of the Jin family.

124
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:44,113
Does this really mean
Jin Bu-yeon has returned?

125
00:11:53,706 --> 00:11:57,334
Why do my eyes hurt like crazy
every time I go to Jinyowon?

126
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:06,510
Is it because of
the power of their relics?

127
00:12:26,197 --> 00:12:27,740
Mu-deok, what are you doing here?

128
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:30,659
Why were you looking in the mirror?

129
00:12:34,622 --> 00:12:36,165
Did you want to look nice for me?

130
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,792
Do not be ridiculous.

131
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,586
Wait.

132
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:42,463
I want to make myself look nice.

133
00:12:43,088 --> 00:12:46,050
How about you pick something suitable
for your young master?

134
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:50,304
I will pick one myself.

135
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:56,810
What do you think? Does it suit me?

136
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:59,855
Yes, sure. You look fabulous.

137
00:13:00,397 --> 00:13:02,525
Of course it would look nice on me.

138
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,777
Let me see.

139
00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:08,531
This looks nice on me too.

140
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:10,491
This is just too hard.
Everything suits me.

141
00:13:16,038 --> 00:13:17,373
What is this?

142
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:20,918
Give me that. I will doll you up.

143
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,094
Look at you. You look stunning.

144
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:32,972
It looks like I am all dolled up now.

145
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,557
Now, it is your turn.

146
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:42,064
Look at how pretty you look, Mu-deok.

147
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:47,194
How childish of you.
I thought you only liked my eyes.

148
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:49,947
I know, right?
I only thought your eyes were pretty.

149
00:13:51,323 --> 00:13:53,909
But your poison must have done
a number on me.

150
00:13:53,993 --> 00:13:55,828
Now, you look pretty no matter what.

151
00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:09,466
I see you are trying hard not to love me.

152
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,551
You seem distressed.

153
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,349
Not at all. You could not be more wrong.

154
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:24,440
If you are going to lie to my face,
at least try not to show it.

155
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:27,109
You are blushing right now.

156
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:32,823
That is because
you put all this blush on my face.

157
00:14:32,907 --> 00:14:34,033
Let me see.

158
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:39,163
I must have applied too much.
It will not come off.

159
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,751
You kind of

160
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:47,129
look like a drunk dog right now.

161
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:53,802
You should not glare like that.
You look like a dog about to bite.

162
00:14:53,886 --> 00:14:56,221
I might as well just bite you.

163
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,643
I will not bite. Come here.

164
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:06,690
All right. Stop.

165
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:12,279
I had to buy this because of you.

166
00:15:13,364 --> 00:15:16,659
Do not use it if you do not need it.
I will use it for myself.

167
00:15:18,243 --> 00:15:19,995
This is pretty too.

168
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:22,975
Mu-deok…

169
00:16:40,075 --> 00:16:41,702
You were almost hit by the wagon.

170
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,546
Mu-deok.

171
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:55,674
Are you really drunk or something?
Did you drink without me?

172
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:01,263
I had a drink too.
How about we have some more together?

173
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:03,599
I am not drunk.

174
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:05,976
Were you out drinking?

175
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,854
I went to Gaema Village
and someone let me have a drink.

176
00:17:09,438 --> 00:17:11,815
Did you meet Shaman Choi there?

177
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:15,778
I found a connection
between her and Jin Mu.

178
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:18,697
But I also ran into
the Crown Prince there.

179
00:17:19,448 --> 00:17:20,532
The Crown Prince?

180
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:24,036
His Royal Highness is also suspicious
of Jin Mu and the Queen.

181
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:32,878
Your Royal Highness.

182
00:17:34,296 --> 00:17:36,090
Are you coming back from Gaema Village?

183
00:17:37,174 --> 00:17:38,092
Yes.

184
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:41,512
The place was like a maze.
It was hard to find my way out.

185
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:43,222
What is it?

186
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:46,683
-Is there something the matter?
-The Assistant Gwanju is here.

187
00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:11,542
Where did you go all by yourself
without a single person to escort you?

188
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:15,420
It is embarrassing enough to be caught
after sneaking out. Please let it slide.

189
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,842
I just met His Majesty.

190
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:22,511
He brought up the King's Star again.

191
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:25,848
He seems to want it so much.

192
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:29,560
You should just give him a fake
constellation plate with the King's Star.

193
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:31,979
Then he must find everyone
who was born that day

194
00:18:32,062 --> 00:18:33,564
and kill them.

195
00:18:35,274 --> 00:18:36,483
Why?

196
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:38,902
It could be a hero like Master Seo Gyeong

197
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:41,905
instead of being a traitor
wishing to conspire against the king.

198
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:44,491
They say Seo Gyeong saved the world
with the ice stone.

199
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:45,534
But that is not true.

200
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,830
In truth, he controlled the world
by forbidding everyone

201
00:18:49,913 --> 00:18:51,456
from using that immense power.

202
00:18:52,457 --> 00:18:55,252
The ice stone enables sorcery,
which is why it is dangerous.

203
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:57,504
That is the logic set by Songrim.

204
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,884
The ice stone has the power
to bring eternity to finite things.

205
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:04,595
Instead of aging and dying,

206
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:08,348
its power could enable us
to stay young and beautiful.

207
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:10,142
Are you talking about
the alchemy of souls?

208
00:19:10,225 --> 00:19:12,144
The sorcery that was banned by Songrim.

209
00:19:12,227 --> 00:19:13,770
But what if the ban gets lifted

210
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:15,772
and the use of the ice stone
becomes permissible?

211
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:16,940
Your Royal Highness.

212
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:19,443
What do you think would happen then?

213
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:26,325
Those who possess the ice stone
will be able to live forever.

214
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:30,662
But it would be dangerous if that kind
of power can be used by anyone.

215
00:19:30,746 --> 00:19:32,623
Not everyone will be able to use it.

216
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:35,459
We will create a new order
where only those specially chosen,

217
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,794
like you, Your Royal Highness,
will be allowed to use its power.

218
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:43,467
We need to find the ice stone

219
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,178
in order for that to become possible.

220
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:49,640
Jin Bu-yeon, the long-lost daughter
of Jinyowon, has returned.

221
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:51,725
-Jinyowon?
-The woman who helped

222
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:56,021
Master Seo Gyeong find the ice stone
was the first leader of Jinyowon.

223
00:19:56,104 --> 00:19:58,315
And Jin Bu-yeon has divine powers

224
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,192
that parallel that of the first leader.

225
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,950
If the ice stone appears
just like it did 200 years ago,

226
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:09,868
the priestess of Jinyowon

227
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:13,121
will surely find it once again.

228
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:19,378
The eldest daughter of Jinyowon
has returned alive.

229
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:22,756
She seemed like an ordinary blind girl.

230
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:25,259
I thought she was a powerful priestess.

231
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:27,511
I wonder if she lost her power.

232
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:28,971
I guess it is possible

233
00:20:29,054 --> 00:20:32,057
seeing that she failed
to find her way home for ten years.

234
00:20:34,977 --> 00:20:38,563
She was brought here by Jin Mu.
There is no way she is ordinary.

235
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:40,232
Did you notice anything peculiar?

236
00:20:43,652 --> 00:20:46,363
I ran into her once
in front of your house.

237
00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:51,118
I remember because I picked up
the cane she had dropped.

238
00:20:53,412 --> 00:20:54,746
She was in front of my house?

239
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,082
But nothing about her
seemed peculiar that day.

240
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:58,792
The same goes for today.

241
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:03,547
The umbrella…

242
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:09,261
She was carrying an umbrella.

243
00:21:09,344 --> 00:21:11,263
I have seen that umbrella somewhere.

244
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:14,725
An umbrella?
What is so special about an umbrella?

245
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:15,851
No.

246
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:18,729
That umbrella was made
with high-quality sheepskin and bamboo.

247
00:21:19,521 --> 00:21:21,023
It was very expensive.

248
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:24,484
-How did it end up with her?
-Why?

249
00:21:24,568 --> 00:21:26,153
Who did it originally belong to?

250
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:29,448
The umbrella?

251
00:21:30,032 --> 00:21:31,825
I do not have that umbrella anymore.

252
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:33,869
I gave it to someone.

253
00:21:33,952 --> 00:21:35,287
Who did you give it to and where?

254
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,789
It was not intentional.

255
00:21:37,873 --> 00:21:39,708
I am sorry. I know you bought it for me.

256
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:41,918
You do not need to apologize.

257
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,338
Did you give it to a woman?

258
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:46,965
Yes, I did give it to a woman.

259
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:48,050
Please do not be angry.

260
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,054
Why would I be angry?

261
00:21:52,137 --> 00:21:53,555
Who was that woman?

262
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:55,140
Tell me.

263
00:21:55,223 --> 00:21:57,684
Will you answer me already?
This is so frustrating.

264
00:21:57,768 --> 00:21:59,603
Who was the woman you gave it to?

265
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:04,649
Mu-deok.

266
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:07,152
That is not the way to ask. Yul is…

267
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,739
He is pale with fear.

268
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:13,116
You sound like a wife
interrogating a cheating husband.

269
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,869
It is inappropriate to ask him
with such a demanding tone.

270
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:18,538
Watch and learn. Yul.

271
00:22:18,622 --> 00:22:21,500
Did you give that umbrella
to a blind girl?

272
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,251
How did you know that?

273
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:27,506
By any chance, is she So-i,
the girl you mentioned last time?

274
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,967
Yes, I gave it to her.

275
00:22:31,051 --> 00:22:32,177
Why do you ask?

276
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,471
Today, I went to Jinyowon

277
00:22:35,347 --> 00:22:37,474
and saw their long-lost daughter,
Jin Bu-yeon.

278
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,142
She was blind,

279
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:41,478
but she was holding an umbrella
instead of a cane.

280
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:43,563
Was it the same umbrella?

281
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:47,984
Hey.

282
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:50,862
Hey, did you hear?

283
00:22:50,946 --> 00:22:54,241
They found Young Lady Jin's older sister.
They found Jin Bu-yeon.

284
00:22:56,034 --> 00:22:57,077
Do you hear me?

285
00:22:57,786 --> 00:22:59,538
What is with this atmosphere?

286
00:23:00,122 --> 00:23:01,581
What were you talking about?

287
00:23:01,665 --> 00:23:04,209
We were talking about So-i,
the girl we were looking for.

288
00:23:04,835 --> 00:23:05,669
So-i?

289
00:23:06,711 --> 00:23:07,921
Oh, the swindler?

290
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:09,464
Did you find her?

291
00:23:09,548 --> 00:23:11,842
The Jin Bu-yeon that Jin Mu has brought in

292
00:23:12,717 --> 00:23:13,927
is So-i, the swindler.

293
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,596
She must have killed all those people

294
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,598
to keep her identity a secret.

295
00:23:34,322 --> 00:23:35,532
Jin Bu-yeon.

296
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:41,955
I will make sure to become
indistinguishable from you.

297
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:01,933
This is exactly the same
as the one that Mu-deok had.

298
00:24:05,103 --> 00:24:06,771
Why is this here?

299
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,816
Bu-yeon.

300
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:19,159
Do you remember

301
00:24:20,285 --> 00:24:21,328
this eye mask?

302
00:24:28,543 --> 00:24:30,587
The eye masks you wore

303
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,924
were all embroidered by me.

304
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:36,843
I was always worried that

305
00:24:36,927 --> 00:24:39,888
something might happen to you
since you could not see.

306
00:24:39,971 --> 00:24:44,309
So I always made you wear an eye mask
that had the crest of Jinyowon on it.

307
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,104
I see.

308
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:54,694
This may be old,
but it is made out of silk.

309
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:58,073
Your biological parents might be rich.

310
00:25:00,575 --> 00:25:02,577
Are you sure you are blind?

311
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:05,497
I cannot find spring water
even though I can see,

312
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,707
but you have no trouble at all.

313
00:25:10,335 --> 00:25:15,006
Bu-yeon, you always had
the ability to sense energy.

314
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:19,803
You could find things a lot better
than those who could see,

315
00:25:20,387 --> 00:25:23,223
and you easily found your way
around places.

316
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:26,935
That is exactly how Mu-deok was
in Sari Village.

317
00:25:27,018 --> 00:25:29,980
She found things easily
and always knew where she was going.

318
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:31,898
You were wearing the same eye mask

319
00:25:33,525 --> 00:25:36,361
the very day you disappeared.

320
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:40,991
So I hoped that you might use the eye mask

321
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:43,702
to find your way back home.

322
00:25:44,828 --> 00:25:47,163
She always cherished it

323
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:49,708
saying it was the only way
to find her parents.

324
00:25:51,459 --> 00:25:53,253
If you had kept that with you,

325
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:57,716
I would have recognized you at once.

326
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,262
The eye mask that I stole from Mu-deok
was made by this woman.

327
00:26:03,388 --> 00:26:04,973
In any case,

328
00:26:05,056 --> 00:26:08,852
thank you so much
for coming back alive, Bu-yeon.

329
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:18,320
The real Jin Bu-yeon,
the daughter of this woman,

330
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,156
is Mu-deok.

331
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,430
My goodness, Bu-yeon!

332
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,853
I wonder if Mu-deok was the reason
why these doors opened that day.

333
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,482
Mu-deok is the real daughter.

334
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:59,486
What will become of me
if she finds that out?

335
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:03,782
Will I die?

336
00:27:09,746 --> 00:27:10,997
Bu-yeon.

337
00:27:12,207 --> 00:27:13,708
What are you doing here?

338
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:15,794
Are you trying to open the doors again?

339
00:27:15,877 --> 00:27:17,045
No.

340
00:27:20,173 --> 00:27:23,385
I just cannot believe that
I am the daughter of this family.

341
00:27:24,594 --> 00:27:26,137
Do not worry.

342
00:27:26,805 --> 00:27:27,972
You can believe it.

343
00:27:28,056 --> 00:27:30,975
We all saw you open those doors.

344
00:27:34,646 --> 00:27:38,650
By the way, about the girl
who was here with you last night…

345
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:39,859
Mu-deok?

346
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,070
She is not a person of Jinyowon.

347
00:27:42,153 --> 00:27:45,407
Does she come here often?
Mother seemed to know her too.

348
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,200
Mother does not like her.

349
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:49,369
She once caused trouble, you see.

350
00:27:49,452 --> 00:27:50,745
Is that so?

351
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,374
So that is why.

352
00:27:54,457 --> 00:27:56,459
I sensed bad energy from her.

353
00:27:57,502 --> 00:27:59,963
Bad energy?

354
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:03,967
The energy I sensed from that girl
was dark and unpleasant.

355
00:28:04,843 --> 00:28:07,846
You should not stay close to someone
with that kind of energy.

356
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,558
She is not that bad of a person.

357
00:28:12,642 --> 00:28:13,977
There you girls are.

358
00:28:16,146 --> 00:28:17,147
Father.

359
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,148
Father.

360
00:28:18,982 --> 00:28:20,692
Cho-yeon, your mother is looking for you.

361
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:22,360
Mother?

362
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:25,864
I thought she was no longer angry.

363
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,743
-I should go then.
-Go on.

364
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:37,292
I warned you to keep a distance
from my daughter.

365
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:39,169
I apologize.

366
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:42,589
We must go to Cheonbugwan
on the last day of this month.

367
00:28:42,672 --> 00:28:44,674
-So be prepared.
-Yes.

368
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:47,343
Father, wait.

369
00:28:49,888 --> 00:28:51,139
My lord.

370
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:56,227
Are you sure Jin Bu-yeon is dead?

371
00:28:57,687 --> 00:29:00,106
What will happen to me
if she were to return?

372
00:29:01,357 --> 00:29:03,318
You do not need to worry
about such a thing.

373
00:29:05,737 --> 00:29:06,905
She is dead.

374
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:18,458
Even if Mu-deok is their real daughter,

375
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:20,210
no one in their family knows that.

376
00:29:21,377 --> 00:29:23,296
I just need to make sure no one finds out.

377
00:29:26,674 --> 00:29:28,134
I am Jin Bu-yeon.

378
00:29:40,313 --> 00:29:41,898
I thought about it all night.

379
00:29:42,524 --> 00:29:44,818
Although this may put my love at risk,

380
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:48,404
I will do what I must
as the heir of Songrim.

381
00:29:48,488 --> 00:29:51,032
-I should tell my uncle.
-No.

382
00:29:51,115 --> 00:29:54,410
You all remember seeing him
arguing with Lady Jin, right?

383
00:29:54,494 --> 00:29:56,287
If we accuse her daughter

384
00:29:56,371 --> 00:29:58,998
of being a fake and a murderer
without any concrete evidence,

385
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:01,751
things could get ugly
between Songrim and Jinyowon.

386
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:04,087
You have a point.

387
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:08,091
If the truth gets revealed, there will be
a fight between Jin Mu and Jinyowon.

388
00:30:08,758 --> 00:30:11,261
Songrim should not get involved
if we are not sure.

389
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:15,807
But why did they bring a swindler

390
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,600
to act as such a powerful priestess?

391
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:19,769
Because they need someone
in that position.

392
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:21,813
What if she gets caught?

393
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:23,898
A mother would know her daughter.

394
00:30:23,982 --> 00:30:27,402
In the end, she will get caught.
Why do something so reckless?

395
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:29,946
Because it does not matter.

396
00:30:32,198 --> 00:30:33,783
Jin Mu must have something big

397
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:36,661
so that even if Jin Ho-gyeong finds out
her daughter is a fake,

398
00:30:37,829 --> 00:30:39,914
she will not be able
to do anything about it.

399
00:30:47,672 --> 00:30:49,257
Something about her is different.

400
00:30:49,924 --> 00:30:54,804
She has the same scar and mole
that Bu-yeon had as a child.

401
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,765
But her ears are different.

402
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:01,978
The shape of our ears never changes.

403
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,482
Am I not remembering things correctly?

404
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,819
Ho-gyeong.

405
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:29,589
I am surprised you only wish to see

406
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:33,259
the inside of Jinyowon
in return for helping me find Bu-yeon.

407
00:31:33,927 --> 00:31:36,721
This place was forbidden to me

408
00:31:36,804 --> 00:31:38,973
although I was a member of the Jin family.

409
00:31:39,057 --> 00:31:41,309
I do remember severely punishing you

410
00:31:42,143 --> 00:31:43,895
every time you came close to Jinyowon.

411
00:31:45,647 --> 00:31:47,523
I admit I have been too harsh on you.

412
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:50,944
I hated you for you were the result
of my father's affair,

413
00:31:51,027 --> 00:31:53,404
and I despised you
for always trying so hard

414
00:31:53,488 --> 00:31:55,406
to please and butter everyone up.

415
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:57,492
I am sorry.

416
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,039
It is all in the past.

417
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,892
Now that Bu-yeon is back,

418
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:28,982
you should quickly choose your successor.

419
00:32:30,817 --> 00:32:34,529
Are you telling me to appoint her
as the next leader of Jinyowon?

420
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:39,534
Appointing a new owner
will bring back life to Jinyowon.

421
00:32:39,617 --> 00:32:40,743
Once that is done,

422
00:32:40,827 --> 00:32:44,831
I will lay the groundwork for Cho-yeon
to become the Crown Princess.

423
00:32:49,043 --> 00:32:50,420
There is no need to rush.

424
00:32:50,503 --> 00:32:52,714
Bu-yeon has not
fully recovered her memory,

425
00:32:53,423 --> 00:32:55,883
and I am still capable
to stay as the leader.

426
00:32:55,967 --> 00:33:00,513
Your power is not enough for us
to retrieve the ice stone.

427
00:33:02,765 --> 00:33:04,892
When you were pregnant with Bu-yeon,

428
00:33:04,976 --> 00:33:07,895
you unsealed the ice stone from Jinyowon
and gave it to Jang Gang

429
00:33:08,521 --> 00:33:09,856
in order to save her.

430
00:33:12,108 --> 00:33:14,652
How do you know that?

431
00:33:14,736 --> 00:33:15,945
Do not be startled.

432
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:18,281
I am not trying to accuse you
of your wrongdoings.

433
00:33:19,657 --> 00:33:22,702
I bet Jang Gang insisted on
sealing the ice stone somewhere else

434
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:24,328
and did not return it to you.

435
00:33:25,246 --> 00:33:27,874
Do you know
where Jang Gang hid the ice stone

436
00:33:27,957 --> 00:33:29,625
that he took from Jinyowon?

437
00:33:29,709 --> 00:33:31,419
Now that the successor
of Jinyowon is back,

438
00:33:31,502 --> 00:33:35,631
I will return the ice stone
back to where it belongs.

439
00:33:36,758 --> 00:33:39,177
Jin Mu, are you saying…

440
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,178
Ho-gyeong.

441
00:33:40,261 --> 00:33:42,096
I just told you that I would return it.

442
00:33:42,847 --> 00:33:44,807
Do not be suspicious
or stand on your guard.

443
00:33:44,891 --> 00:33:47,602
Think of it as a gift that came
with your daughter's return.

444
00:33:47,685 --> 00:33:51,314
All you need to do is
just accept it with joy.

445
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:13,211
It sounds like you are telling me

446
00:34:13,795 --> 00:34:17,799
to blindly acknowledge Bu-yeon
if I wish to receive that gift.

447
00:34:17,882 --> 00:34:21,344
Get rid of your suspicions and doubts,
and you will be able to have it all.

448
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:25,848
Both the ice stone
and your long-lost daughter.

449
00:34:27,558 --> 00:34:29,185
What do you want?

450
00:34:33,314 --> 00:34:35,733
You must fight Songrim

451
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:38,486
in order to protect the ice stone.

452
00:34:40,196 --> 00:34:42,573
You want me to fight with Songrim?

453
00:34:42,657 --> 00:34:44,283
The collapse of Songrim

454
00:34:45,326 --> 00:34:48,871
will allow us to possess
absolute power over the ice stone.

455
00:35:05,555 --> 00:35:07,557
Are you talking about
the alchemy of souls?

456
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,725
The sorcery that was banned by Songrim.

457
00:35:10,935 --> 00:35:12,436
But what if the ban gets lifted

458
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,522
and the use of the ice stone
becomes permissible?

459
00:35:14,605 --> 00:35:15,731
Your Royal Highness.

460
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,317
What do you think would happen then?

461
00:35:21,195 --> 00:35:23,030
An eternal life?

462
00:35:29,745 --> 00:35:32,165
Has the petrification stopped?

463
00:35:32,248 --> 00:35:34,709
He is able to breathe now.

464
00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:37,712
He can also move his fingers and toes.

465
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:41,048
Master Kang was a mage
with many years of training.

466
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:44,051
How did he become tempted to use sorcery?

467
00:35:44,135 --> 00:35:47,305
If Jin Mu were to approach me
and tell me I could shift my soul

468
00:35:47,388 --> 00:35:50,224
into a younger and more beautiful body,
I would be tempted too.

469
00:35:52,393 --> 00:35:56,314
I am joking. But I am sure
many people will fall for that.

470
00:35:56,397 --> 00:35:57,899
They are merely keeping quiet

471
00:35:57,982 --> 00:35:59,525
because of Songrim.

472
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:04,405
First, it was Cheonbugwan
and the royal palace.

473
00:36:04,488 --> 00:36:08,784
Now it looks like Jin Mu
even has influence over Jinyowon.

474
00:36:08,868 --> 00:36:09,994
But we have evidence

475
00:36:10,077 --> 00:36:13,414
to prove that he has been
performing the alchemy of souls.

476
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:15,791
Once Master Kang spills everything,

477
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:18,127
we can finally put a stop to Jin Mu.

478
00:36:18,711 --> 00:36:20,713
He is not scared that he got caught.

479
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:23,382
Instead, he is already
plotting something new.

480
00:36:24,842 --> 00:36:26,928
I have no way of telling

481
00:36:27,595 --> 00:36:30,056
how far Jin Mu is willing to go from here.

482
00:36:31,515 --> 00:36:32,975
And that scares me.

483
00:36:40,775 --> 00:36:44,195
What is the purpose of my visit
to Cheonbugwan this time?

484
00:36:44,278 --> 00:36:47,323
Will I have to endure the pain
of another worm entering my body?

485
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:49,408
Just do as you are told.

486
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:54,622
There will be many others there,
so be careful of how you behave.

487
00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:24,110
Today, I shall finally reveal

488
00:37:25,778 --> 00:37:27,530
the Danju of our secret organization.

489
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:35,997
Stand before everyone here
and show your face.

490
00:37:54,598 --> 00:37:57,310
The Danju is not only
the most powerful priestess of Daeho,

491
00:37:57,393 --> 00:38:00,479
but also the future leader of Jinyowon.
Her name is Jin Bu-yeon.

492
00:38:03,024 --> 00:38:05,401
Show your respect to the Danju.

493
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:23,753
I will use her to bring the ice stone
out into the world.

494
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:26,922
Then I shall shift my soul into her body.

495
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,718
That will allow me to serve you
from a closer distance,

496
00:38:31,802 --> 00:38:33,054
my sister.

497
00:38:48,027 --> 00:38:51,572
The leader of Jinyowon gathered
a Unanimous Assembly

498
00:38:51,655 --> 00:38:53,657
-without discussing it with Songrim?
-Yes.

499
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:56,952
She sent letters to all the families.
They are now heading to Songrim.

500
00:39:00,498 --> 00:39:01,665
What in the world

501
00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:05,544
is Jinyowon trying to do this time?

502
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:15,179
She is the mother of the young man
who is currently lying in Sejukwon.

503
00:39:18,808 --> 00:39:20,226
Why is everyone gathering here?

504
00:39:21,977 --> 00:39:24,480
Jinyowon gathered the Unanimous Assembly.

505
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:29,527
Young Lady Cho-yeon is here.

506
00:39:30,277 --> 00:39:32,905
Is that blind girl Jin Bu-yeon?

507
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:34,990
So-i?

508
00:39:36,283 --> 00:39:37,201
Yes.

509
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:42,248
Things are proceeding
faster than expected.

510
00:39:42,331 --> 00:39:44,834
They are going to use the fake daughter

511
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:46,794
to get something done today.

512
00:39:55,094 --> 00:39:57,346
She must be Jin Bu-yeon.

513
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:27,960
The leader of Jinyowon has invited

514
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:31,338
the royal family and Cheonbugwan
to the Unanimous Assembly.

515
00:40:31,422 --> 00:40:33,048
The Unanimous Assembly?

516
00:40:34,884 --> 00:40:36,010
What for?

517
00:40:36,093 --> 00:40:38,012
To announce a grave matter

518
00:40:38,095 --> 00:40:41,056
that will determine the fate of Daeho.

519
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:53,861
The capital has been suffering from chaos
due to many incidents

520
00:40:53,944 --> 00:40:55,988
regarding soul shifters

521
00:40:56,071 --> 00:40:57,698
ever since the appearance of Naksu.

522
00:40:58,491 --> 00:41:02,328
Thus, Jinyowon has
generously tried to help Songrim

523
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:04,246
find the source of sorcery.

524
00:41:05,372 --> 00:41:06,332
However,

525
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:10,669
Songrim took our cooperation for granted

526
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:16,634
and arrogantly began to make
unreasonable demands and requests.

527
00:41:18,802 --> 00:41:22,097
They barged into Jinyowon
as well as Cheonbugwan

528
00:41:22,181 --> 00:41:25,392
with the excuse of patrolling for sorcery.

529
00:41:25,476 --> 00:41:28,896
They also tried to use
the relics of Jinyowon

530
00:41:28,979 --> 00:41:30,814
to investigate all the families of mages

531
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:33,692
as if they thought everyone
outside of Songrim performed sorcery.

532
00:41:34,485 --> 00:41:36,737
-Unbelievable.
-Worse than that,

533
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,741
they even took one of our relics
into the royal palace.

534
00:41:41,242 --> 00:41:43,244
Did Songrim really cast doubt on us?

535
00:41:43,327 --> 00:41:44,662
That is crossing the line.

536
00:41:48,499 --> 00:41:50,376
Lady Jin, did you gather

537
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:53,587
the Unanimous Assembly to vent
and complain about Songrim?

538
00:41:53,671 --> 00:41:54,630
Look at him.

539
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:57,007
I have only just started speaking,

540
00:41:57,091 --> 00:41:58,968
and he is already trying to shut me up.

541
00:41:59,552 --> 00:42:01,595
I, Jin Ho-gyeong, the leader of Jinyowon,

542
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:06,433
wish to stop Songrim's arbitrary actions
they justify as patrolling for sorcery.

543
00:42:06,517 --> 00:42:09,144
That requires me to break
the 200-year-old rule

544
00:42:09,228 --> 00:42:14,191
that has been kept until now,
which is why I have gathered you all.

545
00:42:17,945 --> 00:42:18,862
Bu-yeon.

546
00:42:29,164 --> 00:42:33,627
She is Jin Bu-yeon,
the long-lost successor of Jinyowon

547
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:35,087
who has returned after ten years.

548
00:42:38,674 --> 00:42:39,925
I heard she found her daughter.

549
00:42:40,509 --> 00:42:41,385
That must be her.

550
00:42:45,139 --> 00:42:48,183
I have something to show you
with the help of my daughter,

551
00:42:48,267 --> 00:42:50,853
who is also the successor of Jinyowon.

552
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:07,536
Songrim has been going around
in search of the ice stone,

553
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,538
the source of the alchemy of souls.

554
00:43:09,622 --> 00:43:12,333
However, that ice stone
has been inside Jinyowon all along.

555
00:44:00,214 --> 00:44:02,132
So that was Jin Mu's plan.

556
00:44:02,675 --> 00:44:05,969
He wanted to use Jinyowon
to bring the ice stone into this world.

557
00:44:06,053 --> 00:44:07,554
That cannot be all.

558
00:44:08,472 --> 00:44:11,934
The person who got caught
will try to shift souls.

559
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:16,021
What do you mean?

560
00:44:16,647 --> 00:44:17,648
Do you not get it?

561
00:44:18,232 --> 00:44:20,943
The Queen had the ice stone,
but now it is with Jinyowon.

562
00:44:21,026 --> 00:44:22,903
That means the shaman's soul will shift

563
00:44:23,987 --> 00:44:26,156
from the Queen's body
to someone at Jinyowon.

564
00:44:28,951 --> 00:44:30,828
She will abandon the Queen's body

565
00:44:32,663 --> 00:44:36,375
and shift her soul into the body
of the future leader of Jinyowon…

566
00:44:37,668 --> 00:44:39,128
using the alchemy of souls.

567
00:44:52,141 --> 00:44:53,851
That one in the front looks nice.

568
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,978
I heard the Unanimous Assembly

569
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:58,522
has gathered at Songrim
to talk about soul shifters.

570
00:44:58,605 --> 00:45:00,315
Yes, apparently.

571
00:45:01,442 --> 00:45:04,278
Do not buy unnecessary accessories.
Buy gold instead.

572
00:45:04,361 --> 00:45:06,864
Gold is the only thing you can trust
in times of chaos.

573
00:45:06,947 --> 00:45:09,783
Things will get busy
once the gathering is over.

574
00:45:09,867 --> 00:45:10,701
Yes.

575
00:45:10,784 --> 00:45:13,203
Once it is over,
they will all come to drink

576
00:45:13,287 --> 00:45:15,956
-and talk dirt about Songrim.
-Hey.

577
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:18,584
Will you stop touching that
and just buy it already?

578
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:21,170
Goodness, give her some time.

579
00:45:21,253 --> 00:45:22,713
I want to buy everything.

580
00:45:22,796 --> 00:45:24,798
-Let me try that.
-This one?

581
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:32,055
Everyone in the capital is
talking about the Unanimous Assembly

582
00:45:32,139 --> 00:45:33,932
and the attendance of the royal family.

583
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:38,145
He will have to show himself
with all the fuss going around.

584
00:45:39,605 --> 00:45:41,356
Are you talking about Master Jang?

585
00:45:42,483 --> 00:45:46,862
I found it strange that
Young Master Park kept asking me

586
00:45:46,945 --> 00:45:48,655
about Master Jang.

587
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:52,284
The leader of Songrim also seemed
to be waiting for him to show up.

588
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:01,543
Keep this with you

589
00:46:01,627 --> 00:46:03,420
and give it to him once he comes.

590
00:46:04,379 --> 00:46:05,464
What is it?

591
00:46:06,298 --> 00:46:07,424
Can I see what it is?

592
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:19,770
It is an empty piece of paper.

593
00:46:19,853 --> 00:46:23,649
Did you use a spell to write a letter
just like Words of the Heart?

594
00:46:25,692 --> 00:46:29,238
Once Jang Gang reads that,
he will do what is written.

595
00:46:35,661 --> 00:46:40,040
By the way, do you not need
to attend the Unanimous Assembly?

596
00:46:40,624 --> 00:46:42,709
I am a pupil of Master Seo Gyeong.

597
00:46:44,211 --> 00:46:45,796
If I go there,

598
00:46:45,879 --> 00:46:50,842
I will neither be able to admit nor deny
the actions of my master.

599
00:46:56,932 --> 00:47:01,144
Does this mean Master Seo Gyeong
left an ice stone unharmed?

600
00:47:01,228 --> 00:47:03,605
I thought he destroyed all of them.

601
00:47:03,689 --> 00:47:05,399
Was Songrim aware of this?

602
00:47:05,482 --> 00:47:07,734
If so, everything that
Songrim has done until now

603
00:47:07,818 --> 00:47:10,779
under the pretext of Master Seo Gyeong
would be considered fraud.

604
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:13,365
-Do not speak nonsense.
-Fraud is what it is.

605
00:47:13,448 --> 00:47:15,409
Songrim has enforced countless regulations

606
00:47:15,492 --> 00:47:17,995
on all the families of mages
under the guise of patrolling for sorcery.

607
00:47:18,078 --> 00:47:19,288
Do you not agree?

608
00:47:19,371 --> 00:47:21,623
-I agree.
-You are right.

609
00:47:21,707 --> 00:47:23,625
Did Songrim deceive us?

610
00:47:23,709 --> 00:47:25,043
Have we been fooled?

611
00:47:25,127 --> 00:47:27,504
-Is that what it is?
-Everyone, calm down.

612
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:30,257
The mages of Songrim

613
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,219
were not aware that
the ice stone was still inside Jinyowon.

614
00:47:34,928 --> 00:47:36,972
We do not wish to hear your excuses.

615
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:38,390
We must discuss

616
00:47:38,473 --> 00:47:42,311
what is to be done about the ice stone
that Master Seo Gyeong left behind.

617
00:47:42,394 --> 00:47:45,439
We must destroy the ice stone
as it is the source of sorcery.

618
00:47:45,939 --> 00:47:47,816
That is what Master Seo Gyeong
would have wanted.

619
00:47:48,567 --> 00:47:50,068
We must destroy the ice stone

620
00:47:50,902 --> 00:47:53,071
in front of everyone here as witnesses.

621
00:47:53,572 --> 00:47:56,408
He was the one
who left the ice stone inside Jinyowon.

622
00:47:56,491 --> 00:47:59,328
Following his command
would be to leave it inside Jinyowon.

623
00:47:59,411 --> 00:48:02,706
Then you never should have
brought it outside in the first place.

624
00:48:02,789 --> 00:48:06,293
How could you expect Songrim to stay still
after having revealed its existence?

625
00:48:06,376 --> 00:48:09,171
Are you trying to make a fool of Songrim?

626
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:12,049
The leader of Jinyowon has a point.

627
00:48:12,132 --> 00:48:13,592
She merely wishes to respect

628
00:48:13,675 --> 00:48:15,719
Master Seo Gyeong's intentions
by leaving it inside Jinyowon.

629
00:48:15,802 --> 00:48:20,515
Songrim no longer has a say
in what to do with the ice stone.

630
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:24,353
Unbelievable. Do you not even care
what Songrim thinks anymore?

631
00:48:24,936 --> 00:48:26,521
The purpose of this gathering
is to discuss

632
00:48:26,605 --> 00:48:29,441
how to use the ice stone
based on Master Seo Gyeong's wishes.

633
00:48:29,524 --> 00:48:31,902
If Songrim has a problem with that,
you may leave.

634
00:48:31,985 --> 00:48:33,528
-Here, here.
-Agreed.

635
00:48:33,612 --> 00:48:35,947
Songrim has deceived us,
so stay out of this.

636
00:48:36,031 --> 00:48:38,700
-Yes, you have no say.
-Stay out of it.

637
00:48:38,784 --> 00:48:39,993
Leave if you have a problem.

638
00:48:40,077 --> 00:48:42,454
-Just leave!
-Get out!

639
00:48:42,537 --> 00:48:43,914
So this is why Jin Mu

640
00:48:43,997 --> 00:48:47,250
revealed the ice stone to the world.

641
00:48:47,334 --> 00:48:50,253
Now that Songrim's logic
no longer seems valid,

642
00:48:50,337 --> 00:48:52,714
no one is willing to listen to them.

643
00:48:59,763 --> 00:49:01,098
What are you doing there?

644
00:49:01,682 --> 00:49:02,933
If Songrim is against

645
00:49:03,016 --> 00:49:05,644
keeping the ice stone inside Jinyowon,

646
00:49:06,186 --> 00:49:09,231
then how about
letting a third party keep it?

647
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,566
So here is my proposal.

648
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:13,568
How about keeping it at Gisan?

649
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:15,987
-Where did that idea come from?
-Gisan?

650
00:49:16,071 --> 00:49:17,948
Why should it be kept at Gisan?

651
00:49:18,031 --> 00:49:19,700
You and your family are low-level mages.

652
00:49:19,783 --> 00:49:20,742
What did you say?

653
00:49:20,826 --> 00:49:23,620
Your family has no right
to keep the ice stone.

654
00:49:23,704 --> 00:49:25,622
-We will not allow it.
-We have no right?

655
00:49:26,206 --> 00:49:29,418
My family has been around the longest
in the history of Daeho.

656
00:49:29,501 --> 00:49:31,753
So we have every right
to protect the ice stone.

657
00:49:31,837 --> 00:49:33,922
How dare you try to touch it!

658
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:36,633
-Are you trying to start a fight?
-Speak for yourself!

659
00:49:36,717 --> 00:49:39,177
-What do you think you are doing?
-Watch your tongue.

660
00:49:39,761 --> 00:49:41,763
Who do you think you are?

661
00:49:41,847 --> 00:49:43,890
You little shrimp!

662
00:49:43,974 --> 00:49:45,434
Did you call me a shrimp?

663
00:49:45,517 --> 00:49:46,935
Hey, that is enough.

664
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:47,978
Get out of the way!

665
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:54,109
Did you just hit me?

666
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:56,236
Damn you, old man!

667
00:49:58,071 --> 00:49:59,406
You little…

668
00:49:59,489 --> 00:50:01,950
Get off me, you punk!

669
00:50:05,912 --> 00:50:07,080
Did you just gather energy?

670
00:50:07,164 --> 00:50:09,416
Fine. Go ahead and attack me.

671
00:50:09,499 --> 00:50:11,084
-Damn you.
-Go ahead.

672
00:50:11,668 --> 00:50:12,586
Do you…

673
00:50:12,669 --> 00:50:14,796
Do you think I will not be able to?

674
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,256
You are as impudent as you look.

675
00:50:16,339 --> 00:50:18,341
Look who is talking.

676
00:50:19,176 --> 00:50:21,428
My grandfather is
at the Unanimous Assembly?

677
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:22,345
Yes.

678
00:50:22,929 --> 00:50:26,016
I could not find the medical manual
you requested at Jeongjingak.

679
00:50:26,767 --> 00:50:28,935
I will go to Jeongjingak
and look for it myself.

680
00:50:30,145 --> 00:50:32,314
The Unanimous Assembly must be a big deal.

681
00:50:32,397 --> 00:50:35,275
All the mages at Sejukwon
must have gone there.

682
00:50:39,196 --> 00:50:42,699
I was told that my son
is still alive here.

683
00:51:07,891 --> 00:51:08,975
Ji-ho…

684
00:51:27,994 --> 00:51:29,329
You are alive.

685
00:51:38,046 --> 00:51:39,089
Ji-ho.

686
00:52:06,074 --> 00:52:08,159
Everyone, please settle down!

687
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,956
I think it is time

688
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:15,792
for Jin Ho-gyeong to get involved
and settle the issue.

689
00:52:25,176 --> 00:52:28,263
Everyone! That is enough!

690
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,184
-I will get back to you later!
-Fine by me!

691
00:52:33,268 --> 00:52:34,811
Consider yourself lucky.

692
00:52:35,604 --> 00:52:36,479
Allow me to speak.

693
00:52:37,689 --> 00:52:39,608
Judging by everyone's opinions,

694
00:52:39,691 --> 00:52:41,735
it seems best that we use the ice stone

695
00:52:41,818 --> 00:52:45,780
left by Master Seo Gyeong
for the benefit of everyone here.

696
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:48,074
Therefore,

697
00:52:48,158 --> 00:52:52,704
I, Jin Ho-gyeong, the leader of Jinyowon,
would like to make a suggestion.

698
00:52:52,787 --> 00:52:56,166
How about giving the rights
to gather the Unanimous Assembly

699
00:52:56,833 --> 00:53:00,754
to Jinyowon instead of Songrim
from now on?

700
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,511
If no one here is against the idea,

701
00:53:08,595 --> 00:53:10,430
I shall end the gathering here.

702
00:53:10,513 --> 00:53:14,100
And as of this moment on,
Jinyowon will take Songrim's place

703
00:53:14,976 --> 00:53:17,520
and take charge of holding the discussions
regarding the ice stone.

704
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:24,736
I will take that as a yes

705
00:53:24,819 --> 00:53:26,571
and end today's Unanimous Assembly.

706
00:53:28,448 --> 00:53:31,826
As for the ice stone,
it will remain inside Jinyowon.

707
00:53:33,036 --> 00:53:34,579
The right thing to do

708
00:53:35,497 --> 00:53:39,542
is to destroy the ice stone
to prevent further quarrels.

709
00:53:39,626 --> 00:53:42,087
What gives Songrim the right
to make that decision?

710
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,505
No one here agrees with it.

711
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:46,633
The alchemy of souls has been performed,
and that was possible

712
00:53:46,716 --> 00:53:49,094
because of the Soul Ejector
created from that ice stone.

713
00:53:49,177 --> 00:53:51,304
First, you cast doubt
on Cheonbugwan and the royal family.

714
00:53:51,388 --> 00:53:53,723
And now, you are
doing the same to Jinyowon.

715
00:53:55,308 --> 00:53:58,603
I will not allow
the Unanimous Assembly to end like this.

716
00:54:00,146 --> 00:54:01,314
Lady Jin.

717
00:54:01,398 --> 00:54:07,404
I forbid you to take the ice stone
outside of Songrim.

718
00:54:07,487 --> 00:54:10,615
Are you trying to go up against
everyone here?

719
00:54:10,699 --> 00:54:12,075
No one is allowed

720
00:54:13,243 --> 00:54:15,620
to take the ice stone outside of Songrim.

721
00:54:24,796 --> 00:54:26,214
I order you to fight

722
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:29,843
and stop anyone who attempts to do so.

723
00:54:33,805 --> 00:54:35,849
A war will break out at this rate.

724
00:54:44,149 --> 00:54:45,859
The situation has turned unstable.

725
00:54:45,942 --> 00:54:47,777
You should get involved, Your Majesty.

726
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:50,822
Master Lee was right.

727
00:54:50,905 --> 00:54:53,616
Everyone coveted it,
which led to endless fights.

728
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,285
And that is why it was banned.

729
00:54:57,245 --> 00:54:59,164
Everyone is fighting over the ice stone,

730
00:54:59,831 --> 00:55:01,041
which means Master Lee

731
00:55:01,124 --> 00:55:03,460
must also be right about the King's Star.

732
00:55:48,088 --> 00:55:50,965
I can see that
all of my former masters are here.

733
00:55:51,758 --> 00:55:54,594
Allow your former pupil, Jang Uk,
to greet all of you.

734
00:55:55,553 --> 00:55:57,305
Who is that young man?

735
00:55:57,388 --> 00:55:58,640
He is Jang Uk.

736
00:55:58,723 --> 00:56:01,518
The reckless son of the Jang family
who used to be my pupil.

737
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:04,813
As I recall,
your family also tried to train him.

738
00:56:05,438 --> 00:56:07,857
Yes, I remember he ran away
in just three days.

739
00:56:07,941 --> 00:56:11,069
I apologize for interrupting
this passionate discussion

740
00:56:11,653 --> 00:56:14,405
with the sound of the drum.

741
00:56:17,158 --> 00:56:19,911
-What should I stop him?
-Let him talk.

742
00:56:20,495 --> 00:56:23,540
Whatever the case,
he managed to stop the fight.

743
00:56:24,249 --> 00:56:25,875
Jang Uk, son of Jang Gang.

744
00:56:27,961 --> 00:56:31,047
You had better have a good reason
for interfering like this

745
00:56:31,131 --> 00:56:33,383
in front of His Majesty the King.

746
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:40,014
I am here to tell you
what Master Seo Gyeong wanted.

747
00:56:51,192 --> 00:56:53,653
I told him the true intentions
of Master Seo Gyeong.

748
00:56:53,736 --> 00:56:55,488
I hope he uses it wisely.

749
00:57:01,578 --> 00:57:05,206
I tell you this on behalf of Master Lee,
a pupil of Master Seo Gyeong.

750
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:07,584
So I expect everyone here
to show their respect

751
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:09,544
and listen to Master Seo Gyeong's will.

752
00:57:18,219 --> 00:57:20,305
According to Master Lee,

753
00:57:20,388 --> 00:57:22,849
Master Seo Gyeong's will
regarding the ice stone

754
00:57:22,932 --> 00:57:24,642
is written in Words of the Heart.

755
00:57:27,145 --> 00:57:29,522
He wrote down the reason
he left behind the ice stone

756
00:57:29,606 --> 00:57:32,192
and left it for all the mages
of Jeongjingak to read,

757
00:57:32,275 --> 00:57:35,487
meaning Songrim did not hide anything.

758
00:57:38,615 --> 00:57:42,118
I believe most of you here
have also read Words of the Heart.

759
00:57:42,619 --> 00:57:46,331
Our job is to find his intentions
in Words of the Heart.

760
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:50,835
Do you remember what it was about?

761
00:57:50,919 --> 00:57:53,588
No, I read it too long ago.

762
00:57:53,671 --> 00:57:55,340
Are you saying he wrote down

763
00:57:55,423 --> 00:57:57,467
why he left the ice stone in that book?

764
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,345
Yes.

765
00:58:00,428 --> 00:58:04,015
I was told that everyone will follow
Master Seo Gyeong's wishes.

766
00:58:04,098 --> 00:58:06,559
So what you should really be fighting over

767
00:58:06,643 --> 00:58:08,895
is Words of the Heart, not the ice stone.

768
00:58:08,978 --> 00:58:12,106
Where is the so-called Words of the Heart
that he is talking about?

769
00:58:12,815 --> 00:58:14,609
Songrim had been keeping it,

770
00:58:14,692 --> 00:58:18,571
but we recently sent it to Jinyowon
on Master Lee's orders.

771
00:58:20,281 --> 00:58:22,867
It is being kept inside Jinyowon.

772
00:58:22,951 --> 00:58:25,078
Then bring the book here.

773
00:58:27,205 --> 00:58:28,373
Yes, Your Majesty.

774
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:38,466
I am Jin Cho-yeon of Jinyowon.

775
00:58:39,259 --> 00:58:41,135
I will bring Words of the Heart.

776
00:58:41,803 --> 00:58:43,555
As it used to belong to Songrim,

777
00:58:43,638 --> 00:58:45,807
I will send someone from Songrim as well.

778
00:58:46,558 --> 00:58:49,102
Dang-gu, I want you to go with her.

779
00:58:55,024 --> 00:58:56,192
Let us go.

780
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:13,209
It has been decades

781
00:59:14,127 --> 00:59:17,880
since I last read Words of the Heart.

782
00:59:17,964 --> 00:59:20,091
Can you remind me what it was about?

783
00:59:20,174 --> 00:59:22,385
It is just a short piece of poetry.

784
00:59:23,595 --> 00:59:26,014
Then is Uk lying?

785
00:59:26,097 --> 00:59:28,182
It does not say anything
about the ice stone.

786
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:33,021
I have no idea why he suddenly brought up
Words of the Heart.

787
00:59:36,065 --> 00:59:38,568
What is inside Words of the Heart?

788
00:59:38,651 --> 00:59:40,028
I do not know.

789
00:59:41,112 --> 00:59:44,907
He is probably just bluffing
to stall the situation.

790
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,744
But that book was written by Seo Gyeong.

791
00:59:48,453 --> 00:59:51,164
We barely managed
to break everyone's trust in Songrim.

792
00:59:51,247 --> 00:59:53,583
What if that causes everyone
to trust Songrim again?

793
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:59,464
Young Master Jang,
they seem extremely angry.

794
00:59:59,547 --> 01:00:01,716
Soon, they will also be startled.

795
01:00:02,592 --> 01:00:03,801
But to do that,

796
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:06,054
I need his help.

797
01:00:18,816 --> 01:00:21,027
This is nothing more than just poetry.

798
01:00:22,111 --> 01:00:23,988
Is there a meaning behind this?

799
01:00:25,406 --> 01:00:26,574
I am not sure.

800
01:00:27,617 --> 01:00:30,286
He must have used the book
to stop the fighting.

801
01:00:30,912 --> 01:00:32,872
If he did it to stall for time,

802
01:00:33,373 --> 01:00:35,166
I should take as much time as I can.

803
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:36,793
Let us hurry back.

804
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:38,628
No, wait.

805
01:00:38,711 --> 01:00:41,547
I am extremely starving.
Do you have anything to eat?

806
01:00:42,632 --> 01:00:44,342
I did not even have breakfast.

807
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:48,262
Are you purposely trying
to buy time for Songrim?

808
01:00:51,349 --> 01:00:54,268
Do you want to return
and see everyone get into a dispute again?

809
01:00:54,352 --> 01:00:56,396
We have no time to argue.

810
01:00:56,479 --> 01:00:57,980
My mother and sister are waiting.

811
01:00:58,815 --> 01:01:00,274
Young Lady Jin.

812
01:01:01,818 --> 01:01:03,319
Do you really think

813
01:01:04,362 --> 01:01:06,197
she is your real sister?

814
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:08,908
Why do you ask?

815
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:14,288
You know that the real culprit behind
the murder that Mu-deok was accused of

816
01:01:14,372 --> 01:01:16,082
was a girl named So-i, right?

817
01:01:18,543 --> 01:01:20,461
The girl you believe to be your sister

818
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:23,131
is actually So-i.

819
01:01:25,425 --> 01:01:26,592
What?

820
01:01:45,903 --> 01:01:49,699
I heard you told Cho-yeon that
you feel uneasy about that girl.

821
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:53,536
Yes.

822
01:01:55,413 --> 01:01:57,498
I feel uneasy because I sense bad energy.

823
01:01:57,582 --> 01:02:00,376
I do not wish for her
to come near me ever again.

824
01:02:06,382 --> 01:02:08,801
I should always make sure
to keep you safe,

825
01:02:09,635 --> 01:02:10,928
so I will get rid of her.

826
01:02:17,185 --> 01:02:18,770
Thank you, Mother.

827
01:02:46,547 --> 01:02:47,840
Her attitude has changed.

828
01:02:48,716 --> 01:02:50,384
Does she know that she is fake?

829
01:02:51,803 --> 01:02:53,805
Is she using her, knowing she is fake?

830
01:02:56,057 --> 01:02:58,810
Why did you use Words of the Heart
to stall for time?

831
01:03:02,814 --> 01:03:05,817
DAILY LOG OF CHEONBUGWAN

832
01:03:08,528 --> 01:03:10,196
"The fifth of May."

833
01:03:10,279 --> 01:03:12,448
"While Cheonbugwan's Gwanju, Jang Gang,

834
01:03:12,532 --> 01:03:15,201
attempted to capture Shaman Choi
for cursing someone with sorcery,

835
01:03:15,284 --> 01:03:17,787
she ran away into a fire."

836
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,622
"She is presumed dead."

837
01:03:21,082 --> 01:03:23,084
The story we heard
from Shaman Bong at Gaema Village

838
01:03:23,835 --> 01:03:25,169
actually exists as a record.

839
01:03:25,753 --> 01:03:29,590
This is probably when Shaman Choi
and Jin Mu met.

840
01:03:29,674 --> 01:03:32,802
Why are you so persistent
about finding this Shaman Choi?

841
01:03:32,885 --> 01:03:36,305
Did you find the house that
Eunuch Kim frequented at Gaema Village?

842
01:03:37,682 --> 01:03:39,016
Yes, I did.

843
01:03:39,517 --> 01:03:42,186
The place he frequented was an apothecary.

844
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:43,646
An apothecary?

845
01:03:44,272 --> 01:03:46,858
I have told you one thing,
so it is your turn to tell me.

846
01:03:48,442 --> 01:03:49,610
Eunuch Kim

847
01:03:50,444 --> 01:03:52,864
referred to the person he served
as "Shaman Choi."

848
01:03:56,742 --> 01:03:58,661
The person that Eunuch Kim served was…

849
01:03:58,744 --> 01:04:00,496
It was Her Highness, the Queen.

850
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,167
I know you have also been
suspicious of her.

851
01:04:05,251 --> 01:04:08,129
The soul of the actual Queen
is still alive.

852
01:04:08,963 --> 01:04:11,799
She is most likely at the place
that Eunuch Kim kept going to.

853
01:04:12,758 --> 01:04:14,594
How can you be sure that she is alive?

854
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:22,101
The Queen's Lantern of Life
is still glowing.

855
01:04:22,184 --> 01:04:24,020
She is a member of the Seo family.

856
01:04:24,687 --> 01:04:26,022
I will find the real Queen

857
01:04:26,105 --> 01:04:29,150
and reveal the true identity of the one
at the Unanimous Assembly.

858
01:04:34,155 --> 01:04:36,532
So you want me to get involved in this?

859
01:04:36,616 --> 01:04:38,784
This is regarding your mother.

860
01:04:44,498 --> 01:04:45,791
What do you plan to do

861
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:48,002
with the ice stone
after you reveal everything?

862
01:04:48,085 --> 01:04:49,962
I will follow Master Seo Gyeong's wishes

863
01:04:50,046 --> 01:04:51,964
and do what is written
in Words of the Heart.

864
01:04:52,048 --> 01:04:52,924
Uk.

865
01:04:53,883 --> 01:04:56,093
Words of the Heart
is not about the ice stone.

866
01:04:56,177 --> 01:04:59,805
I thought you lied
to buy yourself some time.

867
01:04:59,889 --> 01:05:01,223
I did not lie.

868
01:05:01,933 --> 01:05:03,601
The reason Master Seo Gyeong

869
01:05:03,684 --> 01:05:06,604
left the ice stone
is clearly written in Words of the Heart.

870
01:05:11,943 --> 01:05:14,612
The ice stone holds the power of Hwansu.
Am I correct?

871
01:05:14,695 --> 01:05:17,323
It has the power
to control water, fire, and wind,

872
01:05:17,406 --> 01:05:20,326
as well as the power
to freely control the souls of humans.

873
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:22,370
That is why

874
01:05:22,453 --> 01:05:24,664
its power should be forbidden to mankind.

875
01:05:24,747 --> 01:05:28,042
It is hard to believe that
such a small piece of ice

876
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:29,293
holds such great power.

877
01:05:29,377 --> 01:05:30,878
I must see it for myself.

878
01:05:34,966 --> 01:05:37,760
Has anyone here witnessed its power
with their own two eyes?

879
01:05:40,805 --> 01:05:44,433
Were you fighting over the ice stone
without even having witnessed its power?

880
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,146
Then how about we check

881
01:05:50,272 --> 01:05:52,566
how powerful it is
with everyone here as a witness?

882
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:55,403
How exactly do you suggest we do that?

883
01:05:55,486 --> 01:05:56,696
If it controls souls,

884
01:05:57,405 --> 01:06:00,074
then it should be able to bring back
a dead person to life.

885
01:06:01,575 --> 01:06:04,286
The power of Hwansu is not sorcery,
so it is not forbidden.

886
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:06,080
And bringing someone back to life
is a good deed.

887
01:06:07,832 --> 01:06:09,333
Lady Jin, you brought the ice stone here,

888
01:06:10,626 --> 01:06:12,086
so you should show its power to us.

889
01:06:13,546 --> 01:06:14,880
Your Majesty.

890
01:06:14,964 --> 01:06:18,009
No one here is dead.
Who are we supposed to bring back to life?

891
01:06:19,427 --> 01:06:21,095
Then kill someone.

892
01:06:27,018 --> 01:06:27,893
Hey, you.

893
01:06:31,355 --> 01:06:33,524
Come over here.

894
01:06:35,818 --> 01:06:36,736
Yes, Your Majesty.

895
01:06:42,074 --> 01:06:43,701
Kill her and then bring her back to life.

896
01:06:44,285 --> 01:06:45,828
She is a maid who knows no spells.

897
01:06:46,412 --> 01:06:49,623
So you will not have to worry about her
getting close to the ice stone.

898
01:06:49,707 --> 01:06:50,541
Your Majesty.

899
01:06:50,624 --> 01:06:53,002
We cannot kill someone
for a mere experiment.

900
01:06:53,085 --> 01:06:54,962
What I want is
to see her come back to life

901
01:06:55,546 --> 01:06:56,422
with this.

902
01:06:56,505 --> 01:06:58,549
How could you ask someone
so young and weak

903
01:06:58,632 --> 01:07:00,926
to do something so fearful?

904
01:07:04,555 --> 01:07:05,639
Tell me.

905
01:07:06,724 --> 01:07:08,017
Are you too scared?

906
01:07:11,562 --> 01:07:13,064
I will pay you 100 yangs worth of gold.

907
01:07:13,773 --> 01:07:15,107
What do you say?

908
01:07:18,486 --> 01:07:19,570
Yes.

909
01:07:20,362 --> 01:07:21,530
I will try it.

910
01:07:22,948 --> 01:07:24,075
I will sacrifice myself

911
01:07:24,825 --> 01:07:28,370
to show the very power
that you and everyone here

912
01:07:29,455 --> 01:07:31,332
wish to witness.

913
01:07:59,777 --> 01:08:02,154
This is finally my chance
to acquire the ice stone.

914
01:08:03,906 --> 01:08:08,410
In order to succeed in doing that,
I must die first.

915
01:08:10,121 --> 01:08:14,125
No one here cares about
whether I live or die.

916
01:08:15,376 --> 01:08:17,962
They only desire to witness

917
01:08:18,462 --> 01:08:20,422
the power of the ice stone.

918
01:08:40,818 --> 01:08:42,987
I have no way of knowing
if I will just die

919
01:08:43,487 --> 01:08:47,283
or retrieve my power
through the ice stone.

920
01:08:48,534 --> 01:08:50,619
I have pushed myself
to the edge of a cliff

921
01:08:51,579 --> 01:08:54,623
with the ice stone in front of me.

922
01:08:54,707 --> 01:08:56,208
I also missed you.

923
01:08:59,503 --> 01:09:00,504
That is my reply.

924
01:09:01,672 --> 01:09:05,092
I am relieved that you did not
have to stand here beside me.

925
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:09,013
It was a desire to save the person
he cared about.

926
01:09:09,597 --> 01:09:11,640
Master Seo Gyeong's Words of the Heart

927
01:09:11,724 --> 01:09:14,143
was a letter written to a dying lover.

928
01:09:14,226 --> 01:09:17,062
He wrote that he left something behind
in hopes to keep her by his side.

929
01:09:17,146 --> 01:09:18,898
Are you saying the great hero

930
01:09:19,815 --> 01:09:22,234
who destroyed the ice stone
to save the world

931
01:09:22,318 --> 01:09:25,529
was tempted to use it
just to save someone's life?

932
01:09:25,613 --> 01:09:27,698
It shows the foolishness
and heartache of a man

933
01:09:28,365 --> 01:09:30,993
who was willing to go against
the laws of nature to save a loved one.

934
01:09:31,827 --> 01:09:36,832
That is Master Seo Gyeong's confession
in Words of the Heart.

935
01:09:41,712 --> 01:09:44,465
I am not happy
about this situation either.

936
01:09:46,258 --> 01:09:48,636
I will make sure you die a painless death.

937
01:09:50,346 --> 01:09:52,681
This is not to see me die.

938
01:09:53,974 --> 01:09:56,018
It is to see me come back to life.

939
01:09:59,647 --> 01:10:01,065
Bring me back to life

940
01:10:02,107 --> 01:10:03,692
so no one here is disappointed.

941
01:10:05,736 --> 01:10:07,446
Then let us not disappoint anyone.

942
01:10:11,116 --> 01:10:13,244
A mother will be killing her own daughter.

943
01:11:09,383 --> 01:11:10,551
You look beautiful.

944
01:11:12,052 --> 01:11:13,846
My Bu-yeon.

945
01:11:22,688 --> 01:11:23,814
Mother.

946
01:12:23,332 --> 01:12:24,792
Something has gone awry.

947
01:12:24,875 --> 01:12:26,377
Could something have
happened to the ice stone?

948
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:29,838
The moment we reached the gate,
a strong gust of wind hit us.

949
01:12:29,922 --> 01:12:31,632
It definitely all happened
because of Mu-deok.

950
01:12:32,508 --> 01:12:34,134
The kids are in there!

951
01:12:34,218 --> 01:12:35,260
Yun-ok!

952
01:12:35,344 --> 01:12:37,513
My energy just drained from the sword.

953
01:12:37,596 --> 01:12:39,723
I think the barrier
is causing the problem.

954
01:12:39,807 --> 01:12:41,683
The soul shifter, Master Kang,
has disappeared?

955
01:12:42,851 --> 01:12:46,522
None of us could use spells in here.
So why can he?

956
01:12:46,605 --> 01:12:48,357
We cannot all die.

957
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,442
I will lure and trap him
in the secret room.

958
01:12:50,526 --> 01:12:52,111
Jang Uk could die!

959
01:12:52,653 --> 01:12:55,781
If it is closed,
he is probably already dead.

960
01:12:57,491 --> 01:12:59,118
Jang Uk, my pupil…

961
01:13:01,829 --> 01:13:06,834
