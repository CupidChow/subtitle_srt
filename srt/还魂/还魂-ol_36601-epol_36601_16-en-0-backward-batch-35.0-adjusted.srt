1
00:00:00,744 --> 00:00:02,287
What if I do not mind dying?

2
00:00:03,038 --> 00:00:05,415
Then can I hold onto it
and keep loving you?

3
00:00:07,876 --> 00:00:10,003
I told you that
I am willing to risk it all

4
00:00:10,962 --> 00:00:12,756
and that we are in this together.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,217
I will keep going no matter what.

6
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:20,764
So you should do the same
and stick to your confession.

7
00:00:22,348 --> 00:00:24,309
Keep loving me to death.

8
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:40,950
Mu-deok, you should not glare like that.

9
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:44,245
Nobody would believe your words
if you glare at me like that.

10
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:46,956
Then tell me, Young Master.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,002
How should I look to convince people
that I love you to death?

12
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:53,838
Well, first of all…

13
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,467
Glaring at me like that
will definitely not do.

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,137
They say one's eyes would be
brimming with sweetness.

15
00:01:03,556 --> 00:01:04,766
I guess that is not possible.

16
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:07,936
So why did you say you love me to death?

17
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:11,314
You should have said
you were mildly attracted to me instead.

18
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:15,318
Say that I do my best
to look at you with sweetness

19
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:17,529
and keep loving you to death.

20
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:19,697
What happens after that?

21
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:21,074
After?

22
00:01:21,157 --> 00:01:24,035
Should I keep loving you blindly

23
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,913
while Maidservant Kim
desperately tries to marry you off?

24
00:01:27,997 --> 00:01:31,167
What would happen to me then?

25
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:35,004
Do not worry.
I have no intention of marrying for now.

26
00:01:35,088 --> 00:01:36,756
"No intention," my foot.

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,676
Is that not why you refused
to drink chaste herb tea?

28
00:01:42,053 --> 00:01:45,223
So what you are asking me is

29
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:48,309
a promise of some sort?

30
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:50,270
If I am to stay in love with you,

31
00:01:51,437 --> 00:01:53,815
I need to be certain that you are mine.

32
00:01:56,067 --> 00:02:00,029
Let us not rush into things.

33
00:02:00,113 --> 00:02:01,030
So you refuse.

34
00:02:02,949 --> 00:02:05,827
Why is everything so dramatic with you?

35
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,454
I am just saying that
we cannot rush things right now.

36
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:11,541
I have to discuss it
with Maidservant Kim too.

37
00:02:11,624 --> 00:02:12,625
Good grief.

38
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:14,377
Never mind then.

39
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:17,172
"Eyes brimming with sweetness," my foot.

40
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:19,841
I will just glare at you like a dog.

41
00:02:19,924 --> 00:02:21,009
A dog?

42
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:22,969
That is right.

43
00:02:23,052 --> 00:02:26,514
I forgot to tell you something important.

44
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,933
It was that dog.

45
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,060
What are you talking about?

46
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:34,355
The dog that was with Master Lee
at Danhyanggok. Do you remember?

47
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:36,232
Sapsali?

48
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:37,650
Yes.

49
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:40,028
That dog was Gwigu.

50
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,660
Master Lee knew that you were
a soul shifter from the beginning.

51
00:02:47,744 --> 00:02:48,912
Perhaps,

52
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:51,623
he even knows you are Naksu.

53
00:03:05,178 --> 00:03:08,765
What brings the leader of Jinyowon
to Songrim at this hour?

54
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,980
She must be here for you.

55
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:18,107
I heard that

56
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:21,653
you took Gwigu, a relic of Jinyowon,
to the palace today.

57
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:24,530
It was to find traces
of sorcery at the palace.

58
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:29,118
I warned you not to get Jinyowon involved
in any more soul shifter cases.

59
00:03:29,202 --> 00:03:31,371
Why is Songrim using Jinyowon at will?

60
00:03:33,665 --> 00:03:35,583
Mage families under the Unanimous Assembly

61
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:37,335
must strive to stop sorcery.

62
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:41,214
If Songrim is striving to do just that,
Jinyowon should offer their assistance.

63
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:43,466
Do you not think so?

64
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:46,511
So you mean you will use us again.

65
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,098
Then I will take Gwigu.

66
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:52,558
Hand it over to me.

67
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:56,980
Or should I look for it myself?

68
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,190
Gwigu is right here.

69
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:12,829
Gwigu was a relic created
by Master Seo Gyeong.

70
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:14,497
Therefore, it also belongs to Songrim.

71
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,874
Why would Jinyowon's relic
also belong to Songrim?

72
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:20,586
Are you saying Jinyowon is
some kind of storehouse for Songrim?

73
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,422
That is not what he meant.

74
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:26,092
You boldly assume everything
in Jinyowon is yours to take.

75
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:28,553
You take things without asking
and never return them.

76
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:30,930
That must be
how the people of Songrim are.

77
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:37,061
You said something similar before.

78
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:42,984
That a mage of Songrim had taken
something from Jinyowon.

79
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:51,951
Who was that mage?

80
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:05,923
He is right before my eyes.

81
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:09,594
The one who snuck into Jinyowon

82
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:11,345
and stole Gwigu.

83
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,726
How dare you call Master Lee a thief!

84
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:19,687
What else do you call someone who steals?

85
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:22,690
Mother, please.

86
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:26,861
It was Master Lee who moved Gwigu
from the broken pottery

87
00:05:26,944 --> 00:05:28,654
into the body of that dog.

88
00:05:28,738 --> 00:05:30,573
It was Songrim that broke the pottery.

89
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:31,824
How dare you!

90
00:06:33,553 --> 00:06:35,263
It is dead, Master.

91
00:06:39,142 --> 00:06:40,726
I was protecting my daughter.

92
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,188
Master Lee, did you command
Gwigu to attack us?

93
00:06:44,272 --> 00:06:46,858
Gwigu attacked because it sensed sorcery.

94
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:52,321
Then that means

95
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:56,117
that the young lady had traces of sorcery.

96
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:07,003
It must have sensed the sorcery
of the worm that sucked her blood.

97
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:15,052
Young Lady Jin.

98
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:17,138
Have you ever

99
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,599
used sorcery?

100
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,024
Sorcery? That is preposterous!

101
00:07:28,107 --> 00:07:29,358
If not,

102
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:31,777
why would Gwigu have attacked her?

103
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:35,406
Songrim must be trying
to frame my daughter.

104
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,991
Please stop!

105
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,410
Master Lee is right.

106
00:07:42,997 --> 00:07:44,207
A while ago,

107
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:48,544
I did use sorcery.

108
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:58,387
But it was not meant to hurt anyone.

109
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:08,606
It is quite popular these days.

110
00:08:09,982 --> 00:08:13,569
It is a Lovers' Charm.
It helps grant one's love.

111
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:21,536
I think it was because of that.

112
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:32,129
It seems our daughter has
caused a misunderstanding.

113
00:08:32,213 --> 00:08:33,297
Our apologies.

114
00:08:57,071 --> 00:09:00,866
You stayed alive in the body of this dog

115
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:03,494
but now you are gone.

116
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:15,673
Gwigu has now completely vanished.

117
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:19,093
What do I do?

118
00:09:19,844 --> 00:09:23,556
Is it my fault that Gwigu died?

119
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,515
Cho-yeon!

120
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:27,643
How dare you disgrace Jinyowon?

121
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:53,586
Gwigu is dead?

122
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:55,546
Yes.

123
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,466
Master Lee said he will bury it
in the daylight tomorrow.

124
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:01,719
So this dog was Gwigu.

125
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:08,142
It must have known that
I was a soul shifter from the beginning.

126
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:11,187
But it never barked at me.

127
00:10:12,188 --> 00:10:15,608
Was it covering for me too?

128
00:10:20,237 --> 00:10:21,864
Even though it is dead, it is still Gwigu.

129
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:25,576
There might still be traces of its powers.
Do not touch it.

130
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:36,337
Did the people from Jinyowon leave?

131
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,047
They are discussing
another issue right now.

132
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:39,632
Another issue?

133
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:41,842
It turns out Dang-gu and Cho-yeon

134
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:44,095
were lovers.

135
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:46,597
-What?
-What?

136
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,935
I was the one who destroyed
a relic of Jinyowon

137
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,895
so Songrim is not at fault.

138
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,398
We shall now leave.

139
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,651
-Let us go.
-Yes.

140
00:10:58,734 --> 00:10:59,985
Lady Jin.

141
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:02,321
Have some tea before you leave.

142
00:11:02,905 --> 00:11:05,116
We should clear misunderstandings
and make meaningful bonds.

143
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:06,951
Make bonds?

144
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,994
These two are in love.

145
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:11,455
The charm that you took out before

146
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:14,166
was for Dang-gu, right?

147
00:11:16,544 --> 00:11:18,796
Yes. I am the cause of all of this.

148
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,132
Cho-yeon did not do anything wrong.

149
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,216
Be quiet.

150
00:11:24,844 --> 00:11:26,554
I found out recently too.

151
00:11:26,637 --> 00:11:28,431
He was talking nonsense

152
00:11:28,514 --> 00:11:31,267
about how they will be together
when your late daughter returns

153
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,102
so I reprimanded him.

154
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:36,230
My late daughter?
Bu-yeon is alive and we will find her.

155
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,317
Do you really believe
Jin Mu will find her?

156
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:43,821
You are being fooled by him.

157
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:46,782
Did Jin Mu give you the idea
to search all over Songrim

158
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:48,701
looking for Gwigu at this hour?

159
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:50,995
I told you not to meddle in our affairs.

160
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:54,415
Now, let us not fight.

161
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:57,626
It would be wonderful news
to find Bu-yeon.

162
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,255
Lady Jin does not want to
make enemies with Songrim either.

163
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,759
Let us be cordial as we were before.

164
00:12:05,843 --> 00:12:07,303
Who knows?

165
00:12:07,386 --> 00:12:11,015
Cho-yeon and Dang-gu
may unite the two families.

166
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,433
I respectfully decline.

167
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:15,227
Cho-yeon will have a better suitor.

168
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:20,649
Who is better than
the Park family of Songrim?

169
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,276
A daughter of the Jin family

170
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:25,112
is good enough to be
the bride of the Crown Prince.

171
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:27,615
Mother.

172
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:29,283
What are you saying?

173
00:12:30,242 --> 00:12:31,452
I do not want to.

174
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:34,330
The Crown Prince is unkind.

175
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:36,874
-I do not like him.
-Cho-yeon.

176
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,502
I wish to marry the one I love.

177
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:41,879
Yes.

178
00:12:42,505 --> 00:12:44,423
I am the one she loves.

179
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:45,549
Dang-gu!

180
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:52,640
We will talk at home.

181
00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:57,728
Let go of his hand and follow me.

182
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,524
Let her go for now.

183
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:03,442
Let go of her hand so she can leave.

184
00:13:04,735 --> 00:13:06,278
Let go of his hand.

185
00:13:06,362 --> 00:13:07,446
Let go!

186
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,581
Cho-yeon.

187
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:20,584
If you wish to be so disobedient,
do not bother coming home.

188
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,555
I think it is best that we leave.

189
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:36,892
Will you not come home with us?

190
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:39,436
I will not obey Mother this time.

191
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:42,231
Please understand, Father.

192
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:47,403
I will send word
when your mother's anger subsides.

193
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:50,990
Please take care of her for a while.

194
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,658
I will.

195
00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:04,879
Uncle, I apologize for the trouble.

196
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:06,547
But I will protect my lady.

197
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,464
Get out!

198
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:20,853
Where should we go now?

199
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,231
I do not know.

200
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:29,778
Since he told us to leave,

201
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:32,698
we could go to an inn and get…

202
00:14:33,365 --> 00:14:35,242
-Get a room?
-Sorry?

203
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,787
That is not what I meant!

204
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:41,707
Not one room,
but separate rooms of course.

205
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,338
I do not like inns.

206
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,009
There is nowhere else to go for now.

207
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,594
And it is getting cold…

208
00:14:54,345 --> 00:14:55,387
It is cold…

209
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,183
Where can we go?

210
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,643
Young Master Park!

211
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:05,397
They said Young Master Jang was released,
but he is not in his room.

212
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:06,815
Have you seen him?

213
00:15:11,737 --> 00:15:13,739
Is there something wrong?

214
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:18,953
-Maidservant Kim…
-What?

215
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:20,037
Maidservant Kim.

216
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,039
Please let go, Young Master Park.

217
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,334
Young Lady Jin? What is going on?

218
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:27,044
Maidservant Kim…

219
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,588
Gwigu, which caused mayhem at the palace,

220
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:33,384
was destroyed by Lady Jin
as she was trying to retrieve it.

221
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,219
Gwigu was destroyed?

222
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,179
Why would she destroy something
that detects sorcery?

223
00:15:37,262 --> 00:15:39,640
Detecting sorcery was just an excuse.

224
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:42,685
It was a relic that Songrim used
to threaten the royal family.

225
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:44,895
Jin Mu is right.

226
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:48,524
Songrim wanted to show off
that they were more powerful than us.

227
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:51,694
Under the guise of rooting out sorcery,

228
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:54,279
Songrim can mobilize
the mages of the Unanimous Assembly

229
00:15:54,363 --> 00:15:56,323
and dethrone the king.

230
00:15:57,032 --> 00:15:59,284
Is that why they mentioned
the King's Star?

231
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:02,413
To warn me that they could dethrone me?

232
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:06,208
The reason Master Lee mentioned
the King's Star was to explain

233
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:09,837
that someone like Master Seo Gyeong
will come to save us from troubled times.

234
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,797
It was not to threaten us.

235
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,175
What if the one that saves us
wants to rule us as well?

236
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:17,428
Do you think you can stop him?

237
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:20,597
Gwanju Jang Gang of Cheonbugwan

238
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:22,391
predicted that
the King's Star will appear.

239
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:24,476
Master Lee said that as well.

240
00:16:25,978 --> 00:16:28,897
Does Songrim know this too?

241
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:40,909
He tried to sire a son with the energy of
the King's Star from his many concubines.

242
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:43,495
Now he is trying to find one in Songrim.

243
00:16:44,288 --> 00:16:46,582
It is natural
for the King to be so threatened.

244
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,251
To the royal household of Go,

245
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:52,463
the existence of the King's Star
could signal treason.

246
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:00,679
"Treason"?

247
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:04,433
People of Daeho do believe in
and worship the heavens,

248
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,770
but a centuries-old monarchy
would not crumble so easily.

249
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:10,522
It is preposterous to think
that one can become king

250
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:11,940
because of some constellation.

251
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:14,735
If he is from Songrim, it is possible.

252
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:18,906
Master Seo Gyeong of Songrim
saved the world 200 years ago.

253
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,744
He is still revered within Daeho.

254
00:17:25,204 --> 00:17:27,873
If someone was born under the King's Star
like Master Seo Gyeong,

255
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:32,628
it could make a convincing reason
to become a King.

256
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:36,048
So you think

257
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:40,094
the King's worries may come true?

258
00:17:42,638 --> 00:17:44,056
Do not be concerned.

259
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:49,561
As long as I am here,
that will never happen.

260
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:55,567
Very well.

261
00:17:55,651 --> 00:18:00,197
I will not be foolish like my father
and live under constant fear.

262
00:18:04,535 --> 00:18:06,912
When I brought Gwigu to the palace,

263
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:09,581
I could see that you were right.

264
00:18:09,665 --> 00:18:12,918
The Queen is on Jin Mu's side.

265
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:16,964
But we cannot provoke
the royal family just yet.

266
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:19,383
If Songrim tries
to take on the royal family,

267
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:22,553
Jin Mu will surely use
the circumstances of Uk's birth

268
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:24,972
and turn him into
the enemy of the royal family.

269
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:28,684
Then Songrim will become
an enemy of the royal family as well

270
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,352
for taking him in.

271
00:18:31,228 --> 00:18:32,771
We need Jang Gang.

272
00:18:34,106 --> 00:18:36,525
Jang Gang knows the truth.

273
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:39,570
He must know Jin Mu's weakness as well.

274
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:44,032
How can you find someone
who has been wandering for decades?

275
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:47,119
We will have to wait
until he returns of his own accord.

276
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:52,082
The rumors about soul shifters
have spread throughout Daeho Fortress.

277
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,252
If he hears the rumors, he will return,

278
00:18:55,335 --> 00:19:00,174
fearing for Songrim and for his son.

279
00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:40,672
I came because I was summoned.

280
00:19:40,756 --> 00:19:42,257
Where is Master Lee?

281
00:19:44,176 --> 00:19:46,386
He left for Danhyanggok at dawn

282
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:48,347
to bury Sapsali.

283
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:49,848
What?

284
00:19:50,432 --> 00:19:53,393
He is not here? Was it not Master Lee
who summoned me?

285
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:54,895
He did summon you.

286
00:19:56,688 --> 00:19:58,482
He told me to give this to you.

287
00:20:01,193 --> 00:20:05,447
This is the assassin Naksu's sword
that he retrieved from the Crown Prince.

288
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:09,117
He said you are the only one
who can keep this sword

289
00:20:09,201 --> 00:20:10,911
so he told me to give it to you.

290
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,497
He just left me this sword?

291
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,833
Did he not say anything else
before leaving?

292
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:20,087
He did not take you in as his pupil,

293
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,382
so I do not understand
why he is treating you fondly.

294
00:20:23,882 --> 00:20:25,676
You will not even practice chastity.

295
00:20:27,886 --> 00:20:31,223
I heard from Park Jin that
you are head over heels for a woman.

296
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:33,558
If you were in love with Mu-deok,

297
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:35,394
why did you lead on my Yun-ok?

298
00:20:36,895 --> 00:20:39,273
-I never led her on.
-Did you not?

299
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:40,691
You charmed Yun-ok.

300
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:43,652
How did you manage to charm Master Lee?

301
00:20:43,735 --> 00:20:45,487
I did not do anything.

302
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,615
Just because someone is being good to me,

303
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:50,784
does not mean I charmed them.

304
00:20:52,077 --> 00:20:55,122
Be mindful of Yun-ok from now on

305
00:20:55,205 --> 00:20:56,832
and be respectful to Master Lee.

306
00:20:56,915 --> 00:20:57,958
Yes.

307
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:01,628
Master Lee is not close-minded
like other masters at Songrim.

308
00:21:01,712 --> 00:21:04,881
He seems to be open-minded and gracious.

309
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:06,550
I respect him.

310
00:21:07,384 --> 00:21:10,512
You have no idea how strict he can be.

311
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:15,600
He is merciless towards those who stray.

312
00:21:15,684 --> 00:21:18,437
So you must always be careful.

313
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,646
Take it and be off.

314
00:21:26,695 --> 00:21:27,779
I forgot.

315
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:29,448
I almost got in trouble again.

316
00:21:29,531 --> 00:21:31,575
I was told to give you this message

317
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:34,202
when I gave you Naksu's sword.

318
00:21:46,256 --> 00:21:48,300
Why would he give you my sword?

319
00:21:48,884 --> 00:21:51,094
Because I have you,

320
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:53,680
I should have your sword too.

321
00:21:54,598 --> 00:21:57,642
Anyway, this means
he will continue to turn a blind eye.

322
00:21:57,726 --> 00:21:59,061
That is good.

323
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:07,277
I was told to give you this message.

324
00:22:12,115 --> 00:22:14,493
Jang Uk must keep that sword safe.

325
00:22:14,576 --> 00:22:18,455
If anyone tries to use the sword,
they must be killed.

326
00:22:20,582 --> 00:22:22,417
If he fails to do so,

327
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:26,505
he will die as well.

328
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:33,678
It was a warning that he will kill us
if Mu-deok ever uses the sword

329
00:22:34,596 --> 00:22:36,014
as the assassin, Naksu.

330
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,729
The sword feels strange,
even though it is mine.

331
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:46,608
He must have let me live
because he knows I cannot use it.

332
00:22:47,692 --> 00:22:50,278
It means you will be safe as Mu-deok.

333
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:53,365
If I become Naksu, I will be in danger.

334
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,660
Once I find the ice stone
and regain my energy,

335
00:22:57,369 --> 00:22:59,454
I will also gain many enemies.

336
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:02,833
What happens to me then

337
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:04,960
will have nothing to do with you.

338
00:23:05,043 --> 00:23:06,002
Why?

339
00:23:06,711 --> 00:23:08,880
Because we will no longer be
master and pupil?

340
00:23:08,964 --> 00:23:11,299
You will no longer
have a reason to protect me.

341
00:23:11,383 --> 00:23:13,343
Nor will I have a reason
to go easy on you.

342
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:17,139
That was our promise from the start.

343
00:23:24,813 --> 00:23:26,398
Then promise me one more thing.

344
00:23:27,107 --> 00:23:29,401
Out of duty and loyalty,

345
00:23:29,484 --> 00:23:33,530
and also out of the so-called love,
you can grant me one more wish.

346
00:23:35,073 --> 00:23:36,867
Fine. What is it?

347
00:23:37,576 --> 00:23:39,119
When you regain your energy

348
00:23:39,744 --> 00:23:42,289
and if you must draw
and point that sword at someone,

349
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:45,125
point it at me before at anyone else.

350
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,212
If you stab me,

351
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:54,634
then I will die as the one
who released the assassin.

352
00:23:58,388 --> 00:23:59,723
If you withdraw your sword,

353
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,767
I will make you another promise.

354
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,396
Something along the lines of the promise

355
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:10,775
you wanted to hear
from me about our future.

356
00:24:19,201 --> 00:24:22,537
I will look for the ice stone
so you do not run wild

357
00:24:23,955 --> 00:24:25,540
because I promised to do so.

358
00:24:36,718 --> 00:24:38,428
The runaway couple

359
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:40,931
is staying at my house.

360
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:45,018
Dang-gu is there?

361
00:24:47,562 --> 00:24:51,691
Why did you take them in?

362
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:52,943
If not,

363
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:54,861
should I have left them to go into town

364
00:24:54,945 --> 00:24:58,365
to build a lover's nest
and become the talk of the town?

365
00:25:00,408 --> 00:25:01,618
I ask you to be discrete

366
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:04,788
and take good care of them.

367
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:07,290
They are a sweet couple.

368
00:25:07,374 --> 00:25:09,125
Why are you so against it?

369
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:11,461
They cannot marry.

370
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:13,338
So you kicked them out?

371
00:25:13,922 --> 00:25:15,757
My lord, you must stop
this habit of yours.

372
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:20,345
You held Mu-deok and Young Master Jang
for no reason the other night.

373
00:25:20,428 --> 00:25:22,639
You must become more tolerant as you age.

374
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:24,349
Such a shame…

375
00:25:26,184 --> 00:25:28,353
I like Mu-deok a lot.

376
00:25:28,436 --> 00:25:31,356
I like Young Master Jang very much.

377
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:33,149
Maidservant Kim.

378
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,361
What would you do

379
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:40,532
if Uk falls in love
with a woman he should not,

380
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:42,158
like Dang-gu?

381
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:44,244
Would you be tolerant?

382
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,335
Whoever Young Master Jang loves
is fine with me.

383
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:54,170
-Is that right?
-Of course.

384
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,133
I am sure you will.

385
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,844
I know that you care about

386
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:03,888
birth, appearance, age, and much more.

387
00:26:03,972 --> 00:26:05,557
The heart is the most important.

388
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:09,060
If you are in love,
appearances do not matter.

389
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:12,188
So what if she is not that beautiful,

390
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:14,649
or if they have a great age difference?

391
00:26:20,822 --> 00:26:24,326
Is that how you feel too?

392
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:26,619
Is it?

393
00:26:26,703 --> 00:26:27,871
Pardon?

394
00:26:31,249 --> 00:26:34,711
Anyone who is not as handsome as Jang Gang

395
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:37,255
and is much older

396
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:40,842
would still have a chance

397
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:43,720
if your heart is moved?

398
00:26:45,472 --> 00:26:46,598
Well…

399
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:51,561
If my heart is moved,

400
00:26:53,271 --> 00:26:56,149
he would seem more handsome

401
00:26:56,232 --> 00:26:57,525
and younger in my eyes.

402
00:27:10,288 --> 00:27:13,041
I see, Maidservant Kim.

403
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:15,585
I understand what you mean.

404
00:27:33,311 --> 00:27:38,191
Goodness, he was quite straightforward
when he asked how I felt about him.

405
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:41,820
What does he mean by not being handsome?

406
00:27:41,903 --> 00:27:43,905
And he is only two years older than me.

407
00:27:47,075 --> 00:27:48,785
He worries for no reason.

408
00:27:59,421 --> 00:28:03,550
How can she say she likes Master Lee

409
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:05,385
so easily in front of me?

410
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:11,141
Is he handsome?

411
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:16,479
He is more than
a hundred years older than her.

412
00:28:26,948 --> 00:28:28,116
Dang-gu…

413
00:28:28,783 --> 00:28:30,702
You little brat!

414
00:28:34,497 --> 00:28:35,832
Right now,

415
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:40,962
I wish I could have
the wine hidden in Uncle's room

416
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,381
instead of tea.

417
00:28:43,465 --> 00:28:45,925
What? You already have regrets?

418
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:47,552
No way.

419
00:28:48,219 --> 00:28:51,556
I believed I could give it all up.

420
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:54,392
That is why I took her hand that day.

421
00:28:56,644 --> 00:28:59,939
I did not know
he would grab my hand so suddenly.

422
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,610
I was just upset that
they were talking about the Crown Prince.

423
00:29:03,693 --> 00:29:06,112
All I said was that
I do not like the Crown Prince.

424
00:29:06,738 --> 00:29:09,115
But he suddenly grabbed my hand
and said he loved me.

425
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:10,450
Move over a bit.

426
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:15,663
I could not just let go of his hand.

427
00:29:15,747 --> 00:29:17,832
I was simply swept up in the moment.

428
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,419
I had no intention to run away from home.

429
00:29:23,046 --> 00:29:24,714
How long will you be here?

430
00:29:26,257 --> 00:29:28,760
I was told to serve you two
while you are here.

431
00:29:31,012 --> 00:29:32,472
I have no idea.

432
00:29:32,555 --> 00:29:34,682
I do not wish to stay here for long.

433
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:38,812
If I say we should go back home,

434
00:29:38,895 --> 00:29:41,064
I would seem irresponsible, right?

435
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:44,067
If I say I want to go home,
it would break his heart, right?

436
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:46,778
-What do I do?
-What do I do?

437
00:29:48,488 --> 00:29:50,031
This is for the best.

438
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:52,200
Serving Young Lady Jin here

439
00:29:52,283 --> 00:29:54,661
is better than
running into Park Jin at Songrim.

440
00:29:54,744 --> 00:29:59,249
If So-i is responsible
for the murder case you are embroiled in,

441
00:29:59,874 --> 00:30:01,000
then it is dangerous.

442
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:04,796
You may not know her,
but she knows who Mu-deok is.

443
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:09,676
Why is So-i going around killing people?

444
00:30:13,555 --> 00:30:15,723
If the blind girl
these men were picking on

445
00:30:15,807 --> 00:30:17,684
is the same girl the broker knew as So-i,

446
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:19,936
then she probably
could not have killed them herself.

447
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,521
She must have someone helping her.

448
00:30:21,604 --> 00:30:24,816
If the authorities take these bodies,
they will catch the murderer.

449
00:30:25,608 --> 00:30:27,277
Mu-deok would know about So-i.

450
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,612
We should send her
to help with the investigation.

451
00:30:30,822 --> 00:30:32,532
She will not recognize So-i.

452
00:30:32,615 --> 00:30:35,076
She is not the same Mu-deok
who lived in Sari Village.

453
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:38,079
She will be falsely accused and suffer.

454
00:30:38,162 --> 00:30:41,040
I will ask her myself if necessary.

455
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:51,384
I do not think you need to step up.
Yul seems to be on top of it.

456
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:01,603
We will be in trouble if
the Assistant Gwanju hears you are out.

457
00:31:02,103 --> 00:31:04,856
Everyone who recognizes me
has been killed.

458
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:07,191
I would have to walk outside
even after I get into Jinyowon.

459
00:31:07,275 --> 00:31:09,402
I should practice
walking like a blind person.

460
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:11,988
You should buy what you want.

461
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:13,990
I gave you quite a bit of money.

462
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:17,118
Let us go back after a while.

463
00:31:18,453 --> 00:31:19,704
Wait a minute.

464
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,832
Why are you using an umbrella
instead of a cane?

465
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:26,002
Do not touch it.

466
00:31:28,004 --> 00:31:29,380
I prefer using this.

467
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:44,228
You did help prove my innocence.

468
00:31:44,312 --> 00:31:46,606
I hope you will be comfortable
while you are here.

469
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:48,942
Does the Jang family always eat like this?

470
00:31:50,193 --> 00:31:51,402
This is too greasy.

471
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:57,659
Yes, Young Lady.
I will prepare a different meal.

472
00:32:06,918 --> 00:32:08,670
This is too salty!

473
00:32:11,089 --> 00:32:13,049
-It is not salty.
-It is salty.

474
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:15,343
I get bloated when I eat salty foods.

475
00:32:18,054 --> 00:32:19,305
Yes, Young Lady.

476
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,434
This is too hard.

477
00:32:23,518 --> 00:32:25,353
This is too sweet.

478
00:32:26,562 --> 00:32:27,855
What is this?

479
00:32:29,107 --> 00:32:30,942
I am so worried I lost my appetite.

480
00:32:32,986 --> 00:32:36,197
Why is she acting exactly like Uk?

481
00:32:36,906 --> 00:32:38,199
I have no appetite.

482
00:32:38,282 --> 00:32:39,784
Do you have something to drink?

483
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:41,452
Like cinnamon punch or rice punch?

484
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:49,544
They are perfect for each other.
Why call off the wedding?

485
00:32:49,627 --> 00:32:53,131
If they got married,
one of them would have died in a fight.

486
00:32:57,927 --> 00:32:59,095
Mu-deok, the rice punch is…

487
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:01,305
Is it sweet? And too cold?

488
00:33:01,931 --> 00:33:04,058
Rice punch is supposed to be like that.

489
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:06,436
Why are you raising your voice?

490
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:08,062
Are you tired of serving me?

491
00:33:08,938 --> 00:33:11,107
Then would you say you were easy to serve?

492
00:33:13,526 --> 00:33:15,778
I get irritable when I am anxious.

493
00:33:15,862 --> 00:33:17,822
It is uncomfortable not being at home.

494
00:33:17,905 --> 00:33:19,699
Then go home.

495
00:33:20,742 --> 00:33:23,494
No. I am too scared.

496
00:33:23,578 --> 00:33:25,538
Mother is very angry with me.

497
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,418
Even for a daughter, you are a handful.

498
00:33:30,501 --> 00:33:32,420
I was never her favorite.

499
00:33:33,588 --> 00:33:35,757
My sister was her pride and joy.

500
00:33:37,633 --> 00:33:39,635
Even though she was blind,

501
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:41,721
she could see energy and handle relics.

502
00:33:41,804 --> 00:33:44,557
Even at a young age, her abilities
were as powerful as my mother's.

503
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,477
Well, I heard that the Jin family members

504
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,354
are born with more divine powers
than spell-related powers.

505
00:33:50,938 --> 00:33:53,107
You saw me handle Gwigu, right?

506
00:33:53,775 --> 00:33:55,318
It is like that.

507
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,195
A really powerful priestess

508
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:00,698
can control people's souls
and trap them to be helpless.

509
00:34:01,616 --> 00:34:03,951
-Trap the soul?
-Yes.

510
00:34:04,035 --> 00:34:06,079
If the priestess traps their powers,

511
00:34:06,162 --> 00:34:09,665
even the most powerful mage is helpless.

512
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,003
I heard there are shamans

513
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:16,255
who can erase or change
memories of a soul.

514
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:19,050
A Jinyowon priestess is
in a different league.

515
00:34:19,133 --> 00:34:22,261
How did such an amazing girl like her die?

516
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:25,348
Because she is that great.

517
00:34:27,058 --> 00:34:29,060
She is definitely alive.

518
00:34:30,895 --> 00:34:32,522
We will see her again.

519
00:34:38,778 --> 00:34:40,196
If she is alive

520
00:34:41,155 --> 00:34:42,573
I am sure you will.

521
00:34:51,415 --> 00:34:54,377
Uncle looked into Mu-deok.

522
00:34:54,961 --> 00:34:57,880
He asked the broker about her.
Did you know about that?

523
00:34:58,756 --> 00:35:00,508
Yes. I heard from her.

524
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,929
He has become suspicious
because of the soul shifter incident.

525
00:35:05,513 --> 00:35:06,430
You are right.

526
00:35:06,514 --> 00:35:10,810
If there are soul shifters in the palace,
Songrim may have them too.

527
00:35:11,686 --> 00:35:15,523
Why is the cast-out successor of Songrim
worrying about such a thing?

528
00:35:15,606 --> 00:35:19,735
-I am not totally cast out.
-He is already regretting it.

529
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:20,653
Hey.

530
00:35:20,736 --> 00:35:23,072
You were so confident yesterday.

531
00:35:25,408 --> 00:35:27,034
Uk is the one who always gets kicked out.

532
00:35:27,118 --> 00:35:28,536
What am I doing here?

533
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:30,746
You will get used to it.

534
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:34,041
It is quite miserable the first time.

535
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:37,587
Only Yul would have no idea how we feel.

536
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,838
What do you mean?

537
00:35:38,921 --> 00:35:40,006
Yul has been kicked out too.

538
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:41,174
No way.

539
00:35:41,883 --> 00:35:44,051
Do you remember the time
that I broke the gold-plated inkstone

540
00:35:44,135 --> 00:35:45,636
and we all lied together?

541
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:54,145
Uncle will get so mad at me.

542
00:35:54,729 --> 00:35:55,605
Let us hide it.

543
00:35:56,564 --> 00:35:58,649
We will bury it
and pretend to know nothing about it.

544
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:00,443
That is not right.

545
00:36:01,277 --> 00:36:03,571
We must tell the truth
and ask for forgiveness.

546
00:36:03,654 --> 00:36:06,741
Then Dang-gu will get in
a lot of trouble with the leader.

547
00:36:09,785 --> 00:36:11,787
I cannot tell a lie.

548
00:36:13,331 --> 00:36:15,082
It is all right, Dang-gu.

549
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:17,585
I am sure there is a way.

550
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:23,466
Eventually the three of us
agreed to cover it up.

551
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:25,968
But Yul became ill afterward.

552
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:29,513
I think Yul is very ill.

553
00:36:29,597 --> 00:36:30,806
I think so.

554
00:36:32,725 --> 00:36:37,063
My goodness,
why is Yul so sick? What is wrong?

555
00:36:37,647 --> 00:36:41,150
I heard he cannot eat or sleep well.

556
00:36:41,234 --> 00:36:42,318
What is wrong?

557
00:36:43,694 --> 00:36:46,739
Yul had never done anything wrong.

558
00:36:46,822 --> 00:36:49,242
He got sick worrying we would get caught.

559
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:53,454
We ended up confessing
because we thought Yul would die.

560
00:36:53,537 --> 00:36:55,665
We were all kicked out together.

561
00:36:55,748 --> 00:36:59,043
I got kicked out so many times
so I do not remember everything.

562
00:36:59,126 --> 00:37:02,672
But I doubt that Yul was sick
because he was afraid of being caught.

563
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,801
He suffered because he knew
what he was doing was wrong,

564
00:37:07,468 --> 00:37:10,638
and that fact was hard for him to endure.

565
00:37:14,976 --> 00:37:17,144
He is someone who gets lost
if he is caught off guard.

566
00:37:18,854 --> 00:37:21,816
He must have been worried
and scared to do something

567
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:24,110
he knew was wrong

568
00:37:25,695 --> 00:37:27,196
just to protect his friends.

569
00:37:32,326 --> 00:37:34,787
Yes. I remember it clearly.

570
00:37:36,122 --> 00:37:37,540
I suffered quite a bit.

571
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:40,543
To punish oneself more harshly

572
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:43,504
than others would.

573
00:37:43,587 --> 00:37:45,840
Is it some sort of
a heightened state of morality?

574
00:37:46,549 --> 00:37:49,302
Gosh, you were already there
at that young age?

575
00:37:49,385 --> 00:37:50,428
That is incredible.

576
00:37:52,096 --> 00:37:54,849
Can you imagine what I felt,
burying a broken inkstone

577
00:37:54,932 --> 00:37:56,350
with my immature friends?

578
00:37:57,685 --> 00:38:00,187
We could not even bury it well.
We were soon caught.

579
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:01,564
-What?
-What?

580
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:04,358
We were caught? You said we confessed.

581
00:38:04,942 --> 00:38:06,944
Dang-gu is remembering it wrong.

582
00:38:07,028 --> 00:38:08,446
We did not confess to it.

583
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:12,908
Sang-ho found the half-buried inkstone.
That is how we were caught.

584
00:38:13,534 --> 00:38:14,660
Is that right?

585
00:38:15,244 --> 00:38:16,746
I must have romanticized the memory.

586
00:38:18,122 --> 00:38:20,416
I thought we did the honorable thing.

587
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:22,084
How embarrassing…

588
00:38:22,168 --> 00:38:25,004
What are you embarrassed about?

589
00:38:25,087 --> 00:38:27,214
You are currently a runaway.

590
00:38:27,298 --> 00:38:30,009
Who will be the next leader
instead of Dang-gu?

591
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,178
Will it be Sang-ho?

592
00:38:32,261 --> 00:38:33,637
Is that right?

593
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:36,015
I should get on his good side.

594
00:38:36,974 --> 00:38:39,226
You two cannot discard me like this.

595
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,228
You should take my side like before.

596
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:43,189
Come on, Uk.

597
00:38:43,272 --> 00:38:45,816
I will not be much help to you.

598
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,612
-Hey, Yul.
-I am not good with words.

599
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,322
Especially about love…

600
00:38:59,914 --> 00:39:01,415
Of course you two are on my side.

601
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:22,561
Yul, do you not sleep well these days?

602
00:39:22,645 --> 00:39:25,648
Drink as much as you want today

603
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:27,733
and get a good night's sleep.

604
00:39:29,068 --> 00:39:31,070
You have trouble sleeping?

605
00:39:31,695 --> 00:39:32,696
No.

606
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,365
I saw you wandering around until late.

607
00:39:34,448 --> 00:39:36,242
You usually go to bed like clockwork.

608
00:39:36,325 --> 00:39:39,620
Are you concerned about
what is happening at Seoho Fortress?

609
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:49,380
I just slashed a soul shifter.

610
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:52,842
It is our duty to protect this world

611
00:39:53,843 --> 00:39:55,344
from such monsters.

612
00:39:56,971 --> 00:39:58,889
Even though it is dead, it is still Gwigu.

613
00:39:59,432 --> 00:40:00,850
There might still be traces of its powers.

614
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:02,435
Do not touch it.

615
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:11,610
You are feigning ignorance, right?

616
00:40:15,072 --> 00:40:17,032
Like the time we buried the inkstone.

617
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:21,370
It must be tough for you.

618
00:40:39,597 --> 00:40:41,807
If I regain my energy and draw that sword,

619
00:40:43,851 --> 00:40:47,897
will I be able to slash
anyone relentlessly like before?

620
00:40:52,693 --> 00:40:54,445
Is that the assassin's sword?

621
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,324
Why did Young Master bring it again?

622
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:02,828
I am terrified of that sword.

623
00:41:03,913 --> 00:41:05,956
It feels ominous. I do not want it nearby.

624
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:11,337
The guests are all asleep. Go to bed.

625
00:41:12,004 --> 00:41:13,631
Maybe we need to have a charm written.

626
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:25,184
Terrifying…

627
00:41:28,229 --> 00:41:29,438
and ominous.

628
00:41:59,802 --> 00:42:01,887
Eunuch Kim,
who caused trouble at Cheonbugwan,

629
00:42:01,971 --> 00:42:03,722
is not beside the Queen today as well.

630
00:42:04,682 --> 00:42:06,058
Did you look into it?

631
00:42:06,141 --> 00:42:09,395
They say he is ill and is resting,
but no one seems to know where he is.

632
00:42:11,188 --> 00:42:13,399
Find out as much as you can about him.

633
00:42:13,482 --> 00:42:14,984
Find out when he came to the palace,

634
00:42:15,067 --> 00:42:18,112
when he started serving the Queen,
and if there is anything odd about him.

635
00:42:18,946 --> 00:42:20,364
Be discrete.

636
00:42:21,073 --> 00:42:21,991
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

637
00:42:28,038 --> 00:42:31,500
Do you remember what Eunuch Kim said
when we saw him at Cheonbugwan?

638
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:35,921
Did that wench Shaman Choi

639
00:42:36,589 --> 00:42:38,549
tell you to kill me?

640
00:42:39,091 --> 00:42:40,801
Shaman Choi…

641
00:42:40,884 --> 00:42:43,971
She must be superior to Jin Mu
to have given him orders.

642
00:42:45,014 --> 00:42:46,724
It must be the Queen.

643
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:49,518
Just as Mu-deok's true identity is Naksu.

644
00:42:49,602 --> 00:42:51,270
Could the true identity of the Queen

645
00:42:52,313 --> 00:42:54,023
be Shaman Choi?

646
00:42:54,106 --> 00:42:54,982
That is probably right.

647
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,278
But only if the Queen is a soul shifter.

648
00:43:00,362 --> 00:43:04,325
There was nothing to suspect
that the Queen is a soul shifter.

649
00:43:04,408 --> 00:43:07,411
I checked her core of energy
as I was examining her,

650
00:43:07,494 --> 00:43:10,414
but she was a normal person
without extraordinary energy.

651
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:17,129
She could have appeared so
if she had the ice stone.

652
00:43:18,756 --> 00:43:22,676
The Queen is the younger sister
of General Seo.

653
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,178
She is Yul's aunt.

654
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:27,848
She is not related to the Heo family,
but she is a member of the Seo family.

655
00:43:27,931 --> 00:43:29,391
If her soul has been shifted,

656
00:43:30,392 --> 00:43:34,229
the soul in her body is someone else.

657
00:43:34,313 --> 00:43:37,483
Is the Queen's soul dead?

658
00:43:38,067 --> 00:43:39,526
That is not possible.

659
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:42,821
Each member of the Seo Family
has a Lantern of Life.

660
00:43:44,198 --> 00:43:47,743
Because they guard the Seoho Fortress
near the border and go to battle often,

661
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:51,664
they each have a lantern that is lit
by the energy of their soul

662
00:43:51,747 --> 00:43:53,457
so they know who is alive and dead.

663
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:56,794
If the Queen passed away,

664
00:43:57,294 --> 00:43:59,838
they would know immediately because
her Lantern of Life would have gone off.

665
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:03,967
Yes, I remember the Lantern of Life.

666
00:44:04,051 --> 00:44:08,097
Her soul would have been
kept alive in another body.

667
00:44:09,807 --> 00:44:14,770
Like Master Kang of Daegangtongun
who is lying in Sejukwon right now.

668
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:22,069
Are you certain
that the Queen is a soul shifter?

669
00:44:23,654 --> 00:44:25,322
If we can know for sure,

670
00:44:26,323 --> 00:44:29,743
that would mean
we found Jin Mu's greatest weakness.

671
00:44:32,996 --> 00:44:35,207
Songrim is suspecting me

672
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:38,252
and they will try
to prove the Queen is a soul shifter.

673
00:44:38,335 --> 00:44:39,878
What is there to worry about?

674
00:44:40,921 --> 00:44:44,216
We already have a body
for her soul to be transferred to.

675
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:53,350
Can you get her into Jinyowon
without a problem?

676
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:56,311
I will bring her to Jinyowon today.

677
00:44:56,979 --> 00:44:59,231
If everything goes to plan,

678
00:44:59,815 --> 00:45:02,359
Jinyowon will get their lost daughter back

679
00:45:03,026 --> 00:45:05,529
and there will be a funeral at the palace.

680
00:45:07,573 --> 00:45:10,784
Because the Queen will have passed away.

681
00:45:13,495 --> 00:45:18,125
What should we do with my old body
that the Queen's soul is occupying?

682
00:45:20,252 --> 00:45:23,088
We shall take care of it
since we no longer need it alive.

683
00:46:05,672 --> 00:46:08,842
Your Highness,
I am here instead of Eunuch Kim today.

684
00:46:17,476 --> 00:46:18,852
What a pity.

685
00:46:19,686 --> 00:46:23,565
It would be better for you
to let go of your mind.

686
00:46:45,629 --> 00:46:47,339
This must be Gaema Village.

687
00:46:48,131 --> 00:46:50,217
You are looking for a shaman?

688
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,301
Yes.

689
00:46:52,135 --> 00:46:54,012
Then try Gaema Village.

690
00:46:54,596 --> 00:46:57,933
All kinds of shamans gather there.

691
00:46:58,517 --> 00:47:01,103
I know the oldest shaman there.

692
00:47:01,687 --> 00:47:04,481
If you are looking for someone, ask him.

693
00:47:07,901 --> 00:47:09,278
-Fire Priestess is really--
-No thank you.

694
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:11,405
-Wait.
-Goodness.

695
00:47:11,488 --> 00:47:15,492
Excuse me, do you know
where Shaman Bong's house is?

696
00:47:15,576 --> 00:47:16,910
Shaman Bong?

697
00:47:16,994 --> 00:47:19,246
He does not have powers anymore.

698
00:47:19,329 --> 00:47:20,998
You should go to
the Fire Priestess instead.

699
00:47:21,081 --> 00:47:23,875
-I will take you there.
-No, I am looking for Shaman Bong.

700
00:47:23,959 --> 00:47:27,004
-I told you, he is not good.
-No, it has to be Shaman Bong.

701
00:47:27,921 --> 00:47:28,922
Thank you.

702
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:43,020
Where am I?

703
00:47:43,562 --> 00:47:45,647
All of the streets look the same.

704
00:47:49,401 --> 00:47:52,362
I never said
I wanted to see the Fire Priestess.

705
00:47:52,446 --> 00:47:55,198
You still have to pay
if you had your fortune read.

706
00:47:55,282 --> 00:47:57,701
-Where are you going?
-Hey, do not touch me.

707
00:47:58,201 --> 00:48:00,454
She did not get a single thing right.
Why should I pay?

708
00:48:06,918 --> 00:48:08,629
Did you go and see Shaman Bong?

709
00:48:08,712 --> 00:48:10,005
He is bad, is he not?

710
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:13,050
The Fire Priestess is the real deal.
Am I right?

711
00:48:13,133 --> 00:48:14,760
"Fire Priestess," my foot.

712
00:48:14,843 --> 00:48:15,927
Come on.

713
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:19,765
My goodness…

714
00:48:21,058 --> 00:48:23,435
Did you come to get your fortune read?

715
00:48:24,394 --> 00:48:26,396
How about you?
Did you come for an exorcism?

716
00:48:27,022 --> 00:48:29,816
What did Fire Priestess say
to make you so angry?

717
00:48:30,442 --> 00:48:33,904
She said I have no luck in government
and I should get into business.

718
00:48:33,987 --> 00:48:35,364
I am the Crown Prince.

719
00:48:36,823 --> 00:48:38,533
What did Shaman Bong say to you?

720
00:48:38,617 --> 00:48:40,952
I am on my way to see him.
I have many questions for him.

721
00:48:43,747 --> 00:48:44,790
Jang Uk.

722
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:50,170
Are you looking for Eunuch Kim too?

723
00:48:53,423 --> 00:48:55,342
Why are you looking for him here?

724
00:48:59,054 --> 00:49:02,391
He disappeared from the palace
since that day at Cheonbugwan.

725
00:49:03,225 --> 00:49:05,185
His traces led me here.

726
00:49:05,268 --> 00:49:08,605
So you came here alone without any guards?

727
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,234
I do not want anyone to know

728
00:49:13,193 --> 00:49:14,903
that I am suspecting them.

729
00:49:17,948 --> 00:49:19,991
So you agree that
Eunuch Kim is a soul shifter

730
00:49:21,076 --> 00:49:23,954
and that the Queen is being
suspicious by trying to cover it up?

731
00:49:25,872 --> 00:49:26,957
That is right.

732
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:30,127
Why are you here?
What are you looking for?

733
00:49:30,794 --> 00:49:33,630
I think there are overlaps in
what we are looking for.

734
00:49:33,714 --> 00:49:34,881
Shall we exchange information?

735
00:49:35,716 --> 00:49:37,008
Share one piece of information each?

736
00:49:37,801 --> 00:49:39,803
Fine. You go first.

737
00:49:39,886 --> 00:49:41,805
If I tell you first,

738
00:49:41,888 --> 00:49:44,599
you will not share yours,
saying, "I am the Crown Prince."

739
00:49:44,683 --> 00:49:45,642
How did you know that?

740
00:49:47,561 --> 00:49:48,562
Fine.

741
00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:53,817
While I was searching for Eunuch Kim,
I found something strange.

742
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,445
It seems he left the palace every month
to go somewhere.

743
00:49:57,237 --> 00:49:59,573
The place he visited every month
was Gaema Village.

744
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:02,534
I am looking for Shaman Choi.

745
00:50:03,118 --> 00:50:04,035
Who is that?

746
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:06,580
That is for the next time.
Now if you excuse me…

747
00:50:07,414 --> 00:50:08,623
Wait.

748
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:12,836
What am I supposed to glean
from that kind of information?

749
00:50:12,919 --> 00:50:14,671
I do not have much information yet.

750
00:50:17,507 --> 00:50:20,510
-Why are you following me?
-To meet Shaman Bong.

751
00:50:20,594 --> 00:50:22,220
We do not have to go together.

752
00:50:22,304 --> 00:50:25,640
I can go afterward
and get him to tell me what he told you.

753
00:50:26,308 --> 00:50:27,434
I am the Crown Prince.

754
00:50:32,731 --> 00:50:35,901
-I do not know where he is.
-You do know.

755
00:50:35,984 --> 00:50:37,444
I really have no idea.

756
00:50:40,363 --> 00:50:45,410
I have met your uncle and your mother.

757
00:50:45,494 --> 00:50:47,287
What did she say?

758
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:49,748
Is she still very angry at me?

759
00:50:50,624 --> 00:50:52,667
Will he really cast me out?

760
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,215
They said they will forgive you
if you submit a signed letter.

761
00:50:58,298 --> 00:51:01,134
A signed letter swearing
never to see each other again.

762
00:51:04,513 --> 00:51:05,347
Here you go.

763
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,059
The words are already written

764
00:51:09,142 --> 00:51:11,353
so all you have to do is sign each copy

765
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:13,230
and you will be able to return home.

766
00:51:13,772 --> 00:51:15,524
You can discuss it
before making your decision.

767
00:51:16,358 --> 00:51:20,320
As for me, I am willing to provide
food and shelter for a while

768
00:51:20,403 --> 00:51:23,406
if you insist on staying together.

769
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:24,324
Please excuse me.

770
00:51:35,752 --> 00:51:36,962
Cho-yeon…

771
00:51:42,008 --> 00:51:43,176
To tell you the truth,

772
00:51:46,513 --> 00:51:48,265
I slightly regretted it.

773
00:51:51,017 --> 00:51:53,103
I was scared that I may have acted

774
00:51:55,522 --> 00:51:57,065
rather impulsively.

775
00:52:00,861 --> 00:52:02,112
But…

776
00:52:08,535 --> 00:52:10,662
the thought of never seeing you again…

777
00:52:13,707 --> 00:52:15,458
I do not care about anything else.

778
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:19,212
I cannot sign this letter.

779
00:52:19,296 --> 00:52:20,964
I cannot live without seeing you.

780
00:52:23,258 --> 00:52:25,385
JIN CHO-YEON OF JINYOWON SWEARS NEVER
TO SEE PARK DANG-GU OF SONGRIM AGAIN

781
00:52:26,261 --> 00:52:28,430
I was also annoyed at first.

782
00:52:31,474 --> 00:52:33,310
But I want to keep seeing you.

783
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:11,640
The negotiation is off.

784
00:53:11,723 --> 00:53:14,517
Set the table, Mu-deok.

785
00:53:21,066 --> 00:53:22,901
Have some fish.

786
00:53:29,324 --> 00:53:30,909
Have some meat as well.

787
00:53:42,963 --> 00:53:47,050
Are you two really going to stay here?

788
00:53:47,133 --> 00:53:48,343
Yes.

789
00:53:48,426 --> 00:53:52,514
We are going to go home
and bring our belongings.

790
00:53:52,597 --> 00:53:55,350
So you will build
your honeymoon nest here?

791
00:53:58,436 --> 00:53:59,646
It is not like that,

792
00:53:59,729 --> 00:54:01,606
but we at least need a change of clothes.

793
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:04,401
Could you go with her
and carry her luggage back?

794
00:54:15,203 --> 00:54:16,913
Did you throw away the paper
that was here?

795
00:54:17,497 --> 00:54:18,331
I was about to throw them out.

796
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:26,631
JIN CHO-YEON OF JINYOWON SWEARS NEVER
TO SEE PARK DANG-GU OF SONGRIM AGAIN

797
00:54:26,715 --> 00:54:28,258
I need to think it over.

798
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:32,679
If I pack up and leave,
I really might get kicked out.

799
00:54:34,764 --> 00:54:36,099
Did you get hurt?

800
00:54:38,351 --> 00:54:39,519
Does it hurt?

801
00:54:40,103 --> 00:54:41,604
Of course, it does.

802
00:54:46,776 --> 00:54:47,819
You have a scar.

803
00:54:47,902 --> 00:54:49,446
How did you get that?

804
00:54:50,155 --> 00:54:51,448
I have no idea.

805
00:54:51,531 --> 00:54:53,616
It was when I was young,
so I do not remember.

806
00:54:54,617 --> 00:54:56,619
That is a scar from a laceration.

807
00:54:56,703 --> 00:54:59,789
My sister had one in the same place
because of me.

808
00:55:01,124 --> 00:55:04,044
She fell exactly like you did just now.

809
00:55:11,843 --> 00:55:14,345
A scar formed on the cut.

810
00:55:19,267 --> 00:55:20,685
This will do.

811
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,690
I will do my best, Father.

812
00:55:28,109 --> 00:55:30,236
Do not call me that
unless it is necessary.

813
00:55:31,446 --> 00:55:32,822
It makes my skin crawl.

814
00:55:42,332 --> 00:55:44,876
Did he have to be so rude about it?

815
00:55:45,627 --> 00:55:48,671
Why did he throw away
such a beautiful silk handkerchief?

816
00:55:50,298 --> 00:55:51,382
Wait.

817
00:55:59,516 --> 00:56:02,060
It has the same design as Mu-deok's.

818
00:56:06,356 --> 00:56:08,817
-Did the lord from Jinyowon leave?
-Yes.

819
00:56:11,778 --> 00:56:13,321
What is this design?

820
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:16,157
It is the crest of the Jin family.

821
00:56:16,908 --> 00:56:19,035
You will go there today. Get ready.

822
00:56:19,702 --> 00:56:20,870
Right.

823
00:56:23,623 --> 00:56:25,416
Is that what this was?

824
00:56:34,008 --> 00:56:36,636
Why would Mu-deok have something

825
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:39,097
with the crest of Jinyowon on it?

826
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:49,107
You have to get my things
without my mother finding out.

827
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:50,275
Follow me.

828
00:56:51,526 --> 00:56:54,154
I wish she would just go in and stay.

829
00:57:02,203 --> 00:57:05,123
Can this man really be believed?
He seems like a hack.

830
00:57:05,957 --> 00:57:07,792
He must be something.

831
00:57:08,376 --> 00:57:12,213
You are both piping hot.
You have shared something.

832
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:13,965
Are you perchance lovers?

833
00:57:16,259 --> 00:57:17,677
-No way.
-No.

834
00:57:19,721 --> 00:57:22,932
It is my business policy
never to breach confidentiality.

835
00:57:23,016 --> 00:57:24,684
You can rest assured.

836
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:29,522
The two of you have already shared
something very meaningful, right?

837
00:57:31,024 --> 00:57:31,900
He is good.

838
00:57:33,276 --> 00:57:34,194
Come on.

839
00:57:36,362 --> 00:57:39,199
I heard you have been
in Gaema Village the longest.

840
00:57:39,282 --> 00:57:41,701
Do you happen to know Shaman Choi?

841
00:57:44,996 --> 00:57:46,247
Shaman Choi?

842
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:49,250
Are you mages patrolling for sorcery?

843
00:57:52,629 --> 00:57:56,799
It is nothing like that.
I just heard she was very good.

844
00:57:56,883 --> 00:57:58,760
I just want to find her because of that.

845
00:58:02,347 --> 00:58:03,556
Yes, she was.

846
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,059
It was already over 20 years ago.

847
00:58:13,483 --> 00:58:14,817
Shaman Choi was famous

848
00:58:14,901 --> 00:58:18,863
for her sorcery that put hexes on people.

849
00:58:19,447 --> 00:58:21,407
One day, she almost got caught

850
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:25,370
by the mages from Cheonbugwan
who were cracking down on sorcery.

851
00:58:26,287 --> 00:58:27,830
But she jumped into a fire.

852
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:33,628
Some say she died in that fire.

853
00:58:34,295 --> 00:58:38,216
Others say she was burnt badly
but survived.

854
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:40,009
That was when

855
00:58:40,093 --> 00:58:43,012
your father Jang Gang
was the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan.

856
00:58:45,807 --> 00:58:48,935
If Shaman Choi was hunted
by the mages of Cheonbugwan,

857
00:58:50,061 --> 00:58:52,397
are you seeking her because
she bears a grudge against your father?

858
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,774
I do not even remember my father.

859
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,610
How can I know
who bears a grudge against him?

860
00:59:01,197 --> 00:59:04,242
PARK DANG-GU OF SONGRIM SWEARS NEVER
TO SEE JIN CHO-YEON OF JINYOWON AGAIN

861
00:59:06,369 --> 00:59:08,621
You did not sign the paper.

862
00:59:08,705 --> 00:59:11,249
I thought about signing the paper
and coming back home,

863
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:14,252
but that would be lying.

864
00:59:14,335 --> 00:59:16,296
I cannot live without seeing her.

865
00:59:19,507 --> 00:59:22,051
This did not happen overnight.

866
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:26,055
I was in love with her for a long time,
but could not express it for a long time.

867
00:59:26,139 --> 00:59:28,099
I was only able to take her hand now.

868
00:59:28,683 --> 00:59:30,184
Please do not call us childish

869
00:59:30,268 --> 00:59:32,812
and give us a chance.

870
00:59:32,895 --> 00:59:35,189
Take your bundle of belongings

871
00:59:35,273 --> 00:59:36,899
and go to Uk's home.

872
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,611
-Uncle…
-I need you

873
00:59:40,528 --> 00:59:42,071
to do something there.

874
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:53,708
If this person comes to his house,

875
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:55,460
let me know immediately.

876
00:59:55,543 --> 00:59:57,587
Who is this?

877
00:59:58,755 --> 01:00:00,590
Gwanju Jang Gang of Cheonbugwan.

878
01:00:01,341 --> 01:00:02,592
He is Uk's father.

879
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,805
If he comes,

880
01:00:09,766 --> 01:00:11,017
let me know

881
01:00:12,101 --> 01:00:13,269
right away.

882
01:00:15,938 --> 01:00:17,857
Oh, I almost forgot.

883
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:21,444
Shaman Choi had a brother.

884
01:00:22,403 --> 01:00:25,114
Do you know where he is?

885
01:00:25,198 --> 01:00:29,327
I have not seen him since the incident.

886
01:00:29,994 --> 01:00:33,539
But there was a rumor that

887
01:00:33,623 --> 01:00:35,917
he married a woman from a powerful family.

888
01:01:00,608 --> 01:01:03,569
They said this girl
is very likely to be her.

889
01:01:04,487 --> 01:01:06,322
Why is she wearing such ragged clothes?

890
01:01:06,406 --> 01:01:08,866
As a child, she washed up
along Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

891
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:11,619
She was barely alive
when the fishermen rescued her.

892
01:01:12,537 --> 01:01:15,707
That experience must have
caused memory loss,

893
01:01:16,332 --> 01:01:21,295
but she can sense things around her
even though she is blind.

894
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:47,321
You have the birthmark here…

895
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:58,040
You have a scar in the same place.

896
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:04,839
That is why they said
you are very likely to be my Bu-yeon.

897
01:02:04,922 --> 01:02:06,424
However,

898
01:02:06,507 --> 01:02:10,595
it could still be a coincidence.
Why not test her with the surest method?

899
01:02:17,518 --> 01:02:19,687
Let us go and see

900
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,774
if you can open the doors of Jinyowon.

901
01:02:32,784 --> 01:02:34,869
The Cheonbugwan people are here again.

902
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:37,246
They must have brought
another girl to see if she is Bu-yeon.

903
01:02:47,298 --> 01:02:50,718
Since you have
Jin Cho-yeon's blood in your body,

904
01:02:50,802 --> 01:02:53,346
you should be able to
move the doors of Jinyowon.

905
01:02:55,306 --> 01:02:57,892
Try to move the doors even a little bit.

906
01:02:58,476 --> 01:03:00,186
That should be enough.

907
01:03:10,196 --> 01:03:12,698
So many girls were brought here,

908
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,867
but none of them could open the door.

909
01:03:58,286 --> 01:03:59,453
Bu-yeon!

910
01:04:00,746 --> 01:04:02,039
My goodness, Bu-yeon!

911
01:04:05,501 --> 01:04:09,255
It is happening again.
It happens every time I come to Jinyowon.

912
01:04:25,313 --> 01:04:26,856
If it was 20 years ago,

913
01:04:27,398 --> 01:04:30,234
it was when Jin Mu
was your father's pupil.

914
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,654
Jin Mu may know something.
Should I ask him?

915
01:04:33,738 --> 01:04:35,448
Absolutely not.

916
01:04:35,531 --> 01:04:38,868
Please keep what you heard today a secret.

917
01:04:40,953 --> 01:04:44,332
What we learned today does not seem
all that important, but I will.

918
01:04:47,793 --> 01:04:51,047
Your Royal Highness,
did you say you came here alone?

919
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:52,131
I did.

920
01:04:52,214 --> 01:04:55,635
But it seems like someone is following us.

921
01:04:59,096 --> 01:05:02,266
Shall we split up
to see who he is following?

922
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:43,599
Mother!

923
01:06:25,725 --> 01:06:27,685
Who are you and why are you following me?

924
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:31,647
I said…

925
01:06:35,067 --> 01:06:36,152
who are you?

926
01:07:28,412 --> 01:07:31,957
The Jin Bu-yeon that Jin Mu
has brought in is So-i, the swindler.

927
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:33,250
Why is this here?

928
01:07:33,334 --> 01:07:34,752
Mu-deok is the real daughter.

929
01:07:34,835 --> 01:07:36,796
What will become of me
if she finds that out?

930
01:07:36,879 --> 01:07:39,381
Jin Mu must have something big
so that even if Jin Ho-gyeong finds out

931
01:07:39,465 --> 01:07:42,134
her daughter is a fake, she will not
be able to do anything about it.

932
01:07:42,718 --> 01:07:43,761
What do you want?

933
01:07:43,844 --> 01:07:48,349
You must fight Songrim
in order to protect the ice stone.

934
01:07:49,683 --> 01:07:51,602
Everyone, please settle down!

935
01:07:51,685 --> 01:07:54,146
Do you mean you wish to become
a hero with the fate of the King's Star

936
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:56,482
by destroying every ice stone
and saving the world from chaos?

937
01:07:56,565 --> 01:07:57,858
Is Seo Yul here?

938
01:07:57,942 --> 01:07:59,568
He shall be the first person I kill.

939
01:08:00,277 --> 01:08:01,529
Young Master Seo!

940
01:08:02,988 --> 01:08:03,948
There is a soul shifter.

941
01:08:04,031 --> 01:08:05,324
Jang Uk could die!

942
01:08:05,407 --> 01:08:07,409
Jang Uk, my pupil…

943
01:08:09,453 --> 01:08:14,458
