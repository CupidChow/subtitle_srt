ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:22,448
We have brought the liquor
to be used for Jinyowon's ancestral rites.

3
00:00:37,296 --> 00:00:39,340
You have used different water to make it.

4
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,011
You see, due to the drought
for the past three years,

5
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:46,263
the well we always used had dried up.

6
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:47,765
So we had to use a different source.

7
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:56,023
-Goodness!
-Goodness!

8
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:59,652
-No!
-What--

9
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:02,196
Make them again.

10
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:04,865
Pardon?

11
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,284
But we have no water.

12
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,121
How could we possibly make any liquor?

13
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:14,458
Or could you let us use
some of Jinyowon's water, my lady?

14
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,551
He can come inside and get it.

15
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:25,511
-Yes, my lady.
-Me?

16
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:29,515
Go.

17
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:33,269
-Hurry.
-Go.

18
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:47,616
The young lady has disappeared
from her room again.

19
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,535
Stay right here and wait for me.

20
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:51,370
Yes, I will.

21
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,088
How beautiful.

22
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:52,348
Is that liquor?

23
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:00,356
Here you go.

24
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:13,994
This is of good quality.

25
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:16,163
It is fragrant.

26
00:03:17,373 --> 00:03:18,207
Do you have more?

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,669
I do have one more bottle.

28
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:23,796
-Give it to me.
-All right.

29
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,633
My lady!

30
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:30,594
-Search over there.
-Hurry.

31
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,554
Yes, here you go.

32
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:34,515
Wait.

33
00:03:57,413 --> 00:03:58,247
How beautiful.

34
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,922
I have never seen
such a beautiful woman before.

35
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:09,008
I think she is from the Jin family.

36
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:13,012
Young Lady Jin Cho-yeon
is the only daughter they have.

37
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:14,888
It is Jinyowon, after all.

38
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:17,057
He was likely possessed by a relic.

39
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:20,311
They have forbidden outsiders
from entering for three years.

40
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:21,895
It must be teeming with ghosts.

41
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:28,110
Whether she was a ghost or not,
I hope I can see her again.

42
00:04:28,193 --> 00:04:29,445
You little…

43
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:32,531
Do not talk about ghosts
when we are delivering funeral drinks.

44
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:33,782
-Jeez.
-My apologies.

45
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:35,075
Before we go inside…

46
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:37,745
This charm will fend off ghosts. Take one.

47
00:04:37,828 --> 00:04:38,787
What is this?

48
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:42,583
This works on soul shifters too.

49
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,878
You remember Naksu, the soul shifter
who devastated Songrim three years ago?

50
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:48,881
Her petrified body was ground to a powder

51
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:51,008
and used to make these charms.

52
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,426
-With her petrified body?
-Yes.

53
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:54,136
That is absurd.

54
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,264
Her body is at the bottom
of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

55
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:58,432
Jeez.

56
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:02,061
I cannot believe you bought this.
You wasted your money.

57
00:05:02,144 --> 00:05:03,812
Come on!

58
00:05:05,022 --> 00:05:06,023
Trust me on this.

59
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,816
If you see a soul shifter,

60
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,445
show it this charm
that contains Naksu's energy and--

61
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:18,160
Did you do that?

62
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,126
No!

63
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:29,671
Wait for me! Do not leave me!

64
00:05:43,852 --> 00:05:45,771
-What is that?
-Darn it!

65
00:05:57,032 --> 00:05:58,617
Is this the deed of a soul shifter?

66
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:02,579
-Who is that?
-Who is that?

67
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:28,522
Is he a soul shifter?

68
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,190
Are we going to die?

69
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:31,775
Stay away!

70
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,944
-Go away.
-Stay away!

71
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,028
-Go away!
-Leave!

72
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:36,530
-Stay back!
-We should go!

73
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:37,865
Wait.

74
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:40,784
He must not be a soul shifter.

75
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:44,204
What is that?

76
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,165
A charm.

77
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:47,583
Does that fend off soul shifters?

78
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:51,086
Where did you get it? Gaema Village?

79
00:06:52,463 --> 00:06:53,297
Yes.

80
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:55,716
-For how much?
-One silver nyang.

81
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,426
-For three?
-No.

82
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:59,052
For one. It was three nyang in total.

83
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:01,638
My lord.

84
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,515
That is expensive.

85
00:07:04,683 --> 00:07:06,101
That village lacks business ethics.

86
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:08,937
You can get ten for one nyang elsewhere.

87
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:10,647
Really? Which village?

88
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:12,608
That is not the point!

89
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:13,942
Darn it.

90
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:16,153
You should get your money's worth.

91
00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:33,212
If you want to live,

92
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:35,506
step aside and duck.

93
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:16,315
Despite having the ice stone,

94
00:09:16,398 --> 00:09:19,276
can your Tansu skills only make one drop?

95
00:09:20,402 --> 00:09:21,987
Since your body has died already,

96
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,656
you are a soul shifter just like me.

97
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:27,159
To others,

98
00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:28,619
we are both monsters.

99
00:09:30,662 --> 00:09:31,663
Are you done?

100
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,876
If not, hurry up because that one drop

101
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:38,378
is going to be quite painful.

102
00:09:57,272 --> 00:10:00,317
You do not deserve to say anything
when you shifted into your son's body.

103
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:30,722
So you are not a soul shifter

104
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:32,933
but a mage who kills soul shifters.

105
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,270
Thank you for saving us, my lord.

106
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,273
-Is that a bottle of liquor?
-Yes, my lord.

107
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:54,746
Goodness.

108
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,540
His father shifted into his body?

109
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:58,417
Poor boy.

110
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,920
It is true that soul shifters petrify
when they are dead.

111
00:11:03,422 --> 00:11:04,339
My lord.

112
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:06,174
Then Naksu died and was petrified, right?

113
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:08,552
I told you, I was right.

114
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:13,557
These charms were indeed made
with the remains of her petrified body.

115
00:11:16,184 --> 00:11:19,646
This charm will protect us
from monsters like her.

116
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,231
My lord.

117
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,150
Would you like one?

118
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,332
This charm

119
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,461
will protect you from Naksu?

120
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:47,424
People must think

121
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,469
she is still alive.

122
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,472
Goodness. Naksu is dead, of course.

123
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:56,266
Despite her body
lying in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,

124
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:59,895
people are still terrified of her.

125
00:12:10,572 --> 00:12:13,074
The men from Songrim
will clean up here soon.

126
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,039
My lord, what is your name?

127
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,085
I think I know who he is.

128
00:12:25,462 --> 00:12:26,796
He is the one who reached Hwansu

129
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:29,424
with the ice stone.

130
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:32,344
He is that mage.

131
00:12:32,427 --> 00:12:34,262
The one whom Naksu almost killed?

132
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:36,723
Young Master Jang?

133
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:41,186
What kind of relationship
did those two have?

134
00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:55,700
This charm will protect us from Naksu.

135
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:58,912
If I keep this with me,

136
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:02,958
I will not be able to see you
even if you come.

137
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:51,256
Naksu was a maid of his.

138
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,384
She was also his betrothed.

139
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:58,763
And in return for his unconditional love,

140
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:00,640
she stabbed him

141
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:04,895
in the heart with a sword.

142
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,613
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

143
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:04,287
The energy of the sky
rules the wind, clouds, and rain.

144
00:15:04,996 --> 00:15:08,583
This energy reached the ground
and created a huge form of energy.

145
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:11,711
A country was built around
Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,

146
00:15:12,671 --> 00:15:13,838
a lake that embodied that energy.

147
00:15:14,756 --> 00:15:16,424
The name of the country was Daeho

148
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:18,385
due to the enormous lake it had.

149
00:15:19,803 --> 00:15:23,181
This story is about the mages of Daeho,
a place that does not exist

150
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,642
in both history books or maps.

151
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:38,029
That looks delicious.

152
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:43,284
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

153
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:20,697
It must be a soul shifter.

154
00:16:21,322 --> 00:16:22,532
I am terrified.

155
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:35,879
Did you lose her?

156
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:39,758
She fled into Jinyowon, of all places.

157
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:44,846
Jinyowon?

158
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:51,603
JINYOWON

159
00:16:51,686 --> 00:16:54,731
Outsiders are not allowed
to enter Jinyowon.

160
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,566
I am aware that for the past three years,

161
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,944
Jinyowon has forbidden
outsiders from entering.

162
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:02,697
But this is an urgent situation.
A soul shifter has hidden inside.

163
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,158
Ask Lady Jin to come and see me.

164
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,243
She will still say no.

165
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:09,412
He is the leader of Songrim.

166
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:13,583
How dare a low-ranking priestess
refuse to relay his message?

167
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:16,628
-My apologies.
-Open the gate this instant!

168
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:51,037
Young Lady Jin.

169
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,291
I have not seen you for three years.

170
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:58,086
Have you been well?

171
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:00,338
I did not come out here
to send my regards.

172
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:04,676
My mother refuses
to allow outsiders to enter Jinyowon.

173
00:18:06,678 --> 00:18:07,762
So you should go.

174
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,014
It is a dangerous situation.

175
00:18:10,598 --> 00:18:13,226
A soul shifter has harmed
dozens of lives at Yeongpo Dock.

176
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:15,145
The people of Jinyowon could get hurt too.

177
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,646
Just like my father did?

178
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:22,068
How could you possibly save anyone
when you failed to save

179
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:25,280
the father of your betrothed?

180
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:30,535
After what happened,

181
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:35,874
you never gave me the chance to apologize.

182
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,418
So it laid heavy on my heart.

183
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:39,711
Then keep feeling guilty.

184
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:42,630
I hope you never forget it.

185
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:45,216
Young Lady Jin.

186
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,509
You should go.

187
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:30,261
Did someone

188
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:33,306
just enter Jinyowon?

189
00:19:35,892 --> 00:19:36,726
Yes.

190
00:19:37,685 --> 00:19:39,187
I believe it was Jang Uk.

191
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,358
He has been chasing
the soul shifter with us.

192
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:45,276
Jang Uk?

193
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:48,988
Are you saying he just stepped inside?

194
00:19:49,781 --> 00:19:50,615
He is only obeying

195
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:53,993
the order of the royal family
and the Unanimous Assembly.

196
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,497
I shall close the gate.

197
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:00,250
You should go.

198
00:20:14,305 --> 00:20:17,392
There is no doubt
that Uk will catch the soul shifter.

199
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:19,227
We can just wait here.

200
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:21,980
Sure.

201
00:20:32,073 --> 00:20:33,157
Jang Uk

202
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:34,701
is in Jinyowon?

203
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:35,618
Yes.

204
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,413
He is here to catch
the soul shifter in hiding.

205
00:20:39,497 --> 00:20:42,041
Is Bu-yeon still in the annex
as she was told?

206
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,794
There is a barrier around her room,

207
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,921
so it will be near invisible
to the naked eye.

208
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:50,633
Jang Uk will never find her.

209
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:43,853
You must have shifted a long time ago.

210
00:21:53,654 --> 00:21:54,489
What is this?

211
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:36,823
What is this place?

212
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:39,784
A prison?

213
00:23:10,773 --> 00:23:11,607
Do not touch that.

214
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:20,533
Who are you? How did you get in here?

215
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,213
You must be insane.

216
00:23:34,297 --> 00:23:36,340
You seem to be a lousy Jinyowon priestess.

217
00:23:36,424 --> 00:23:38,092
How dare you aim that fire poker at me?

218
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:41,304
Incredible.

219
00:23:43,097 --> 00:23:45,933
Did you enter this room
after breaking the surrounding barrier?

220
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:48,019
As a priestess, you must know who I am.

221
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:50,146
Who are you?

222
00:23:50,855 --> 00:23:52,064
And what is this place?

223
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,650
Is this a prison?

224
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,694
Are you locked in here?

225
00:23:58,779 --> 00:23:59,739
It is not a prison.

226
00:24:04,994 --> 00:24:06,495
I could use this as a step.

227
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:13,711
Throw this onto the wall too.

228
00:24:14,462 --> 00:24:15,296
What?

229
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,007
Is it too flat?

230
00:24:19,717 --> 00:24:20,718
Then…

231
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,185
Is this better? Or this?

232
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:34,690
Which one would be better?

233
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:40,238
You must be locked up here.

234
00:24:40,321 --> 00:24:41,364
Are they no good?

235
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:43,950
You must be ill.

236
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,077
Would this be better?

237
00:24:46,827 --> 00:24:47,745
Are you leaving?

238
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:50,831
All right, then take me with you.

239
00:24:58,714 --> 00:24:59,715
You want

240
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:01,926
to leave with me?

241
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:04,512
I have not gone out in ages.

242
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:11,894
I smell the flowers on your clothing.

243
00:25:12,603 --> 00:25:14,272
The roses must have bloomed already.

244
00:25:16,274 --> 00:25:17,108
Look.

245
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,486
I understand that you are crazy
about going outside.

246
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:22,780
But I cannot help you.

247
00:25:22,863 --> 00:25:25,408
You can use that instead to go outside.

248
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:27,493
But that will be exhausting.

249
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:29,704
-I want to go with you.
-Hey, Lousy Priestess.

250
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,667
Step back unless you want
to end up like that fire poker.

251
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:38,379
I am not used

252
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,257
to having people stand so close.

253
00:25:55,646 --> 00:25:56,939
That is a pretty stone.

254
00:26:00,651 --> 00:26:01,485
You must have

255
00:26:02,486 --> 00:26:04,030
the energy of the sky.

256
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,034
I guess you are not all that lousy.

257
00:26:08,117 --> 00:26:08,951
You.

258
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:11,120
Can you see what is inside me?

259
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:12,872
Yes.

260
00:26:13,497 --> 00:26:15,207
I can see the energy of the world.

261
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,627
I have heard of a priestess
who could do that.

262
00:26:19,587 --> 00:26:20,463
So it was you?

263
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:24,383
Tell me. Who are you?

264
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:27,887
I cannot reveal who I am
due to a certain reason.

265
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,431
But once you find out who I am,

266
00:26:30,514 --> 00:26:33,601
you will definitely want
to take me out of here.

267
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,067
Where is Jang Uk?

268
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,486
I found traces of
his fight with the soul shifter.

269
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:44,904
Even near Bu-yeon's annex?

270
00:26:44,987 --> 00:26:47,698
I did not look there due to the barrier.

271
00:26:47,782 --> 00:26:50,534
No. That is the most vulnerable place.

272
00:26:50,618 --> 00:26:53,579
It would be terrible
if he ever were to run into her.

273
00:26:58,376 --> 00:27:01,170
Seeing how they even
imprisoned you with a barrier,

274
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:03,005
I guess you are not simply crazy.

275
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:06,175
If you get me out of here,
I will tell you who I am.

276
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,260
You will be utterly shocked.

277
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,182
-Forget it.
-Are you not curious about me?

278
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:15,976
Jinyowon and I have bad blood.

279
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,271
I do not want to let you out
and worsen our relationship even more.

280
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,191
You have bad blood with Jinyowon?

281
00:27:24,985 --> 00:27:25,945
You.

282
00:27:32,201 --> 00:27:33,869
Was this to help you escape?

283
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,373
Well, it is pretty lousy.

284
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,166
It took me three whole days to make that.

285
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:43,170
Three days?

286
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:48,926
Hey!

287
00:27:53,597 --> 00:27:54,890
If you do not want to take me, fine.

288
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:56,392
But did you have to do that?

289
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,978
They will suspect me
if you escape soon after I leave.

290
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:00,730
I want to avoid unnecessary trouble.

291
00:28:01,564 --> 00:28:02,732
It took you three days, right?

292
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:05,609
So postpone your escape by three days
so it will not affect me.

293
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:13,534
It will just be an outing, not an escape.

294
00:28:14,702 --> 00:28:17,538
Even if I get out of here,

295
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:20,416
I have no choice but to return.

296
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:30,843
Why did they lock up
such an incredible priestess?

297
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:33,262
What crime are you guilty of?

298
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:36,182
Being alive.

299
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:39,101
Existing in this world.

300
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:42,646
I am guilty

301
00:28:43,647 --> 00:28:45,608
of existing in this world
when I should not.

302
00:28:48,652 --> 00:28:50,529
I am someone who died a long time ago.

303
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:57,578
It must have been Jang Uk's doing.

304
00:28:58,788 --> 00:29:01,624
He must have come very close to the annex.

305
00:29:18,098 --> 00:29:18,933
Bu-yeon.

306
00:29:23,145 --> 00:29:23,979
Bu-yeon.

307
00:29:24,522 --> 00:29:26,482
Did anyone come in here?

308
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:27,650
No.

309
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:31,153
Who else could come in here
except for you and Mother?

310
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:37,243
What is the matter?

311
00:29:38,035 --> 00:29:39,119
Did something happen?

312
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:42,081
A soul shifter entered
and hid in Jinyowon.

313
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:45,209
A mage also entered to catch her

314
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:47,294
and caused havoc.

315
00:29:47,378 --> 00:29:48,504
A soul shifter?

316
00:29:49,547 --> 00:29:51,465
A monster whose soul
is different from its body?

317
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:54,009
Yes.

318
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:57,429
But we killed the soul shifter,
so do not worry.

319
00:30:11,485 --> 00:30:15,030
So he was a mage
who came here to kill the soul shifter.

320
00:30:21,704 --> 00:30:24,331
This will be enough to help you escape.

321
00:30:28,252 --> 00:30:29,587
Remember what I said.

322
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,631
Do not tell them about me
and wait before you get out.

323
00:30:33,716 --> 00:30:34,800
I will.

324
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,971
Can you do two more?

325
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:41,724
I am not as tall as you.

326
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:42,850
Will two suffice?

327
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:45,686
-You are pretty short.
-Then you will do three?

328
00:30:47,563 --> 00:30:48,397
Thanks.

329
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:50,816
Jeez.

330
00:30:52,735 --> 00:30:55,696
By the way, why are you helping me?

331
00:30:56,572 --> 00:30:57,907
Why the change of heart?

332
00:30:59,116 --> 00:31:00,951
Because we are guilty of the same crime.

333
00:31:03,037 --> 00:31:04,371
I am also guilty of existing

334
00:31:05,956 --> 00:31:06,874
when I should not.

335
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:23,349
Someone guilty of the same crime…

336
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:44,912
The roses must have really bloomed.

337
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:08,310
SONGRIM

338
00:32:11,438 --> 00:32:14,441
This soul shifter entered
a cargo boat at Yeongpo Dock

339
00:32:14,525 --> 00:32:16,610
and slaughtered everyone inside.

340
00:32:16,694 --> 00:32:19,863
We are constantly finding
soul shifters running rampant.

341
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,659
And Uk killed them all.

342
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:28,414
That is because everyone agreed
that would be how to make use of Jang Uk,

343
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,417
who was reborn
with the power of the ice stone.

344
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,668
That is not true.

345
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:35,462
He just complied with that decision.

346
00:32:36,672 --> 00:32:37,506
Are you still

347
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:41,260
awkward around him?

348
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:45,305
Yul has returned to Seoho Fortress.

349
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:46,849
You are the only friend he has.

350
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:50,227
You should not distance yourself from him.

351
00:32:52,021 --> 00:32:53,397
That is not my intention.

352
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:54,898
I just

353
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,569
do not know how to act around him.

354
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:03,657
I cannot laud him by claiming
to envy the great power he holds.

355
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:07,077
But I cannot empathize with him

356
00:33:08,412 --> 00:33:09,538
and tell him to give up either.

357
00:33:11,665 --> 00:33:13,375
Things are not how they used to be.

358
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,461
Since he used the ice stone's power

359
00:33:16,253 --> 00:33:18,338
to kill this soul shifter,

360
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:22,259
he will have trouble
sleeping tonight as well.

361
00:33:22,342 --> 00:33:23,302
Oh, dear.

362
00:33:32,186 --> 00:33:33,896
Songrim told me.

363
00:33:34,772 --> 00:33:37,316
Young Master, are you all right?

364
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,277
I am always fine.

365
00:33:41,111 --> 00:33:43,947
Worrying about me
will be the death of you.

366
00:33:44,031 --> 00:33:45,324
I told you not to worry.

367
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,246
Since you used that sword,

368
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:53,916
you will struggle tonight as well.

369
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:55,626
I am used to it now.

370
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,920
It is bearable.

371
00:34:07,554 --> 00:34:08,806
Did you heat up his room?

372
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,476
Prepare some strong liquor
and place a brazier inside.

373
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:17,064
I am too scared to enter his room.

374
00:34:17,147 --> 00:34:19,441
I get goosebumps,
and chills run down my spine

375
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:21,693
-if I am nearby.
-Goodness.

376
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:24,822
Light the brazier,
and I will carry it inside.

377
00:34:24,905 --> 00:34:25,739
Yes, ma'am.

378
00:34:53,183 --> 00:34:56,103
-Save me.
-Please help me.

379
00:34:58,105 --> 00:34:59,606
I do not want to die.

380
00:35:01,441 --> 00:35:02,693
Give me the ice stone!

381
00:35:09,491 --> 00:35:11,660
Since he used the energy of the sky,

382
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:14,913
the wraiths swarm toward him
to feed on that power.

383
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:19,960
They are noisy, cold,
unsightly, and pitiful.

384
00:35:20,794 --> 00:35:23,505
That is the price one must pay
for taking the ice stone

385
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:24,923
and using the energy of the sky.

386
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:44,902
Yeongpo Dock will be closed for now

387
00:35:44,985 --> 00:35:47,112
due to losing many workers
to the soul shifter.

388
00:35:47,196 --> 00:35:49,823
You must deliver the goods
to Wol Fortress by land.

389
00:35:50,574 --> 00:35:52,326
Daegangtongun will be the quickest.

390
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:53,243
Yes, my lord.

391
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:02,920
Young Master Park finally looks like
the leader of Songrim.

392
00:36:03,003 --> 00:36:06,173
He may not have been
the best at casting spells,

393
00:36:06,256 --> 00:36:09,009
but he is an excellent businessman.

394
00:36:13,096 --> 00:36:14,223
-Young Lady Heo.
-Yes?

395
00:36:27,194 --> 00:36:30,656
Has Young Lady Heo decided not
to return to Wol Fortress?

396
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:34,576
She is tending to the body
that the Queen's soul resides in.

397
00:36:35,244 --> 00:36:36,078
So she cannot leave.

398
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:39,206
Did you say she visited your place again?

399
00:36:39,957 --> 00:36:40,874
Yes, my lord.

400
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:44,211
She is worried about how
our young master cannot sleep well,

401
00:36:44,795 --> 00:36:47,464
so she always brings him medicine
that she concocts.

402
00:36:47,547 --> 00:36:52,052
And has Uk ever thanked her
by offering her some tea?

403
00:36:54,096 --> 00:36:57,182
I understand how she feels,
so I try my best to help out.

404
00:36:57,975 --> 00:36:59,059
But it is difficult.

405
00:36:59,142 --> 00:37:00,227
Goodness.

406
00:37:01,061 --> 00:37:04,231
I keep telling her to give up on him,

407
00:37:04,314 --> 00:37:05,857
but it is not working.

408
00:37:05,941 --> 00:37:07,484
I will keep trying.

409
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:11,071
Goodness. By the way,
will you be visiting Park Jin?

410
00:37:11,154 --> 00:37:12,531
-Yes, my lord.
-If you do,

411
00:37:12,614 --> 00:37:15,492
can you please dissuade him

412
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:18,745
from continuing his new hobby?

413
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:22,666
All the people of Songrim
have pickled tongues thanks to him.

414
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,167
Pickled tongues?

415
00:37:24,251 --> 00:37:25,794
Our tongues are a mess.

416
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,879
What could he possibly be doing?

417
00:37:27,963 --> 00:37:28,797
Goodness.

418
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:18,680
My lord.

419
00:38:19,723 --> 00:38:21,016
What are you up to?

420
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,768
Hello, Maidservant Kim.

421
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:24,936
I am making cubed radish kimchi today.

422
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,230
You are making all of this?

423
00:38:27,314 --> 00:38:30,442
You have no idea
how delighted those in the kitchen are

424
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:33,028
whenever I give them
new batches of kimchi.

425
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:34,613
Right.

426
00:38:34,696 --> 00:38:36,823
I did hear that you gave them five crocks

427
00:38:36,907 --> 00:38:39,284
of mustard leaf kimchi
and green onion kimchi last time.

428
00:38:39,368 --> 00:38:41,286
It was not that tiring to make,

429
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,747
and I only did it to kill time.

430
00:38:44,498 --> 00:38:47,793
But they seem
to be waiting for my kimchi now.

431
00:38:48,585 --> 00:38:51,088
I do not think they are
that desperate for the kimchi.

432
00:38:52,005 --> 00:38:53,882
There is no need for all this.

433
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:57,427
They cannot openly ask for more
since they are intimidated by me.

434
00:38:58,595 --> 00:38:59,554
But I am not that dense.

435
00:39:00,347 --> 00:39:01,681
I ought to give them more.

436
00:39:02,432 --> 00:39:03,892
I need more garlic.

437
00:39:04,684 --> 00:39:05,685
I will be back.

438
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:12,484
Gosh, everyone told me to stop him.

439
00:39:29,418 --> 00:39:32,129
I get why Maidservant Park said
this was driving her crazy.

440
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:36,258
This is too much to throw away.

441
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:38,009
It will only torment the eater.

442
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:47,310
I see.

443
00:39:48,395 --> 00:39:51,690
My lord, I need some radish.

444
00:39:51,773 --> 00:39:53,567
Can I use those?

445
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:54,568
Sure.

446
00:39:54,651 --> 00:39:57,320
But then I will not have enough
to make cubed radish kimchi with.

447
00:39:57,404 --> 00:39:59,448
Come on. This is already enough.

448
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:02,075
They will appreciate it more
if it is not abundant.

449
00:40:02,993 --> 00:40:04,077
That is true.

450
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:07,622
-Have a seat.
-Yes, my lord.

451
00:40:15,797 --> 00:40:19,718
Do you feel empty inside
after stepping down from being a leader?

452
00:40:21,178 --> 00:40:23,722
I tend to the field and the flowers.

453
00:40:23,805 --> 00:40:26,308
I also do housework. It is all quite fun.

454
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:42,282
You have planted many balsam seeds.

455
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:47,496
Young Master Jang

456
00:40:48,622 --> 00:40:50,081
is still very ill.

457
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:54,961
I am afraid

458
00:40:55,962 --> 00:40:58,131
I will have to be
by his side this year as well.

459
00:41:00,842 --> 00:41:01,760
I understand.

460
00:41:02,552 --> 00:41:04,179
Three years ago,

461
00:41:05,055 --> 00:41:07,766
you took responsibility
for everything and stepped down.

462
00:41:09,643 --> 00:41:10,769
I did not once dissuade you.

463
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:14,105
Rather, I brazenly thanked you.

464
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:19,152
I was only relieved that my young master

465
00:41:20,737 --> 00:41:21,863
was spared.

466
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:27,869
We have not peeled the garlic yet,
but you are already crying.

467
00:41:30,914 --> 00:41:32,123
We need to peel all of these.

468
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:35,293
Yes, my lord.

469
00:41:35,877 --> 00:41:37,921
I will peel them all for you.

470
00:41:39,756 --> 00:41:42,300
But the kimchi will be too bitter
if you put them all in.

471
00:41:42,384 --> 00:41:44,594
The bigger the amount,
the tastier it will be.

472
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:51,351
I need some garlic too,
so let me take half.

473
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:55,063
Will the kimchi still be tasty?

474
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:56,356
Half is more than enough.

475
00:41:56,856 --> 00:41:57,691
I see.

476
00:42:01,528 --> 00:42:03,738
Jinyowon is preparing for a wedding?

477
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:06,366
Do you remember how we placed

478
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:08,660
Young Lady Jin's wedding supplies
in the storage?

479
00:42:09,703 --> 00:42:12,455
Jinyowon asked for them back today.

480
00:42:15,542 --> 00:42:19,004
Someone must be getting married.

481
00:42:19,087 --> 00:42:21,881
But if someone from the Jin family
is getting married,

482
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,342
it can only mean Young Lady Jin.

483
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,147
The wedding date has been set already?

484
00:42:37,897 --> 00:42:39,524
This is too sudden, Mother.

485
00:42:40,817 --> 00:42:42,444
It was not easy to find a suitor.

486
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,738
She must obey my words.

487
00:42:46,906 --> 00:42:47,741
Mother.

488
00:42:48,825 --> 00:42:50,201
Why are you so cruel?

489
00:42:52,996 --> 00:42:54,205
As I expected,

490
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:56,958
is she not Bu-yeon,

491
00:42:58,543 --> 00:42:59,669
but that other woman?

492
00:42:59,753 --> 00:43:01,087
Jin Cho-yeon.

493
00:43:04,174 --> 00:43:05,008
She is Bu-yeon.

494
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:07,469
The original soul was already dead

495
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:10,472
when we retrieved the body
from the lake three years ago.

496
00:43:11,264 --> 00:43:14,643
That body belongs to my daughter,
Jin Bu-yeon.

497
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:36,790
Bu-yeon.

498
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:41,211
Yes, Mother.

499
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:47,133
I am getting married?

500
00:43:48,718 --> 00:43:51,888
Does that mean I will leave this room?

501
00:43:51,971 --> 00:43:53,264
He will be married into the family.

502
00:43:53,348 --> 00:43:55,266
Once your husband arrives for the wedding,

503
00:43:55,350 --> 00:44:00,105
you will continue living in this room.

504
00:44:01,648 --> 00:44:05,735
If I cannot get out of here,
why must I get married?

505
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:08,738
Because we need a girl
who will lead Jinyowon in the future.

506
00:44:09,989 --> 00:44:12,325
Children with the greatest divine powers

507
00:44:12,409 --> 00:44:14,911
always come from the eldest daughters.

508
00:44:16,871 --> 00:44:20,041
Give birth to a beautiful daughter
with great divine powers.

509
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:26,840
So you expect me to stay
locked up here and just give birth?

510
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:30,802
No.

511
00:44:31,553 --> 00:44:33,054
I do not want that kind of marriage.

512
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:34,681
It has already been decided.

513
00:44:35,432 --> 00:44:36,766
You just need to follow my orders.

514
00:44:39,352 --> 00:44:41,646
If I get married like you want me to,

515
00:44:42,772 --> 00:44:45,066
I will forever be stuck here.

516
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:48,445
Bu-yeon.

517
00:44:49,195 --> 00:44:51,823
It took me many years to find you again.

518
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:56,244
Marry the man I have chosen for you

519
00:44:56,327 --> 00:44:58,830
and stay by my side forever.

520
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:02,959
Mother.

521
00:45:04,878 --> 00:45:06,463
Who will Bu-yeon

522
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:08,465
get married to?

523
00:45:08,548 --> 00:45:10,884
He is from the Seo family
at Seoho Fortress.

524
00:45:10,967 --> 00:45:13,386
He will temporarily stay
at Chwiseonru upon arrival.

525
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:16,514
The wedding will take place
at his uncle's house.

526
00:45:17,724 --> 00:45:21,394
He is excellent husband material.

527
00:45:52,759 --> 00:45:54,594
We will arrive at Daeho Fortress soon.

528
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,554
Has it been three years for you?

529
00:45:56,638 --> 00:45:57,472
Yes.

530
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:01,935
I did not know
it would take me this long to return.

531
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:03,728
But Yul,

532
00:46:04,354 --> 00:46:08,691
why did Master Heo forbid you
from returning to Daeho Fortress?

533
00:46:08,775 --> 00:46:11,152
I doubt you caused any kind of trouble.

534
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:13,404
Did you have bad blood
with someone at Songrim?

535
00:46:14,781 --> 00:46:15,949
He was protecting me.

536
00:46:17,367 --> 00:46:20,161
And I was cowardly enough to listen.

537
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:28,002
Due to the ongoing drought,
the water level has dropped.

538
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:29,587
Its energy is weak now.

539
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:32,507
I heard they are planning
to perform a rite for the lake again.

540
00:46:33,299 --> 00:46:35,593
The Unanimous Assembly
will be discussing it.

541
00:46:35,677 --> 00:46:36,719
But to do that,

542
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:40,932
they will need the help
of Jinyowon's priestesses.

543
00:46:47,564 --> 00:46:49,440
Jang Uk of Songrim

544
00:46:49,524 --> 00:46:52,402
caught and retrieved the soul
of the 29th soul shifter.

545
00:46:52,485 --> 00:46:53,695
Then as usual,

546
00:46:55,071 --> 00:46:58,616
the Crown Prince shall visit him
and reward him with 1,000 gold nyang.

547
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:02,078
Please allow Cheonbugwan

548
00:47:02,745 --> 00:47:05,498
to deliver them
instead of His Royal Highness from now on.

549
00:47:05,582 --> 00:47:07,041
I decline.

550
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:11,296
I ask that the Crown Prince
reward Uk himself as always.

551
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:25,810
Jang Uk has been earning
1,000 gold nyang every time.

552
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:28,980
At this rate, he will be
the richest man in Daeho.

553
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:32,025
If that is the price
for taking all the credit,

554
00:47:32,108 --> 00:47:33,526
then you should do it happily.

555
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,030
The people of Daeho believe
you have ordered Jang Uk

556
00:47:37,113 --> 00:47:39,073
to kill all the monsters.

557
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:42,493
They praise you
for being born under the King's Star.

558
00:47:43,786 --> 00:47:44,704
On the other hand,

559
00:47:44,787 --> 00:47:47,040
they call Uk a monster
who catches other monsters.

560
00:47:47,123 --> 00:47:49,250
They are terrified and avoid him.

561
00:47:49,334 --> 00:47:50,960
He brought that upon himself.

562
00:47:51,961 --> 00:47:54,964
Why is he carrying
Naksu's sword that once killed him?

563
00:47:55,048 --> 00:47:57,091
Some say he is bearing a bitter grudge,

564
00:47:57,175 --> 00:48:00,219
while others say
he is just painfully in love with her.

565
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,808
What do you think, Your Royal Highness?

566
00:48:05,892 --> 00:48:07,143
He is nothing but a lunatic.

567
00:48:07,226 --> 00:48:08,936
He chose to carry her sword

568
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,272
and kill soul shifters
who are just like her.

569
00:48:11,356 --> 00:48:12,649
He feels dark and ominous.

570
00:48:14,901 --> 00:48:17,737
That is how people perceive him as of now.

571
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,365
Is that not what you wanted
in the first place?

572
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:31,167
He is living the life you wanted for him.

573
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,210
So please visit him,

574
00:48:32,794 --> 00:48:36,381
and praise and congratulate
that ominous lunatic yourself.

575
00:49:00,655 --> 00:49:04,325
Visiting the now-empty Jeongjingak
always makes me forlorn.

576
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:07,078
Since every mage except Jang Uk has left,

577
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:10,206
the energy that fills this place
must be his own.

578
00:49:10,289 --> 00:49:12,792
I heard it is
always dark and cold where he is.

579
00:49:22,552 --> 00:49:25,179
I am here to reward you
for killing the soul shifter.

580
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:27,265
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

581
00:49:28,057 --> 00:49:29,142
You can leave it and go.

582
00:49:34,981 --> 00:49:37,191
How dare he not accept it in person?

583
00:49:37,984 --> 00:49:39,318
Shall I call him back?

584
00:49:39,402 --> 00:49:40,236
That is fine.

585
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:53,666
I heard you followed
the soul shifter into Jinyowon.

586
00:49:54,751 --> 00:49:57,420
How did you get in
when they forbade outsiders from entering?

587
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,381
No one can stop me from going anywhere.

588
00:50:01,257 --> 00:50:03,676
And I am used to feeling unwelcome.

589
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:09,390
Is that why you drink alone
in this dark and gloomy place?

590
00:50:13,686 --> 00:50:15,772
Park Dang-gu used to be
so affectionate toward you.

591
00:50:15,855 --> 00:50:16,898
Then again,

592
00:50:17,732 --> 00:50:20,943
I do not blame him.
His wedding fell through because of you.

593
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,321
And Seo Yul is at Seoho Fortress.

594
00:50:24,155 --> 00:50:26,574
I heard all the Jeongjingak mages left
because of you.

595
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:31,704
You are truly all alone.

596
00:50:40,797 --> 00:50:43,466
I would rather be blunt
than sugarcoat things.

597
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,722
Hey, why do you drink such strong liquor?

598
00:50:49,806 --> 00:50:51,224
My insides are melting.

599
00:50:51,307 --> 00:50:53,142
You should force yourself to have it.

600
00:50:53,768 --> 00:50:56,813
The liquor will protect you
from the chill emitted by wraiths.

601
00:50:56,896 --> 00:50:57,730
Wraiths?

602
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:01,651
But this is Jeongjingak.

603
00:51:02,944 --> 00:51:03,945
Did you not hear?

604
00:51:04,028 --> 00:51:05,696
Wraiths follow me everywhere.

605
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:11,744
What?

606
00:51:12,411 --> 00:51:13,746
But it is broad daylight.

607
00:51:16,082 --> 00:51:16,916
That is absurd.

608
00:51:16,999 --> 00:51:19,377
Feel free to leave
if you feel uncomfortable.

609
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,462
You must not have come here
because you missed me.

610
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:25,299
Why do you ask me to reward you every time
if you know how uncomfortable I am?

611
00:51:26,092 --> 00:51:27,218
You do not lack money.

612
00:51:28,511 --> 00:51:31,097
It makes me feel at ease to use this power

613
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:34,350
only to atone for my sins and be rewarded.

614
00:51:34,433 --> 00:51:37,687
I take credit for punishing
and rewarding you.

615
00:51:39,105 --> 00:51:40,648
I must look like a joke to you.

616
00:51:45,486 --> 00:51:46,988
This is what I dislike about you.

617
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:50,116
You look down on me and mock me
for the things I desire and obsess over.

618
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:51,409
That is what offends me.

619
00:51:51,492 --> 00:51:53,119
And you should be.

620
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:56,539
That is exactly why I am doing this.

621
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,213
I am too intimidating
to be considered acting out of stupidity.

622
00:52:04,797 --> 00:52:07,592
Yet your ego does not let you accept
that I am acting out of vigor.

623
00:52:08,843 --> 00:52:10,428
I am sure it bothers you.

624
00:52:16,976 --> 00:52:17,810
You are right.

625
00:52:19,437 --> 00:52:21,981
You are always as annoying
as a splinter in my finger.

626
00:52:22,064 --> 00:52:23,858
A splinter in your finger?

627
00:52:25,568 --> 00:52:26,819
What a joke.

628
00:52:29,655 --> 00:52:30,781
Did Jin Mu tell you

629
00:52:31,866 --> 00:52:33,868
to think that of me
to make you feel better?

630
00:52:39,373 --> 00:52:40,249
Am I not too strong

631
00:52:42,251 --> 00:52:43,794
and too significant to be a mere splinter?

632
00:52:48,132 --> 00:52:51,344
I understand that you are frustrated,
but you are not the victim here.

633
00:52:53,012 --> 00:52:54,388
That splinter cannot be

634
00:52:55,765 --> 00:52:56,599
more painful

635
00:52:57,642 --> 00:52:59,518
than a sword through my chest.

636
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:16,327
Well, then.

637
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,287
We will meet again
once I kill the next soul shifter.

638
00:53:34,804 --> 00:53:36,138
Bu-yeon disappeared?

639
00:53:36,222 --> 00:53:37,765
Look at this, my lady.

640
00:53:38,975 --> 00:53:40,309
She must have climbed using this

641
00:53:40,393 --> 00:53:42,228
and escaped through the window.

642
00:53:43,896 --> 00:53:45,356
Why are these on the wall?

643
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:48,150
How in the world did she do that?

644
00:53:48,234 --> 00:53:49,068
I am not sure.

645
00:53:51,821 --> 00:53:54,115
We must find her before Mother finds out.

646
00:53:55,074 --> 00:53:56,784
She has the tracking bracelet.

647
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:59,328
It may take some time,
but we will eventually find her.

648
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,597
Last time, they caught me in four hours.

649
00:54:18,681 --> 00:54:20,433
I must meet my betrothed before then.

650
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,436
He is from the Seo family
at Seoho Fortress.

651
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,313
He will temporarily stay
at Chwiseonru upon arrival.

652
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:27,481
Chwiseonru.

653
00:54:31,694 --> 00:54:35,364
A man from the Seo family
who will come from Seoho Fortress?

654
00:54:35,448 --> 00:54:36,574
That is right.

655
00:54:36,657 --> 00:54:38,576
I heard he will be staying there.

656
00:54:38,659 --> 00:54:41,287
Yes. We do have reservations.

657
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:44,832
There are two of them.
Which one of them are you looking for?

658
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:51,714
A man who is excellent husband material.

659
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:53,758
I see.

660
00:54:53,841 --> 00:54:55,801
Then it must be Young Master Seo Yul.

661
00:54:56,385 --> 00:54:57,511
Seo Yul?

662
00:54:57,595 --> 00:54:59,847
Have you never heard of him?

663
00:55:01,307 --> 00:55:03,184
You must not be from Daeho Fortress.

664
00:55:03,893 --> 00:55:06,479
Every woman here knows about him.

665
00:55:08,564 --> 00:55:11,233
I cannot reveal
a guest's information to a stranger.

666
00:55:18,365 --> 00:55:19,825
Can you tell me more in detail?

667
00:55:26,665 --> 00:55:28,459
Check if this is authentic or not.

668
00:55:29,251 --> 00:55:30,252
Yes, my lady.

669
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:33,214
There are four men

670
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:36,592
at Daeho Fortress
whom all the women want to marry.

671
00:55:36,675 --> 00:55:37,510
First.

672
00:55:38,385 --> 00:55:40,763
The prince who will sit
on the throne one day.

673
00:55:44,016 --> 00:55:45,309
Crown Prince Go Won.

674
00:55:45,893 --> 00:55:48,854
He is single,
but not everyone can marry him.

675
00:55:50,689 --> 00:55:53,526
The next candidate
is from the wealthiest family here.

676
00:55:53,609 --> 00:55:55,945
He is the new leader of Songrim,
Park Dang-gu.

677
00:55:57,446 --> 00:56:00,032
His wedding fell through
at the very last minute.

678
00:56:00,116 --> 00:56:01,450
But that is not a big deal.

679
00:56:02,284 --> 00:56:04,745
The third candidate is Seo Yul.

680
00:56:07,081 --> 00:56:10,126
He is from the most distinguished family
and lacks nothing.

681
00:56:10,209 --> 00:56:12,837
But the catch is that
his hometown is Seoho Fortress.

682
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,005
It is too far away.

683
00:56:15,089 --> 00:56:18,008
And lastly, there is Jang Uk.

684
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:22,513
He is probably
the strongest man in the world right now.

685
00:56:22,596 --> 00:56:25,266
But I do not recommend him.

686
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:26,183
Why not?

687
00:56:26,809 --> 00:56:31,021
You should never date a man with a past
as painful as a stab to the heart.

688
00:56:34,942 --> 00:56:38,529
So among those men,
you are here to meet Seo Yul, right?

689
00:56:39,321 --> 00:56:40,990
I believe so.

690
00:56:41,073 --> 00:56:42,658
When is he coming?

691
00:56:42,741 --> 00:56:45,077
The boat that departed
from Seoho Fortress will arrive soon.

692
00:56:45,161 --> 00:56:46,370
He should be here shortly.

693
00:56:47,705 --> 00:56:49,915
By the way,
what is your relationship with him?

694
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:53,794
You talked about him being a husband.
Are you his betrothed?

695
00:56:55,671 --> 00:56:57,214
I will only make that decision

696
00:56:57,298 --> 00:57:00,551
after we meet and discuss the matter.

697
00:57:00,634 --> 00:57:03,471
Goodness, you are confident.

698
00:57:04,472 --> 00:57:06,974
He is not someone you can have
solely based on good looks.

699
00:57:07,057 --> 00:57:09,268
Which family are you from?

700
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:13,147
Madam.

701
00:57:19,528 --> 00:57:21,197
It is indeed authentic,

702
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,282
but this is the crest of Jinyowon.

703
00:57:23,365 --> 00:57:25,826
She is offering something from Jinyowon?

704
00:57:26,869 --> 00:57:27,912
She must be a thief.

705
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:33,167
My lady.

706
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,461
What is your relationship with Jinyowon?

707
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:38,964
How suspicious.

708
00:57:39,632 --> 00:57:42,468
I must go there
and check if this is really yours.

709
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,263
Get her! Get that thief!

710
00:57:49,058 --> 00:57:50,017
Hello, my lord.

711
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,686
-Is Yul here?
-He has not arrived yet.

712
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:15,501
He will be arriving on a boat.

713
00:58:17,211 --> 00:58:18,170
Probably from over there.

714
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:22,216
If he lacks nothing,

715
00:58:23,008 --> 00:58:24,802
he must be handsome too.

716
00:58:31,767 --> 00:58:34,103
Excuse me. Are you from the Seo family?

717
00:58:34,895 --> 00:58:36,438
No, I am not.

718
00:58:36,522 --> 00:58:37,856
But I would like to know your name.

719
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,316
Forget it, then.

720
00:59:01,589 --> 00:59:04,842
This boat will depart
for Bisan-dong in the capital.

721
00:59:04,925 --> 00:59:07,886
This boat will depart
for Bisan-dong in the capital.

722
00:59:32,911 --> 00:59:34,496
Have you been well,

723
00:59:36,206 --> 00:59:37,374
Young Master Seo?

724
00:59:47,176 --> 00:59:49,511
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

725
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:56,644
If my betrothed accepts
my mother's wishes,

726
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:58,646
I will be locked up there forever.

727
01:00:01,023 --> 01:00:03,067
I must speak with him before I get caught.

728
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:05,694
What should I do?

729
01:00:14,453 --> 01:00:16,705
Look over there.

730
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:19,208
Is he not Jang Uk?

731
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:21,210
Yes, the ice stone man.

732
01:00:21,293 --> 01:00:23,295
He is Young Master Jang
from the Jang family.

733
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:39,269
Is that man over there Jang Uk?

734
01:00:39,853 --> 01:00:40,854
-Yes, he is.
-Yes.

735
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:41,897
Jang Uk.

736
01:00:44,483 --> 01:00:45,484
The fourth candidate.

737
01:00:55,411 --> 01:00:58,914
He is probably
the strongest man in the world right now.

738
01:00:59,498 --> 01:01:01,333
The strongest man?

739
01:01:30,028 --> 01:01:31,947
I heard that people avoid you.

740
01:01:33,073 --> 01:01:34,366
So it is true.

741
01:01:35,033 --> 01:01:36,201
You must have successfully escaped.

742
01:01:36,952 --> 01:01:38,829
Right. You said it was just an outing.

743
01:01:40,581 --> 01:01:41,665
Yes, thanks to you.

744
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:48,172
I smell something delicious.

745
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:54,678
Can I have one of those?

746
01:01:59,641 --> 01:02:01,602
Never mind. I have no money.

747
01:02:03,479 --> 01:02:05,355
Here is your strong liquor, my lord.

748
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:07,858
Excuse me.

749
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:12,362
I want one of those.

750
01:02:13,071 --> 01:02:14,031
Yes, my lord.

751
01:02:17,993 --> 01:02:19,912
Thanks, Jang Uk.

752
01:02:22,206 --> 01:02:23,332
How do you know my name?

753
01:02:23,415 --> 01:02:25,042
I learned it by accident

754
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:27,169
while searching for my betrothed.

755
01:02:28,253 --> 01:02:29,087
Betrothed?

756
01:02:29,171 --> 01:02:31,048
I will get married soon.

757
01:02:31,757 --> 01:02:33,383
He will move into Jinyowon.

758
01:02:35,552 --> 01:02:37,346
Even regular priestesses' husbands
move in there?

759
01:02:37,429 --> 01:02:38,806
Of course not.

760
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:41,225
Only the heir of the Jin family
brings in her husband.

761
01:02:41,308 --> 01:02:43,143
But that is Jin Cho-yeon.

762
01:02:43,769 --> 01:02:45,854
She is the second daughter.

763
01:02:47,439 --> 01:02:49,733
The future leader of Jinyowon

764
01:02:49,817 --> 01:02:51,318
will be me, the eldest daughter.

765
01:02:52,236 --> 01:02:53,153
Jin Bu-yeon.

766
01:02:57,032 --> 01:02:59,201
What? You are who?

767
01:03:01,662 --> 01:03:03,080
She died ages ago.

768
01:03:03,163 --> 01:03:06,792
I told you already
that I died a long time ago.

769
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:11,964
I was locked up there
because I should not have existed

770
01:03:12,047 --> 01:03:13,590
in the first place.

771
01:03:15,926 --> 01:03:18,470
My mother wants my future husband
to secretly move in.

772
01:03:18,554 --> 01:03:20,305
She wants me to give birth to an heir.

773
01:03:21,348 --> 01:03:24,643
But if I do get married,
I will be stuck in that room forever.

774
01:03:24,726 --> 01:03:27,271
So you are Jin Bu-yeon.

775
01:03:27,354 --> 01:03:29,523
And you want to run away
and not get married?

776
01:03:31,483 --> 01:03:33,277
I cannot flee.

777
01:03:33,777 --> 01:03:36,321
So I wanted to find my betrothed
and ask for his help.

778
01:03:38,824 --> 01:03:40,784
But I just came up with a great idea.

779
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:46,915
I should find a husband
who suits me instead.

780
01:03:50,002 --> 01:03:51,169
Speaking of which,

781
01:03:52,421 --> 01:03:53,255
Jang Uk.

782
01:03:54,882 --> 01:03:56,758
Will you marry me?

783
01:03:57,968 --> 01:03:58,802
What?

784
01:03:58,886 --> 01:04:02,180
I want you to be my husband.

785
01:04:13,775 --> 01:04:16,945
There are no mages
who train at Jeongjingak anymore.

786
01:04:19,364 --> 01:04:20,240
There is only Uk.

787
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:22,951
But he was the reason

788
01:04:23,702 --> 01:04:24,536
why everyone left.

789
01:04:28,123 --> 01:04:29,416
I left first.

790
01:04:32,377 --> 01:04:33,795
I fled by myself

791
01:04:35,464 --> 01:04:37,299
when you two were struggling the most.

792
01:04:42,054 --> 01:04:42,888
I am sorry.

793
01:04:47,935 --> 01:04:49,102
You were struggling too.

794
01:04:52,648 --> 01:04:53,482
You knew,

795
01:04:55,108 --> 01:04:56,193
did you not?

796
01:04:58,487 --> 01:04:59,655
That she was Naksu.

797
01:05:03,659 --> 01:05:04,493
Yes.

798
01:05:05,077 --> 01:05:07,788
Uk was the first to recognize her.

799
01:05:10,165 --> 01:05:12,417
But I was the first to meet Naksu.

800
01:05:27,307 --> 01:05:29,893
We only met once,
but you want me to marry you?

801
01:05:30,686 --> 01:05:32,270
You must be out of your mind.

802
01:05:32,354 --> 01:05:36,274
-I should have never helped you escape.
-I am not out of my mind.

803
01:05:36,858 --> 01:05:39,027
You are strong enough
to go against my mother.

804
01:05:39,111 --> 01:05:41,113
And you have bad blood with Jinyowon.

805
01:05:41,196 --> 01:05:43,573
If we get married, she might kick me out.

806
01:05:44,449 --> 01:05:45,993
That is exactly what I want.

807
01:05:48,954 --> 01:05:51,415
I cannot believe I ran into
the perfect potential husband.

808
01:05:57,337 --> 01:05:59,339
I cannot believe I ran into
the craziest potential bride

809
01:05:59,423 --> 01:06:00,674
when we only met once.

810
01:06:01,383 --> 01:06:03,218
-So you see me as a potential bride?
-No.

811
01:06:05,012 --> 01:06:06,013
Look me in the eye.

812
01:06:07,639 --> 01:06:09,141
Look at me and reconsider.

813
01:06:13,979 --> 01:06:16,189
Do you not want to wed me?

814
01:06:16,273 --> 01:06:17,190
Why?

815
01:06:17,274 --> 01:06:18,108
Because…

816
01:06:21,737 --> 01:06:22,779
my beauty is unmatched.

817
01:06:26,658 --> 01:06:27,826
You are driving me crazy.

818
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:29,745
You cannot deny the fact

819
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:33,582
that I turn heads wherever I go.

820
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:39,129
I am sure you can see for yourself.

821
01:06:39,212 --> 01:06:40,172
Yes, you are beautiful.

822
01:06:41,339 --> 01:06:44,342
I hope you find a better match
with that beauty of yours.

823
01:06:46,261 --> 01:06:47,679
Enjoy the chicken.

824
01:06:47,763 --> 01:06:48,764
Jang Uk.

825
01:06:53,018 --> 01:06:53,852
You.

826
01:06:54,853 --> 01:06:56,563
Do you think I am a pushover?

827
01:06:57,689 --> 01:06:58,523
That is enough.

828
01:07:08,033 --> 01:07:09,284
That looks good.

829
01:07:09,367 --> 01:07:11,912
Enjoy your outing and go home.

830
01:07:28,512 --> 01:07:30,222
Darn it. They will catch me soon.

831
01:08:14,432 --> 01:08:15,851
There is one thing that bothers me.

832
01:08:17,978 --> 01:08:19,980
Seeing how they are
determined to find you,

833
01:08:20,897 --> 01:08:22,816
you must not be just some lousy priestess.

834
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:25,735
Are you really Jin Bu-yeon?

835
01:08:26,444 --> 01:08:28,822
Yes. I am her.

836
01:08:28,905 --> 01:08:30,282
She went missing ages ago.

837
01:08:30,365 --> 01:08:32,659
But they found me three years ago.

838
01:08:32,742 --> 01:08:34,870
They also found a fake daughter back then.

839
01:08:34,953 --> 01:08:38,415
If I were fake, why would they hide me
for all those years?

840
01:08:39,249 --> 01:08:40,542
I am the real Bu-yeon.

841
01:08:41,459 --> 01:08:44,004
Then again, I did hear

842
01:08:45,088 --> 01:08:47,174
that Bu-yeon could see energy.

843
01:08:49,301 --> 01:08:52,387
And you saw the ice stone within me.

844
01:08:53,096 --> 01:08:54,264
That is right.

845
01:08:54,347 --> 01:08:56,892
I am the eldest daughter
with the greatest divine powers.

846
01:08:57,851 --> 01:08:59,436
If my looks do not move you,

847
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,562
consider my skills.

848
01:09:01,271 --> 01:09:03,064
You might need my help one day.

849
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:08,153
All right.

850
01:09:09,446 --> 01:09:11,156
If I ever need your help,

851
01:09:12,365 --> 01:09:13,325
I will find you then.

852
01:09:19,206 --> 01:09:21,082
I will get married
on the full moon of this month.

853
01:09:21,166 --> 01:09:24,002
And once I do,
I will never be able to leave that room.

854
01:09:25,545 --> 01:09:27,505
I need a new groom to avoid that fate.

855
01:09:30,926 --> 01:09:33,845
I would like you to come and take me away.

856
01:09:35,388 --> 01:09:36,306
I will be waiting.

857
01:09:37,515 --> 01:09:39,559
Please come for me.

858
01:09:52,155 --> 01:09:52,989
Jang Uk.

859
01:09:54,032 --> 01:09:57,327
Everyone seems to avoid you.

860
01:09:58,286 --> 01:10:00,121
Just get married while you still can.

861
01:10:01,289 --> 01:10:02,666
I am willing to marry you.

862
01:10:05,418 --> 01:10:06,253
Forget it.

863
01:10:16,513 --> 01:10:17,847
There you are.

864
01:10:17,931 --> 01:10:19,140
Let us go.

865
01:10:30,026 --> 01:10:31,528
Have you been well, my lord?

866
01:10:31,611 --> 01:10:33,822
I am no longer the leader of Songrim.

867
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:36,157
Dang-gu is the leader now.

868
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:38,076
Come on.

869
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:39,244
Uncle.

870
01:10:39,327 --> 01:10:41,621
I feel uneasy
whenever someone calls me that.

871
01:10:41,705 --> 01:10:43,623
Can you take the position again

872
01:10:43,707 --> 01:10:45,500
and let me just assist you?

873
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:46,626
Forget it.

874
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:49,587
I have become so carefree.

875
01:10:52,424 --> 01:10:53,800
What do you do these days?

876
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:57,554
I farm and do housework.

877
01:10:59,055 --> 01:10:59,889
Yul,

878
01:11:00,682 --> 01:11:05,353
I have prepared a grand feast
just for you.

879
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:09,357
Did you do the cooking, Uncle?

880
01:11:09,441 --> 01:11:11,026
He should have a taste too.

881
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:13,486
Yul, you can look forward to it.

882
01:11:24,205 --> 01:11:26,916
He is right. I cannot be the only victim.

883
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,085
You should have a taste as well.

884
01:11:31,796 --> 01:11:33,631
Here comes another victim.

885
01:11:46,353 --> 01:11:47,187
You are back.

886
01:11:52,025 --> 01:11:53,485
Yes, I am back.

887
01:12:24,307 --> 01:12:27,435
I dug out this deodeok myself,
added a bit of red pepper paste,

888
01:12:27,519 --> 01:12:30,105
and charbroiled it.

889
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:32,357
Is it not fragrant?

890
01:12:35,735 --> 01:12:36,945
This was deodeok?

891
01:12:39,948 --> 01:12:40,782
I did not know.

892
01:12:42,951 --> 01:12:46,204
Yul must have a dull palate.

893
01:12:46,996 --> 01:12:49,207
Right? Try savoring it.

894
01:12:54,212 --> 01:12:55,338
It has a strange smell.

895
01:12:59,634 --> 01:13:01,928
I truly appreciate your thoughtfulness.

896
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:04,472
But I cannot eat this anymore.

897
01:13:06,558 --> 01:13:08,893
I understand.

898
01:13:08,977 --> 01:13:11,521
It may not be to your liking.

899
01:13:11,604 --> 01:13:12,439
-Right.
-Right.

900
01:13:13,231 --> 01:13:15,859
Dang-gu and Uk can have the rest.

901
01:13:30,748 --> 01:13:33,293
I am delighted to see you three

902
01:13:33,376 --> 01:13:34,878
sitting before me once again.

903
01:13:36,588 --> 01:13:37,464
Cheers.

904
01:13:48,641 --> 01:13:50,393
-Eat up.
-Eat up.

905
01:13:55,565 --> 01:13:57,150
Park Dang-gu of Songrim is aware

906
01:13:57,233 --> 01:13:59,527
that we are preparing for a wedding?

907
01:14:00,111 --> 01:14:01,112
Yes, my lady.

908
01:14:01,196 --> 01:14:03,823
I heard that he kept asking
who the bride was.

909
01:14:07,702 --> 01:14:09,454
Since he does not know about Bu-yeon,

910
01:14:10,038 --> 01:14:11,915
we should tell him it is me.

911
01:14:19,339 --> 01:14:21,925
I loved you, Jin Cho-yeon.

912
01:14:24,177 --> 01:14:26,429
I hope you will be happy!

913
01:14:28,014 --> 01:14:32,101
I miss you so much…

914
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,021
I will tuck him in.

915
01:14:35,104 --> 01:14:35,939
-Sure.
-Jin Cho-yeon…

916
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:39,400
-I loved you, Jin Cho-yeon.
-Bye.

917
01:14:40,693 --> 01:14:43,905
I loved you so much…

918
01:14:43,988 --> 01:14:45,198
That poor kid.

919
01:14:46,241 --> 01:14:47,742
Seeing how drunk he is,

920
01:14:48,993 --> 01:14:52,330
Sang-ho must have been right
about a wedding happening in Jinyowon.

921
01:14:56,167 --> 01:14:59,128
There really is a wedding
taking place in Jinyowon?

922
01:14:59,712 --> 01:15:01,881
I heard they brought in wedding supplies.

923
01:15:02,924 --> 01:15:05,718
They locked their gate
and lay low for the past three years.

924
01:15:06,886 --> 01:15:10,139
I guess the wedding
will be held in secret as well.

925
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:15,979
Do you know who the bride is?

926
01:15:16,062 --> 01:15:17,230
Jin Cho-yeon, probably.

927
01:15:18,314 --> 01:15:21,234
She is the only daughter of the family.

928
01:15:22,735 --> 01:15:24,404
There is also the eldest daughter.

929
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:26,531
But she is dead.

930
01:15:27,115 --> 01:15:30,535
She was trying to retrieve
the ice stone that was sealed in the lake

931
01:15:30,618 --> 01:15:32,287
when the waters swept her away.

932
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:33,788
Her father came clean

933
01:15:34,998 --> 01:15:36,708
about everything before he died.

934
01:15:38,376 --> 01:15:40,795
Her death was such a waste.

935
01:15:41,379 --> 01:15:44,173
With the divine powers
she had at such a young age,

936
01:15:45,341 --> 01:15:48,011
she would have grown to be
as powerful as Jin Seol-ran,

937
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:50,054
the first leader of Jinyowon.

938
01:15:52,849 --> 01:15:53,683
If a priestess

939
01:15:55,143 --> 01:15:56,936
as powerful as Jin Seol-ran exists,

940
01:15:58,938 --> 01:16:01,316
will she be able
to extract the ice stone within me?

941
01:16:02,442 --> 01:16:03,651
If she can,

942
01:16:04,694 --> 01:16:05,945
would you extract it?

943
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:15,872
You are only alive thanks to that stone.

944
01:16:16,456 --> 01:16:17,457
You said the ice stone

945
01:16:18,291 --> 01:16:21,085
should be destroyed
since no human can control its power.

946
01:16:22,587 --> 01:16:23,421
Yes.

947
01:16:24,464 --> 01:16:25,465
You are right.

948
01:16:27,133 --> 01:16:28,134
It is too much for me…

949
01:16:30,386 --> 01:16:31,220
to handle.

950
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:38,227
Maidservant Kim told me

951
01:16:39,771 --> 01:16:42,899
that it was too painful to watch you live

952
01:16:42,982 --> 01:16:44,984
with a wounded heart.

953
01:16:46,611 --> 01:16:47,945
Is it still very painful?

954
01:16:50,490 --> 01:16:51,866
I should have died then.

955
01:16:52,492 --> 01:16:54,160
As a human,

956
01:16:55,536 --> 01:16:57,705
I should have died then and there.

957
01:16:58,289 --> 01:17:00,041
Do you think removing the ice stone

958
01:17:01,501 --> 01:17:04,295
would heal your wounded heart?

959
01:17:10,468 --> 01:17:13,346
But if you do that,

960
01:17:14,972 --> 01:17:15,890
you will die.

961
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:20,603
At least…

962
01:17:23,815 --> 01:17:26,693
I will lift the weight off my shoulders
and finally be at peace.

963
01:18:35,762 --> 01:18:36,763
Uncle Yun-o,

964
01:18:36,846 --> 01:18:38,014
you are getting married?

965
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:40,892
You never told me.

966
01:18:42,018 --> 01:18:45,062
It was meant to be a secret,
so I could not tell you.

967
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:50,485
I will be wedding the eldest daughter
of Jinyowon, Jin Bu-yeon.

968
01:18:58,367 --> 01:19:01,245
It is our tradition to have
the wedding at the groom's place

969
01:19:01,996 --> 01:19:04,040
and then return to Jinyowon with him.

970
01:19:12,924 --> 01:19:13,841
What is that?

971
01:19:14,926 --> 01:19:16,260
A petal?

972
01:19:17,178 --> 01:19:19,222
It came to me
when I was at my most desperate.

973
01:19:21,849 --> 01:19:23,351
I hope it will return.

974
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:30,024
I know you hate it,
but you should not run away again.

975
01:19:31,984 --> 01:19:32,819
I know.

976
01:19:33,736 --> 01:19:34,737
I am waiting.

977
01:19:35,404 --> 01:19:37,824
Waiting? For whom?

978
01:19:40,326 --> 01:19:41,452
My groom.

979
01:19:44,497 --> 01:19:47,416
Please come and take me away.

980
01:20:14,652 --> 01:20:16,654
The bride has left Jinyowon

981
01:20:17,363 --> 01:20:18,447
and will be here soon.

982
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:23,828
Is he the one Bu-yeon will wed tonight?

983
01:20:23,911 --> 01:20:24,745
Yes.

984
01:20:25,246 --> 01:20:27,456
He is the cousin
of General Seo of Seoho Fortress

985
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:28,541
and the Queen.

986
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:30,334
He lost his parents early

987
01:20:30,418 --> 01:20:32,295
and has no one to rely on.

988
01:20:33,629 --> 01:20:35,590
He needs our help,

989
01:20:36,382 --> 01:20:38,718
so I can be assured that he will do well.

990
01:20:43,014 --> 01:20:43,973
He will not be able

991
01:20:44,891 --> 01:20:47,268
to free my sister.

992
01:21:04,702 --> 01:21:06,078
I guess he will not come.

993
01:22:43,509 --> 01:22:44,343
I knew it.

994
01:22:45,177 --> 01:22:46,387
I knew you would come.

995
01:22:47,555 --> 01:22:48,973
You might be of some use.

996
01:22:49,557 --> 01:22:51,183
I told you I would be useful.

997
01:22:58,024 --> 01:22:59,275
Let us go.

998
01:22:59,358 --> 01:23:00,192
Sure.

999
01:23:04,947 --> 01:23:06,949
Let us go, my dear husband.

1000
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:16,310
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

1001
01:24:16,393 --> 01:24:19,271
You see, I remember nothing
before Jinyowon.

1002
01:24:20,147 --> 01:24:22,274
Search all of Songrim
and find Park Dang-gu.

1003
01:24:22,358 --> 01:24:24,568
I thought the wedding ceremony
was for Young Lady Jin.

1004
01:24:24,652 --> 01:24:28,197
Although I wanted to ruin the ceremony,
I did not.

1005
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,115
WHOEVER FINDS THIS LADY
WILL BE REWARDED GENEROUSLY

1006
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:31,826
The entire world ended up
finding out about Bu-yeon.

1007
01:24:32,368 --> 01:24:35,329
Were you going to ask her
to take out the ice stone for you?

1008
01:24:36,122 --> 01:24:38,999
Have we ever met before?

1009
01:24:39,959 --> 01:24:42,753
What is it that you need me for?

1010
01:24:43,254 --> 01:24:46,340
I just need your great divine powers.
That is why I need you.

1011
01:24:46,924 --> 01:24:51,679
