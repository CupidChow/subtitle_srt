1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
20 YEARS AGO

2
00:00:01,624 --> 00:00:03,293
My lady…

3
00:00:05,628 --> 00:00:07,505
My lady…

4
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:17,724
My lady…

5
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:23,772
I shall make Do-hwa mine.

6
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:26,483
If she bears a child,
know that it is mine.

7
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,282
My lady…

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,534
My lord.

9
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:38,203
Where are you going, my lord?

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,590
I heard about Do-hwa.

11
00:00:51,174 --> 00:00:52,801
We were just about to head over.

12
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:56,805
Why are you here
when you should be mourning her?

13
00:00:57,514 --> 00:01:00,558
I came here because this was
the only way to change his fate.

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,121
What are you doing?

15
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,149
What have you done?

16
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:51,276
I have blocked his gate of energy.

17
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,571
He will not be able
to learn any spells while he is alive.

18
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,161
I forbid anyone from opening
his gate of energy!

19
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:05,915
How could you do this to your son?

20
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:09,043
My son?

21
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:20,513
Why would he decide my own fate?

22
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:24,017
No one even considers him
as my true father anyway!

23
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:25,977
I will find someone.

24
00:02:26,603 --> 00:02:28,438
A master who will open my gate of energy

25
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,523
and teach me how to practice spells.

26
00:02:31,482 --> 00:02:33,318
I will find someone myself.

27
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:37,030
Then I will take out that sword
and break it in two.

28
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:46,039
I have met a total of 12 masters
and have been kicked out every time.

29
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:51,252
And finally, I have met the master
who will change my fate.

30
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:04,724
I knew the moment I saw you.

31
00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:07,852
You are my master.

32
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:22,283
Did you find something special about me,

33
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:23,409
Young Master?

34
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:28,248
I told you that you have beautiful eyes.

35
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:30,667
Right, sorry.
Only your eyes are beautiful.

36
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:34,837
The soul shifter's blue mark
has bloomed inside them.

37
00:03:36,589 --> 00:03:38,508
So the mark was inside my eyes.

38
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:44,180
You are going to fight me?

39
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:45,974
Killing you would be a breeze.

40
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:47,850
But this is Songrim.

41
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:50,019
You will get caught.

42
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:04,617
I am planning to save you.

43
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:07,745
You will not get caught
if you stay by my side.

44
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:23,928
How should you address me
if you want to lie low?

45
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:27,724
"Young Master."

46
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:41,904
Jang Uk?

47
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:43,781
Yes, it is me.

48
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:45,742
Why are you here?

49
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:50,538
And who is she?

50
00:04:51,914 --> 00:04:52,749
Right.

51
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:56,002
She is Mu-deok, my maid.

52
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:59,839
Mu-deok?

53
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:06,763
Yul, you startled her.
Can you put your blade down?

54
00:05:07,638 --> 00:05:08,765
Right.

55
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:13,519
Mu-deok, are you all right?

56
00:05:16,397 --> 00:05:17,440
Mu-deok.

57
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,819
I am fine, Young Master.

58
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:23,321
Good.

59
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,364
Uk?

60
00:05:26,157 --> 00:05:27,075
Hey.

61
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:30,995
Hold on. Why are you here?

62
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,624
I came to visit the leader.
We took refuge here after hearing a fight.

63
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,127
There were intruders.
You cannot even fight.

64
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:41,089
Jeez. Thank goodness
they did not spot you.

65
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:42,632
No.

66
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:45,051
It was wise of you to hide here.

67
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:48,346
My maid ran away,
so I just followed her, you…

68
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:49,680
Gosh, that hurts…

69
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:52,141
Who is she?

70
00:05:57,188 --> 00:05:58,523
What is with that blade?

71
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:06,072
You…

72
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:11,202
Were you trying to protect him with that?

73
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:13,955
I am proud of you.

74
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:17,333
That is right. Your young master
is extremely weak,

75
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,335
so you need to protect him.

76
00:06:21,504 --> 00:06:22,672
Of course.

77
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:24,966
I ought to protect my young master.

78
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:28,302
No, that is not true.

79
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:32,348
I should protect you instead.

80
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:35,143
What is with the strong grip?

81
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:36,978
Let go.

82
00:06:45,027 --> 00:06:48,573
Mu-deok! You should not glare like that!

83
00:06:49,282 --> 00:06:50,491
You should look down.

84
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:55,371
Yes, Young Master.

85
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:58,916
So you were the one who ran away from me.

86
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,334
Mu-deok, was it?

87
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:02,795
I am sorry to have startled you.

88
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:16,684
Are you injured?

89
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,573
Mu-deok.

90
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:33,951
I am fine, Young Master.

91
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:39,040
-Has the dust settled?
-No.

92
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:40,291
It is still chaotic.

93
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,835
Soul Shifter Naksu's body
has gone missing.

94
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,797
I knew it. They were the Danju's men.

95
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:49,509
Now, I just need
to get out of here safely.

96
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:51,969
What a pity.

97
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,971
The soul shifter.

98
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:56,098
Naksu, the Shadow Assassin.

99
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,895
I was always curious about how she looked.

100
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:05,316
He knows who I am.

101
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,652
I must kill him before I leave.

102
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:15,368
They must have broken
the pine forest barrier and gone out.

103
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:30,466
So they broke the barrier.

104
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,885
-We will go after them.
-It is too late.

105
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:36,931
Only those of Songrim
can break the barrier.

106
00:08:38,057 --> 00:08:39,809
There is a spy among us.

107
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,729
We must ask the Jin family for help.

108
00:08:50,403 --> 00:08:53,489
Naksu's body was in this secret room.

109
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:57,994
Uk, did you notice anything suspicious
while hiding in Jeongjingak?

110
00:08:58,077 --> 00:08:59,620
Suspicious?

111
00:08:59,704 --> 00:09:02,456
No. I was only watching Mu-deok.

112
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:10,464
Do you think Naksu shifted her soul
into another woman's body

113
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:11,966
and came to retrieve her body?

114
00:09:15,845 --> 00:09:18,264
Can women only shift souls
to the same gender?

115
00:09:18,347 --> 00:09:19,473
Not really.

116
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:23,144
But for everything to go smoothly,
I heard they should pick someone similar.

117
00:09:23,227 --> 00:09:26,022
Gender, age, and build.
They all need to be similar.

118
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,525
I am only asking
because I have not seen her.

119
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:33,654
Was Naksu thin with short limbs?

120
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:36,407
Did she have a round face
like Mu-deok right here?

121
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,326
What the hell is his problem?

122
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:44,457
If that was the case,
she would not have been nicknamed "Naksu".

123
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,416
Look at her.

124
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,961
What kind of an assassin
looks this adorable?

125
00:09:49,837 --> 00:09:50,838
You are right.

126
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:53,174
I bet she was a monster.

127
00:09:53,257 --> 00:09:55,426
No, she was human.

128
00:09:57,303 --> 00:10:00,348
Let us not belittle the dead,
even if she was an assassin.

129
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,314
Master Heo Yeom wants to see you.

130
00:10:08,397 --> 00:10:10,358
Go without me. He dislikes me anyway.

131
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:12,151
Right. Being here would be safer.

132
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:13,402
Let us go.

133
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:26,624
The body was frozen here.

134
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:30,503
Seeing how there is no rotting smell,
your body must still be fine.

135
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:33,506
Naksu.

136
00:10:35,132 --> 00:10:36,300
That is right.

137
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:39,470
I am the Shadow Assassin.

138
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:43,474
Naksu.

139
00:10:48,187 --> 00:10:50,398
I thought long and hard
about why you helped me.

140
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,485
Did the Danju send you too?

141
00:10:54,568 --> 00:10:56,987
No. No one sent me here.

142
00:10:57,071 --> 00:10:58,989
Then why did you help me?

143
00:10:59,073 --> 00:11:02,451
I already told you,
but I guess you did not get the message.

144
00:11:05,204 --> 00:11:06,539
You have beautiful eyes.

145
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:08,541
Do not tell me

146
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:11,085
you really fell for me.

147
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:14,422
Do not laugh.

148
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:17,174
That is the only thing that makes sense.

149
00:11:17,258 --> 00:11:19,176
I do admit repeatedly calling you pretty.

150
00:11:20,177 --> 00:11:22,012
But it was because I desired something.

151
00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:23,806
Which was?

152
00:11:24,473 --> 00:11:28,769
I have been searching for someone who
can break this spell to call my master.

153
00:11:29,562 --> 00:11:31,021
And then, I found you.

154
00:11:33,023 --> 00:11:34,108
Naksu.

155
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,861
I want you to be my master.

156
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:53,919
I heard.

157
00:11:54,003 --> 00:11:56,046
You borrowed
the Jin family's ghost Sapsali?

158
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,089
Yes, my lord.

159
00:11:57,673 --> 00:12:01,135
Are you certain that thing is in Songrim?

160
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:02,303
I am.

161
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:07,057
A soul shifter is lurking within Songrim.

162
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,522
The son of Jang Gang of Songrim

163
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:16,066
is asking me, an assassin,
to be his master?

164
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:19,487
What original nonsense.

165
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:24,617
You will open your pupil's gate of energy
and help him master spells.

166
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:28,037
As your pupil,
I will keep you safe and hidden.

167
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,457
We could form a beautiful relationship
where we benefit from each other.

168
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,417
-Not interested.
-If you do not want to be my master,

169
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:35,211
you could be my wife instead.

170
00:12:35,294 --> 00:12:36,587
-Would you like that?
-Shut it.

171
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:40,216
I heard you visited many masters
and got kicked out every time.

172
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:42,259
Was it because you were this stubborn?

173
00:12:46,222 --> 00:12:49,558
I could not threaten my former masters
since they had no weakness.

174
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:53,896
But you have a pretty big one.

175
00:12:57,107 --> 00:12:59,443
You cannot get out of here alive
without my help.

176
00:13:00,194 --> 00:13:02,112
You will die if they find out who you are.

177
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,156
Is that so?

178
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,450
In that case,

179
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,205
I will just kill you.

180
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,585
How merciless. After all, I helped you.

181
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:19,630
Sorry that I am so merciless
for such a cute face.

182
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:31,141
I brought you to our house
with the Jade Plaque

183
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:33,852
and to Songrim with the Spirit Plaque.

184
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:36,730
And now, look where we are.

185
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,115
This is Songrim's secret room.

186
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:50,536
Once that door closes, we can only get out
if someone opens from the outside.

187
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,372
We are locked in here together.

188
00:13:55,624 --> 00:13:56,792
Do not move!

189
00:13:57,293 --> 00:13:59,879
Step on the wrong spot,
and the ground will cave in.

190
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:07,303
Kill me, and you will be killed
by the Songrim mages who will enter.

191
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:10,764
But if you agree to be my master,
we will get out of this unscathed.

192
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:17,271
I do not have the strength
to break his gate of energy right now.

193
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:19,648
He will catch wind of it if I stay here.

194
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:21,275
I need my sword.

195
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:24,612
I have become weak due to shifting souls.

196
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:27,531
I need my sword's energy
to open your gate of energy.

197
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:29,241
Without that,

198
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:32,536
there is nothing I can do in here.

199
00:14:33,662 --> 00:14:35,122
To retrieve my sword,

200
00:14:36,498 --> 00:14:37,708
I need to go out there.

201
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:38,918
So stop that.

202
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,463
Did you not hear me?

203
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:45,633
I cannot do that. I need to wait
until it fully closes first.

204
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:49,470
You! You lied, did you not?

205
00:14:52,598 --> 00:14:53,807
Do not move!

206
00:14:53,891 --> 00:14:56,060
-If you do, the ground will cave in!
-Wait!

207
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:00,773
Grab tightly! You are slipping!

208
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:04,276
-Where is your face touching?
-Shut it!

209
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,070
-Hey!
-Hey!

210
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:07,112
You little…

211
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:10,532
-That hurts!
-It was not intentional.

212
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:12,743
-It hurts!
-Just wait.

213
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:14,203
Let me go.

214
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,252
By the way, how will we find your sword?

215
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:25,130
I know who took it. I can find it.

216
00:15:26,423 --> 00:15:28,342
It is too dangerous to get out of Songrim.

217
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:30,052
We need to stay inside.

218
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:33,263
Does it have to be that specific sword?

219
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:35,140
Get another sword with that energy
and do it here.

220
00:15:35,224 --> 00:15:37,351
I cannot. It has to be mine.

221
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:40,104
Let us go out and find it.

222
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:44,191
I will lure him out and then kill him.

223
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:47,277
You said you became weak.

224
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,533
I thought you were pretending
to be clumsy.

225
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:55,077
How weak have you become?

226
00:15:58,163 --> 00:15:59,581
The mages are coming.

227
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:00,708
Stay alert.

228
00:16:03,585 --> 00:16:06,547
Why would I? They are on my side.

229
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:10,551
Taking sides?
Are you seriously that childish?

230
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:12,469
Why are you talking casually
in this situation?

231
00:16:12,553 --> 00:16:13,762
Fine, Young Master.

232
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:15,097
I will look down.

233
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:16,974
Look at you.

234
00:16:24,231 --> 00:16:25,274
Who is she?

235
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:29,111
I am Mu-deok, his maid.

236
00:16:31,613 --> 00:16:33,615
You heard her, right? She is my maid.

237
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:35,909
You all seem busy. Go on, then.

238
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:38,412
-Let us go, Mu-deok.
-You may not leave.

239
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:44,084
The leader ordered everyone
to gather at the Training Center.

240
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,838
I am not a member of Songrim.

241
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:50,174
He wants every living thing
within these walls

242
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,052
to gather there.

243
00:17:01,643 --> 00:17:03,145
-Uk.
-Hey.

244
00:17:05,064 --> 00:17:07,483
What is going on?
Why are we gathered here?

245
00:17:08,025 --> 00:17:10,652
They are going to catch
Naksu's men who are in here.

246
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:14,073
Naksu?

247
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,043
One of you

248
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:29,004
has helped Naksu's men
who sneaked in here today.

249
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:30,839
My lord.

250
00:17:30,923 --> 00:17:34,093
Everyone here knows each other.

251
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:37,805
On the outside,
you all look like those of Songrim.

252
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:41,975
That is why I asked someone for help.

253
00:17:43,185 --> 00:17:46,438
Lady Jin Cho-yeon of the Jin family
has brought Gwigu.

254
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:23,142
Hello, my lady.

255
00:18:37,114 --> 00:18:39,241
Why is Jang Uk here?

256
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:41,368
I am not sure.

257
00:18:52,004 --> 00:18:54,965
That must be Gwigu,
the Jin family's heirloom.

258
00:18:55,048 --> 00:18:56,091
Gwigu?

259
00:18:56,675 --> 00:18:57,968
-As in a dog?
-Yes.

260
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:00,762
It is a ghost Sapsali
that detects sorcery.

261
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,476
There is

262
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:08,812
a soul shifter among us.

263
00:19:10,272 --> 00:19:14,359
And Gwigu will find that individual.

264
00:19:15,027 --> 00:19:17,654
They look like one of us on the outside.

265
00:19:17,738 --> 00:19:21,116
But Gwigu will find the one
who has a different soul within them.

266
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:29,041
Close all the doors.

267
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:30,000
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

268
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:39,134
Whoever tries to leave this building

269
00:19:39,218 --> 00:19:42,471
will be considered a spy and killed.

270
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:45,057
You may begin.

271
00:20:46,326 --> 00:20:49,830
The alchemy of souls, a type of sorcery,
has one weakness.

272
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:51,873
There is a gap
between the body and the soul.

273
00:20:51,957 --> 00:20:54,376
The evil energy seeps out from it.

274
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:56,837
And Gwigu can detect that.

275
00:21:25,574 --> 00:21:28,577
Uk, feign ignorance even if I get caught.

276
00:21:30,996 --> 00:21:33,123
-Is this loyalty?
-It is my duty.

277
00:21:39,296 --> 00:21:41,757
I do not want to become a laughingstock

278
00:21:42,424 --> 00:21:44,384
once they find out I asked you for help.

279
00:21:44,468 --> 00:21:45,969
Stay right by my side.

280
00:21:47,137 --> 00:21:50,807
No one here will let that thing attack me.

281
00:22:21,922 --> 00:22:23,298
He is a soul shifter! Get him!

282
00:23:51,928 --> 00:23:55,015
I heard soul shifters get petrified
when they run wild and lose their energy.

283
00:23:55,098 --> 00:23:56,308
It was true.

284
00:24:24,878 --> 00:24:27,339
We thank you for your great help.

285
00:24:28,715 --> 00:24:30,967
I am sure one day
we will ask you for help too.

286
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:36,723
I see that Daeho's four families
have all gathered here.

287
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:38,892
I heard you are called the Four Seasons.

288
00:24:39,476 --> 00:24:42,646
Seeing you all together makes me happy.

289
00:24:43,396 --> 00:24:45,106
We used to gather often,

290
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,401
but it is our first time after Uk
and Cho-yeon called off their wedding.

291
00:24:49,903 --> 00:24:51,279
You little…

292
00:24:51,863 --> 00:24:54,324
I told them to prepare some tea
in the reception room.

293
00:24:54,407 --> 00:24:55,617
Please come.

294
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,084
You were here as well.

295
00:25:04,793 --> 00:25:06,878
I heard you were kicked out of Gisan.

296
00:25:06,962 --> 00:25:08,505
Right.

297
00:25:09,422 --> 00:25:12,217
You should stop
keeping track of what I am doing.

298
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,889
Everyone was talking about
how you got kicked out yet again.

299
00:25:17,973 --> 00:25:19,516
I just happened to hear it.

300
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:20,934
I see.

301
00:25:21,977 --> 00:25:24,854
Our precious guest here
seems uncomfortable around me,

302
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:26,314
so let me excuse myself.

303
00:25:29,776 --> 00:25:31,027
What a scumbag.

304
00:25:32,904 --> 00:25:33,947
Let us go.

305
00:25:36,157 --> 00:25:37,242
Let us go.

306
00:25:49,254 --> 00:25:51,673
Hey, excuse me.

307
00:25:52,757 --> 00:25:54,718
Did you see my maid?

308
00:25:55,302 --> 00:25:57,929
She is short, thin, and has a round face.

309
00:25:58,013 --> 00:25:59,306
Darn it.

310
00:26:00,181 --> 00:26:01,808
Where did she go?

311
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,646
The spy the Danju had sent here
was a soul shifter.

312
00:26:08,315 --> 00:26:09,983
I must find the Danju.

313
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,538
You were not loyal,
but you said you knew your duties.

314
00:26:24,122 --> 00:26:26,041
Can you say the same thing about this?

315
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,544
That is exactly
why I am leaving you behind.

316
00:26:29,627 --> 00:26:32,047
My original plan
was to take you with me and kill you.

317
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,089
I see.

318
00:26:33,882 --> 00:26:35,258
How evil.

319
00:26:35,342 --> 00:26:39,012
I am not the round-faced Mu-deok,
your loyal maid.

320
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:42,891
You are Naksu. The merciless assassin.

321
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,313
You had the chance to kill me
when I was bathing.

322
00:26:48,396 --> 00:26:50,607
I even risked my life
bringing you here with me.

323
00:26:51,858 --> 00:26:53,985
It is up to you
whether to still kill me now

324
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:57,030
or become my master
after opening my gate of energy.

325
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:06,623
By the way, you have the habit
of glaring at others.

326
00:27:06,706 --> 00:27:08,958
Keep doing that, and you will get caught.

327
00:27:10,085 --> 00:27:12,253
Can you see the mark
from where you are at?

328
00:27:13,671 --> 00:27:14,714
No.

329
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:18,593
What about now?

330
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:22,847
I can see it since I know already.

331
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:25,975
And now?

332
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,110
I can definitely see it.

333
00:27:35,193 --> 00:27:37,862
But I doubt you will be
this up-close with someone often.

334
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,407
Just be careful when you kiss someone.

335
00:27:42,742 --> 00:27:44,619
Come on. I am just helping you out.

336
00:27:44,702 --> 00:27:47,163
Anyone who came that close to me
died in my hands.

337
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:51,042
You could die tonight.

338
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:53,628
It is the ghost Sapsali.

339
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:02,595
If that thing attacks you,

340
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:04,472
will you turn to stone like that guy?

341
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:07,517
Run.

342
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:10,729
I will try to save you.

343
00:29:33,561 --> 00:29:35,188
Gwigu's pottery.

344
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:37,398
It was our family heirloom.

345
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:41,611
I just wanted to take a look at it.

346
00:29:41,694 --> 00:29:44,781
But what kind of an heirloom
is this fragile?

347
00:29:44,864 --> 00:29:46,199
Jang Uk!

348
00:29:49,911 --> 00:29:51,663
We need to talk. Come here.

349
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,414
Uk.

350
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:56,584
Uk.

351
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:01,631
Hey, Uk. Jang Uk!

352
00:30:06,344 --> 00:30:07,428
Uk!

353
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:09,848
Uk!

354
00:30:10,473 --> 00:30:11,808
Jang Uk!

355
00:30:12,392 --> 00:30:13,768
Darn it!

356
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:16,062
Uk!

357
00:30:17,272 --> 00:30:18,314
Gather all the pieces

358
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:20,608
since I will have to
put them back together.

359
00:30:20,692 --> 00:30:21,985
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

360
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:38,501
Jeez.

361
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:40,962
That is the work of your young master.

362
00:30:42,672 --> 00:30:45,341
So that is how he saved me.

363
00:30:45,425 --> 00:30:46,509
Gosh, that kid.

364
00:30:46,593 --> 00:30:49,137
Last year, he broke off the engagement
with the Jin family.

365
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,639
This time, he broke their heirloom.

366
00:30:51,723 --> 00:30:53,975
-Engagement?
-Yes.

367
00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:57,061
He called off the wedding with her.

368
00:30:57,729 --> 00:31:01,274
He got kicked out 12 times,
broke off a wedding, and now, an heirloom.

369
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:02,817
What a disaster.

370
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,280
What will you do about him?

371
00:31:08,197 --> 00:31:09,365
Where is he?

372
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:11,284
He got dragged away.

373
00:31:11,951 --> 00:31:15,288
I am afraid he will face
severe punishment this time.

374
00:31:22,712 --> 00:31:25,214
I sent you to Gisan.

375
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:28,509
Then you were kicked out
in less than six months.

376
00:31:29,344 --> 00:31:31,095
Why did you come here tonight?

377
00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:34,223
I heard you were troubled by the news,
so I came to apologize.

378
00:31:34,807 --> 00:31:36,184
Is this how you apologize?

379
00:31:38,811 --> 00:31:41,689
Why did you break the pottery?

380
00:31:41,773 --> 00:31:44,484
I was fascinated by it
and wanted to take a look,

381
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:46,736
but it slipped out of my hands.

382
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:49,364
Had I learned spells,
that would not have happened.

383
00:31:49,447 --> 00:31:50,907
I guess I lack the teachings.

384
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,575
Jang Uk!

385
00:31:54,243 --> 00:31:56,079
He also tampered

386
00:31:56,162 --> 00:31:58,331
with the door of the secret room
and damaged it.

387
00:31:58,831 --> 00:32:01,960
He definitely did that on purpose.
He is just jealous.

388
00:32:02,752 --> 00:32:05,838
I will not let it slide this time around.

389
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:09,968
Until I say so, I forbid Jang Uk

390
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:13,721
from moving or talking.

391
00:32:15,056 --> 00:32:16,349
Repent.

392
00:32:35,576 --> 00:32:36,577
Do not worry.

393
00:32:38,037 --> 00:32:39,914
He will not punish him for too long.

394
00:32:41,457 --> 00:32:43,960
He almost died of a cold
after he was punished

395
00:32:44,043 --> 00:32:45,169
all night long one day.

396
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:49,382
Uk's gate of energy is opened
just enough to keep him alive.

397
00:32:49,465 --> 00:32:52,051
So extreme cold or heat
can be life-threatening.

398
00:32:52,844 --> 00:32:54,053
He cannot recover when he falls ill.

399
00:32:54,637 --> 00:32:58,516
Then open his gate of energy for him.
He desperately wants it.

400
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:00,852
You are his friends.

401
00:33:01,894 --> 00:33:03,771
We are still too weak to do that.

402
00:33:05,106 --> 00:33:06,566
But no one in Songrim…

403
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:10,278
No. No one in Daeho is allowed to do that.

404
00:33:15,491 --> 00:33:18,619
Then he is already being punished
for his entire lifetime.

405
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:55,364
You are allowed to have a hot cup of tea.

406
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,036
Young Master.

407
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:03,581
I will go first and leave you behind.

408
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:06,542
You are leaving without me?

409
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:16,385
You are loyal and know your duties.

410
00:34:17,261 --> 00:34:19,639
That is why you took me in,
brought me here,

411
00:34:20,723 --> 00:34:22,892
and protected me.

412
00:34:23,976 --> 00:34:27,271
You must know very well
that you cannot tell that to anyone.

413
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,662
I will be safe thanks to you.

414
00:34:53,673 --> 00:34:56,676
The people I have met so far
only wanted me dead.

415
00:34:57,969 --> 00:34:59,846
You are the first person

416
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:02,849
who tried to save me.

417
00:35:09,188 --> 00:35:11,816
Even if we meet again
and come this close to each other,

418
00:35:12,441 --> 00:35:13,985
I will spare you.

419
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:13,961
I will send a gift of apology to Gisan

420
00:36:14,045 --> 00:36:18,216
and pay the Jin family a hefty sum
for what he did.

421
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:22,220
Uk made too many mistakes this time.

422
00:36:23,763 --> 00:36:25,473
I had no choice but to punish him.

423
00:36:25,556 --> 00:36:27,391
I am glad you punished him.

424
00:36:28,476 --> 00:36:31,771
Since you have done enough,
I will take him home now.

425
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:33,689
Sure.

426
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:36,525
Thank you.

427
00:36:42,448 --> 00:36:45,534
-Are you all right?
-No, I am not.

428
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:49,747
Did Mu-deok stop by our place?

429
00:36:50,331 --> 00:36:52,333
Why would she?

430
00:36:53,209 --> 00:36:56,879
Speaking of which, where did she go
while you were being punished?

431
00:36:57,505 --> 00:36:58,589
Forget it.

432
00:37:01,884 --> 00:37:04,762
By the way, why did you tamper
with the secret room?

433
00:37:05,846 --> 00:37:07,431
The stone door will not close.

434
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:09,433
I do not know.

435
00:37:12,311 --> 00:37:14,814
-Why did you break the pottery?
-I do not…

436
00:37:16,816 --> 00:37:18,401
I said I do not know.

437
00:37:19,026 --> 00:37:20,361
Stop asking me.

438
00:37:30,454 --> 00:37:32,373
Here are the firecrackers you wanted.

439
00:37:32,456 --> 00:37:34,500
They will be able to see them
from miles away.

440
00:37:37,545 --> 00:37:38,671
All right.

441
00:37:39,672 --> 00:37:42,633
Why does Young Master Jang want them?

442
00:37:42,717 --> 00:37:45,094
Rumor has it that
he was punished severely.

443
00:37:45,177 --> 00:37:46,679
So what is he scheming this time?

444
00:37:48,681 --> 00:37:49,682
It is a secret.

445
00:37:50,558 --> 00:37:52,351
Do not tell anyone about this, okay?

446
00:37:54,145 --> 00:37:55,396
Ju-wol.

447
00:37:57,273 --> 00:37:59,317
He should lie low for now.

448
00:38:06,073 --> 00:38:07,450
This is Songrim's Spirit Plaque.

449
00:38:08,034 --> 00:38:09,910
Are you free to enter there?

450
00:38:09,994 --> 00:38:12,163
Your young master must really trust you.

451
00:38:12,913 --> 00:38:14,999
This is such a precious item.

452
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:17,626
He wants me to sell it.

453
00:38:18,544 --> 00:38:21,213
You cannot sell
something like this that easily.

454
00:38:21,297 --> 00:38:22,298
Is that so?

455
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,134
He said I would be able
to sell it somewhere.

456
00:38:25,718 --> 00:38:26,761
But then again,

457
00:38:26,844 --> 00:38:30,222
there is a merchant
who purchases black market goods.

458
00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:34,226
But it will not be easy to hook you up.

459
00:38:40,733 --> 00:38:42,860
You will be getting a hefty sum.

460
00:38:42,943 --> 00:38:44,862
Can I have another chicken?

461
00:38:44,945 --> 00:38:47,531
Sure. I will put it on
your young master's tab.

462
00:38:47,615 --> 00:38:49,533
Eat up. Eat lots.

463
00:38:56,791 --> 00:39:01,087
Naksu's body may be here,
but her soul lives on in another body.

464
00:39:01,962 --> 00:39:05,883
You will also be given new bodies
through the alchemy of souls.

465
00:39:05,966 --> 00:39:10,346
So do not be afraid
to sacrifice yourselves for me.

466
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:11,597
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

467
00:39:31,742 --> 00:39:32,660
Fire!

468
00:39:51,345 --> 00:39:52,847
I need my sword.

469
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,974
I have become weak due to shifting souls.

470
00:39:55,683 --> 00:39:58,602
I need my sword's energy
to open your gate of energy.

471
00:39:58,686 --> 00:40:01,313
Even if we meet again
and come this close to each other,

472
00:40:01,897 --> 00:40:03,399
I will spare you.

473
00:40:08,195 --> 00:40:10,656
-I have no appetite.
-Young Master Jang.

474
00:40:12,867 --> 00:40:14,660
Young Master Jang, they caught them.

475
00:40:15,244 --> 00:40:17,913
-Mu-deok?
-Why would anyone catch her?

476
00:40:18,914 --> 00:40:21,041
Never mind.

477
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:22,835
Jin Mu, the Assistant Gwanju
of Cheonbugwan,

478
00:40:22,918 --> 00:40:25,337
caught Naksu's men who raided Songrim.

479
00:40:25,963 --> 00:40:26,964
Really?

480
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:33,429
Jin Mu brought the bodies
of Naksu's men into the palace.

481
00:40:33,512 --> 00:40:35,639
We were the ones who caught Naksu.

482
00:40:35,723 --> 00:40:38,517
So I am worried
we will become a laughingstock.

483
00:40:38,601 --> 00:40:41,604
Is it true that he spared

484
00:40:42,146 --> 00:40:43,814
none of the men?

485
00:40:43,898 --> 00:40:45,399
He killed them all.

486
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:49,737
We have no way to track
the source of the alchemy of souls.

487
00:40:51,864 --> 00:40:54,200
Jin Ho-gyeong of Jinyowon is here too.

488
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,457
I heard Jin Mu,
the Assistant Gwanju of Cheonbugwan,

489
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,335
caught the assassins
that Songrim could not.

490
00:41:05,169 --> 00:41:08,172
How did they break
Songrim's barrier twice?

491
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,262
There was a soul shifter spy
inside Songrim.

492
00:41:15,346 --> 00:41:18,641
Thankfully, the Jin family's Gwigu
caught him.

493
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,893
Gwigu?

494
00:41:20,976 --> 00:41:22,853
I would like to see it too.

495
00:41:22,937 --> 00:41:25,231
I am afraid I cannot show you right now.

496
00:41:25,314 --> 00:41:28,150
They made the mistake
of accidentally breaking it.

497
00:41:29,235 --> 00:41:31,487
How could you make such a foolish mistake?

498
00:41:32,947 --> 00:41:34,198
My apologies, Your Majesty.

499
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:39,411
Since Jin Mu made this contribution,
I summoned you all to tell you

500
00:41:39,495 --> 00:41:41,747
that I am considering
promoting him to Gwanju.

501
00:41:42,957 --> 00:41:44,208
That is not right.

502
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:47,002
Jang Gang is still the current Gwanju.

503
00:41:47,086 --> 00:41:50,089
For he was given the robe
and the sword by the late king,

504
00:41:50,172 --> 00:41:52,049
Jang Gang is the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan.

505
00:41:52,633 --> 00:41:55,302
Furthermore, he has a son, Jang Uk.

506
00:41:55,386 --> 00:41:56,220
Jang Gang…

507
00:41:57,054 --> 00:41:58,430
has been away for decades

508
00:41:58,514 --> 00:42:00,140
using his training as an excuse.

509
00:42:00,224 --> 00:42:03,269
His son, Jang Uk,
physically cannot learn spells.

510
00:42:03,352 --> 00:42:05,354
Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu has been the one

511
00:42:06,522 --> 00:42:07,606
to fill in for him.

512
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:11,735
Your Majesty, the dark soul-related spell

513
00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:15,197
is forbidden sorcery among mages.

514
00:42:15,281 --> 00:42:17,408
And Songrim has always been the one

515
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,785
to keep this under control.

516
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:23,872
Songrim could have gotten to the bottom
of this soul shifter incident

517
00:42:23,956 --> 00:42:25,416
and gotten rid of it all.

518
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:30,921
But Jin Mu
killed every single one of them.

519
00:42:32,047 --> 00:42:34,508
He actually ruined everything.

520
00:42:34,592 --> 00:42:36,218
Are you unhappy

521
00:42:37,052 --> 00:42:39,888
that Cheonbugwan took the credit?

522
00:42:39,972 --> 00:42:42,099
Songrim was the one who caught Naksu!

523
00:42:42,182 --> 00:42:44,059
And you took credit for it!

524
00:42:46,395 --> 00:42:48,314
We are not here to discuss that.

525
00:42:50,816 --> 00:42:54,486
As for the Gwanju position,
we will hold a mage meeting

526
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,573
and make a decision
once Jang Gang returns.

527
00:42:58,574 --> 00:43:01,702
Please grant him a different reward.

528
00:43:05,205 --> 00:43:06,457
Jin Mu.

529
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:10,210
Tell me what you desire.

530
00:43:13,088 --> 00:43:15,007
The people are troubled by this sorcery.

531
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,509
Allow me to burn
Naksu's body in front of Cheonbugwan.

532
00:43:17,593 --> 00:43:18,761
As for Naksu's sword…

533
00:43:19,845 --> 00:43:23,182
Allow us to keep it
since Songrim has lost it once already.

534
00:43:26,602 --> 00:43:28,312
You may do that.

535
00:43:37,529 --> 00:43:41,700
The best swords of the mages
have always been stored

536
00:43:41,784 --> 00:43:44,536
in the Sword Room of Jeongjingak.

537
00:43:45,663 --> 00:43:48,082
But things have changed
after that incident.

538
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:51,710
Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan took Naksu's sword?

539
00:43:51,794 --> 00:43:55,381
Yes. He will burn Naksu's body there too.

540
00:43:55,464 --> 00:43:58,050
She will be there to witness
her body getting burned.

541
00:43:58,133 --> 00:43:59,176
Who?

542
00:43:59,259 --> 00:44:00,177
Naksu?

543
00:44:00,928 --> 00:44:03,138
Do you still think
Naksu has switched souls?

544
00:44:04,306 --> 00:44:06,809
Are you serious
about accepting Naksu as your master?

545
00:44:07,976 --> 00:44:09,103
Forget it.

546
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,355
Pour me some more tea.

547
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:17,277
You can do that yourself,

548
00:44:17,361 --> 00:44:18,904
lazybones.

549
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,284
Where is your maid, Mu-deok?

550
00:44:25,661 --> 00:44:29,456
I will find her.
But first, I need that sword.

551
00:44:36,547 --> 00:44:39,133
Seeing how he got rid
of everything that was mine,

552
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:42,219
he must think I failed
to switch souls and died.

553
00:44:43,762 --> 00:44:46,640
I cannot look for the Danju
since I do not know who he is.

554
00:44:55,274 --> 00:44:58,026
Find the merchant
who is selling a drawn Spirit Plaque,

555
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,528
and you will find me.

556
00:45:00,112 --> 00:45:01,405
I will be waiting.

557
00:45:24,136 --> 00:45:25,596
That is Danhyanggok.

558
00:45:28,724 --> 00:45:32,227
CHEONBUGWAN

559
00:45:32,311 --> 00:45:34,021
I am here for Naksu's sword.

560
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,023
Why would you?

561
00:45:36,106 --> 00:45:39,151
I heard His Majesty allowed
Cheonbugwan to keep it.

562
00:45:39,234 --> 00:45:42,738
Since Jang Gang is the Gwanju,
it is right for his family to keep it.

563
00:45:42,821 --> 00:45:44,072
Since your father is not here,

564
00:45:44,156 --> 00:45:46,492
it is only right that
the Assistant Gwanju keeps it.

565
00:45:49,953 --> 00:45:53,540
Since my father is not here,
I, his son, should keep it.

566
00:45:58,253 --> 00:46:00,672
I heard you are searching everywhere
for your master.

567
00:46:01,423 --> 00:46:03,133
I would like to take you in myself.

568
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,512
But I cannot defy your father's commands
since he was my master once.

569
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:11,266
Why did he close
his own son's gate of energy?

570
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:14,186
I just cannot fathom it.

571
00:46:18,857 --> 00:46:21,276
The mage's energy
flows through this sword.

572
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,447
Someone as ordinary as you
will not be able to unsheathe it.

573
00:46:49,179 --> 00:46:50,973
Are you afraid I will do it?

574
00:46:53,892 --> 00:46:56,478
If I unsheathe it,
I will be qualified as the next Gwanju.

575
00:46:56,562 --> 00:46:59,439
meaning you will be disqualified
from getting that position.

576
00:47:04,861 --> 00:47:05,904
Do not worry.

577
00:47:06,697 --> 00:47:08,073
I cannot unsheathe it for now.

578
00:47:20,002 --> 00:47:21,211
"For now"?

579
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:27,759
I saw firecrackers
coming from Danhyanggok.

580
00:47:27,843 --> 00:47:29,678
Are you sure it was Danhyanggok?

581
00:47:29,761 --> 00:47:30,596
Yes, my lord.

582
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:33,223
They came from the valley,
Naksu's former home.

583
00:47:53,243 --> 00:47:54,870
I am looking for the one
with the Spirit Plaque.

584
00:48:04,338 --> 00:48:06,131
Ma'am, they are here.

585
00:48:10,927 --> 00:48:12,679
I guess someone wants to buy it.

586
00:48:18,268 --> 00:48:20,103
The very last room, please.

587
00:48:26,026 --> 00:48:27,819
How could you lose it?

588
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,280
I did not lose it. Someone stole it.

589
00:48:30,364 --> 00:48:31,865
I am certain it was Ae-hyang.

590
00:48:34,326 --> 00:48:36,328
Are you the one who brought this?

591
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,083
I am here to buy the Spirit Plaque.

592
00:48:41,917 --> 00:48:43,460
You have come to the right person.

593
00:48:50,717 --> 00:48:52,511
She is no longer useful.

594
00:48:52,594 --> 00:48:54,429
Kill her to avoid further problems.

595
00:49:06,858 --> 00:49:07,776
You know me, right?

596
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:10,070
I told you to let me know
if someone brought that drawing.

597
00:49:10,737 --> 00:49:11,571
And I did.

598
00:49:12,322 --> 00:49:14,533
She is meeting them upstairs.

599
00:49:15,409 --> 00:49:17,661
So it was Ae-hyang.

600
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:24,459
We are mages from Cheonbugwan.

601
00:49:25,043 --> 00:49:28,255
We just caught a thief.
You can mind your own business.

602
00:49:34,469 --> 00:49:35,637
He killed her.

603
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,223
He thought it was me.

604
00:50:07,419 --> 00:50:09,588
The Danju has cut me off.

605
00:50:36,948 --> 00:50:39,242
Is that truly you?

606
00:50:43,955 --> 00:50:46,041
-Begin.
-Yes, my lord.

607
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:15,028
Cheonbugwan caught Naksu
when Songrim failed?

608
00:51:15,111 --> 00:51:17,489
Songrim was pretty much humiliated.

609
00:51:17,572 --> 00:51:20,992
The Assistant Gwanju is over there.

610
00:51:21,076 --> 00:51:22,035
You are right.

611
00:51:38,218 --> 00:51:40,220
So the Danju was Jin Mu,

612
00:51:40,303 --> 00:51:43,974
the Assistant Gwanju
of the royal Cheonbugwan.

613
00:51:56,278 --> 00:51:58,113
I am burning.

614
00:51:59,614 --> 00:52:03,952
Just like how my house
and parents burned on that day.

615
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,043
I will give you power.

616
00:52:12,127 --> 00:52:13,837
Will you come with me?

617
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,209
Young Master Jang.

618
00:52:54,169 --> 00:52:56,755
As you can see, there is nothing I can do

619
00:52:57,547 --> 00:52:59,716
but watch my body burn.

620
00:53:01,551 --> 00:53:03,511
There is nothing I can do for you either.

621
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,145
I found your sword.

622
00:53:19,653 --> 00:53:21,988
You said you could retrieve
your power with this.

623
00:53:28,995 --> 00:53:32,040
Why are you standing still?
Pick it up and unsheathe it.

624
00:53:49,975 --> 00:53:52,519
An excellent blade recognizes its owner.

625
00:54:02,654 --> 00:54:05,365
Now, I just need to receive its energy.

626
00:54:41,943 --> 00:54:44,195
You are too weak to handle

627
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,740
and unsheathe your own sword.

628
00:54:49,117 --> 00:54:50,952
You are just as powerless as me.

629
00:54:51,953 --> 00:54:53,246
We are useless.

630
00:54:58,543 --> 00:55:01,087
That is enough. Forget it.

631
00:55:01,796 --> 00:55:02,922
Just go.

632
00:55:08,636 --> 00:55:12,474
I doubt you will be a threat to Songrim,
and Naksu is already gone.

633
00:55:13,808 --> 00:55:15,935
Just live as Mu-deok.

634
00:55:20,815 --> 00:55:22,484
I would rather die…

635
00:55:26,654 --> 00:55:28,073
than live like this.

636
00:55:30,617 --> 00:55:32,285
Then be my guest.

637
00:56:24,462 --> 00:56:26,422
This is the grave of the Soul Shifters.

638
00:56:27,507 --> 00:56:30,009
The one who taught me this spell

639
00:56:30,093 --> 00:56:32,637
also disposed of their bodies here.

640
00:56:43,565 --> 00:56:44,691
So this will be

641
00:56:46,109 --> 00:56:47,944
my grave as well.

642
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,392
Young Master Jang,
how long should we keep this place closed?

643
00:57:20,768 --> 00:57:22,103
I am done now.

644
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:24,481
What is wrong with Mu-deok?

645
00:57:24,564 --> 00:57:26,232
She seemed out of it.

646
00:57:30,445 --> 00:57:31,696
I am just worried.

647
00:57:32,614 --> 00:57:34,908
She was heading
toward Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

648
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,828
Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?

649
00:57:42,123 --> 00:57:43,791
I would rather die…

650
00:57:45,585 --> 00:57:46,794
than live like this.

651
00:57:46,878 --> 00:57:48,338
Then be my guest.

652
00:59:01,995 --> 00:59:03,121
Mu-deok!

653
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,164
Mu-deok!

654
00:59:09,836 --> 00:59:10,920
Darn it…

655
01:00:09,187 --> 01:00:12,649
SEJUKWON, SONGRIM

656
01:00:23,117 --> 01:00:24,577
You are in Sejukwon.

657
01:00:25,536 --> 01:00:27,330
Master Heo Yeom's infirmary in Songrim.

658
01:00:28,456 --> 01:00:31,417
Thanks to you, I could come here
even though I was once forbidden.

659
01:00:34,128 --> 01:00:37,507
Your eyes are probably sore.
I put in some eye drops.

660
01:00:38,383 --> 01:00:41,344
He said the blue marks in your eyes
were like bruises.

661
01:00:41,427 --> 01:00:43,971
These eye drops will lighten their color.

662
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:45,682
Put them in regularly.

663
01:00:53,564 --> 01:00:55,191
I unsheathed this before.

664
01:00:56,943 --> 01:00:58,069
I definitely did.

665
01:00:58,152 --> 01:00:59,654
I know. I saw it.

666
01:01:00,405 --> 01:01:02,198
But you are still too weak.

667
01:01:02,281 --> 01:01:04,534
You could only do it
thanks to that lake's energy.

668
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,954
I had regained my power inside that lake.

669
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,873
I should go back there.

670
01:01:10,957 --> 01:01:14,419
Then what?
Will you live underwater like a fish?

671
01:01:19,882 --> 01:01:23,010
I felt a surge of energy underwater.

672
01:01:23,094 --> 01:01:24,721
That is how I regained my power.

673
01:01:25,304 --> 01:01:26,472
That is it.

674
01:01:27,557 --> 01:01:30,017
Someone who has energy
as powerful as that lake

675
01:01:30,685 --> 01:01:33,438
should push out the energy within me.

676
01:01:33,521 --> 01:01:36,357
And who exactly?
Will you be searching for a master too?

677
01:01:37,024 --> 01:01:40,194
Do you think there is anyone
that powerful, to begin with?

678
01:01:40,278 --> 01:01:43,239
Even if there was,
would they want to help you?

679
01:01:44,407 --> 01:01:46,075
You are Naksu, an assassin
who shifted her soul.

680
01:01:49,579 --> 01:01:50,496
What?

681
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:53,166
Uk came to Sejukwon?

682
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:55,918
He came to treat his maid who was injured.

683
01:01:56,002 --> 01:01:57,670
He barged in.

684
01:01:57,754 --> 01:01:58,880
His maid?

685
01:02:00,298 --> 01:02:01,716
Mu-deok, was it?

686
01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:03,259
How bad were her injuries

687
01:02:03,801 --> 01:02:06,721
that he would come
all the way here himself?

688
01:02:22,862 --> 01:02:24,989
I have only heard of Sejukwon.

689
01:02:25,823 --> 01:02:27,450
It sure is an incredible infirmary.

690
01:02:28,618 --> 01:02:30,453
There are all sorts of medicinal herbs.

691
01:02:31,078 --> 01:02:32,497
And poisonous ones too.

692
01:02:38,252 --> 01:02:42,006
I am sure these eye drops
will make your eye color faint.

693
01:02:42,089 --> 01:02:43,633
Lie low and live as Mu-deok.

694
01:02:44,509 --> 01:02:46,010
This is all I can do for you.

695
01:02:46,093 --> 01:02:47,386
You are wrong.

696
01:02:48,554 --> 01:02:51,098
I want you to be my Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

697
01:02:54,519 --> 01:02:57,188
You said you risked your life
many times for me.

698
01:02:58,439 --> 01:03:00,149
Do it one more time.

699
01:03:06,614 --> 01:03:07,907
It will be pretty painful.

700
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:16,666
What did you put in here?

701
01:03:19,001 --> 01:03:21,003
One of the poisonous herbs.

702
01:03:27,802 --> 01:03:29,595
I am betting everything on you.

703
01:03:31,681 --> 01:03:34,642
So I hope you will survive.

704
01:03:51,117 --> 01:03:52,410
If you do,

705
01:03:55,746 --> 01:03:57,707
I will be your master.

706
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:09,176
Uk!

707
01:04:10,136 --> 01:04:12,179
What is wrong? Uk!

708
01:04:12,263 --> 01:04:13,347
Uk!

709
01:04:13,431 --> 01:04:14,724
What is wrong with him?

710
01:04:15,349 --> 01:04:16,475
He ingested poison.

711
01:04:18,185 --> 01:04:19,687
-Poison?
-What poison?

712
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:23,316
His heart will stop in six hours.

713
01:04:23,399 --> 01:04:24,567
What poison was it?

714
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:27,069
It will be too late
by the time you find out

715
01:04:27,153 --> 01:04:28,905
and concoct an antidote.

716
01:04:28,988 --> 01:04:31,532
There is only one way to save him.

717
01:04:31,616 --> 01:04:32,950
Open his gate of energy

718
01:04:33,034 --> 01:04:36,621
and remove the poison
with both of your energy.

719
01:04:36,704 --> 01:04:37,914
-What?
-What?

720
01:04:39,415 --> 01:04:41,083
Open his gate of energy.

721
01:04:41,709 --> 01:04:43,294
Or else, he will die.

722
01:04:46,964 --> 01:04:48,758
Yul…

723
01:04:49,508 --> 01:04:51,260
Uk ingested poison.

724
01:04:52,094 --> 01:04:53,346
They say he's going to die.

725
01:04:53,429 --> 01:04:56,265
-What?
-Mu-deok was the one who gave it to him.

726
01:04:56,349 --> 01:04:58,726
But she will not say
what kind of poison it was,

727
01:04:58,809 --> 01:05:01,604
so my uncle is torturing her right now.

728
01:05:07,276 --> 01:05:08,861
What was the poison?

729
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:14,951
Keep going.

730
01:05:15,034 --> 01:05:17,411
-She could die, my lord.
-Uk is dying.

731
01:05:18,162 --> 01:05:21,832
We must find out what it is
in the next two hours.

732
01:05:28,255 --> 01:05:29,340
Young Master Jang.

733
01:05:30,174 --> 01:05:31,300
Young Master Jang…

734
01:05:33,386 --> 01:05:34,595
Open his gate of energy.

735
01:05:35,805 --> 01:05:37,682
That is the only way.

736
01:05:40,142 --> 01:05:41,560
We are running out of time!

737
01:05:42,186 --> 01:05:43,312
Please…

738
01:05:44,313 --> 01:05:46,399
Please save Young Master Jang!

739
01:06:01,122 --> 01:06:02,581
-My lord.
-How is Uk?

740
01:06:02,665 --> 01:06:04,291
Did something happen to him?

741
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:06,293
Master Heo Yeom removed the poison.

742
01:06:06,919 --> 01:06:08,421
Young Master Jang is safe.

743
01:06:09,005 --> 01:06:11,590
-Did he concoct the antidote?
-No, my lord.

744
01:06:12,341 --> 01:06:15,428
He opened
the young master's gate of energy.

745
01:06:40,995 --> 01:06:43,789
Young Master Jang, are you awake?

746
01:06:55,926 --> 01:06:57,845
Am I alive or dead?

747
01:06:59,096 --> 01:07:00,806
You barely made it out alive.

748
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:02,433
Master Heo saved you

749
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:05,811
by opening your gate of energy.

750
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:09,899
He opened it?

751
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:11,442
Mu-deok that lunatic

752
01:07:12,151 --> 01:07:15,154
would not tell us
what kind of poison you took.

753
01:07:15,237 --> 01:07:19,033
So he had no choice
but to do that to remove the poison.

754
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,372
I am betting everything on you.

755
01:07:25,998 --> 01:07:29,168
So I hope you will survive.

756
01:07:32,171 --> 01:07:33,589
Where is Mu-deok?

757
01:07:52,608 --> 01:07:53,734
Mu-deok…

758
01:08:00,407 --> 01:08:01,659
Mu-deok!

759
01:08:12,211 --> 01:08:13,170
Mu-deok.

760
01:08:16,674 --> 01:08:17,842
Mu-deok.

761
01:08:22,346 --> 01:08:23,430
Mu-deok.

762
01:08:38,028 --> 01:08:39,738
Both of us could have died.

763
01:08:40,614 --> 01:08:41,740
You are…

764
01:08:43,075 --> 01:08:44,410
You are really crazy.

765
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:49,081
So you survived…

766
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:52,209
my pupil.

767
01:08:58,507 --> 01:08:59,758
That is right.

768
01:09:01,677 --> 01:09:03,470
I almost died thanks to you.

769
01:09:10,019 --> 01:09:11,770
My crazy master.

770
01:10:22,716 --> 01:10:26,845
Uk has opened his gate of energy
in the end.

771
01:10:26,929 --> 01:10:30,724
Since I survived as promised,
I will serve you as my master.

772
01:10:30,808 --> 01:10:34,395
In order to become the best mage,
you must go through several steps.

773
01:10:34,478 --> 01:10:36,855
You are worse than what I had expected.

774
01:10:36,939 --> 01:10:38,190
We were looking at Yul.

775
01:10:38,274 --> 01:10:39,566
Mu-deok asked me to come.

776
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:41,318
That girl, Mu-deok…

777
01:10:41,402 --> 01:10:43,612
She seems to be hiding something.

778
01:10:43,696 --> 01:10:45,447
I am in love with you!

779
01:10:45,531 --> 01:10:49,535
Young Master!
The prince has come to see you.

780
01:10:49,618 --> 01:10:51,829
There is another sword here that
you cannot unsheathe.

781
01:10:51,912 --> 01:10:54,248
It will not bode well for me
if I lose that sword as well.

782
01:10:54,331 --> 01:10:55,165
It cannot be helped.

783
01:10:55,249 --> 01:10:57,167
Whoever wins shall take the sword.

784
01:10:59,169 --> 01:11:04,174
