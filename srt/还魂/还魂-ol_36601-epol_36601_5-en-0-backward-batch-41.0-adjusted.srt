1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,054
Here, at Cheonbugwan,
we have records of all the constellations.

2
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:17,391
Even the one on your birthday.
Would you like to see it?

3
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,143
Yes, Father.

4
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,562
All right. Let us go.

5
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:35,367
There it is.

6
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,916
My father studied stars
and kept records of them

7
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,377
as he was a constellation recorder mage
at Cheonbugwan.

8
00:00:58,682 --> 00:00:59,683
My lady!

9
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:00,935
My lady!

10
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,155
My lady, stay inside and do not come out.

11
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,326
If you see your father, run away.

12
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,245
Do not let him catch you.

13
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,187
Father…

14
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:44,038
I will give you power.

15
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:46,248
Will you come with me?

16
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:58,218
The day my father was killed
by the four families of Daeho,

17
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:00,763
I followed Jin Mu.

18
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:04,642
I was raised
as if I was cut off from the world

19
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:07,519
in the deep and dangerous valleys
of Danhyanggok.

20
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,262
I do not know if I toughened up to survive

21
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:43,555
or if I survived because I was tough.

22
00:03:47,768 --> 00:03:51,188
By the time my past self
and my father had been forgotten,

23
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:54,358
I finally returned to the world as Naksu.

24
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:01,532
But Naksu is dead now.

25
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:05,452
I have returned to this place as Mu-deok,

26
00:04:06,453 --> 00:04:08,872
along with an incapable young master

27
00:04:09,623 --> 00:04:13,085
who is also an unmotivated pupil.

28
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:15,504
How far do we have to go?

29
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:16,880
This bracelet weighs a ton.

30
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:19,008
Master, your pupil is exhausted.

31
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,719
I am done.
I am too tired to go any further.

32
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:23,887
I am the one carrying all the luggage.

33
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:26,598
I am your young master,
and you are my maid.

34
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:27,933
That is your job.

35
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,935
So I am your master when you are in need

36
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:32,229
but your maid when you need a servant?

37
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,355
Of course.

38
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:38,986
I did not know

39
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:41,989
there was a place like this
right outside the city.

40
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:45,784
This is a place so rugged and remote
that even echoes cannot be heard.

41
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,203
Hence the name, Danhyanggok.

42
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:54,835
I hear the echoes just fine.

43
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:56,211
It was a figure of speech.

44
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:57,713
The name is just a bluff.

45
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:00,257
I am hungry.

46
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:04,261
Up there is where I used to live.

47
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:06,555
You will eat what I provide for you

48
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:10,184
and sleep where you collapse
after a hard day's training.

49
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,897
What is this? I smell chicken.

50
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,485
-Do they sell chicken here?
-Who would sell chicken here?

51
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:24,490
You smell chicken too, right?

52
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:26,241
I am telling you. It is chicken.

53
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:29,536
I am sure it is chicken. I love chicken.

54
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,914
How did you climb up there?

55
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,708
Someone must be cooking chicken nearby.

56
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,460
Come on down. Why are you up there?

57
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:46,804
See? It is chicken.

58
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:49,932
I told you I smelled chicken.
It is so nice here!

59
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:11,370
Why are these things here?

60
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:14,331
Mu-deok!

61
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,292
There is even a bath here!

62
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,678
Mu-deok.

63
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,932
There are tons of things to eat,
and the bathtub is nice too.

64
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:34,184
Master, you had yourself
a pretty nice place.

65
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,520
Did you really have to
scare your pupil like that?

66
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:37,438
You are one weird…

67
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:41,191
There is even a blanket.

68
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:45,737
This is so soft. It is nice and comfy.

69
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:48,031
These are not mine.

70
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:51,368
Someone else is living here.

71
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:57,875
Mu-deok.

72
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,336
Should we eat the chicken?
I noticed that it was nicely cooked.

73
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,588
Mu-deok?

74
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:09,761
Is it a man?

75
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:32,659
Quiet! Stop!

76
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,996
Stay still.

77
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:49,426
Good boy.

78
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,345
You are well-trained. Do you live here?

79
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,472
He is not a stray dog.

80
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:55,724
Where is your owner?

81
00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:58,519
Hey, Fluffy. Go bring your owner.

82
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:02,731
What a clever dog.

83
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:06,401
Who could it be?

84
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:07,945
It cannot be one of Danju's men,

85
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:11,281
seeing that this person is
not trying to hide him or herself.

86
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,035
There is tea.

87
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:18,163
We are guests, so it would not be rude
to have a cup, right?

88
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:20,916
Watch what you eat or drink.

89
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,752
We need to check who lives here first.

90
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:25,629
Then we will decide what to do next.

91
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:26,964
So you really have no idea?

92
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:28,423
What?

93
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,801
There is a dog, a bunch of flowers,

94
00:08:30,884 --> 00:08:32,803
roasted chicken, and a pot of tea.

95
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,179
I almost had the wrong idea.

96
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:35,639
What do you mean?

97
00:08:35,722 --> 00:08:39,017
I almost misunderstood you for trying
to kidnap and make me live with you

98
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,561
on the pretense of training me.

99
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:42,437
If that dog wagged its tail at you,

100
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:45,148
I would have thought that
this was all part of your plan.

101
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:47,359
This place is big enough
for two or three kids.

102
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:49,945
It was not like this when I lived here.

103
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:51,905
It was completely barren

104
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,575
and perfect for training,
which is why I brought you here.

105
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,452
So just for training?

106
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:00,163
Was that all you had in mind?

107
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:03,292
Forget it! Go ahead
and eat or drink whatever you wish

108
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,501
and get yourself killed.

109
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:07,170
Unbelievable.

110
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:10,924
I cannot believe she would say that to me
just because I made a joke.

111
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:14,177
I was a fool to have followed her
all the way here.

112
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:15,721
Goodness.

113
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:26,273
Just stay a clueless Young Master

114
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:30,485
of the Jang family.

115
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:33,697
I would rather live here

116
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:36,366
than live that way.

117
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,539
Today, the leader of Jinyowon

118
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:27,459
has gathered the mages of Daeho
to hold a Unanimous Assembly.

119
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:31,463
All 11 families have gathered
aside from Jang Gang of the Jang family.

120
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:35,467
Is my duel with Jang Uk
that big of a deal?

121
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:38,470
It is a duel between
a royal family member and a mage.

122
00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:40,347
The last one was hundreds of years ago.

123
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,974
I am merely trying to punish Jang Uk

124
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:45,143
for having looked down on me.

125
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,603
This is not a personal matter.

126
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:50,232
His Majesty gave his orders,
and the mages have gathered.

127
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:53,985
If they agree to this duel,
the fight will become official.

128
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:58,281
A crack has formed
and damaged the stability and peace

129
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:01,576
that had existed
between the royal family and mages.

130
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:18,844
Did you really agree with depriving
Uk's right to become the next Gwanju?

131
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:21,430
Yes, it is true.

132
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:27,477
This duel is merely to resolve

133
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,105
the misunderstanding
between the Crown Prince and Uk.

134
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:31,440
As for the Gwanju position,

135
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:36,820
I already have someone else in mind
other than Jang Uk to recommend for it.

136
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:38,738
Having it taken away
is different from giving it up.

137
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:43,118
I heard Jang Uk ran away
before he even received the duel offer.

138
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:46,705
How embarrassing.

139
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:50,208
He should fight honorably
and die as a mage with integrity.

140
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,544
Uk does not have the guts to do that.

141
00:11:53,962 --> 00:11:56,882
Everyone here has been his master.

142
00:11:56,965 --> 00:11:59,593
-Right.
-He never had any kind of potential.

143
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:03,180
I do not wish for us mages
to be disgraced like this.

144
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:05,932
What if we disqualify Uk
of his rights as a mage?

145
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:12,689
If we disqualify his rights
followed by a unanimous vote,

146
00:12:12,772 --> 00:12:16,026
his energy flow will be cut off,
and he will lose all his power.

147
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:18,820
Are you suggesting we ruin
the young man's life forever?

148
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,739
Still, it will help us stop the duel.

149
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:25,911
Uk's gate of energy was closed anyway
thanks to his father.

150
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:27,913
-He is right.
-He has a point.

151
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:30,081
All of you here

152
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:33,293
have once taught Uk as his master.

153
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:38,048
How could you be so nonchalant

154
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:41,259
about ruining the life of someone
who once used to be your pupil?

155
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:46,389
Songrim has accepted
the royal family's duel.

156
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:49,392
Songrim will take on the disgrace
that may or may not occur.

157
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:53,563
Then make sure it becomes an official duel
between Songrim and the royal family.

158
00:12:55,398 --> 00:12:56,233
I will.

159
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,695
I heard Uk mastered Ryusu
in a very short amount of time.

160
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:04,282
Was he taught by someone in Songrim?

161
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,331
No matter where he goes,
whether it is Songrim or not,

162
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:16,628
there will be no master for Uk.

163
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:23,677
The water is nice and clean.
My skin feels so soft.

164
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,053
Maybe it is mineral water.

165
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,391
Mu-deok, the owner of this place
seems like a very neat person.

166
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:30,976
I do not think he will be back…

167
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:35,522
Goodness.

168
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:51,580
She is completely knocked out.

169
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:53,832
Of course, you are tired.

170
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:56,543
We could have taken our time,
but you insisted on hurrying.

171
00:13:56,626 --> 00:13:59,588
You are Mu-deok now, not Naksu.
You do not have the strength.

172
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:05,927
Oh, gosh. This is…

173
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:07,804
This is heavy.

174
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,431
What a fool.

175
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:12,392
If it was this heavy,
she should have asked for help.

176
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:21,735
It is so comfy.

177
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:29,284
I am a young master,

178
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:32,454
and she is my maid. That is right.

179
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,665
It is only right that I sleep here.

180
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,473
Gosh, this is making me feel uneasy.

181
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:02,067
All right.

182
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:16,373
Master.

183
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:17,874
Please get a good night's rest.

184
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:44,109
This is so uncomfortable.

185
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,931
Are you saying
there is a soul shifter inside?

186
00:16:18,601 --> 00:16:20,186
How interesting.

187
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,258
I would not have recognized her
without your help

188
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:51,926
since her soul has no malice.

189
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:00,852
You will be better off dying in my hands
than to run wild and be petrified.

190
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:31,466
A great soul has shifted into this body.

191
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:37,180
She should have run wild by now,
judging by how weak this body looks.

192
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:39,182
How is she still fine?

193
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:50,860
I feel no energy around her.
Where did it all disappear to?

194
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:58,284
Who are you?

195
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,163
And you are?

196
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,249
Step away from Mu-deok.

197
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,096
That sword was given
to the Cheonbugwan's Gwanju by the king.

198
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,973
Who are you?

199
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:46,809
What are you doing with a girl like her?

200
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:51,940
Mu-deok, run!

201
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,612
Hey, you are up.

202
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,243
Who is he?

203
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,619
The man you saw last night.

204
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:31,247
The man I saw last night?

205
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,540
Yes. Do you not remember?

206
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:38,546
Mu-deok, run!

207
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,584
I apologize about last night.

208
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:18,503
I saw someone inside the hut,

209
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:21,589
and you suddenly wielded your sword at me,
so I had no choice.

210
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:23,007
I was startled too.

211
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,676
I am not trained enough
to control the energy in my arm.

212
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,637
I had no intentions of harming you.

213
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,846
Did you two…

214
00:22:29,764 --> 00:22:30,723
fight?

215
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,854
Do you not remember anything
from last night?

216
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,315
No.

217
00:22:39,398 --> 00:22:41,943
You stood right there
and watched us fight.

218
00:22:42,026 --> 00:22:43,277
I did?

219
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,237
What?

220
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:46,614
I guess you sleepwalk.

221
00:22:46,697 --> 00:22:50,284
I will get you medicinal herbs for that.
Brew them and drink the tea.

222
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,370
Are you a herbalist?

223
00:22:52,453 --> 00:22:54,539
No, but he is staying here
to pick some medicinal herbs

224
00:22:54,622 --> 00:22:56,249
that are only found in Danhyanggok.

225
00:22:56,332 --> 00:22:57,250
Call me Master Lee.

226
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,002
There is enough
food and space for all of us,

227
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:01,963
so make yourselves at home.

228
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:06,884
All right, Sapsali.

229
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:10,555
Do you really not remember?

230
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:12,640
Did I really sleepwalk last night?

231
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:27,905
I swear I was on the floor…

232
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,449
That soul shifter is special.

233
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:33,744
There is a great soul
dwelling inside that small body.

234
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:37,999
Let us get to know her a bit.

235
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:39,542
Do not lie.

236
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:42,211
I am serious. I moved you
so you could sleep comfortably.

237
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,671
What is your relationship?

238
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,632
Are you married?

239
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,925
-No.
-No.

240
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:52,054
You did not put me on the bed.
I remember sleeping on the floor.

241
00:23:52,138 --> 00:23:54,182
Why would I lie to you? I really--

242
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:55,558
-You always lie.
-They must be married.

243
00:23:56,475 --> 00:23:57,643
-We are not.
-We are not.

244
00:23:58,227 --> 00:23:59,812
So did you win?

245
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,439
No, I lost. But…

246
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,691
He is very strong.

247
00:24:03,774 --> 00:24:05,985
-He is--
-Good for you. I knew it.

248
00:24:06,068 --> 00:24:07,111
What?

249
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,827
They even held a gathering.
Things are getting out of hand.

250
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:18,247
Do you think Uk and Mu-deok are all right?

251
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,000
They went to Sari Village,
Mu-deok's hometown.

252
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,251
She must be happy.

253
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:25,671
Why would she be happy?

254
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:26,881
She had to leave you.

255
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:29,217
-So?
-Goodness, you fool.

256
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,219
Mu-deok is in love with you.

257
00:24:33,846 --> 00:24:35,223
She only said that

258
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,475
so she could help Uk.

259
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:39,268
Sure. Whatever.

260
00:24:42,271 --> 00:24:45,191
I heard Young Master Jang ran away.

261
00:24:45,274 --> 00:24:49,403
He did not run away.
He just fled to take refuge.

262
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,947
What is the difference?

263
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,699
Does that mean
he went to Danhyanggok with Mu-deok?

264
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:57,662
-Danhyanggok?
-Yes.

265
00:24:57,745 --> 00:25:01,123
She lit firecrackers there recently
under Young Master Jang's orders.

266
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:03,793
I remember seeing the fireworks
from the fortress.

267
00:25:03,876 --> 00:25:06,963
I figured that was where they went
since it is not too far away.

268
00:25:07,046 --> 00:25:09,715
-Did I guess correctly?
-No.

269
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,677
Mu-deok took him
to Sari Village, her hometown.

270
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,762
Oh, I see. Sari Village.

271
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:16,973
Do not tell anyone that Uk is there.

272
00:25:17,556 --> 00:25:19,225
All right. I will not.

273
00:25:19,308 --> 00:25:20,434
Enjoy.

274
00:25:22,603 --> 00:25:24,939
Mu-deok used to go to Danhyanggok?

275
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:26,524
That place is pretty dangerous.

276
00:25:26,607 --> 00:25:28,943
Is that the place
where you kept your pet bird?

277
00:25:29,652 --> 00:25:31,696
You hurt your leg there
and worried everyone.

278
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:34,073
Yes, it was Danhyanggok.

279
00:25:36,242 --> 00:25:38,411
I had forgotten all about that place.

280
00:25:52,091 --> 00:25:53,217
The fire is weak.

281
00:25:58,264 --> 00:26:00,891
His body must be filled with energy,
judging by his strength.

282
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:05,604
He has mastered Jipsu.

283
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,607
Jipsu? That means he is as strong as I am.

284
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:11,068
No wonder it was not easy to fight him.

285
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:22,788
He is using his energy to control fire.

286
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:23,956
He is far above

287
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,000
the Ryusu level.

288
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:28,127
RYUSU: THE STAGE OF EMITTING
ENERGY FROM THE BODY

289
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:29,670
Ryusu?

290
00:26:30,796 --> 00:26:33,424
He is stronger than I am.
I could have gotten badly hurt.

291
00:26:38,721 --> 00:26:40,473
The rain has soaked my clothes.

292
00:27:02,536 --> 00:27:03,704
He has mastered Chisu.

293
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,415
He dried his clothes so easily.

294
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,126
He is a master
of the higher levels of Chisu.

295
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,551
A master of levels beyond Chisu?

296
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:20,304
I could have died.

297
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,476
It is nice and dry.

298
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:35,820
Do not drink that tea.

299
00:27:40,574 --> 00:27:42,076
You drank the entire pot?

300
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,160
Yes.

301
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,329
Are you all right? Do you feel unwell?

302
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:48,999
Did you brew poisonous herbs?

303
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:51,293
No, not poisonous herbs.

304
00:27:51,377 --> 00:27:52,670
Chaste herbs.

305
00:27:52,753 --> 00:27:54,004
Chaste?

306
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:55,339
Chaste herbs?

307
00:27:55,923 --> 00:27:58,968
You mentioned picking herbs
that grow only in Danhyanggok.

308
00:27:59,051 --> 00:28:00,386
Did you mean chaste herbs?

309
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,515
You know about chaste herbs?

310
00:28:04,598 --> 00:28:07,560
I heard that there were mages
who drink tea made with chaste herbs

311
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:10,980
to lower their libido so they could focus
on mastering their spells.

312
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:14,066
Lower their libido? What is that?

313
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,695
Your sexual desire,
one of the five desires of humans.

314
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:19,280
What? Sexual desire?

315
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,076
Chaste herbs cut off…

316
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,789
the energy that causes humans
to have sexual desires.

317
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,794
I heard about a mage
who reached a high level of sorcery

318
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,505
by cutting off his libido
and mastering spells.

319
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:39,759
They say he only wears clothes
made with hemp fabric,

320
00:28:39,842 --> 00:28:43,053
which is why they call him,
"Hemp Master Lee."

321
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:46,849
You really do know a lot of things
for a mere maid.

322
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,688
I am honored to have met a mage
who has reached such a high level.

323
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,191
Here is a proper greeting,
Hemp Master Lee.

324
00:29:03,824 --> 00:29:04,784
Young Master.

325
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:06,786
What are you doing? Greet him properly.

326
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,209
Does this mean my libido has been cut off?

327
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:15,711
No…

328
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:16,796
No way.

329
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:18,422
No…

330
00:29:19,131 --> 00:29:21,050
That cannot happen. Please help me.

331
00:29:21,884 --> 00:29:24,637
A single pot of tea is not enough
to cut off your libido.

332
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,555
Are you sure? Tell me the truth!

333
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,641
Yes, it is the truth.
If you are so worried,

334
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:31,185
I will make you a tonic
to help boost it back.

335
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:35,773
Thank you.

336
00:29:35,856 --> 00:29:36,857
Master Lee.

337
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,693
Can you help my young master?

338
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:44,156
He is struggling to control the energy
that is focused on his right arm.

339
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,160
Can you help him control it?

340
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,912
Teaching him would not be hard,

341
00:29:49,995 --> 00:29:52,957
but if you wish to learn from me,
you must do as I say.

342
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,250
Are you ready for that?

343
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,751
He is ready to do anything.

344
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:56,752
Right?

345
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:02,049
What exactly do I need to do?

346
00:30:02,132 --> 00:30:03,259
Just like me,

347
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:05,469
you must drink chaste herb tea.

348
00:30:06,762 --> 00:30:09,181
Are you willing to cut off…

349
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:12,935
your libido?

350
00:30:17,523 --> 00:30:19,149
You drank the whole pot?

351
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,651
Yes.

352
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:22,820
You can do it, right?

353
00:30:34,748 --> 00:30:37,001
So what if he is a renowned mage?

354
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:40,796
He is stuck here all by himself
without a pupil for a good reason.

355
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,883
His method will speed things up.

356
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:47,136
You will quickly be able to control
that energy in your arm.

357
00:30:47,219 --> 00:30:50,806
Listen. He wants me to drink
that chaste herb tea. That is ridiculous.

358
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,352
I am already bothered
by how much I drank yesterday.

359
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,855
I wonder if this tonic
will be enough to undo it.

360
00:30:57,938 --> 00:30:59,773
It is not entirely ridiculous.

361
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,860
Cutting off your libido is not a bad idea

362
00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:06,322
if you will not be needing it for a while.
It is a good way to train.

363
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:13,704
Are you saying
I will not be needing it for a while?

364
00:31:15,664 --> 00:31:17,666
Mu-deok, look me in the eye and tell me.

365
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,251
Yes! Is that a problem?

366
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,295
Think about it.
This is a rare opportunity.

367
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:23,589
It takes a lot of luck
to meet someone like him.

368
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,258
Just practice celibacy for a while

369
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:28,302
and get rid of this.

370
00:31:28,385 --> 00:31:30,888
Do not make it sound like
a walk in the park.

371
00:31:30,971 --> 00:31:33,015
Impotence is a small sacrifice
for a high-level mage.

372
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:34,892
See? Listen to what you just said.

373
00:31:34,975 --> 00:31:37,436
You do not care
if my libido will be cut off forever.

374
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,979
Stop fussing over what is useless.

375
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,106
It is precious to me
regardless of its use!

376
00:31:52,326 --> 00:31:53,869
Hey…

377
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,664
Mu-deok, are you all right?

378
00:31:57,247 --> 00:31:59,291
What just happened?

379
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:01,251
Ryusu.

380
00:32:03,545 --> 00:32:05,965
The energy within you has trickled out.

381
00:32:07,466 --> 00:32:09,885
A small amount of energy
created immense strength.

382
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:13,514
If you took off the binding bracelet
and used your full force,

383
00:32:13,597 --> 00:32:15,391
I would have died on the spot.

384
00:32:19,144 --> 00:32:20,604
Hey, you are bleeding.

385
00:32:23,023 --> 00:32:25,025
Master, you must be crazy.

386
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,111
-Do you enjoy almost dying?
-Yes.

387
00:32:27,194 --> 00:32:30,114
It means you are getting stronger.

388
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:37,079
Right now, it may seem insignificant,

389
00:32:37,162 --> 00:32:40,374
but your energy will soon add up,

390
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:44,545
and your power will be as awe-inspiring
as Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

391
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:49,091
Then I will also be able
to regain my power.

392
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,066
Wipe that blood off
before it fills up Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

393
00:33:09,486 --> 00:33:10,320
It must hurt.

394
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:12,031
Not at all.

395
00:33:12,114 --> 00:33:13,615
Stop acting tough.

396
00:33:18,495 --> 00:33:20,414
Year one of the King Go Sun regime.

397
00:33:20,497 --> 00:33:22,875
The first day of April.

398
00:33:29,423 --> 00:33:30,758
GO SUN, YEAR ONE
FIRST DAY OF APRIL

399
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:34,303
The King's Star was in the night sky
the night the baby was born.

400
00:33:34,386 --> 00:33:37,014
No one can find out about that star.

401
00:33:37,097 --> 00:33:39,600
But Cheonbugwan would have
kept a record of it.

402
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:42,019
I have managed to sneak out
the actual plate.

403
00:33:42,102 --> 00:33:43,437
The one in Cheonbugwan is…

404
00:33:44,563 --> 00:33:46,190
a fake one without the King's Star.

405
00:33:47,816 --> 00:33:52,029
You must not let anyone find out
the secret behind his birth.

406
00:33:56,658 --> 00:33:59,244
Do you see a strange constellation there?

407
00:34:08,128 --> 00:34:12,216
It is the day that Lady Do-hwa died
and Jang Uk was born.

408
00:34:14,968 --> 00:34:16,637
I heard about the gathering.

409
00:34:17,596 --> 00:34:22,142
All you noble mages
must have had to gather because of me.

410
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,230
Assistant Gwanju.

411
00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:28,857
Why not start your own family line?

412
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,694
If you receive a unanimous vote,

413
00:34:32,778 --> 00:34:37,366
you can also become a noble member
of the Unanimous Society yourself.

414
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:43,497
I am a member of the Jin family.
Jinyowon is my birthplace.

415
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,418
What brings you to Cheonbugwan?

416
00:34:48,502 --> 00:34:50,003
The soul shifter found in Songrim

417
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:52,297
was a constellation recorder mage
in Cheonbugwan.

418
00:34:53,048 --> 00:34:55,467
The Jeongjingak mages
must carry out an investigation,

419
00:34:56,176 --> 00:34:57,386
so please cooperate.

420
00:34:58,095 --> 00:35:00,055
Investigate what?

421
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:08,730
Why do you want to know?
So you can hide things in advance?

422
00:35:11,775 --> 00:35:14,319
I have nothing to hide.

423
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,280
They are welcome anytime.

424
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:20,367
They are already here.

425
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,643
That mage's job was

426
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:49,688
to continuously maintain
the right amount of energy in here.

427
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,400
He was in charge of this section.

428
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:05,370
What? There is a dead body in Cheonbugwan?

429
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:08,665
Eunuch Kim absorbed a man's energy,
and the body is in the secret room.

430
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,807
The soul shifter's job here
was nothing important.

431
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:28,977
He was also warned for secretly
looking at the constellation plates.

432
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,398
My lord.

433
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:37,861
A lot of the officials
seem to have suddenly disappeared.

434
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,321
Where could they have gone?

435
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,704
Thank you for your cooperation.

436
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,790
Do not mention it.

437
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:52,125
I have one more favor to ask.

438
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:54,628
This may be out of line,

439
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,966
but I would like to take a look
at the secret room inside Cheonbugwan.

440
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:18,610
Feel free to look around.

441
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,681
Use the underground tunnel
to take the corpse out.

442
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:02,821
If they are hiding something,
they will try to get rid of it.

443
00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:05,282
Watch and follow his men.

444
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:10,579
Let us hurry.

445
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:25,886
We saw this wagon exiting Cheonbugwan.

446
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:27,763
Are you a mage there?

447
00:38:27,846 --> 00:38:28,972
Show us your face.

448
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,265
Let us see what is inside.

449
00:39:13,892 --> 00:39:14,810
Go after him!

450
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:04,443
The man I fought just ran away.

451
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:07,362
Did you lose the wagoner?

452
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,866
I found this inside.

453
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:12,951
That is Songrim's Spirit Plaque.

454
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:15,912
Were those men from Songrim?

455
00:40:31,386 --> 00:40:34,598
The Spirit Plaque of Songrim
was found inside the wagon,

456
00:40:34,681 --> 00:40:36,766
so they will not be able
to raise an issue.

457
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:40,353
Naksu ended up helping us
even after she died.

458
00:40:43,857 --> 00:40:46,902
I apologize for the trouble
I have caused, Assistant Gwanju.

459
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,451
You attacked a person
in the middle of the street?

460
00:40:54,534 --> 00:40:57,370
I shifted your good-for-nothing soul
into a man of power,

461
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:58,830
but it was not so you could act out.

462
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,081
Forgive me.

463
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,842
Deliver this chest.

464
00:41:14,012 --> 00:41:16,181
Make sure they receive it as always.

465
00:41:16,264 --> 00:41:19,518
I will make sure
it is delivered right away.

466
00:41:30,195 --> 00:41:32,113
He will have to be discarded soon.

467
00:41:32,197 --> 00:41:33,907
Find me another eunuch.

468
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:38,078
Then I will shift your soul into his body.

469
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,749
Into the body of a eunuch?

470
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,419
What is the matter?
Is it not to your liking?

471
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,550
I shall follow your orders.

472
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:54,719
Do you still safely carry around
the Soul Ejector?

473
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:55,720
Yes.

474
00:42:04,354 --> 00:42:07,774
I was going to refrain from shifting souls
because of Songrim's vigilance.

475
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:13,697
But it seems to be the only way
to serve Her Majesty.

476
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,789
An item that belongs to Songrim
was found in a suspicious wagon

477
00:42:22,872 --> 00:42:24,958
that was coming out of Cheonbugwan.

478
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:27,919
So it gives us no right
to raise an issue about it.

479
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:30,880
Find out whose Spirit Plaque this is.

480
00:42:31,464 --> 00:42:35,427
As you all know,
Uk recently lost his Spirit Plaque.

481
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:39,431
And judging by that burn mark,
I think it belongs to him.

482
00:42:40,807 --> 00:42:42,100
This is Uk's?

483
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:46,313
I cannot believe him. He does not fail
to cause trouble even when he is not here.

484
00:42:46,396 --> 00:42:48,148
I want you two to visit Uk

485
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:52,152
and ask him where and how
he lost this Spirit Plaque.

486
00:42:52,986 --> 00:42:54,279
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

487
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:37,405
This is from Jin Mu, the Assistant Gwanju.

488
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,502
What is it that the Assistant Gwanju
always sends to you?

489
00:43:51,252 --> 00:43:54,547
He sends me medicinal herbs
for the sake of my good health.

490
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,844
He may not look it,
but he is a thoughtful man.

491
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,735
Mu-deok.

492
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,405
I am going to go with Master Lee
to pick medicinal herbs.

493
00:44:18,488 --> 00:44:19,531
When will you train?

494
00:44:19,614 --> 00:44:22,534
I should earn my keep to stay here.
I will see you later.

495
00:44:22,617 --> 00:44:23,993
-Let us get going.
-Right.

496
00:44:25,078 --> 00:44:26,663
Does it really have a great view?

497
00:44:26,746 --> 00:44:29,541
-The view is magnificent.
-I cannot wait to see it.

498
00:44:34,879 --> 00:44:37,257
Master Lee, you are very dexterous.

499
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:40,135
I buy everything
and just put them together. Hold it.

500
00:44:40,218 --> 00:44:41,261
-Like this?
-Yes.

501
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:46,766
This is nice.

502
00:44:49,352 --> 00:44:52,063
Today, we will go to a place
with tons of mandarin fish.

503
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:55,400
Mandarin fish? Then we should
prepare ingredients for the fish stew.

504
00:44:55,483 --> 00:44:56,818
Do you know how to cook it?

505
00:44:56,901 --> 00:44:58,862
No, but you can teach me how.

506
00:44:59,779 --> 00:45:01,614
Why, you…

507
00:45:12,834 --> 00:45:13,960
It is a bit salty.

508
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,339
Mu-deok, have a taste.

509
00:45:18,923 --> 00:45:21,801
Young Master, are you here to mess around?

510
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,636
What are you doing?

511
00:45:24,429 --> 00:45:26,598
Master Lee has a lot to teach.

512
00:45:26,681 --> 00:45:28,099
Who told you to learn things like this?

513
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,185
If you wish to learn from him,
do it right.

514
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:33,563
Mu-deok, I think I am fit
to live in the wild.

515
00:45:33,646 --> 00:45:35,273
Thank you for bringing me

516
00:45:35,356 --> 00:45:36,941
to such a peaceful place.

517
00:45:39,527 --> 00:45:40,695
Are not even worried…

518
00:45:42,822 --> 00:45:44,908
about the duel with the Crown Prince?

519
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,369
If you are so worried, go find out.

520
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,289
It is salty.

521
00:45:54,459 --> 00:45:55,376
Hey!

522
00:45:57,253 --> 00:45:58,254
My gosh!

523
00:46:07,263 --> 00:46:08,473
Mu-deok, put down that knife.

524
00:46:09,432 --> 00:46:11,351
You better not throw it at me.

525
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,062
I said I would kill you
if you become useless.

526
00:46:15,188 --> 00:46:16,272
You cannot kill me.

527
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,525
I have mastered Jipsu,
and you are just Mu-deok.

528
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:22,153
You are no longer Naksu.

529
00:46:24,822 --> 00:46:26,491
Hey! That is dangerous!

530
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,036
You and I have no need
for peace and serenity in our lives.

531
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:31,329
I will destroy it for you.

532
00:46:37,835 --> 00:46:39,212
What is the matter with you?

533
00:46:39,295 --> 00:46:41,422
Who are you to stop me
from enjoying my peace?

534
00:46:41,506 --> 00:46:43,383
Are you satisfied with this life?

535
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:45,510
Yes, I am.

536
00:46:45,593 --> 00:46:48,513
I am very satisfied.
If you do not like it, then you can leave.

537
00:46:48,596 --> 00:46:50,515
I am happy with my life here,

538
00:46:50,598 --> 00:46:53,560
but if you do not feel the same way,
you may leave.

539
00:46:55,895 --> 00:46:57,230
You jerk.

540
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,441
You know we are both connected by fate.

541
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,236
And you are asking me
to be the one to end it.

542
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:06,364
You coward.

543
00:47:13,454 --> 00:47:14,956
Damn it.

544
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,397
I have found a way for Uk

545
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,192
to avoid a duel with the Crown Prince
and still become Cheonbugwan's Gwanju.

546
00:47:44,193 --> 00:47:46,904
What is it? We are ready to do anything.

547
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:52,535
By having Uk marry my daughter, Cho-yeon.

548
00:48:00,293 --> 00:48:02,754
Our family owns a plaque
that gives us the power

549
00:48:02,837 --> 00:48:04,672
to reject the King's orders.

550
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,347
We even have the power
to dethrone the King

551
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:15,767
if all the mages in Daeho
unanimously vote for it.

552
00:48:16,726 --> 00:48:20,563
This plaque was granted to us
by the Unanimous Assembly

553
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:25,193
to prevent the rare and dangerous spirits
inside Jinyowon from escaping.

554
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:30,490
Are you offering to go against
His Majesty's order to deprive Uk

555
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,450
of becoming the next Gwanju?

556
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:34,994
Yes, but only if he marries my daughter

557
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,497
and becomes a member of the Jin family.

558
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:45,004
But Lady Jin and Young Master Jang
have already once

559
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:49,008
called off their engagement.
Are you all right with that?

560
00:48:50,426 --> 00:48:52,637
It was not because
my feelings for him had faded.

561
00:48:53,304 --> 00:48:55,723
I still wish to marry Uk.

562
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,438
I did not expect him to wed so soon.

563
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,607
I am not sure
if he is ready to get married.

564
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:17,286
You do things pretty well
for someone from a wealthy family.

565
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:20,498
Once I put my mind to something,
I tend to learn very fast.

566
00:49:20,581 --> 00:49:21,791
I like you even more now.

567
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:26,087
You should reconsider becoming my pupil.

568
00:49:27,088 --> 00:49:30,133
Master Lee, do you not have any pupils?

569
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,594
I had one,

570
00:49:33,678 --> 00:49:35,680
but he gave up on celibacy
and got married.

571
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,559
He works at an infirmary now.

572
00:49:47,233 --> 00:49:49,569
You can always
change your mind and go back.

573
00:49:49,652 --> 00:49:50,778
So think about it.

574
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:54,907
I did not come here to train.

575
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:56,784
Do you really want to waste that energy

576
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:59,537
on just fishing
and picking medicinal herbs?

577
00:50:04,792 --> 00:50:07,754
-I cannot control it anyway.
-Is that so?

578
00:50:08,421 --> 00:50:10,923
That arm will become a burden
if you leave it like that.

579
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,343
Shall I cut off your energy flow?

580
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:19,390
Then you will be able to live
an average and comfortable life.

581
00:50:34,405 --> 00:50:37,158
I need to go to the fortress.
Would you like to come with me?

582
00:50:37,241 --> 00:50:40,161
No, I will pass today.
I need to cook for Mu-deok.

583
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:44,415
She is not here.
She went down the mountain earlier.

584
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,751
What?

585
00:50:46,834 --> 00:50:49,670
Jang Uk is a real genius

586
00:50:49,754 --> 00:50:52,048
and has already mastered Ryusu.

587
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:54,717
And he is training hard
to get ready for the duel.

588
00:50:56,844 --> 00:50:59,263
Spread that rumor around the city,
word-for-word.

589
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,389
Really?

590
00:51:01,098 --> 00:51:03,851
If he still does not show up,
he will completely lose face.

591
00:51:04,894 --> 00:51:08,022
Then at least he will feel humiliated.

592
00:51:08,731 --> 00:51:09,982
Give me some chicken.

593
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:12,652
You should leave today.
Cheonbugwan officials are here.

594
00:51:12,735 --> 00:51:14,695
Someone high-up came to visit us today.

595
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,490
It is best not to run into them,

596
00:51:17,573 --> 00:51:19,116
especially with
the Spirit Plaque incident.

597
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:40,972
Stop right there.

598
00:51:46,143 --> 00:51:48,396
You are Jang Uk's maid, are you not?

599
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,274
Yes, I am. Do you need something?

600
00:51:52,066 --> 00:51:55,486
There is no way Naksu would have
shifted her soul into a body like that.

601
00:51:56,654 --> 00:51:57,697
You…

602
00:51:58,364 --> 00:52:01,742
Do you remember seeing me
at the inn by the dock?

603
00:52:11,752 --> 00:52:13,546
I am not sure.

604
00:52:17,675 --> 00:52:18,968
He is suspicious of me.

605
00:52:20,094 --> 00:52:23,055
I have a few questions for you.
Come with me to Cheonbugwan.

606
00:52:26,475 --> 00:52:27,518
Follow me.

607
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,687
-Get off me!
-Stay still!

608
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:31,188
-Why are you…
-Stay still!

609
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:34,734
She has no blue mark.

610
00:52:36,277 --> 00:52:38,154
Is she really not Naksu?

611
00:52:40,072 --> 00:52:43,284
I do not know where Young Master Jang is.

612
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:48,039
Your Royal Highness!

613
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,127
Your Royal Highness.

614
00:52:54,253 --> 00:52:55,922
Your Royal Highness, it is me.

615
00:52:56,005 --> 00:52:57,381
It is me, Filthy Mu-deok.

616
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:11,437
You are Filthy Mu-deok.

617
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,941
Yes, that is me. You granted me that name.

618
00:53:15,024 --> 00:53:16,567
I am Filthy Mu-deok.

619
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:21,656
Your Royal Highness, please help me.

620
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:22,865
Help you with what?

621
00:53:23,449 --> 00:53:26,577
Your Royal Highness, you are
not only intelligent but also strong.

622
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,913
Meanwhile, my young master is
dumb and pathetic.

623
00:53:28,996 --> 00:53:30,790
Because of him, my life is at stake.

624
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:32,625
Please help me, Your Royal Highness.

625
00:53:39,131 --> 00:53:41,676
Thank you very much, Your Royal Highness.

626
00:53:43,761 --> 00:53:46,597
What is your dumb, pathetic young master
up to these days?

627
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,891
He spends every day crying.

628
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:52,019
He is terrified of you,
so he shakes in fear

629
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:53,854
and weeps in hiding.

630
00:53:54,647 --> 00:53:57,525
I see you are speaking ill of him
just so you can please me.

631
00:53:58,442 --> 00:54:01,946
I can say things
that are a lot worse if it pleases you.

632
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:06,701
Filthy Mu-deok,
you must think I am a petty man.

633
00:54:07,284 --> 00:54:09,203
I am filthy for a reason.

634
00:54:09,787 --> 00:54:13,082
Relieve yourself of everything
you have wanted to say but could not,

635
00:54:13,165 --> 00:54:14,917
thinking it might make you seem petty.

636
00:54:16,085 --> 00:54:18,379
Are you offering to be
a verbal outhouse of sorts?

637
00:54:18,462 --> 00:54:21,215
Goodness, that would be
too grand of a title for me.

638
00:54:21,298 --> 00:54:23,092
But I would be more than honored.

639
00:54:25,177 --> 00:54:27,513
I do not need someone like you
to relieve my stress.

640
00:54:29,181 --> 00:54:32,184
Your Royal Highness,
I know you have done enough,

641
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:35,688
but can you please tell those men
not to drag me away again?

642
00:54:36,355 --> 00:54:37,815
A warning will be enough.

643
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,074
Take this.

644
00:54:48,534 --> 00:54:49,744
That is my sachet.

645
00:54:49,827 --> 00:54:50,995
SACHET: A SCENTED BAG

646
00:54:51,078 --> 00:54:54,373
Show them that if your pathetic master
puts you in trouble again.

647
00:54:55,332 --> 00:54:57,710
My goodness.
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

648
00:55:03,674 --> 00:55:05,509
It smells of cinnamon.

649
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,386
Why do you look disgusted by the smell?

650
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,555
What is the matter? Do you not like it?

651
00:55:09,638 --> 00:55:12,183
Nonsense. I really like it.

652
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:14,393
-Give it back then.
-No.

653
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,520
It is already covered in my filth.

654
00:55:17,855 --> 00:55:20,566
I am grateful
for this wonderful-smelling gift.

655
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:25,613
Then let me pour you a glass of alcohol
that also smells wonderful.

656
00:55:35,873 --> 00:55:37,291
It is cinnamon and ginger wine,

657
00:55:37,374 --> 00:55:38,667
made with plenty of cinnamon.

658
00:55:40,753 --> 00:55:43,255
You must not like the smell.
I will take it back.

659
00:55:43,881 --> 00:55:44,882
No.

660
00:55:44,965 --> 00:55:46,175
I like it.

661
00:55:56,268 --> 00:55:58,562
-How does it taste?
-It tastes wonderful.

662
00:55:58,646 --> 00:55:59,605
Have another glass.

663
00:56:07,696 --> 00:56:10,574
Mu-deok probably went to Chwiseonru.
She has nowhere else to go.

664
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,868
Did she get angry and leave?

665
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,538
What kind of maid is that?

666
00:56:16,205 --> 00:56:17,832
She is no ordinary maid.

667
00:56:18,457 --> 00:56:21,794
If she is no ordinary maid,
then what exactly is she?

668
00:56:22,711 --> 00:56:25,131
Mu-deok is like a bird's egg.

669
00:56:25,214 --> 00:56:26,841
She needs to be embraced.

670
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:30,427
-Let us go and look.
-What is it?

671
00:56:30,511 --> 00:56:32,638
They found the corpse of a soul shifter.

672
00:56:32,721 --> 00:56:34,515
-A soul shifter's corpse?
-Where?

673
00:56:37,476 --> 00:56:40,271
-Let me see.
-What happened?

674
00:56:40,354 --> 00:56:42,148
-My goodness.
-Oh, dear.

675
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:45,067
-It looks horrible.
-Goodness gracious.

676
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,990
That is not a soul shifter.

677
00:56:51,073 --> 00:56:52,992
But he died because of one.

678
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,202
You know about soul shifters?

679
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,830
When soul shifters run wild,
they feed off the energy of humans.

680
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,374
That is why they banned
the alchemy of souls

681
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,835
and started capturing
and killing soul shifters.

682
00:57:14,388 --> 00:57:16,307
Do all soul shifters run wild?

683
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:18,642
Not if they master Hwansu.

684
00:57:19,351 --> 00:57:22,521
Is that level even possible
for a human being to master?

685
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,814
Of course.

686
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:27,985
Would you like to be my pupil
and reach that level?

687
00:57:28,569 --> 00:57:31,197
You are not only well-built and smart,

688
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,157
but you also have what it takes.

689
00:57:34,074 --> 00:57:37,495
Thank you for the compliment,
but I do not wish to be celibate.

690
00:57:37,578 --> 00:57:38,787
If you become my pupil,

691
00:57:38,871 --> 00:57:41,373
I will teach you how to take off
that binding bracelet.

692
00:57:41,957 --> 00:57:43,042
"Master."

693
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:45,461
That is all it takes.

694
00:57:46,378 --> 00:57:48,297
Please stop trying to convince me.

695
00:57:48,881 --> 00:57:51,383
We are from Cheonbugwan.
Everyone, step away.

696
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:56,388
I should get going.
It is bad for me to run into them.

697
00:57:58,098 --> 00:57:59,266
Goodness.

698
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,988
Look over there.

699
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,615
-It is a rainbow.
-Where?

700
00:58:14,698 --> 00:58:17,326
-Oh, my goodness.
-It is a rainbow.

701
00:58:17,409 --> 00:58:19,745
-It really is a rainbow.
-Beautiful.

702
00:58:19,828 --> 00:58:22,915
-Look at that.
-It has been so long.

703
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,459
-How beautiful.
-Look.

704
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,836
-It really is a rainbow.
-Where did the wagon go?

705
00:58:28,837 --> 00:58:30,422
It was right here a minute ago.

706
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:33,759
-Where did it go?
-Where is the wagon?

707
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,874
I am surprised to hear my voice echo
in Danhyanggok.

708
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:08,877
Nice.

709
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,925
What? Mu-deok is drunk?

710
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:17,052
Are you saying she has been drinking here?

711
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,305
She almost got dragged
to Cheonbugwan today.

712
00:59:20,264 --> 00:59:23,267
But fortunately,
the Crown Prince saved her.

713
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,062
-The Crown Prince?
-Yes.

714
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,856
She did a great job of humoring him.

715
00:59:28,939 --> 00:59:30,524
She knows how to flatter too.

716
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:33,527
She drank every glass of alcohol
that he offered to her.

717
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,658
Where is she?

718
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,397
She is completely wasted.

719
01:00:11,523 --> 01:00:13,567
Mu-deok, are you all right?

720
01:00:17,154 --> 01:00:20,074
My pupil, you have come for me.

721
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:24,453
Yes, I am here for you, Master.

722
01:00:25,746 --> 01:00:28,499
I have no control over my body.

723
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:31,168
I am also having trouble
keeping my head up.

724
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:34,838
This has never happened to me before,
no matter how much I drank.

725
01:00:36,548 --> 01:00:38,509
You are no longer a skilled assassin.

726
01:00:39,635 --> 01:00:40,803
You are just Mu-deok.

727
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,646
I cannot even hold my liquor in this body.

728
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:14,586
I want to give everything up
and live a quiet life.

729
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,007
But one thing keeps bothering me.

730
01:01:45,492 --> 01:01:48,078
I thought I fell
from somewhere really high up.

731
01:01:49,788 --> 01:01:51,665
But I guess it was not that high.

732
01:02:01,216 --> 01:02:02,634
I think I broke my leg.

733
01:02:03,218 --> 01:02:04,428
Help me.

734
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:09,016
I saw you using that
to summon your bird a few times.

735
01:02:11,435 --> 01:02:12,728
I would also like to try.

736
01:02:12,811 --> 01:02:15,230
Can I have that?

737
01:02:30,662 --> 01:02:32,498
I came to give it back.

738
01:03:04,613 --> 01:03:06,198
Mu-deok!

739
01:03:06,281 --> 01:03:07,449
I saw Mu-deok.

740
01:03:12,746 --> 01:03:14,248
She really is here.

741
01:03:15,332 --> 01:03:16,166
Where is Uk?

742
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,418
I told you not to run.

743
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,755
What is going on?

744
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,048
Why are you here?

745
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:25,050
We could not find you at Sari Village,

746
01:03:25,133 --> 01:03:27,636
so we came here
to look for you just in case.

747
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:30,305
Ju-wol was right. You really are here.

748
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,808
Mu-deok, have you been well?

749
01:03:33,767 --> 01:03:34,935
Yes.

750
01:04:00,502 --> 01:04:03,463
Look at you, Mu-deok.
You must be really happy to see him.

751
01:04:04,256 --> 01:04:05,841
Oh, my gosh.

752
01:04:06,842 --> 01:04:07,801
She is drunk.

753
01:04:08,927 --> 01:04:10,554
Did she drink?

754
01:04:10,637 --> 01:04:12,180
-Yes.
-Yes, she did.

755
01:04:12,764 --> 01:04:14,099
Help her climb back up.

756
01:04:14,683 --> 01:04:15,684
You can carry her.

757
01:04:25,485 --> 01:04:27,905
Mu-deok used to come
to Danhyanggok to pick herbs.

758
01:04:27,988 --> 01:04:31,199
A man named Master Lee lives here,
and he is letting us stay with him.

759
01:04:31,283 --> 01:04:33,660
I cannot believe
Mu-deok got drunk all by herself.

760
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:35,078
She must be enjoying life.

761
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,831
I did not know there was
a place like this in Danhyanggok.

762
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:39,833
You knew about Danhyanggok?

763
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:42,085
He used to come here often in the past.

764
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:45,047
He got in trouble
for sneaking out all the time.

765
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:46,214
He did?

766
01:04:46,715 --> 01:04:48,842
He was crazy about birds.

767
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:51,386
Why would you come here all by yourself?

768
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,971
You even broke your leg here.

769
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,225
Because I missed them.

770
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:03,857
The broken leg did not bother me.

771
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,735
And I was not scared to get scolded.

772
01:05:10,155 --> 01:05:11,990
I liked them a lot.

773
01:05:27,172 --> 01:05:29,633
He is way too fond of birds.

774
01:05:30,467 --> 01:05:33,261
By the way, what kind of tea is this?

775
01:05:33,345 --> 01:05:36,014
-It smells really nice.
-Did you drink that?

776
01:05:38,433 --> 01:05:40,560
Yes. Why? Is it good for you?

777
01:05:41,561 --> 01:05:42,437
Of course.

778
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,523
It was made with a medicinal herb

779
01:05:44,606 --> 01:05:47,025
that can only be found in Danhyanggok.

780
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:48,193
Really?

781
01:05:48,276 --> 01:05:50,362
-Yul, have some more.
-Do not drink…

782
01:05:50,862 --> 01:05:51,905
Fine, go ahead.

783
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:54,241
-It really smells nice.
-Yes, I know.

784
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:58,286
That is chaste tea.

785
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:00,747
What? Chives tea?

786
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:03,417
You will all lose your…

787
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:08,046
-Is this made with chives?
-I am not sure if it was chives.

788
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:09,756
Well…

789
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,759
It was made
with a lot of ingredients. Drink up.

790
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:15,554
This is nice.

791
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:20,767
Enjoy.

792
01:06:51,965 --> 01:06:54,176
A group of suspicious men
had my Spirit Plaque?

793
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,635
Yes.

794
01:06:55,719 --> 01:06:57,637
Did you really lose your Spirit Plaque?

795
01:06:57,721 --> 01:07:00,057
Did someone steal it from you,
or did you lend it?

796
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:02,350
No, I lost it.

797
01:07:02,434 --> 01:07:04,978
Do you remember
when and where you lost it?

798
01:07:06,813 --> 01:07:07,647
No.

799
01:07:07,731 --> 01:07:10,233
We found it while investigating
the soul shifter's case.

800
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:12,152
This is very important and dangerous.

801
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,538
The marriage of Jin Cho-yeon and Jang Uk?

802
01:07:24,122 --> 01:07:26,666
That is a magnificent idea.

803
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:30,962
But when two people get married,
they should love each other.

804
01:07:31,046 --> 01:07:34,758
He cannot marry someone he does not love,
just to resolve an urgent matter.

805
01:07:34,841 --> 01:07:38,720
Look at you babbling on about love.
That is why you two are still single.

806
01:07:39,596 --> 01:07:42,307
Marriage is no fantasy.

807
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:43,934
I know what love is.

808
01:07:44,017 --> 01:07:45,102
I even once

809
01:07:45,185 --> 01:07:48,855
turned my back on my own master for love.

810
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:51,483
However, it was all for nothing.

811
01:07:51,566 --> 01:07:52,692
Let us push forward

812
01:07:53,485 --> 01:07:54,444
with the wedding.

813
01:07:59,866 --> 01:08:01,618
An unknown man has
broken our barrier and entered.

814
01:08:06,331 --> 01:08:09,793
Heo Yeom, come outside and greet me.

815
01:08:09,876 --> 01:08:13,672
Who dares to call me by my name?

816
01:08:18,468 --> 01:08:19,511
Yeom.

817
01:08:20,762 --> 01:08:22,097
Have you been well?

818
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,057
Master.

819
01:08:24,891 --> 01:08:25,934
Master.

820
01:08:26,643 --> 01:08:27,686
Master!

821
01:08:29,229 --> 01:08:30,230
Master.

822
01:08:30,313 --> 01:08:32,274
Goodness, Master.

823
01:08:34,067 --> 01:08:35,360
Oh, dear.

824
01:08:35,443 --> 01:08:37,320
Put down your swords! Put them away!

825
01:09:00,051 --> 01:09:01,219
Mu-deok.

826
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:04,806
I thought you were sleeping.
I looked for you everywhere.

827
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,725
Are you still drunk?

828
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:10,020
I thought I might be able to climb it
when I was drunk.

829
01:09:11,146 --> 01:09:14,649
But it is too tall.
I am starting to sober up.

830
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:18,278
Is this the tree
with the bird's nest on top?

831
01:09:18,361 --> 01:09:19,404
Yes.

832
01:09:20,864 --> 01:09:22,908
I want to climb up that tree again.

833
01:09:24,284 --> 01:09:27,704
Did you really climb
all the way to the top?

834
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:30,665
I was Naksu then.

835
01:09:32,292 --> 01:09:35,253
The moon from up there looked beautiful.

836
01:09:36,504 --> 01:09:38,798
But I can no longer see it with this body.

837
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:43,011
I ran into one of Danju's men today.

838
01:09:43,678 --> 01:09:45,180
He seemed suspicious of me.

839
01:09:46,097 --> 01:09:48,808
By any chance,
did you give him my Spirit Plaque?

840
01:09:48,892 --> 01:09:51,102
I tried to use the Spirit Plaque
to go back.

841
01:09:51,895 --> 01:09:54,564
But he killed the person
whom he thought was me.

842
01:09:57,567 --> 01:09:59,611
If I ever happen to get caught by them,

843
01:10:00,528 --> 01:10:01,863
do not try to save me.

844
01:10:03,907 --> 01:10:05,992
Of course. I am too weak to help anyway.

845
01:10:08,328 --> 01:10:11,081
There is nothing
your pupil can do for you.

846
01:10:14,626 --> 01:10:16,002
I expected nothing from you.

847
01:10:19,714 --> 01:10:20,799
Mu-deok.

848
01:10:21,466 --> 01:10:24,386
I may not be able to do much,
but I think I can climb that tree.

849
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:28,056
There are no branches
for you to stand on at the top.

850
01:10:29,057 --> 01:10:31,101
You must use your energy
to create a foothold.

851
01:10:31,726 --> 01:10:34,187
You must master Chisu in order to do that.

852
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:36,523
You are nowhere near that level.

853
01:10:36,606 --> 01:10:38,400
I wanted to do nothing,

854
01:10:39,192 --> 01:10:41,027
but I feel motivated to climb this tree.

855
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:49,244
You said you want
to see the moon from there.

856
01:10:49,327 --> 01:10:51,496
I am the only one
who can take you up there,

857
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,498
so I would like to try.

858
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:56,126
Do you wish to go up there?

859
01:10:58,211 --> 01:11:01,172
You must master Chisu
in order to be able to climb up there.

860
01:11:02,882 --> 01:11:04,426
Do you wish to go up there?

861
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:11,474
Then do me a favor, Uk.

862
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,227
Take me up there.

863
01:11:16,229 --> 01:11:17,480
Fine.

864
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:20,817
I will take you to the top of that tree.

865
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:07,280
How is Uk doing?

866
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:10,033
Do you know who my real father is?

867
01:12:10,116 --> 01:12:12,744
Nobody is expecting you
to come to that duel.

868
01:12:12,827 --> 01:12:15,955
His next step could lead him to his death.

869
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:18,166
Is your young master aware of that?

870
01:12:18,249 --> 01:12:21,336
You have met Naksu when you were young?

871
01:12:21,419 --> 01:12:22,796
I do not know her name or age.

872
01:12:22,879 --> 01:12:24,756
Other than the cliff
where we called out for birds,

873
01:12:24,839 --> 01:12:26,383
I have never been to her abode.

874
01:12:26,466 --> 01:12:28,635
Is this the Jin family's abode?

875
01:12:28,718 --> 01:12:31,471
Lady Jin's daughter is getting married.

876
01:12:31,554 --> 01:12:34,349
What should I do, Master?
Should I get married?

877
01:12:34,432 --> 01:12:37,143
I have no plans
to stay by your side as just a maid.

878
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:44,234
