00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:09,961
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:38,239
If something happens to Yul,

3
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:40,784
Uk will see red.

4
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:43,745
He has been suppressing his anger
for a very long time.

5
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:45,246
But…

6
00:00:45,872 --> 00:00:47,707
if the men from Cheonbugwan harm Yul,

7
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,542
Uk will explode.

8
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:51,002
I hope nothing happens--

9
00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:53,088
I know where the gambling den is.
Let me take you there.

10
00:00:53,171 --> 00:00:55,256
I also know where the gambling den
in Gaema Village is.

11
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,884
Something might have happened there,
so please stay here.

12
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,654
Yul.

13
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:20,532
Yul.

14
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,493
Uk.

15
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:27,580
I am sorry.

16
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:56,276
Not a single person…

17
00:01:57,443 --> 00:01:58,945
will be able to walk out of here alive.

18
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,339
What is this blood parasite?

19
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:21,009
It is a creature

20
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:24,012
that you put in someone's bloodstream.

21
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,431
We put it in So-i's bloodstream,

22
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:30,602
but I do not know why Seo Yul has it.

23
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:32,562
Who put that thing in So-i's body?

24
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:36,649
-Was it Jin Mu's doing?
-Yes.

25
00:03:06,804 --> 00:03:07,764
Yul.

26
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,683
Yul.

27
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:20,860
Seo Yul was attacked
by mages of Cheonbugwan?

28
00:03:20,944 --> 00:03:21,861
What do you mean?

29
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:23,363
I just heard from Songrim.

30
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:24,572
Everyone is panicking.

31
00:03:24,656 --> 00:03:26,032
They must be mistaken.

32
00:03:26,115 --> 00:03:28,493
Why would Cheonbugwan mages
ever attack him?

33
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,786
My lord!

34
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:32,413
We have a problem.

35
00:03:32,497 --> 00:03:35,083
Yeom-su and our mages were attacked
at the gambling den in Gaema Village.

36
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,000
What?

37
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:38,503
Why? Who attacked them?

38
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:41,464
It was Jang Uk.
He single-handedly subdued them all.

39
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,303
More than ten Cheonbugwan mages
attacked Seo Yul.

40
00:03:47,387 --> 00:03:48,680
Had it not been for Jang Uk,

41
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:50,723
Yul would have died.

42
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:54,352
Did you say Yul was taken to Sejukwon?

43
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,980
How is he?

44
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:59,732
Seo Yul's health is in grave danger,
Your Majesty.

45
00:04:00,483 --> 00:04:02,694
If Seo Yul dies,

46
00:04:03,486 --> 00:04:06,197
it will start a great clash
between Songrim and Cheonbugwan.

47
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:15,540
The blood parasite
is inside his core of energy.

48
00:04:16,082 --> 00:04:17,875
Then you should remove it.

49
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,380
There is no way to remove a blood parasite
that is inside a mage's core of energy.

50
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:25,508
It will only come out after he dies.

51
00:04:25,591 --> 00:04:27,260
Using his energy

52
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:29,971
would have surged
the blood parasite's energy,

53
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:32,015
thus making it painful for him.

54
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:33,558
He fought in this state.

55
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:37,186
One can only imagine how much pain
he was in until the last moment.

56
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,731
What do you mean, last moment?

57
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:42,984
Are you telling me he will die?

58
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:44,569
Yul.

59
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,779
Please find a way.

60
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:50,408
We cannot let him die like this.

61
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,036
He must have suffered unbearable pain.

62
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,874
Yul.

63
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:12,722
Yul's Lantern of Life
is in Seoho Fortress.

64
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:14,098
SEO YUL

65
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:17,852
The light will die out if Yul passes away.

66
00:05:18,436 --> 00:05:21,856
Then his father, General Seo,

67
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:24,192
will immediately come to the capital

68
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:27,528
to find out the cause of his abrupt death.

69
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,282
The Seo family obeyed
Master Seo Gyeong's commands

70
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,242
and has been protecting Seoho Fortress
along the borders.

71
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:36,454
If they come to the capital
and clash with Cheonbugwan,

72
00:05:37,497 --> 00:05:38,998
a war could break out.

73
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:40,124
Seo Il

74
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,627
is your elder brother, is he not?

75
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,004
Please try to dissuade him.

76
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:48,216
He would never listen to his sister

77
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:51,469
who has the appearance of Shaman Choi
as a result of the alchemy of souls.

78
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:54,097
Instead,

79
00:05:54,972 --> 00:05:57,058
you should worry
about how Songrim will react to this.

80
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,485
I have not seen Uk for a while now.

81
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:08,402
I believe

82
00:06:09,195 --> 00:06:10,530
he has gone to Cheonbugwan.

83
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:14,283
I have no intentions of dissuading him.

84
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:17,245
They pushed the heir of the Seo family
to the brink of death.

85
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:20,123
Cheonbugwan should pay
for what they have done.

86
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:24,335
I will support Uk.

87
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,837
What will Songrim do?

88
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,464
Uncle.

89
00:06:28,548 --> 00:06:30,633
I am not yet confident
to represent Songrim.

90
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:32,552
But given what happened to my friend,

91
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:34,595
I will support Uk as well.

92
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:36,973
Park Dang-gu.

93
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:38,683
As the leader of Songrim,
you should protect it.

94
00:06:41,394 --> 00:06:43,855
Master Heo, please take care of Yul.

95
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:47,233
Gather the mages.

96
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:51,821
I will go to Cheonbugwan myself.

97
00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:58,077
Seo Yul's death must never
be attributed to Cheonbugwan.

98
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:01,289
Summon the Unanimous Assembly right now.
We must plead our innocence.

99
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:02,290
-Yes.
-My lord.

100
00:07:02,373 --> 00:07:04,208
-He is on his way.
-Who is?

101
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:06,711
Jang Uk is coming to Cheonbugwan
as we speak.

102
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:30,693
Jang Uk

103
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:33,654
is coming for me.

104
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:36,782
Gather all the mages of Cheonbugwan.

105
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:39,327
Stop Jang Uk from entering Cheonbugwan!

106
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,369
Yes, my lord.

107
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:50,338
Jang Uk is headed to Cheonbugwan.

108
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:52,465
Songrim is taking action as well.

109
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:54,967
Your Royal Highness, what shall we do?

110
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:23,037
Fire!

111
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,727
Stop! His Royal Highness is here.

112
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:02,827
-Stop it here, Jang Uk.
-Please move.

113
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,704
Will you keep fighting them?

114
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:06,289
I do not care.

115
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:07,331
I will

116
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:10,001
kill Jin Mu.

117
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:11,168
To do that,

118
00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:14,338
you will have to kill
all of Cheonbugwan's mages

119
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:15,256
as well as

120
00:09:16,257 --> 00:09:18,301
all of the royal soldiers.

121
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:21,387
If they get in my way to protect him,

122
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:23,848
then I have no other choice.

123
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:28,185
You are not an exception.

124
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:29,103
So…

125
00:09:30,354 --> 00:09:32,523
keep hiding behind him,
like you always do.

126
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:38,237
I am not trying
to protect Jin Mu from you!

127
00:09:42,825 --> 00:09:46,078
I do not want
all your hard work to come to no avail.

128
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,956
I know that the sword in your hands

129
00:09:49,832 --> 00:09:52,168
reflects your grief, hatred, and rage.

130
00:10:00,176 --> 00:10:01,218
Then you must also know

131
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,930
to whom these emotions are directed.

132
00:10:07,683 --> 00:10:09,435
I know it is because of me.

133
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:13,564
That is the reason
I was uncomfortable with facing you.

134
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:18,611
To stop yourself
from wielding that sword at the world,

135
00:10:18,694 --> 00:10:22,031
you painstakingly suppressed
and buried all those feelings inside.

136
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:28,663
I do not want your hard work
to go down the drain.

137
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:37,713
That is why I am standing before you

138
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:41,676
even though I know you can slay me.

139
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:46,889
He is about to attack
His Royal Highness! Fire!

140
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:48,933
Stop!

141
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:03,447
From now on, Songrim will support Jang Uk.

142
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:05,741
We will stand with his decisions

143
00:11:06,575 --> 00:11:07,868
and fight alongside him.

144
00:11:08,828 --> 00:11:09,912
So, Jang Uk,

145
00:11:10,496 --> 00:11:12,039
deliberate carefully

146
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,168
where you point that sword.

147
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:36,522
If you point your sword towards me

148
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:39,775
and wield it against me,

149
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:43,904
then I will have to fight them as well.

150
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:47,408
I know that you neither like nor trust me.

151
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:48,534
However,

152
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:52,746
please do not fall short
of my expectations.

153
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,082
Then I will wait here.

154
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:59,253
Bring Jin Mu to me.

155
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:12,975
Cheonbugwan officials may have
harmed Seo Yul,

156
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:15,603
but they all died at Jang Uk's hand.

157
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:19,356
We could follow the mages' customs
and drop this issue.

158
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,608
So why

159
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:23,569
must I take responsibility for Seo Yul?

160
00:12:23,652 --> 00:12:25,821
You must take responsibility
for the blood parasite.

161
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:29,867
The blood parasite?

162
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,119
His life is at risk

163
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:34,371
due to the blood parasite
in his core of energy.

164
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:37,208
Before he died,

165
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,251
Yeom-su confessed that it was your doing.

166
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:44,840
I only put that blood parasite
in an individual

167
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:47,134
to keep them under my control.

168
00:12:47,218 --> 00:12:49,470
So I do not know how it ended up

169
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:51,514
in Seo Yul's body.

170
00:12:51,597 --> 00:12:52,431
Nevertheless,

171
00:12:52,515 --> 00:12:55,809
if Cheonbugwan officials tried to kill him
to keep it a secret,

172
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:58,729
you must take responsibility
as the Gwanju.

173
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:04,193
But why did the blood parasite…

174
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:06,654
Thankfully, Seo Yul is still alive.

175
00:13:07,488 --> 00:13:09,281
If you find a way to save him,

176
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:12,368
they will not try to kill you.

177
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:13,536
I do not know.

178
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:17,039
Jin U-tak was the one who took
that blood parasite from Jinyowon.

179
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:19,583
I do not know how to control it,

180
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:22,127
let alone remove it
from his core of energy.

181
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:24,255
You must find a way.

182
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:26,257
If not,

183
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:30,010
Jang Uk will never back down.

184
00:13:49,738 --> 00:13:52,116
Will you be staying here
until Jin Mu comes?

185
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,285
I am waiting
so as to act with deliberation.

186
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:58,539
Then my target will appear before me.

187
00:13:58,622 --> 00:14:02,167
Is Jin Mu not your target?

188
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:07,131
Please stay by Yul's side.

189
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:11,635
I will find a way to save him and return.

190
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:25,065
You endangered the heir of the Seo family?

191
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:29,153
Jin Mu, you must take
full responsibility for this incident.

192
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:31,447
If this causes Seoho Fortress
to take action,

193
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,616
a war will be inevitable.

194
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:34,742
What will you do?

195
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:37,286
Look what you have done!

196
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:42,416
I summoned you all here

197
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:46,128
so that we could find
a way to prevent that outcome.

198
00:14:46,211 --> 00:14:48,589
How would we know
how to remove a blood parasite

199
00:14:48,672 --> 00:14:50,299
when we have never seen one before?

200
00:14:50,382 --> 00:14:54,845
If Seo Yul dies,
you will also die at the hands of Jang Uk.

201
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:58,307
You must beg for his forgiveness at once
and sacrifice yourself!

202
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,643
Then at least we can prevent
a war from occurring!

203
00:15:00,726 --> 00:15:01,936
You must do that!

204
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:04,229
-We cannot have a war!
-Take full responsibility!

205
00:15:04,313 --> 00:15:05,481
Please calm down.

206
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,316
I desperately plead

207
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:09,860
for your help.

208
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:17,368
If the blood parasite is from Jinyowon,

209
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:19,870
then Lady Jin may know how to take it out.

210
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:22,998
But she has a heavy grudge
against Gwanju Jin Mu.

211
00:15:23,082 --> 00:15:24,291
I doubt she will help.

212
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,501
He will have to beg.

213
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:27,753
Jinyowon is our only hope.

214
00:15:35,094 --> 00:15:35,928
Ho-gyeong.

215
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:38,555
Please save your brother.

216
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,017
I have come here
to beg before you on my knees.

217
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:44,979
What a humiliating sight
for the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan.

218
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:48,607
I guess you must fear Jang Uk after all.

219
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:53,779
Jinyowon is not completely innocent either

220
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:55,572
since the blood parasite came from here.

221
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:58,617
That was done by Jin U-tak and you.
It had nothing to do with me.

222
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:00,577
Lady Jin.

223
00:16:01,537 --> 00:16:03,205
If Seo Yul dies like this,

224
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:05,958
the Seo family will have resentment
toward you as well.

225
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,084
I am not afraid.

226
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,506
Let us say Seo Yul dies,
and my life is at stake.

227
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:14,967
Do you think I will die alone?

228
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:18,053
You and I are both from the Jin family.

229
00:16:18,137 --> 00:16:19,513
We must share the responsibility

230
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:22,349
and Jinyowon must share my demise.

231
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:29,606
I command Lady Jin
to find a way to save Seo Yul

232
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,358
and make Jang Uk leave.

233
00:16:32,484 --> 00:16:34,778
It is nerve-racking to know
that he is out there.

234
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,407
It suffocates me.

235
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,077
Find a way to settle this matter,

236
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:45,080
whether it is by sacrificing yourselves
or offering a solution.

237
00:16:57,676 --> 00:16:58,635
As I said I would,

238
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:01,013
I have brought Jin Mu.

239
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:15,527
I believe there has been
a deep misunderstanding.

240
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:20,824
But as the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan,
I take full responsibility and apologize

241
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:23,535
for putting the heir
of the Seo family at risk.

242
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,163
No.

243
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,832
You should apologize to Yul, not me.

244
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:30,626
After curing him.

245
00:17:33,045 --> 00:17:34,421
Of course.

246
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:37,549
That is exactly
why I have found a way to save him.

247
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:39,468
Ho-gyeong.

248
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:52,815
I have persuaded her and found a way.

249
00:17:59,988 --> 00:18:00,823
Here we are

250
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:03,492
once again.

251
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:05,911
You have managed to drag me out at last

252
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:08,080
after causing all this mess.

253
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:10,541
That is why

254
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:15,087
you should have told me earlier
when I was asking politely.

255
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:20,968
So-i was not captured and brought here.

256
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:23,887
She came on her own
to save Yul, did she not?

257
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:29,351
So he was the one
she was desperately trying to save.

258
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:33,188
You know a way to remove
that blood parasite, right?

259
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:35,941
Yul is dying.

260
00:18:38,193 --> 00:18:40,571
Please help him. I beg of you.

261
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:46,577
I am not interested
in whether he lives or dies.

262
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,250
I am sorry.

263
00:19:05,012 --> 00:19:06,763
You said you were not interested,

264
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,099
so I tried to grab your attention.

265
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:10,517
And in the end,

266
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:12,436
here you are.

267
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,147
I did not have to move from this place.

268
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:22,821
You were not here to slay me after all.

269
00:19:22,905 --> 00:19:26,533
You were using me to persuade her.

270
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:29,786
With my friend's life at stake,
my top priority is to save him.

271
00:19:30,454 --> 00:19:32,706
Not to kill someone with the likes of you.

272
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,042
The likes of me?

273
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:44,843
You should have let me in on this
if you knew in advance.

274
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:50,307
Then I would not have had
to humiliate myself by apologizing to him.

275
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:55,812
I would have never suffered
the humiliation of coming here by myself.

276
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,066
You may go now.

277
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:02,903
Come to Jinyowon,
and I will tell you what the solution is.

278
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:21,338
You had been obedient
for the past three years.

279
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:25,092
But you put everyone
in a state of panic simply by coming here.

280
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:27,678
Cheonbugwan, Songrim, Jinyowon,

281
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:31,306
the royal family, the Unanimous Assembly,
and even Seoho Fortress.

282
00:20:32,975 --> 00:20:34,351
You sure are incredible.

283
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:37,771
Nevertheless,

284
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,234
I stopped like you asked me to.

285
00:20:48,991 --> 00:20:50,117
Gwanju.

286
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:54,579
You should go to the constellation basin
and pray to the stars

287
00:20:54,663 --> 00:20:56,999
that Yul will survive this ordeal
by whatever means.

288
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:00,043
If Yul does not survive,

289
00:21:02,087 --> 00:21:03,255
you will surely die.

290
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:32,617
I am sorry.

291
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:35,203
I should have
immediately let the others know

292
00:21:36,705 --> 00:21:37,998
when I detected that in you.

293
00:21:47,758 --> 00:21:49,468
But all I can do is see.

294
00:21:53,764 --> 00:21:54,973
There is nothing I can do.

295
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,978
Only three breaths.

296
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:03,857
I cherish all the memories
I had in Danhyanggok.

297
00:22:10,197 --> 00:22:11,740
Do not touch him without permission.

298
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,205
Do you not understand
that he is in a dire situation?

299
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:25,796
I heard you kept quiet all along
despite being aware of his condition.

300
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:31,843
Stop interfering and leave.

301
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,352
What was that just now?

302
00:22:52,364 --> 00:22:53,824
Young Lady Heo.

303
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:57,285
I do not know which medicine
Young Master Seo has been taking.

304
00:22:57,369 --> 00:22:59,704
He had packed up his belongings,
so I brought them all.

305
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,666
Are you looking for his medicine?

306
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:03,583
Yes.

307
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:16,763
What is that?

308
00:23:18,306 --> 00:23:20,267
It seems to be
a letter sealed with energy.

309
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,520
I told you not to touch anything
without permission.

310
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,942
I thought maybe he wrote down
the name of his medicine.

311
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:30,527
I can look at it myself.

312
00:23:31,236 --> 00:23:32,070
You should go.

313
00:23:40,704 --> 00:23:42,831
Was Young Master Seo
the one who sealed it?

314
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:45,041
I believe so.

315
00:23:49,004 --> 00:23:52,048
I asked him to come to Danhyanggok with me
when he was in pain.

316
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:58,388
But what was that memory about?

317
00:23:59,097 --> 00:24:01,683
There is no way I went
to Danhyanggok with Seo Yul before.

318
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:03,476
Young Lady Bu-yeon.

319
00:24:04,561 --> 00:24:06,813
There is a way. We can save Yul!

320
00:24:06,897 --> 00:24:07,731
Is that so?

321
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:10,650
Lady Jin said there is a way
to remove the blood parasite.

322
00:24:11,443 --> 00:24:14,029
My uncle and Uk have gone
to Jinyowon to speak with her.

323
00:24:15,447 --> 00:24:18,700
My mother agreed to tell Uk
how to remove the blood parasite?

324
00:24:18,783 --> 00:24:22,370
Yes, if Lady Jin helps us,
Yul will be able to live.

325
00:24:22,454 --> 00:24:24,372
Uk will do anything she asks him to do.

326
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:26,499
He will save Yul at all costs.

327
00:24:28,043 --> 00:24:28,877
I am sure he will.

328
00:24:32,547 --> 00:24:33,590
He should.

329
00:24:34,758 --> 00:24:35,592
At all costs.

330
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:38,345
The blood parasite is like an insect.

331
00:24:39,137 --> 00:24:42,098
And birds are
the greatest predators of insects.

332
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:45,352
Jinyowon has the most powerful bird.

333
00:24:47,145 --> 00:24:47,979
The fire bird.

334
00:24:51,066 --> 00:24:52,859
The fire bird is the solution?

335
00:24:53,985 --> 00:24:55,070
It is too dangerous.

336
00:24:55,153 --> 00:24:58,114
It is dangerous, but it is not impossible.

337
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:01,701
Because we have Jang Uk.

338
00:25:04,955 --> 00:25:07,999
I will do anything you want.
So please tell me how to save him.

339
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:10,168
In that case, let me ask you something.

340
00:25:10,252 --> 00:25:12,963
You need my help to save him.

341
00:25:13,046 --> 00:25:16,258
If I agree to help,
will you truly do anything I ask of you?

342
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:20,887
Send Bu-yeon back home.

343
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:23,723
Then I will help you.

344
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:25,934
If you refuse,

345
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:30,188
I will not help you.

346
00:25:30,772 --> 00:25:33,984
In that case,
you will not be able to save him

347
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:36,528
even if you know how to.

348
00:25:37,153 --> 00:25:37,988
All right.

349
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,323
I will do as you say.

350
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,867
So please help us.

351
00:25:46,204 --> 00:25:47,122
As for Bu-yeon,

352
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:51,876
I will send her back.

353
00:25:54,212 --> 00:25:55,046
Thank you.

354
00:25:57,716 --> 00:26:00,802
Since you are a witness,
I will trust that Uk will keep his word.

355
00:26:00,885 --> 00:26:04,931
I will help you save Seo Yul.

356
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:09,394
Thank you for agreeing to help.

357
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:16,943
The fire bird?

358
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:20,405
It may be dangerous,
but it is worth a shot.

359
00:26:20,488 --> 00:26:23,867
Dang-gu, go fetch Cho-yeon.

360
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,702
We will need the Jin family's blood.

361
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:27,704
All right, I will fetch her right away.

362
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,790
You should go to Seoho Fortress.

363
00:26:30,874 --> 00:26:33,668
If Yul's father hears strange rumors,

364
00:26:33,752 --> 00:26:35,170
it will be a headache.

365
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:38,298
Let him know the details of the situation
and reassure him.

366
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:40,967
I will tell him
that Yul will live at all costs,

367
00:26:41,051 --> 00:26:42,260
so please save him.

368
00:26:44,012 --> 00:26:45,722
Uk, you have the biggest role.

369
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:47,682
You must enter Jinyowon.

370
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:51,311
You will meet someone
who will help you there.

371
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:53,855
-Do not fight with him.
-Him?

372
00:26:55,106 --> 00:26:56,149
Who is he?

373
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:05,700
I will enter Jinyowon alongside Jang Uk.

374
00:27:05,784 --> 00:27:08,953
If you argue in there
and awaken the fire bird,

375
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:12,832
this world will go down in flames.

376
00:27:15,377 --> 00:27:16,628
This will be dangerous.

377
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:18,046
That is why, Lady Jin,

378
00:27:18,129 --> 00:27:22,050
you must tell Jang Uk beforehand
that he must listen to me.

379
00:27:23,176 --> 00:27:25,512
Come on. Do you think
the Crown Prince will listen to me?

380
00:27:25,595 --> 00:27:29,224
If he does not swallow his pride
and listen to me, everything will fail.

381
00:27:29,307 --> 00:27:31,267
He went to Master Heo himself

382
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:33,686
and offered to help save Yul.

383
00:27:34,312 --> 00:27:36,314
Could it be because of the turtle?

384
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,608
What turtle?

385
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:43,863
He is acting like a turtle
and slowly crawling toward me.

386
00:27:43,947 --> 00:27:47,242
Or you could be slowly letting him in.

387
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,245
But Uk…

388
00:27:52,372 --> 00:27:54,541
Will you really be all right without her?

389
00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:01,423
I did expect Lady Jin

390
00:28:02,424 --> 00:28:04,926
to ask for her daughter back
in return for helping us.

391
00:28:05,635 --> 00:28:07,303
If she goes back,

392
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:11,057
you will not be able to kill yourself
by removing that ice stone.

393
00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:13,518
Just like how you made
those dreadful noodles for me,

394
00:28:14,144 --> 00:28:15,812
I was comforted by someone else too.

395
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:18,064
That is when her words,

396
00:28:18,148 --> 00:28:20,859
"It is better to die than to do nothing,"
came to mind.

397
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:22,402
In fact,

398
00:28:22,944 --> 00:28:25,655
it was her way of encouraging me
to do anything I could.

399
00:28:28,158 --> 00:28:28,992
Uk,

400
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:32,412
who would you save
if Maidservant Kim and I were drowning?

401
00:28:32,495 --> 00:28:33,413
Maidservant Kim.

402
00:28:33,496 --> 00:28:35,081
You should save both of us, you fool.

403
00:28:35,165 --> 00:28:39,627
Yul and Bu-yeon are drowning right now.

404
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:43,256
And you are planning to give up on her
because Yul is in grave danger.

405
00:28:44,257 --> 00:28:45,717
Since he is in grave danger,

406
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,386
I cannot afford to think about saving her.

407
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,222
That is wrong.

408
00:28:54,184 --> 00:28:56,227
If it is someone dear to you,

409
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,523
you should not think of letting them go
as if you are abandoning them.

410
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:11,075
I felt bad for keeping her by my side.

411
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:14,329
It is all…

412
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:17,874
for the best.

413
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:39,229
-I heard you went to Jinyowon.
-I did.

414
00:29:39,312 --> 00:29:42,273
Did my mother tell you how to save Yul?

415
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,193
Yes.

416
00:29:45,276 --> 00:29:46,528
That is a relief.

417
00:29:48,905 --> 00:29:49,989
Let me help.

418
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:52,116
Maybe I could be of use as well.

419
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,954
You have already done
everything you could to help.

420
00:29:58,873 --> 00:29:59,707
Still.

421
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,004
I should do everything I can
until the very end.

422
00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:13,972
You do not need to do that.

423
00:30:16,057 --> 00:30:16,891
Just stay here.

424
00:30:17,725 --> 00:30:18,935
I will explain everything

425
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,479
once it is over.

426
00:30:29,654 --> 00:30:31,072
I am not doing this for you.

427
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:33,283
He is my friend as well.

428
00:30:33,908 --> 00:30:34,993
I feel indebted to him.

429
00:30:37,245 --> 00:30:38,079
I want to help.

430
00:30:44,752 --> 00:30:45,587
Fine.

431
00:30:46,796 --> 00:30:47,630
You can help.

432
00:30:49,257 --> 00:30:50,091
Let us go.

433
00:31:01,352 --> 00:31:03,938
He chose to let me go.

434
00:31:10,945 --> 00:31:13,656
Let me brief you
on this parasite-removal operation

435
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,201
that Master Heo has planned out for Yul.

436
00:31:18,286 --> 00:31:20,413
A blood parasite
is in the core of his energy,

437
00:31:20,496 --> 00:31:23,625
and it has sucked
all of his torrent of energy.

438
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:26,961
He can only live if we remove it
and leave his torrent of energy behind.

439
00:31:27,545 --> 00:31:30,965
The fire bird can remove
the blood parasite from his body.

440
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:33,760
We must remove the blood parasite

441
00:31:33,843 --> 00:31:37,680
with the energy of the fire bird
that is inside Jinyowon

442
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:40,558
and make it expel
the torrent of energy it has consumed.

443
00:31:40,642 --> 00:31:43,561
But there are two critical issues.

444
00:31:45,688 --> 00:31:46,856
First,

445
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,360
we cannot take him to Jinyowon,
given his state.

446
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:53,488
And the fire bird cannot
be taken out of Jinyowon either.

447
00:31:54,656 --> 00:31:58,076
Second, it is too dangerous
to break the fire bird's barrier.

448
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,870
So we must use its energy
without breaking down the barrier.

449
00:32:00,954 --> 00:32:03,539
The first issue is
already impossible to resolve.

450
00:32:03,623 --> 00:32:06,501
We can neither move him nor the fire bird.

451
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:08,878
So how will it get rid of the parasite?

452
00:32:08,962 --> 00:32:11,798
That is exactly why we called you here.

453
00:32:12,382 --> 00:32:16,594
You must enter Jinyowon instead of him.

454
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:18,304
Me?

455
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,849
This is a water wick
that the Seo family uses

456
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:24,644
for their Lanterns of Life.

457
00:32:25,228 --> 00:32:29,941
The Seo family fills
their wicks with their energy.

458
00:32:30,024 --> 00:32:34,487
Then they connect their Lanterns of Life

459
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,989
with the core of their energy.

460
00:32:36,072 --> 00:32:40,076
I am going to fill this
with the remainder of his energy.

461
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,662
Then the blood parasite will mistake this

462
00:32:42,745 --> 00:32:46,082
for his core of energy
and enter it as well.

463
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,293
Then we can remove
the blood parasite with this.

464
00:32:49,377 --> 00:32:51,045
Did I not tell you

465
00:32:51,129 --> 00:32:52,797
that it must expel his torrent of energy?

466
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,881
But why

467
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:57,010
must I be the one to take it to Jinyowon?

468
00:32:57,093 --> 00:33:01,931
That is because the blood parasite
was made with your family's blood.

469
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:03,975
Pardon?

470
00:33:04,058 --> 00:33:06,644
Why do you think Jin Mu
put the parasite in So-i's body?

471
00:33:06,728 --> 00:33:09,272
He put your family's energy
in the parasite

472
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:11,983
and put it inside her
so she could open the door to Jinyowon.

473
00:33:14,152 --> 00:33:17,572
So the blood parasite was made
with Cho-yeon's blood.

474
00:33:17,655 --> 00:33:22,452
Once the blood parasite mistakes this
for Yul's core of energy and enters it,

475
00:33:22,535 --> 00:33:24,245
I will put this in Cho-yeon's body

476
00:33:24,328 --> 00:33:28,166
since her blood's energy is identical
to that of the blood parasite.

477
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:32,045
-Would that not be dangerous?
-All you need to do

478
00:33:32,128 --> 00:33:34,756
is put this in your mouth
and do not open it.

479
00:33:36,758 --> 00:33:37,592
Then…

480
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:39,302
I will do it.

481
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:42,805
All right, this is something
you can do even without skills.

482
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:45,308
You will be fine as long as
you have no blood parasite

483
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:47,602
-and are not with child.
-Sorry?

484
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:49,812
Wait.

485
00:33:52,148 --> 00:33:52,982
Young Lady Jin.

486
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:56,861
Remember that night?

487
00:33:58,154 --> 00:34:01,574
The day we revisited
the house we were supposed to move into.

488
00:34:02,283 --> 00:34:03,117
Maybe…

489
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:13,002
She cannot do it.

490
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:15,713
It will be too dangerous
if there is any chance she is pregnant.

491
00:34:15,797 --> 00:34:16,756
You little…

492
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:23,763
Then do we need to ask Lady Jin to do it?

493
00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:26,974
She must stay outside Jinyowon's door
and make sure the other relics

494
00:34:27,058 --> 00:34:28,184
do not become agitated.

495
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:29,102
In that case,

496
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:31,437
I can do it.

497
00:34:32,063 --> 00:34:34,649
But you two are already married.

498
00:34:34,732 --> 00:34:37,110
Will you be all right with it?

499
00:34:37,693 --> 00:34:38,528
We are fine.

500
00:34:39,862 --> 00:34:41,280
There is no possibility of it.

501
00:34:43,116 --> 00:34:44,659
-Not at all?
-No.

502
00:34:44,742 --> 00:34:46,494
Not even the slightest chance.

503
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:50,873
She is right.

504
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:56,045
-I am telling you.
-I see.

505
00:34:56,754 --> 00:35:01,843
Then you can be the one
to move his energy, Bu-yeon.

506
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:06,556
Goodness, we still need to tackle
the second problem.

507
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:10,184
How can we extract the fire bird's energy
without breaking its barrier?

508
00:35:10,268 --> 00:35:13,646
The barrier of the fire bird is made
with an energy similar to that

509
00:35:13,729 --> 00:35:17,191
of the volcano
where the fire bird was born.

510
00:35:17,275 --> 00:35:21,028
It is made with the energy
of gold weighing 30,000 nyang.

511
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:25,908
We must create the same energy
with the gold, expand the barrier,

512
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:27,493
and go inside.

513
00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:30,872
The energy of 30,000 nyang of gold?

514
00:35:31,455 --> 00:35:34,083
Where could we possibly get
that much gold right now?

515
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:36,335
Sang-ho is gathering the gold as we speak.

516
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:38,588
We are in a rush,

517
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:42,091
but I am afraid it will take some time
to gather such an amount.

518
00:35:42,175 --> 00:35:43,593
I have 30,000 nyang of gold.

519
00:35:43,676 --> 00:35:46,137
I also have that much fortune.

520
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,055
I just do not have it with me right now.

521
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:49,390
No, I have it right now.

522
00:35:52,101 --> 00:35:53,144
It is at Jeongjingak.

523
00:35:53,227 --> 00:35:54,312
What?

524
00:35:55,855 --> 00:35:56,939
Here?

525
00:35:57,023 --> 00:35:57,857
Yes.

526
00:36:12,622 --> 00:36:13,873
I stashed the Crown Prince's rewards

527
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:15,666
for slaying the soul shifters here.

528
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:20,087
You just left all of this here?

529
00:36:20,171 --> 00:36:21,631
I had nothing to spend them on

530
00:36:21,714 --> 00:36:23,382
and could not be bothered
to take them home.

531
00:36:23,466 --> 00:36:25,092
I get 1,000 nyang per kill,

532
00:36:25,176 --> 00:36:27,345
so this is definitely
more than 30,000 nyang.

533
00:36:27,428 --> 00:36:28,512
Great.

534
00:36:28,596 --> 00:36:31,390
We are fully ready
to remove that blood parasite.

535
00:36:31,474 --> 00:36:32,308
Let us begin.

536
00:36:32,975 --> 00:36:35,561
Dang-gu and Cho-yeon,
move the gold to Jinyowon.

537
00:36:36,187 --> 00:36:39,607
I will escort Bu-yeon
after she receives Yul's energy.

538
00:37:04,215 --> 00:37:07,927
Yul will no longer have
any energy within him.

539
00:37:09,011 --> 00:37:11,389
I will send all the energy in his core

540
00:37:12,556 --> 00:37:15,476
to the Lantern of Life's water wick.

541
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,113
I can see the blood parasite's energy
moving upward from the core of his energy.

542
00:37:28,572 --> 00:37:29,782
Now.

543
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,382
Open your mouth.

544
00:37:55,975 --> 00:37:56,809
You are carrying

545
00:37:57,893 --> 00:38:00,646
his remaining life in your mouth.

546
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,398
You must never

547
00:38:03,357 --> 00:38:05,693
swallow it or open your mouth.

548
00:38:11,157 --> 00:38:14,035
He only has that much time.

549
00:38:14,118 --> 00:38:15,411
You must return

550
00:38:15,995 --> 00:38:18,831
with his torrent of energy
before time is up.

551
00:38:19,707 --> 00:38:21,959
Uk, I trust you on this.

552
00:38:22,043 --> 00:38:23,336
We will come back

553
00:38:24,462 --> 00:38:25,671
in time.

554
00:38:27,465 --> 00:38:28,299
Let us go.

555
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:41,562
This is everything
I have rewarded Jang Uk with?

556
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:44,774
He did not use a single one of them.

557
00:38:44,857 --> 00:38:47,151
Yul will live thanks to him.

558
00:38:48,402 --> 00:38:51,322
We must protect Jinyowon's door
alongside my mother.

559
00:38:52,573 --> 00:38:54,367
Please wait here, Your Royal Highness.

560
00:38:55,326 --> 00:38:57,953
Jang Uk and my sister
will be arriving soon.

561
00:38:59,038 --> 00:39:00,206
Bu-yeon will be here too?

562
00:39:00,915 --> 00:39:03,334
Yes. Please do not argue with Uk.

563
00:39:03,417 --> 00:39:04,251
Do not worry.

564
00:39:05,044 --> 00:39:07,838
He and I share a turtle.

565
00:39:10,925 --> 00:39:12,301
And it is a bright one.

566
00:39:18,307 --> 00:39:19,767
Bu-yeon, why are you here?

567
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,477
Why are you also getting involved?

568
00:39:22,144 --> 00:39:23,354
Have you not told her yet?

569
00:39:25,898 --> 00:39:28,526
She is carrying
Seo Yul's energy in her mouth,

570
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:29,527
so she cannot speak.

571
00:39:33,364 --> 00:39:35,699
The Crown Prince will be waiting
for you inside Jinyowon.

572
00:39:35,783 --> 00:39:36,617
Go first.

573
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:49,463
If you do not keep your promise,

574
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:51,966
I will refuse to help.

575
00:39:52,049 --> 00:39:54,802
I will keep my end of the bargain
and send her home, so…

576
00:39:57,263 --> 00:39:58,222
you can rest assured.

577
00:40:19,743 --> 00:40:20,744
Turtle Shaman?

578
00:40:20,828 --> 00:40:21,912
Why are you here?

579
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,956
Did you find work at Jinyowon?

580
00:40:30,463 --> 00:40:34,425
I am currently working
alongside the Crown Prince--

581
00:40:34,508 --> 00:40:36,218
I mean, with His Royal Highness.

582
00:40:38,512 --> 00:40:40,431
Thank you for waiting,
Your Royal Highness.

583
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:47,521
That is right.

584
00:40:47,605 --> 00:40:49,815
I am the Crown Prince.

585
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:52,735
I have been him all along.

586
00:40:57,406 --> 00:40:58,240
Hold on.

587
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:00,951
Then are you Jin Bu-yeon?

588
00:41:02,453 --> 00:41:04,747
Yes, this is her.

589
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:08,459
Then she is a Jinyowon priestess,
not a shaman?

590
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:10,085
Do you know her?

591
00:41:10,794 --> 00:41:11,795
Do you know him?

592
00:41:12,421 --> 00:41:13,923
Then your husband is…

593
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:21,472
What is going on?

594
00:41:28,771 --> 00:41:29,688
The turtle?

595
00:41:29,772 --> 00:41:31,106
Right, the eunuch.

596
00:41:33,901 --> 00:41:34,944
Him?

597
00:41:35,736 --> 00:41:36,987
So the eunuch you mentioned

598
00:41:37,655 --> 00:41:38,697
was His Royal Highness?

599
00:41:45,746 --> 00:41:47,122
I finally understand

600
00:41:48,332 --> 00:41:51,669
why you took care of my turtle.

601
00:41:53,462 --> 00:41:54,380
Darn it.

602
00:42:04,765 --> 00:42:08,811
His Royal Highness
offered to help save Seo Yul

603
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:10,688
so that he could save you as well.

604
00:42:13,107 --> 00:42:17,570
I hope that was not
just an excuse he made.

605
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:21,448
Did you say
His Royal Highness brought this turtle?

606
00:42:21,532 --> 00:42:24,076
He saved it from getting killed.

607
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:27,788
He is raising something
that is uselessly weak.

608
00:42:32,376 --> 00:42:34,044
I will summon the gold's energy

609
00:42:34,128 --> 00:42:36,714
and expand the barrier
that is surrounding the fire bird's egg.

610
00:42:36,797 --> 00:42:38,007
Then you can catch

611
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:41,093
the blood parasite
as it escapes the water wick.

612
00:42:41,176 --> 00:42:42,970
And it will come out of her body?

613
00:42:43,554 --> 00:42:44,388
All right.

614
00:42:44,972 --> 00:42:46,515
Shaman, come in.

615
00:42:57,276 --> 00:42:59,612
So Uk was the one who was troubling you?

616
00:42:59,695 --> 00:43:02,323
You must have suffered
more than I thought.

617
00:43:03,198 --> 00:43:05,284
Right, did you find your own room?

618
00:43:06,285 --> 00:43:08,579
I said you can live with me
if you failed to find your own room.

619
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,247
I live in a palace.

620
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:12,958
I did not lie
about having many rooms, right?

621
00:43:17,588 --> 00:43:19,506
What are you doing? Make the energy surge.

622
00:43:52,623 --> 00:43:55,542
The blood parasite
is moving through her bloodstream.

623
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,546
You need to wait until it expels
all of Yul's torrent of energy.

624
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,464
Hang in there.

625
00:44:14,895 --> 00:44:16,563
It has expelled everything.

626
00:44:17,147 --> 00:44:18,857
We just need to remove it.

627
00:44:18,941 --> 00:44:19,775
Where is it?

628
00:44:49,596 --> 00:44:50,764
Hang on.

629
00:44:56,812 --> 00:44:57,938
Are you all right?

630
00:44:58,939 --> 00:44:59,898
It must hurt a lot.

631
00:45:05,863 --> 00:45:06,822
Let us now go to Yul.

632
00:45:07,698 --> 00:45:08,532
Let us go.

633
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:25,174
Me too.

634
00:45:25,257 --> 00:45:26,842
You must not break the barrier of gold.

635
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:28,594
Be careful on your way out.

636
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:31,054
Let us hurry. We have no time.

637
00:45:33,849 --> 00:45:35,100
Help me out too.

638
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:44,318
Hey!

639
00:45:55,412 --> 00:45:58,040
We are almost out of time.
Hurry, put it inside his mouth!

640
00:45:58,123 --> 00:46:00,584
Put it inside! Right now!

641
00:46:01,168 --> 00:46:02,002
Hurry!

642
00:46:33,534 --> 00:46:35,702
We did it!

643
00:46:38,622 --> 00:46:40,791
We did it!

644
00:46:40,874 --> 00:46:42,376
We saved Yul!

645
00:46:43,377 --> 00:46:46,797
Goodness, I can feel his pulse again.

646
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,549
Oh, my goodness.

647
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:50,259
We did it.

648
00:46:50,342 --> 00:46:51,760
-We saved him.
-Yul is alive.

649
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:54,304
-Yes, we did.
-Good work, Jang Uk.

650
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,683
You did well too,

651
00:46:58,767 --> 00:46:59,851
Your Royal Highness.

652
00:47:06,316 --> 00:47:07,276
By the way,

653
00:47:07,901 --> 00:47:10,779
I cannot believe
you were the husband who troubled her.

654
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:11,697
Gosh.

655
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:15,117
How did she mistake you for a eunuch?

656
00:47:17,286 --> 00:47:18,662
We saved a turtle together.

657
00:47:19,746 --> 00:47:24,501
I should invite her to the palace
and let her see the turtle next time.

658
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:28,338
If you are curious,

659
00:47:30,507 --> 00:47:31,758
feel free to come with her.

660
00:47:37,222 --> 00:47:38,265
The turtle?

661
00:47:55,032 --> 00:47:55,991
Well done.

662
00:47:57,993 --> 00:47:59,036
Thank you.

663
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:07,878
This letter was one of his belongings.

664
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:11,506
I should have given this to Lord Park
before he left for Seoho Fortress.

665
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,592
He already left.

666
00:48:13,675 --> 00:48:14,635
I see.

667
00:48:15,135 --> 00:48:16,261
I guess I am late.

668
00:48:16,845 --> 00:48:18,221
Then I should put it back.

669
00:48:23,393 --> 00:48:25,771
The wound from where the parasite exited
could rot.

670
00:48:26,438 --> 00:48:29,232
Apply the ointment
and take your medicine on time.

671
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:31,193
All right.

672
00:48:31,777 --> 00:48:33,028
I will be fine even after I return.

673
00:48:36,073 --> 00:48:37,324
I am not that dense.

674
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:39,618
I knew what my mother would ask for

675
00:48:40,243 --> 00:48:42,204
in return for helping you.

676
00:48:44,498 --> 00:48:45,957
She wants you to come back home.

677
00:48:47,459 --> 00:48:49,878
-I agreed to send you back.
-Do not say that.

678
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:53,423
I am going back out of my own will.

679
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:57,386
She gave me her word.

680
00:48:58,095 --> 00:49:01,181
She promised not to lock me up anymore.

681
00:49:02,557 --> 00:49:04,351
I have nothing to lose even if I leave.

682
00:49:06,186 --> 00:49:08,522
-But I feel bad leaving you.
-What do you mean?

683
00:49:09,606 --> 00:49:11,441
I promised to help you rest comfortably.

684
00:49:12,025 --> 00:49:13,235
That is why you took me with you.

685
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:14,945
But I could not do that.

686
00:49:15,529 --> 00:49:16,780
You are still mistaken.

687
00:49:18,073 --> 00:49:19,449
That is not why I took you.

688
00:49:20,492 --> 00:49:21,326
Then…

689
00:49:22,744 --> 00:49:23,745
what was the reason?

690
00:49:26,248 --> 00:49:27,499
You do not need to know.

691
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:29,918
I have no use for you anymore.

692
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:31,837
I am fine with you leaving as well.

693
00:49:32,921 --> 00:49:34,256
So do not feel sorry for me.

694
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:36,758
They say you can miss the brazier
even during the summer.

695
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,094
Can you not just say
that you will miss me?

696
00:49:40,929 --> 00:49:42,389
A brazier during the summer

697
00:49:43,932 --> 00:49:45,225
is just useless.

698
00:49:46,601 --> 00:49:47,436
Who knows?

699
00:49:48,228 --> 00:49:49,187
Maybe I will miss you

700
00:49:51,481 --> 00:49:52,649
when it gets chilly.

701
00:49:56,695 --> 00:49:57,529
Fine.

702
00:49:58,155 --> 00:50:01,575
Your useless brazier has burnt itself
to leave nothing but ashes.

703
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,244
I will disperse in the wind, and you can…

704
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,125
just freeze to death alone.

705
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:35,609
His torrent of energy is surging
in his core of energy again.

706
00:50:35,692 --> 00:50:39,446
The fire bird's energy
completely banished the blood parasite.

707
00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:42,657
Did you say Jang Uk and the Crown Prince
saw the fire bird themselves?

708
00:50:42,741 --> 00:50:43,617
Yes, Master.

709
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,662
Thankfully, they did not bicker
and kept the fire bird under control.

710
00:50:47,746 --> 00:50:49,372
Yul survived thanks to them.

711
00:50:49,456 --> 00:50:50,957
I had told the Crown Prince

712
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:54,127
to check on Uk
on the pretext of rewarding him.

713
00:50:55,045 --> 00:50:56,880
And it paid off.

714
00:51:02,886 --> 00:51:05,555
You saved my life once again.

715
00:51:06,848 --> 00:51:07,682
This is different.

716
00:51:08,266 --> 00:51:10,268
I saved you last time to kill Jang Uk.

717
00:51:10,352 --> 00:51:11,186
But this time,

718
00:51:12,604 --> 00:51:15,982
he and I joined hands to save Seo Yul.

719
00:51:16,066 --> 00:51:18,235
In any case,

720
00:51:19,194 --> 00:51:22,697
let me once again give you something
as a token of my gratitude.

721
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:38,797
This is Jang Uk's constellation plate.

722
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,215
Is that the King's Star?

723
00:51:41,675 --> 00:51:43,134
Correct, Your Royal Highness.

724
00:51:43,218 --> 00:51:45,428
Like Jang Gang prophesized,

725
00:51:45,512 --> 00:51:47,681
it is the star of the late king's son.

726
00:51:51,393 --> 00:51:52,352
The late king's son?

727
00:51:54,187 --> 00:51:55,021
Jang Uk

728
00:51:55,689 --> 00:51:58,441
is the son of the late king
who shifted souls with Jang Gang.

729
00:51:59,109 --> 00:52:01,152
That is why he has the King's Star.

730
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:04,739
He has the Gold Plaque and the letter

731
00:52:04,823 --> 00:52:06,992
that the late king
had left behind for him.

732
00:52:07,075 --> 00:52:11,329
He is a dangerous star
who can take your place whenever he wants.

733
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,340
Is that why you told me
to keep my distance from him?

734
00:52:24,217 --> 00:52:27,137
Please allow me to send him far away,

735
00:52:28,138 --> 00:52:30,181
Your Royal Highness.

736
00:52:42,986 --> 00:52:46,740
You must have used up a lot of your energy
while protecting Jinyowon.

737
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:49,868
Your hair

738
00:52:50,577 --> 00:52:52,829
has become grayer in the past few days.

739
00:52:56,625 --> 00:52:57,459
Cho-yeon.

740
00:52:58,835 --> 00:53:00,420
Prepare Bu-yeon's room for her.

741
00:53:00,503 --> 00:53:02,756
Is she coming back?

742
00:53:04,132 --> 00:53:05,759
Jang Uk gave me his word.

743
00:53:06,885 --> 00:53:08,011
So she will return soon.

744
00:53:15,018 --> 00:53:16,144
Young Master,

745
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:18,563
is Young Master Seo all right now?

746
00:53:19,189 --> 00:53:21,858
Yes, I wanted to be there when he woke up.

747
00:53:21,942 --> 00:53:24,486
But I left in case my energy
would be harmful to him.

748
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:26,071
That is a relief.

749
00:53:26,738 --> 00:53:30,367
You did a terrific job
of saving your friend.

750
00:53:31,785 --> 00:53:32,661
What about Bu-yeon?

751
00:53:33,328 --> 00:53:35,121
-Did she go safely?
-Young Lady Bu-yeon?

752
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:38,166
She did not come home.

753
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:40,669
I thought you two were in Songrim.

754
00:53:41,461 --> 00:53:42,462
She did not come home?

755
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,092
What is this? Did she leave right away
without saying goodbye to you?

756
00:53:47,175 --> 00:53:48,009
Leave?

757
00:53:48,093 --> 00:53:50,929
Did she return to Jinyowon?

758
00:53:51,012 --> 00:53:54,766
Yes, I promised Lady Jin that I would
send her back to where she belonged.

759
00:53:54,849 --> 00:53:56,476
Did you, now?

760
00:53:56,977 --> 00:53:58,228
I see.

761
00:53:58,311 --> 00:54:00,271
Young Master, give me your hand.

762
00:54:00,355 --> 00:54:01,564
Give it to me.

763
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:05,485
Darn it! She is not an object
you can send back whenever you want!

764
00:54:05,568 --> 00:54:08,154
I only said that
because that is where she belongs.

765
00:54:08,238 --> 00:54:10,824
She belongs right by your side,
does she not?

766
00:54:13,493 --> 00:54:16,413
She never belonged here
in the first place.

767
00:54:22,127 --> 00:54:23,211
Goodness.

768
00:54:23,878 --> 00:54:26,589
He will never know what he had
until it is gone.

769
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:29,759
You will keep going back and forth.

770
00:54:30,385 --> 00:54:31,845
Goodness, I hope

771
00:54:33,388 --> 00:54:34,806
he comes to his senses.

772
00:54:40,603 --> 00:54:41,479
She left right away

773
00:54:43,023 --> 00:54:44,190
that day?

774
00:54:44,274 --> 00:54:47,861
Your useless brazier has burnt itself
to leave nothing but ashes.

775
00:54:47,944 --> 00:54:50,363
I will disperse in the wind, and you can…

776
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,825
just freeze to death alone.

777
00:55:09,466 --> 00:55:10,550
Her mother

778
00:55:11,801 --> 00:55:13,428
would not do that again, would she?

779
00:55:31,404 --> 00:55:32,238
I hope…

780
00:55:32,989 --> 00:55:34,991
that makes it easier for you to find me.

781
00:55:35,617 --> 00:55:36,910
I will keep you warm

782
00:55:37,494 --> 00:55:38,745
and help you rest comfortably.

783
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:44,959
There, now you feel warm.

784
00:56:04,354 --> 00:56:05,563
She left it here.

785
00:56:05,647 --> 00:56:07,524
It would have made
a good excuse to go see her.

786
00:56:11,069 --> 00:56:12,278
I hope she arrived safely.

787
00:56:24,582 --> 00:56:26,501
You can turn off the last lantern.

788
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:28,795
Since you are
a great priestess of Jinyowon,

789
00:56:28,878 --> 00:56:30,672
use your divine powers to turn it off.

790
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,973
See? I did that.

791
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:08,084
Yul.

792
00:57:19,012 --> 00:57:21,431
Young Master Seo, are you finally awake?

793
00:57:23,975 --> 00:57:25,059
What happened?

794
00:57:25,143 --> 00:57:26,853
You were unconscious for three days.

795
00:57:27,437 --> 00:57:30,273
You almost lost your life
while fighting Cheonbugwan officials.

796
00:57:35,069 --> 00:57:36,279
What happened to So-i?

797
00:57:37,864 --> 00:57:40,366
Do you mean the girl
you went there to save?

798
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:41,659
She died.

799
00:57:43,953 --> 00:57:46,789
Lord Dang-gu took her body.

800
00:57:46,873 --> 00:57:49,292
Master Heo and your friends

801
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:51,920
successfully removed
the blood parasite from your body.

802
00:57:52,629 --> 00:57:53,713
They took it out?

803
00:57:54,589 --> 00:57:55,423
Yes, they did.

804
00:58:07,644 --> 00:58:08,645
Are you finally awake?

805
00:58:12,148 --> 00:58:13,441
You were in grave danger.

806
00:58:14,234 --> 00:58:17,487
Young Lady Bu-yeon was of great help
in getting rid of that parasite.

807
00:58:18,821 --> 00:58:21,241
Had I known it was life-threatening,

808
00:58:21,324 --> 00:58:22,617
I would not have kept it a secret.

809
00:58:23,243 --> 00:58:24,160
I am sorry.

810
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:27,580
I had no idea
when I invited you to Danhyanggok.

811
00:58:31,584 --> 00:58:33,378
We had agreed to go there.

812
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:38,007
But we could not go.

813
00:58:42,512 --> 00:58:45,431
Master Lee,
Seo Yul has regained consciousness.

814
00:58:47,141 --> 00:58:49,602
-Master Lee?
-This is Master Lee.

815
00:58:49,686 --> 00:58:51,854
He has been taking care of you.

816
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,274
He knows Master Lee.

817
00:58:54,357 --> 00:58:56,651
He is Master Heo's master.

818
00:58:56,734 --> 00:58:59,612
The "frivolous Yeom"
that you often talked about

819
00:58:59,696 --> 00:59:01,406
was Master Heo?

820
00:59:01,489 --> 00:59:03,992
I found him adorable when he was your age.

821
00:59:04,075 --> 00:59:04,951
Every now and then.

822
00:59:06,995 --> 00:59:09,831
He took care of me
for three years when I was ill.

823
00:59:10,498 --> 00:59:13,418
He is the top physician in Daeho,
so you will recover soon.

824
00:59:13,501 --> 00:59:14,335
Bu-yeon.

825
00:59:14,419 --> 00:59:16,254
Bring Yeom over.

826
00:59:16,337 --> 00:59:17,880
He will be delighted to see Yul awake.

827
00:59:17,964 --> 00:59:19,257
Yes, Master.

828
00:59:26,598 --> 00:59:29,058
You have regained
almost all of your torrent of energy,

829
00:59:29,142 --> 00:59:30,310
so you will recover soon.

830
00:59:31,853 --> 00:59:33,688
If you took care of her for three years,

831
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,149
then you must know her well.

832
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,987
Are you more curious about her
than your condition right now?

833
00:59:41,654 --> 00:59:43,656
That is right. I saved her.

834
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,284
And I will take good care of you now.

835
00:59:51,122 --> 00:59:53,958
Young Lady Bu-yeon
is in Sejukwon right now?

836
00:59:54,042 --> 00:59:55,376
Yes.

837
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:58,129
Her mother thinks she is still at Uk's,

838
00:59:58,212 --> 01:00:00,923
and Uk must think she is in Jinyowon.

839
01:00:01,591 --> 01:00:03,801
Is it really over between them?

840
01:00:04,844 --> 01:00:08,556
Whenever she left our house,
he would bring her back every time.

841
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,391
She must be in Songrim

842
01:00:10,475 --> 01:00:13,728
waiting for Uk to come and fetch her.

843
01:00:15,188 --> 01:00:16,356
Just let them be.

844
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,985
There he is.

845
01:00:21,069 --> 01:00:23,613
You only appreciate someone
once you feel their absence.

846
01:00:23,696 --> 01:00:24,864
My lord.

847
01:00:26,074 --> 01:00:27,575
How was your trip?

848
01:00:27,659 --> 01:00:28,910
You must be so tired.

849
01:00:29,869 --> 01:00:33,039
I hurried over because I knew
you would be waiting for me.

850
01:00:33,122 --> 01:00:35,541
Goodness. He is watching us.

851
01:00:37,251 --> 01:00:38,086
Come inside.

852
01:00:40,755 --> 01:00:42,507
You should not move around just yet.

853
01:00:44,509 --> 01:00:46,052
Were you already aware

854
01:00:47,553 --> 01:00:48,388
of who she was?

855
01:00:50,181 --> 01:00:52,892
You must know if you saved the body
fished out of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

856
01:00:52,975 --> 01:00:54,811
So you recognized her face.

857
01:00:56,062 --> 01:00:59,273
I do remember you saying that
you met her in Danhyanggok as a child.

858
01:00:59,357 --> 01:01:01,317
Does this mean
you saved her despite knowing

859
01:01:03,361 --> 01:01:04,195
who she was?

860
01:01:05,363 --> 01:01:06,197
Seo Yul.

861
01:01:06,989 --> 01:01:09,867
If you are the only one
who knows about this,

862
01:01:09,951 --> 01:01:11,369
then feign ignorance.

863
01:01:13,413 --> 01:01:16,666
Naksu's soul will disappear
from her body soon.

864
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:20,837
Once the soul of Jin Bu-yeon,
the true owner of that body, awakens,

865
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,464
Naksu's soul will disappear.

866
01:01:24,424 --> 01:01:25,258
What?

867
01:01:27,218 --> 01:01:28,594
I do not understand.

868
01:01:29,178 --> 01:01:31,180
Two souls are coexisting in her body.

869
01:01:31,681 --> 01:01:33,808
But the body belongs to Jin Bu-yeon.

870
01:01:35,935 --> 01:01:37,353
Contrary to my intentions,

871
01:01:37,437 --> 01:01:40,148
everything went according to
Jin Bu-yeon's plans.

872
01:01:40,732 --> 01:01:43,025
She will use up Naksu's energy.

873
01:01:45,278 --> 01:01:46,821
And Naksu will soon disappear.

874
01:01:55,538 --> 01:01:56,914
Young Lady Heo!

875
01:01:56,998 --> 01:01:58,750
Master Heo is looking for you!

876
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:01,085
All right, Sun-i.

877
01:02:02,503 --> 01:02:04,756
I will be there soon. You can go first.

878
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:07,383
Yes, my lady.

879
01:02:10,052 --> 01:02:13,389
Is that not Young Master Seo's letter?

880
01:02:14,307 --> 01:02:15,349
Is she peeking at it?

881
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:21,773
That woman…

882
01:02:24,984 --> 01:02:26,027
is Naksu?

883
01:02:32,241 --> 01:02:34,744
If it is someone dear to you,

884
01:02:34,827 --> 01:02:37,997
you should not think of letting them go
as if you are abandoning them.

885
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,917
She belongs right by your side,
does she not?

886
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:51,636
It turned off. Did she break it?

887
01:02:55,681 --> 01:02:57,099
It keeps turning on and off.

888
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,477
It must be out of its mind.

889
01:03:00,144 --> 01:03:02,814
I was hoping for this.

890
01:03:03,648 --> 01:03:05,358
I hoped that you would come for me…

891
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:08,778
despite being of no use to you.

892
01:03:16,577 --> 01:03:17,870
I would be crazy

893
01:03:19,831 --> 01:03:21,249
if I went back for her again.

894
01:03:26,212 --> 01:03:29,048
If you drink that,
it means we are officially married.

895
01:03:29,131 --> 01:03:31,050
Go on. Drink up.

896
01:03:36,013 --> 01:03:37,306
I shall always stay by your side.

897
01:03:38,224 --> 01:03:39,559
Try summoning fireflies.

898
01:03:39,642 --> 01:03:42,436
That is not an easy thing to do, you know.

899
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,397
Get a hold of yourself.

900
01:03:48,985 --> 01:03:50,278
This is driving me crazy.

901
01:03:54,699 --> 01:03:56,492
Mother knows you are here.

902
01:03:56,576 --> 01:03:57,743
She told me to fetch you.

903
01:03:57,827 --> 01:03:59,370
I was going to go today anyway.

904
01:04:00,496 --> 01:04:01,664
I ran into Master Lee.

905
01:04:01,747 --> 01:04:03,624
He had been taking care of Seo Yul,

906
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:05,626
and I wanted to see him wake up.

907
01:04:07,795 --> 01:04:09,922
Jang Uk thinks you are in Jinyowon.

908
01:04:11,716 --> 01:04:13,217
He will not come here for you.

909
01:04:15,469 --> 01:04:16,304
I know.

910
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:19,473
Let us go.

911
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:23,728
I need to return
Songrim's Spirit Plaque before I go.

912
01:04:23,811 --> 01:04:25,062
I left it at Jeongjingak.

913
01:04:25,146 --> 01:04:27,023
Let me go get it. Wait here.

914
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,798
You will be flogged 100 times
if you lose this, you know.

915
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:00,598
I did not lose it.

916
01:05:00,681 --> 01:05:01,515
What is it?

917
01:05:02,183 --> 01:05:03,643
Do you want me to get punished?

918
01:05:08,898 --> 01:05:10,483
I could not find you in Jinyowon.

919
01:05:11,567 --> 01:05:12,401
Here you were.

920
01:05:13,569 --> 01:05:15,821
Were you looking for me?

921
01:05:17,865 --> 01:05:18,699
Why?

922
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:22,328
Because the lantern turned off.

923
01:05:22,411 --> 01:05:23,245
And then,

924
01:05:24,705 --> 01:05:25,539
it turned back on.

925
01:05:25,623 --> 01:05:27,708
Lantern? The one in your study?

926
01:05:27,792 --> 01:05:30,252
It kept flicking on and off.
It is out of its mind.

927
01:05:33,297 --> 01:05:34,382
It must be broken.

928
01:05:35,132 --> 01:05:36,217
Throw it out if it is useless.

929
01:05:37,218 --> 01:05:38,052
Right.

930
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:40,304
It belonged to Jinyowon, right?

931
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:43,307
Then send it back.

932
01:05:43,891 --> 01:05:45,851
You think I abandoned you
because you were useless, right?

933
01:05:46,477 --> 01:05:47,812
To clear up the confusion,

934
01:05:48,521 --> 01:05:50,648
I should clearly explain
what your use was.

935
01:05:53,234 --> 01:05:54,402
I brought you home

936
01:05:55,903 --> 01:05:57,822
so you could take the ice stone out of me.

937
01:05:58,489 --> 01:05:59,323
I know.

938
01:06:00,032 --> 01:06:01,909
You said it would help you feel at ease.

939
01:06:03,494 --> 01:06:04,328
Right.

940
01:06:05,496 --> 01:06:06,747
I wanted to find peace.

941
01:06:08,624 --> 01:06:09,667
But once it is removed,

942
01:06:11,293 --> 01:06:12,294
I will die once again.

943
01:06:13,879 --> 01:06:16,048
It is not your fault
that you did not know this.

944
01:06:16,132 --> 01:06:17,758
I should have been clear about it.

945
01:06:18,884 --> 01:06:20,845
At first, I did not
see the need to explain.

946
01:06:21,971 --> 01:06:24,682
Later, I could not disclose that
to someone who wanted to protect me.

947
01:06:27,727 --> 01:06:28,602
And what about now?

948
01:06:29,311 --> 01:06:30,646
I said I have no use for you.

949
01:06:34,066 --> 01:06:35,860
What I am trying to say is

950
01:06:37,945 --> 01:06:39,196
that I am very grateful

951
01:06:40,573 --> 01:06:41,949
and sorry.

952
01:06:46,078 --> 01:06:46,912
In that case,

953
01:06:48,122 --> 01:06:50,166
I am glad that I am of no use to you.

954
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:53,252
I felt awful for being abandoned.

955
01:06:54,503 --> 01:06:57,381
But you are thanking me
and apologizing to me.

956
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,593
So that is why you came.

957
01:07:02,094 --> 01:07:04,096
I heard you loud and clear,
so I will go now.

958
01:07:05,556 --> 01:07:07,183
I cannot wish you farewell, though.

959
01:07:10,019 --> 01:07:11,353
What is it this time?

960
01:07:11,854 --> 01:07:14,482
Do you want me to brace myself
because you could have a change of heart?

961
01:07:14,565 --> 01:07:17,568
I better not see you ever again,

962
01:07:17,651 --> 01:07:19,361
or I will take that stone out of you.

963
01:07:20,196 --> 01:07:21,155
I am not done yet.

964
01:07:21,906 --> 01:07:23,657
I told you the lantern was flickering.

965
01:07:23,741 --> 01:07:25,618
-So what?
-So…

966
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:31,624
When it is on, I am sane.

967
01:07:32,666 --> 01:07:33,542
It is clear to me

968
01:07:34,835 --> 01:07:36,837
that I must send you back as I promised.

969
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:39,340
But I go insane when it turns off.

970
01:07:39,965 --> 01:07:41,050
I just pine for you.

971
01:07:43,177 --> 01:07:44,637
That is why I came to see you.

972
01:07:53,395 --> 01:07:54,230
So?

973
01:07:57,983 --> 01:07:58,818
What about now?

974
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:02,738
If you are upset and want to leave,

975
01:08:06,158 --> 01:08:07,535
I should get a hold of myself…

976
01:08:10,538 --> 01:08:11,372
and let you go.

977
01:08:27,096 --> 01:08:27,930
What was that?

978
01:08:28,013 --> 01:08:29,431
I turned it off.

979
01:08:33,352 --> 01:08:34,478
I wanted to turn it off.

980
01:10:01,982 --> 01:10:04,902
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

981
01:10:04,985 --> 01:10:06,445
I knew the moment I saw you.

982
01:10:06,528 --> 01:10:07,446
You are my husband.

983
01:10:07,988 --> 01:10:09,281
"I promise to be a good man."

984
01:10:09,365 --> 01:10:11,617
"Please allow me to marry your daughter."

985
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,702
Just let her stay
with the person she wishes to be with

986
01:10:13,786 --> 01:10:14,620
for a while.

987
01:10:14,703 --> 01:10:16,580
If you do not intend
to fight me over the Gold Plaque,

988
01:10:16,664 --> 01:10:18,582
go to North Fortress, Jang Uk.

989
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:20,751
I have decided to accept this fight

990
01:10:20,834 --> 01:10:22,086
in order to protect what I must.

991
01:10:22,169 --> 01:10:25,005
I will soon introduce you
to the secret organization.

992
01:10:25,089 --> 01:10:26,382
I shall wholly support you.

993
01:10:26,465 --> 01:10:27,758
Naksu's soul will disappear soon,

994
01:10:27,841 --> 01:10:30,386
and Jin Bu-yeon will take over the body.

995
01:10:31,053 --> 01:10:34,515
Allow me to test your divine powers.

996
01:10:36,934 --> 01:10:41,939
