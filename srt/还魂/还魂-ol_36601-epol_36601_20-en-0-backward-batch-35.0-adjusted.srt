1
00:00:08,084 --> 00:00:13,339
Bu-yeon, is this where you felt
the energy of the sparkling stone?

2
00:00:13,423 --> 00:00:14,549
Father.

3
00:00:14,632 --> 00:00:15,842
We are close.

4
00:00:17,177 --> 00:00:20,472
The pretty stone is
somewhere underwater nearby.

5
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,190
Do you really think
what she found is the ice stone?

6
00:00:30,774 --> 00:00:31,858
Yes, it has to be it.

7
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:34,486
Ten years ago, my master, Jang Gang,

8
00:00:34,569 --> 00:00:37,197
sealed the ice stone here
at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,200
And now it has been found
by the girl who was born

10
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:42,577
through the great power of the ice stone.

11
00:00:43,912 --> 00:00:47,665
I am sure that
Bu-yeon is Jang Gang's daughter.

12
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:51,002
It explains why he performed sorcery
to save her.

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,339
Do you resent her?

14
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:05,475
Thanks to that girl,

15
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:08,686
a good-for-nothing man like me
was able to marry

16
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:12,148
the daughter of the Jin family.

17
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:15,944
So I guess I should be grateful.

18
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:22,867
This is the place.
The pretty stone is right underneath us.

19
00:01:34,754 --> 00:01:37,507
Her father's inferiority complex
and jealousy

20
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,343
were what led Jin Bu-yeon to her death.

21
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:44,055
It suits you well.

22
00:01:45,098 --> 00:01:48,309
If you like it,
then I like it too, Mother.

23
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,063
You should try on something else.

24
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,277
Jin Bu-yeon's immense divine powers

25
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:00,405
not only came from her mother,
a member of the Jin family.

26
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:05,785
They also came from her father,
a descendant of the fallen Choi family.

27
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:12,167
The Choi siblings, who made a living
by performing curses and divinations,

28
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,628
were descendants of Mage Choi,
the very first mage to perform

29
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:17,463
the alchemy of souls.

30
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:22,468
Jin Bu-yeon was
a descendant of both families,

31
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:26,222
which enabled her to become
the best priestess anyone had ever seen.

32
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,142
You have finally found it.

33
00:02:30,226 --> 00:02:31,060
Bu-yeon.

34
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:33,021
Hand over the ice stone to me.

35
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,367
Hand it over!

36
00:02:51,664 --> 00:02:52,707
Bu-yeon…

37
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,084
Bu-yeon!

38
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:58,046
Bu-yeon!

39
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:25,740
Eat up.

40
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:28,243
Here. Hold the spoon.

41
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,537
It is bad enough that you are blind.

42
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:34,332
It is pitiful that
you cannot even remember your name.

43
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:38,920
Would you like to live with me?

44
00:03:39,796 --> 00:03:43,549
My late granddaughter's name was Mu-deok.

45
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:44,801
Can I call you Mu-deok?

46
00:03:47,387 --> 00:03:48,888
All right.

47
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:50,515
Your name is Mu-deok from now on.

48
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,059
Such a lovely girl.

49
00:03:53,142 --> 00:03:55,019
Go ahead and eat.

50
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:02,443
Mu-deok.

51
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:46,237
Mother.

52
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,204
Bu-yeon.

53
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:11,888
How is this possible?

54
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:16,642
This is exactly what happened
the day Jin Bu-yeon disappeared.

55
00:05:29,655 --> 00:05:31,157
Mu-deok has not returned.

56
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,619
Both Uk and Mu-deok
must have been killed by the soul shifter.

57
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:37,038
At this rate, the rest of us will die too.

58
00:05:43,461 --> 00:05:44,587
Jin Bu-yeon.

59
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,381
You brought the ice stone
from Jinyowon yourself.

60
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:50,384
You are a priestess.
Are you unable to control it?

61
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:54,639
I just did what my mother told me to do
and brought it here.

62
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:56,724
You are pathetic.

63
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:01,104
Young Master Seo has lost too much blood.

64
00:06:01,938 --> 00:06:04,440
Without a blood transfusion,
his life will be in danger.

65
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:07,610
If you need someone's blood,
you can use mine.

66
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:09,987
We are unable to use spells in here,

67
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,906
so your blood cannot be shared.

68
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:20,832
Give me your hand.

69
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,594
The worm that sucked the blood
of my daughter, Cho-yeon,

70
00:06:33,678 --> 00:06:36,472
will enter your body
and give you the power of the Jin family.

71
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:43,312
Jang Uk has made a fool of us
with his lie.

72
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:48,943
The mages of the Unanimous Assembly have
taken turns reading Words of the Heart,

73
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:51,028
and it says nothing about the ice stone.

74
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:53,739
It is nothing more than a piece of poetry.

75
00:06:57,285 --> 00:06:59,162
What does Songrim have to say about this?

76
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:03,624
All the mages may have read it,

77
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:06,711
but there is something no one knows.

78
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,888
Words of the Heart is
a letter of confession

79
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:18,306
written by Master Seo Gyeong.

80
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:21,100
It was a letter?

81
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:25,229
It was a love letter
written to Jin Seol-ran,

82
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:26,772
the first leader of Jinyowon.

83
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:32,278
It is a letter confessing that
he did not destroy the ice stone

84
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:36,407
because he could not let go
of his dying lover.

85
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:40,411
Are you saying Master Seo Gyeong

86
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:43,831
chose not to destroy the ice stone
because of love?

87
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,459
He is just making things up.

88
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:50,630
I can prove that it is a love letter.

89
00:07:52,465 --> 00:07:55,009
All you need to do is say the name
of the recipient in your head,

90
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:58,971
and it will enable you to read
the letter yourself, Your Majesty.

91
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:00,765
I can read Words of the Heart

92
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:03,559
even though I am not a skilled mage?

93
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:05,603
The name of the recipient

94
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:09,982
reminds you of a fresh orchid
that blooms on a cold field of snow.

95
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:13,402
It is Seol-ran.

96
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:16,113
"Seol-ran"?

97
00:08:48,437 --> 00:08:51,857
"The faint, blue light…"

98
00:09:00,324 --> 00:09:03,786
"My heart aches to see
my beautiful flower wither."

99
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,038
"And in the end,

100
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:09,917
I am a fool who dares not shed

101
00:09:11,127 --> 00:09:13,296
a single tear."

102
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:17,300
It is his confession

103
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:20,803
saying he left the ice stone unharmed
to save his lover.

104
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,434
But Lady Jin Seol-ran passed away

105
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:28,519
less than six months

106
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:32,982
after Jinyowon was established
due to her injury during the Great Chaos.

107
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:34,483
If it was left for her,

108
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,736
then why did she not use it
to save herself?

109
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:41,157
I believe she chose not to use it
because she did not want the world

110
00:09:41,824 --> 00:09:43,576
to be exposed to such dangerous power.

111
00:09:44,744 --> 00:09:48,205
What human would choose
to give up on such immense power?

112
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:49,707
A man like you

113
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,210
would never choose to do what she did.

114
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:56,005
However, she did it for mankind.

115
00:09:57,381 --> 00:09:58,633
She did what was right.

116
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:02,803
To protect what we must…

117
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:10,519
one must sometimes choose
to let go of everything.

118
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:29,163
Since you have unsheathed the sword,

119
00:10:30,581 --> 00:10:32,291
make your decision.

120
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:38,547
I know you have been avoiding me.

121
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:41,634
I also know that everyone's lives
are in your hands.

122
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:47,640
Like you promised,
point your sword at me first.

123
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,987
Overflowing power means

124
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:04,740
you will not be able to control
how much of it you use.

125
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,327
Desire rain, and you will get a flood.

126
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:11,664
Desire wind, and you will get a typhoon.

127
00:11:11,747 --> 00:11:13,416
Try to endure it.

128
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:16,377
Does that mean
I have no control over this power?

129
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,506
There is one thing you can do
of your own free will,

130
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:23,926
which is to not use it.

131
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:28,556
It is up to you
to choose not to use that power.

132
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:44,238
Make me another promise

133
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:47,950
just like you said you would.

134
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:06,010
Among the many stars,

135
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:09,388
there is a very sad one
called the King's Star.

136
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:13,684
What is the King's Star?

137
00:12:14,393 --> 00:12:15,728
A star that is given to those

138
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:18,105
who are permitted
to use the energy of the heavens.

139
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:20,774
Does that mean
that person becomes powerful?

140
00:12:20,858 --> 00:12:22,526
That means it is a good thing.

141
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:26,864
Well, I would not say
it is necessarily always a good thing.

142
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,908
With great power

143
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:30,951
comes great responsibilities.

144
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:32,995
What are responsibilities?

145
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:35,539
It means you must also do things
you do not wish to do,

146
00:12:35,623 --> 00:12:37,875
which can be very distressing and lonely.

147
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,504
Mister, can we eat that?

148
00:12:42,713 --> 00:12:43,672
Sure.

149
00:12:44,715 --> 00:12:47,635
-I shall give this to you.
-Thank you.

150
00:12:47,718 --> 00:12:51,388
In return, make sure
you do not fight over it.

151
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:53,057
All right. Let us go now.

152
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:05,152
The star will appear soon.

153
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:09,198
Then those leaving shall leave,

154
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:11,825
and those returning shall return.

155
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:22,670
This is the place that
the Crown Prince was looking for.

156
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:25,381
The apothecary where Eunuch Kim,

157
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:27,841
the man who served the queen,
visited every month.

158
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:30,177
You really know how to find your way.

159
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:33,347
Remember the charm
that helps two people become lovers?

160
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,765
Did you get that at Gaema Village too?

161
00:13:35,975 --> 00:13:39,061
That charm did not even work.
Stop teasing me about that.

162
00:13:39,645 --> 00:13:43,107
What do you mean it did not work?
Look at us. We are here together.

163
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:45,401
I mean…

164
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:48,237
We are not here on a date.

165
00:13:56,787 --> 00:13:59,915
Why is he here?

166
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:04,169
APOTHECARY

167
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,380
Father?

168
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:46,670
You must have regained consciousness.

169
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:49,340
You have tried to harm yourself
once again, Your Highness.

170
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,508
Why are you keeping me alive?

171
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:54,428
Please just kill me.

172
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:57,723
I cannot do that yet.
The Queen's Lantern of Life

173
00:14:58,557 --> 00:15:01,393
must continue to glow
while the Queen's body stays alive.

174
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:07,358
It disturbs me to see you
glare at me like that

175
00:15:08,484 --> 00:15:10,861
with the face of my sister.

176
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:13,197
Your resentment should not
be directed toward me.

177
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,074
Resent the man

178
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:18,285
who put me and my sister in this position.

179
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:32,716
Shaman Choi, you have cursed
and harmed people

180
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,843
by performing prohibited divinations.

181
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:37,304
Do you admit to your sins?

182
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:46,689
I was merely paid
to give people what they wanted.

183
00:15:46,772 --> 00:15:50,401
The ones at fault are those
who asked me to curse others.

184
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:52,319
Your curse has led to someone's death!

185
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:55,239
Yet you still plead innocence?

186
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:01,620
A divination strong enough
to kill someone…

187
00:16:01,704 --> 00:16:03,247
I am amazed by your divine powers.

188
00:16:03,872 --> 00:16:04,999
It just might be

189
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:10,379
strong enough to even kill you.

190
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:19,680
Find every single spell book and tool
that was used to perform evil divinations.

191
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:20,681
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

192
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:39,825
No, not that!

193
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:41,952
We may be a lowly family,

194
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:44,038
but that is our family heirloom.

195
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:46,415
I did not use it to perform divinations!

196
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:47,666
So please do not burn it!

197
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,418
CHEONGANG

198
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:50,669
It is a spell book.

199
00:16:50,753 --> 00:16:51,795
No…

200
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:53,505
Burn it.

201
00:16:56,425 --> 00:17:00,179
No!

202
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:02,097
CHEONGANG

203
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:20,032
Put out the fire. Now!

204
00:17:20,115 --> 00:17:21,158
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

205
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:32,002
CHEONGANG

206
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,304
THE ALCHEMY OF SOULS

207
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:44,431
"The alchemy of souls"?

208
00:17:58,612 --> 00:17:59,947
Hang in there, my sister.

209
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,175
Everything began with him.

210
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:21,802
He put those scars on my sister's face.

211
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:25,055
He is the reason why my sister
shifted her soul into your body.

212
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:27,141
It is all his fault.

213
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,726
Jang Gang.

214
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,563
Jang…

215
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:35,065
Gang…

216
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,068
You cannot pass away just yet.

217
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:40,737
Stay alive in my sister's body

218
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:43,240
for just a bit longer,

219
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:45,284
Your Highness.

220
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:53,167
It has been more than ten years
since I entered this body.

221
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:57,671
But whenever her consciousness returns,
it still puts a toll on me.

222
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,633
If not for the Lantern of Life,
I would have killed her already.

223
00:19:01,717 --> 00:19:04,261
Your brother went to her
to feed her the potion.

224
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:07,264
So you will feel better soon.

225
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:09,683
But…

226
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:13,729
How did the ice stone
end up at Jeongjingak?

227
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:15,522
Jin Ho-gyeong probably made a mistake

228
00:19:15,606 --> 00:19:17,649
since it was her first time
handling the ice stone.

229
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,110
When the timing is right,

230
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:23,947
I will gather the power of the ice stone
using the alchemy of souls.

231
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,536
If you do that now,
everyone in Jeongjingak will die.

232
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,746
Yes, I know.

233
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:32,873
The Crown Prince is there too.

234
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,876
So?

235
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:39,963
You must wait
until the Crown Prince safely gets out.

236
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:41,465
Then you can collect its power.

237
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:42,925
What if he cannot get out?

238
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:46,053
Am I just supposed to wait and do nothing?

239
00:19:46,136 --> 00:19:49,640
What if someone else
takes its power before I do?

240
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:53,310
Fortunately, no one is doing anything
because everyone is on their guard.

241
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:58,482
First, we must find a way
to save the Crown Prince.

242
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:13,789
Mother.

243
00:20:20,337 --> 00:20:21,713
I must have misheard her.

244
00:20:22,464 --> 00:20:24,132
Why would she call me "Mother"?

245
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:26,176
That is ridiculous.

246
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:34,101
People…

247
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:37,938
seem more concerned about the ice stone…

248
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,442
than the kids who are trapped
inside the barrier.

249
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:46,947
The two of us should try
and break the barrier.

250
00:20:48,657 --> 00:20:51,576
If we do anything
without the Unanimous Assembly's consent,

251
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:53,996
there will be another fight.

252
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:58,250
The ice stone belongs to Jinyowon.

253
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,961
Songrim no longer has the right
to make decisions about it.

254
00:21:01,044 --> 00:21:02,087
Lady Jin.

255
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:06,466
Is it true that the ice stone
never left the walls of Jinyowon

256
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,844
for the past 200 years?

257
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:14,182
You once told me that a Songrim mage
once entered Jinyowon.

258
00:21:14,683 --> 00:21:15,976
By any chance,

259
00:21:17,978 --> 00:21:19,229
was it Jang Gang?

260
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:24,943
I asked you a question.

261
00:21:25,944 --> 00:21:29,698
Did Jang Gang ever get his hands
on the ice stone?

262
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:43,128
The baby inside me is not moving.

263
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:44,921
I had her inside me for 13 months.

264
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:46,923
I cannot let her go like this.

265
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:50,510
I must save her.

266
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:52,846
I am sorry.

267
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:55,599
She is already dead.

268
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:02,105
Inside Jinyowon

269
00:22:03,815 --> 00:22:04,775
lies the ice stone.

270
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:08,070
The ice stone?

271
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:10,572
Why act so startled?
You presumed it would be there.

272
00:22:10,655 --> 00:22:13,992
You asked me to let you inside Jinyowon
on numerous occasions.

273
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:17,454
I know it was because you wanted
to look for the ice stone.

274
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,667
I heard the ice stone has the power

275
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:26,797
to bring back the souls of the dead.

276
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:29,382
I am not powerful enough…

277
00:22:31,093 --> 00:22:32,803
to control the ice stone.

278
00:22:33,637 --> 00:22:34,721
But you, Jang Gang,

279
00:22:35,597 --> 00:22:37,682
might have what it takes.

280
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:41,937
Are you telling me to perform sorcery?

281
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,689
I will do anything to save my baby!

282
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:48,443
Please.

283
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:51,822
Please help me save this baby.

284
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:06,294
That night, I opened the doors of Jinyowon
and let him inside

285
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,214
in the hopes of saving the dead baby
inside me.

286
00:23:10,257 --> 00:23:13,885
And as a consequence,
Jinyowon ended up losing the ice stone.

287
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,562
Even if that was the case,

288
00:23:24,563 --> 00:23:26,815
Songrim is more at fault.

289
00:23:26,898 --> 00:23:30,443
A Songrim mage,
who always pretended to be righteous,

290
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:32,362
took the ice stone

291
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:35,866
and caused havoc by using it
to perform the alchemy of souls.

292
00:23:38,493 --> 00:23:40,662
That is why I wanted to hide it.

293
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,123
However,

294
00:23:44,332 --> 00:23:47,544
I will do what I can to reveal the truth
and set things right,

295
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,131
even if it requires me to expose
Songrim's wrongdoings…

296
00:23:52,883 --> 00:23:54,301
and reprimand those at fault.

297
00:23:58,013 --> 00:24:01,725
Then you will have to reprimand
the person you cherish as well.

298
00:24:04,102 --> 00:24:05,437
It will not be easy.

299
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,690
I know.

300
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:12,027
But…

301
00:24:12,777 --> 00:24:16,990
if that is the only way
to rectify the situation,

302
00:24:20,202 --> 00:24:22,579
then I will do so.

303
00:24:32,422 --> 00:24:34,591
My sister will shift her soul
from your body

304
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:38,595
to the body of a girl who is
pretending to be my eldest daughter.

305
00:24:39,387 --> 00:24:40,972
Once that happens,

306
00:24:41,056 --> 00:24:44,643
I will do as you wish and kill you.

307
00:24:59,908 --> 00:25:00,951
Cho-yeon.

308
00:25:02,994 --> 00:25:04,204
What…

309
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:05,622
What are you doing here?

310
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:09,626
Father.

311
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,836
What…

312
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:14,965
in the world…

313
00:25:16,132 --> 00:25:17,384
did I just hear?

314
00:25:21,763 --> 00:25:24,766
Who is that woman?

315
00:25:25,934 --> 00:25:28,186
Does the soul inside that body…

316
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,440
truly belong to the Queen?

317
00:26:02,012 --> 00:26:04,306
Father, stop.

318
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,202
My lord.

319
00:27:08,203 --> 00:27:09,454
Is that you?

320
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:20,256
Maidservant Kim.

321
00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:22,675
It has been a long time.

322
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:28,181
Master Jang.

323
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:09,597
It is the soul shifter.

324
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,769
Uk must have defeated him.

325
00:28:15,353 --> 00:28:16,438
It only took a single stroke.

326
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:20,859
We cannot use spells in here.
How did he manage to kill him?

327
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:24,904
Where are Uk and Mu-deok?

328
00:28:24,988 --> 00:28:26,072
Find them.

329
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:28,032
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

330
00:28:38,793 --> 00:28:41,921
I saw an illusion when I first received
the energy of the ice stone.

331
00:28:42,964 --> 00:28:45,467
She told me that no one can
truly own the ice stone

332
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,218
and that you can only use its power.

333
00:28:48,344 --> 00:28:49,971
Because it is the power of the sky.

334
00:28:50,722 --> 00:28:52,390
We need to train ourselves

335
00:28:52,974 --> 00:28:56,144
to even be able to control
the energy within us.

336
00:28:56,227 --> 00:28:59,105
The energy of the sky
is surely way beyond our reach.

337
00:28:59,189 --> 00:29:03,526
I guess it means we are unable
to use it freely because it is not ours.

338
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:07,739
If one cannot own it…

339
00:29:08,823 --> 00:29:10,408
What if I give it all away?

340
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:12,494
Give it all away?

341
00:29:12,577 --> 00:29:16,206
What if I give all my energy
to the energy of the sky?

342
00:29:16,915 --> 00:29:19,250
Then my energy will become
the energy of the sky.

343
00:29:22,837 --> 00:29:24,964
I read records about the ice stone

344
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:26,925
inside the secret library in Jeongjingak.

345
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:31,638
It said the ice stone has
no shape or form.

346
00:29:31,721 --> 00:29:34,557
Thus, it can be water, fire, or wind.

347
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:36,851
It is impossible to know its size.

348
00:29:36,935 --> 00:29:40,271
Thus, it can be
both minuscule or enormous.

349
00:29:42,315 --> 00:29:45,276
That means the fog
surrounding Jeongjingak like a barrier

350
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,195
is not the actual form of the ice stone.

351
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:49,781
So it can turn into water or fire,

352
00:29:49,864 --> 00:29:52,575
and it can also become bigger
or smaller than this?

353
00:29:53,326 --> 00:29:54,369
That is right.

354
00:29:54,452 --> 00:29:57,997
Then do you think
we can turn the fog into rain?

355
00:29:58,623 --> 00:29:59,624
Rain?

356
00:29:59,707 --> 00:30:02,544
You told me that I was incapable
of beating the ice stone

357
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:05,046
because I could only gather
a single water drop at most.

358
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:09,634
But what if that water drop
turns into thousands of raindrops?

359
00:30:11,594 --> 00:30:13,721
Then it will turn into rain.

360
00:30:13,805 --> 00:30:15,348
It might work.

361
00:30:16,224 --> 00:30:18,142
But to do that, you need to use Tansu.

362
00:30:18,226 --> 00:30:20,562
-Then…
-Then I will lose all my energy.

363
00:30:21,604 --> 00:30:24,732
That is why I said
I must give it all away.

364
00:30:28,903 --> 00:30:29,904
No.

365
00:30:29,988 --> 00:30:31,698
Let us think of another way.

366
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:34,659
If we wait and the Queen gathers
the power of the ice stone,

367
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,828
we will all die.

368
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:40,665
She will not be able to do anything rash
with the Unanimous Assembly there.

369
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:43,793
Uk, I do not want you to do this.

370
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:46,045
As your master, that is an order.

371
00:30:54,804 --> 00:30:57,432
I may have given up
on acquiring this power,

372
00:30:57,515 --> 00:30:59,225
but I cannot let you lose it all too.

373
00:31:00,643 --> 00:31:02,729
It took us so much effort to get this far.

374
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:05,148
I had to push you again and again,

375
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:07,817
and you risked your life many times
to come this far.

376
00:31:13,406 --> 00:31:16,868
How could you be willing to lose it all
for a single drop of water?

377
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:22,081
Yul is severely injured.

378
00:31:22,165 --> 00:31:24,792
If we do not do anything, he will die.

379
00:31:30,506 --> 00:31:31,841
Mu-deok.

380
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:35,637
You gave up what you wanted
because you wanted to protect me.

381
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:40,516
I am trying to protect as well.

382
00:31:41,392 --> 00:31:45,438
And Yul has also been
protecting you all along.

383
00:31:56,032 --> 00:31:59,035
Without a blood transfusion,
his life will be in danger.

384
00:32:02,413 --> 00:32:04,958
This worm sucked the blood
of a member of the Jin family.

385
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:06,668
If I give this to him…

386
00:32:43,287 --> 00:32:44,998
Do not die, Young Master Seo.

387
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:48,001
Please stay alive.

388
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:20,992
Put away the Soul Ejector.
What if someone sees it?

389
00:33:21,576 --> 00:33:23,619
I cannot endure this any longer.

390
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,997
I must retrieve the ice stone at once

391
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,249
with the help of the Soul Ejector.

392
00:33:30,668 --> 00:33:31,919
Have you lost your mind?

393
00:33:32,003 --> 00:33:33,755
You cannot perform sorcery
with the Soul Ejector

394
00:33:33,838 --> 00:33:35,506
when the Unanimous Assembly is here.

395
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,217
Sorcery?

396
00:33:41,637 --> 00:33:44,098
This Soul Ejector was made
from the ice stone.

397
00:33:44,182 --> 00:33:47,018
Yet the ice stone is considered good
while the Soul Ejector is considered evil.

398
00:33:47,101 --> 00:33:49,228
How ridiculous is that?

399
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:53,316
You may think it is ridiculous,
but that is the order of this world.

400
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:56,152
We are doing this
so you can emerge from the darkness

401
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:58,696
without being defamed
as someone who performs sorcery.

402
00:33:59,447 --> 00:34:00,448
Defame?

403
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:04,911
You came this far with the help
of my family's alchemy of souls.

404
00:34:04,994 --> 00:34:07,538
How dare you treat it with disdain?

405
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:15,254
I am merely saying the alchemy of souls
is a spell that is unacknowledged.

406
00:34:16,714 --> 00:34:19,092
Why must the world acknowledge it?

407
00:34:19,801 --> 00:34:22,970
When we found the ice stone
at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho ten years ago,

408
00:34:23,054 --> 00:34:26,682
we could have used the power of sorcery
to rise under the Choi family name.

409
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:27,767
However,

410
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:30,937
you insisted that I enter the Queen's body

411
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,314
and formed a secret organization
in Cheonbugwan.

412
00:34:33,397 --> 00:34:34,565
And now,

413
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:39,362
you insist on revealing the ice stone
to the world through Jinyowon.

414
00:34:40,696 --> 00:34:44,742
That was because it was too dangerous
to go against the world with sorcery.

415
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:48,663
It was not that it was dangerous.
You just despised it.

416
00:34:49,163 --> 00:34:51,624
You did not want to be stigmatized
for using sorcery.

417
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:55,837
You just wanted to wield your power
as everyone worshipped you.

418
00:34:59,173 --> 00:35:01,676
Why are you so desperate
to be acknowledged?

419
00:35:03,678 --> 00:35:06,931
Is it because you still cannot get over
the fact that you were born

420
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:10,893
due to your father's dirty affair
and were never truly acknowledged

421
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:16,357
as a true member of the Jin family,
which made you run around like a dog?

422
00:35:29,954 --> 00:35:35,001
The royal position of Queen
must have become burdensome

423
00:35:35,084 --> 00:35:39,297
for someone who used to make a living
off of performing crude divinations.

424
00:35:43,634 --> 00:35:48,431
If it is so hard to bear,
I will get you a few living souls.

425
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:53,019
Feed off their souls
and get your act together.

426
00:36:20,296 --> 00:36:23,382
You found the Queen's soul?

427
00:36:24,634 --> 00:36:28,179
Did you bring her to Songrim?

428
00:36:28,262 --> 00:36:29,222
Yes.

429
00:36:29,305 --> 00:36:31,140
She is with Young Lady Jin.

430
00:36:33,976 --> 00:36:35,728
Bring her to the Training Center.

431
00:36:35,811 --> 00:36:37,355
I will reveal the truth
in front of everyone.

432
00:36:38,064 --> 00:36:39,190
No, my lord.

433
00:36:39,857 --> 00:36:43,027
You must only tell the royal family
and the people of Jinyowon.

434
00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:48,616
You are the heir of Songrim,

435
00:36:48,699 --> 00:36:52,495
yet you stand there
worrying about the reputation of Jinyowon?

436
00:36:54,205 --> 00:36:55,790
I will not deny that.

437
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:00,795
But Songrim also seems
to hold responsibility in this matter.

438
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:06,175
A Songrim mage was the start of all this.

439
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:09,262
A Songrim mage? Who?

440
00:37:10,054 --> 00:37:13,849
Jang Uk's father, Gwanju Jang Gang.

441
00:37:33,536 --> 00:37:35,288
Based on Songrim's request,

442
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:38,541
I have sent everyone away
but the mages of Cheonbugwan and Jinyowon.

443
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:41,585
What is that you have to tell us?

444
00:37:43,087 --> 00:37:47,633
I heard the Crown Prince has been
looking for someone recently.

445
00:37:48,384 --> 00:37:50,428
Park Dang-gu, a mage of Jeongjingak,

446
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:53,681
and Jin Cho-yeon, a priestess of Jinyowon,
have found that person.

447
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:57,059
The Crown Prince has been
looking for someone?

448
00:37:58,185 --> 00:37:59,478
Who may that be?

449
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:03,649
She is here with us.

450
00:38:08,612 --> 00:38:09,905
I heard someone threw a rock

451
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:12,700
that said the ice stone takes away
their energy to cast spells.

452
00:38:12,783 --> 00:38:15,745
The ice stone takes away
their power to cast spells?

453
00:38:15,828 --> 00:38:18,205
It is the power used
in the alchemy of souls.

454
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:21,667
I guess it sucks out spell-casting energy
just like how it does with souls.

455
00:38:21,751 --> 00:38:25,338
Then what is going to happen to our kids?

456
00:38:25,421 --> 00:38:27,631
You were all so eager to kill someone

457
00:38:27,715 --> 00:38:30,301
just so you could see its power.

458
00:38:30,384 --> 00:38:32,261
And now you are scared?

459
00:38:32,845 --> 00:38:36,766
The power of the ice stone
cannot be controlled by humans.

460
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:39,685
That is why Songrim
insisted on destroying it.

461
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:41,812
Then Songrim should take action.

462
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:44,315
My son is in there.

463
00:38:44,398 --> 00:38:45,858
So is my granddaughter.

464
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:49,236
If I knew what to do,
I would not be just standing here.

465
00:38:50,571 --> 00:38:52,114
Everyone here coveted

466
00:38:52,198 --> 00:38:54,533
the power of the heavens,
and look what that led to.

467
00:38:55,326 --> 00:38:57,745
I fear this will cause
many people to die again,

468
00:38:57,828 --> 00:39:00,581
just as what happened 200 years ago
during the Great Chaos.

469
00:39:01,165 --> 00:39:02,249
Seo Gyeong…

470
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,252
Master Seo Gyeong
got rid of the ice stone.

471
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:09,215
Did he leave anything behind
other than Words of the Heart?

472
00:39:09,298 --> 00:39:13,177
Words of the Heart
was the only thing he left behind.

473
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,472
We summoned the power of the ice stone,

474
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:19,183
so someone among us must undo it

475
00:39:20,142 --> 00:39:22,686
just like what Master Seo Gyeong did
many years ago.

476
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,946
You are going to use rain
to get rid of the ice stone's energy?

477
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,824
I cannot be sure if it will rain

478
00:39:34,907 --> 00:39:38,077
and whether or not
that rain will get rid of the barrier.

479
00:39:38,911 --> 00:39:40,454
One thing is for sure.

480
00:39:41,372 --> 00:39:42,957
If you use Tansu in here,

481
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:45,000
you will lose

482
00:39:45,918 --> 00:39:47,920
all of your ability to cast spells.

483
00:39:49,046 --> 00:39:50,423
I know.

484
00:39:50,506 --> 00:39:52,007
Yet you are willing to try?

485
00:39:54,927 --> 00:39:57,179
You may not be a high-level mage,

486
00:39:57,763 --> 00:40:00,724
but you still went through a lot
to get this far.

487
00:40:01,392 --> 00:40:02,935
Are you fine with losing it all?

488
00:40:06,021 --> 00:40:07,690
I will deal with that.

489
00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:10,359
But I need you to help me deal
with something else.

490
00:40:12,027 --> 00:40:14,697
If the ice stone disappears,

491
00:40:15,364 --> 00:40:18,200
I need you to deal with what comes next.

492
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,456
Those who coveted its power
will become resentful.

493
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:27,209
They might even get suspicious
and think it was hidden somewhere.

494
00:40:27,293 --> 00:40:31,505
So you want me to act like
I was the one who hid the ice stone

495
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:33,716
and to deal with the consequences?

496
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:37,052
Are you telling me
to take credit for what you did?

497
00:40:37,136 --> 00:40:39,180
I am asking you to clean up

498
00:40:39,263 --> 00:40:41,974
after the mess I will be causing.

499
00:40:47,062 --> 00:40:48,147
Jang Uk.

500
00:40:48,856 --> 00:40:51,108
Not only could you lose your powers,
but you could also die.

501
00:40:51,192 --> 00:40:52,985
Stop being stupid and just forget it.

502
00:40:55,988 --> 00:40:57,907
My master

503
00:40:58,449 --> 00:41:01,660
always pushed me to the edge of a cliff
and said this to me.

504
00:41:02,203 --> 00:41:05,664
"It is better to die than to do nothing."

505
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,754
I will be trying something
not out of stupidity, but out of vigor.

506
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,548
Just as my master has taught me.

507
00:41:18,802 --> 00:41:20,721
I did not know you had a master.

508
00:41:20,804 --> 00:41:24,642
Who is it? Is it Master Lee Cheol?

509
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:27,686
Young Master.

510
00:41:31,482 --> 00:41:32,650
I brought the sword.

511
00:41:39,448 --> 00:41:40,407
Filthy Mu-deok.

512
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:44,537
Are you not going to stop him
from being so reckless?

513
00:41:45,913 --> 00:41:49,667
It is better to die than to do nothing.

514
00:41:53,504 --> 00:41:54,463
Young Master.

515
00:41:55,965 --> 00:41:57,508
Do what you must.

516
00:41:58,092 --> 00:41:59,134
And…

517
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:01,637
I hope you succeed.

518
00:42:20,114 --> 00:42:25,119
The person who is about to step inside
is in an incredibly terrible state.

519
00:42:25,703 --> 00:42:27,037
Twenty years ago,

520
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:30,499
she burned herself as she tried to escape
the patrol of Cheonbugwan.

521
00:42:36,338 --> 00:42:38,549
She was a shaman who performed divinations

522
00:42:39,717 --> 00:42:41,051
and cursed people.

523
00:42:44,179 --> 00:42:45,431
A shaman?

524
00:42:46,181 --> 00:42:49,977
She was locked up like a beast
for a very long time,

525
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,647
inside a tiny room
near an apothecary in Gaema Village.

526
00:42:56,108 --> 00:42:58,944
Why was she locked up?

527
00:42:59,028 --> 00:43:01,196
I requested you to assemble this meeting

528
00:43:01,905 --> 00:43:04,325
in hopes to find that out, Your Majesty.

529
00:43:06,076 --> 00:43:07,620
Everyone here is

530
00:43:07,703 --> 00:43:13,167
somewhat related to Shaman Choi,
the woman who will soon enter this room.

531
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,212
-Everyone?
-Your Majesty.

532
00:43:17,296 --> 00:43:19,632
Now is not the time for this.

533
00:43:20,215 --> 00:43:21,759
Deal with the ice stone first.

534
00:43:21,842 --> 00:43:23,802
This can wait
until the Crown Prince safely returns.

535
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:35,105
Leader of Songrim, bring the shaman here.

536
00:43:40,653 --> 00:43:41,987
Please come inside.

537
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:33,038
Shaman Choi, show your face.

538
00:45:00,524 --> 00:45:01,984
Your Majesty.

539
00:45:03,652 --> 00:45:08,490
Never in my dreams did I think
I would be able to see your face again.

540
00:45:09,575 --> 00:45:12,327
Do you know me?

541
00:45:12,411 --> 00:45:15,330
I am your wife, Your Majesty.

542
00:45:15,873 --> 00:45:19,084
I am Seo Ha-seon, the Queen of Daeho.

543
00:45:20,043 --> 00:45:21,044
Shut your mouth!

544
00:45:21,128 --> 00:45:24,256
How dare you speak my name
with that filthy mouth of yours?

545
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:26,675
I am the Queen of this country!

546
00:45:26,758 --> 00:45:28,343
How dare you!

547
00:45:29,094 --> 00:45:30,679
You did this to me.

548
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:34,600
You, a lowly shaman,
used the wicked alchemy of souls

549
00:45:34,683 --> 00:45:37,227
to shift your filthy soul…

550
00:45:38,479 --> 00:45:42,816
into my sacred body,
the body of the Queen!

551
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,735
I have had enough of your lies.

552
00:45:45,402 --> 00:45:47,029
Assistant Gwanju, do not just stand there.

553
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:49,198
Shut that crazy woman up right now.

554
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:55,370
First, we will have to check

555
00:45:55,454 --> 00:45:57,748
whether or not she is lying.

556
00:45:59,249 --> 00:46:00,292
Fine.

557
00:46:01,376 --> 00:46:03,170
She says her soul was shifted,

558
00:46:03,253 --> 00:46:06,465
so let us check if the Queen
has a blue mark on her body.

559
00:46:11,136 --> 00:46:15,057
I will gladly show it to you
to help you get rid of your suspicions.

560
00:46:25,484 --> 00:46:29,112
Should I reveal my shoulder here?

561
00:46:29,196 --> 00:46:33,408
The blue mark can easily be removed.

562
00:46:33,492 --> 00:46:34,993
Then there is no other way to prove it.

563
00:46:38,705 --> 00:46:40,207
There is Gwigu.

564
00:46:49,258 --> 00:46:50,592
I have the ashes

565
00:46:50,676 --> 00:46:55,806
of the dog Gwigu was in
that was cremated recently.

566
00:46:57,516 --> 00:46:59,935
What remains of Gwigu's powers
will help us…

567
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,316
reveal the truth.

568
00:47:11,113 --> 00:47:12,906
No!

569
00:47:16,743 --> 00:47:19,162
No!

570
00:47:26,169 --> 00:47:27,421
You see,

571
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,506
those were…

572
00:47:30,799 --> 00:47:32,509
simply ashes collected

573
00:47:33,468 --> 00:47:34,970
from a brazier.

574
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,736
You just proved to us yourself

575
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,823
that you are a soul shifter.

576
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:06,043
I order you to drag out Shaman Choi

577
00:48:06,126 --> 00:48:10,339
who used the wicked
alchemy of souls to take over

578
00:48:10,422 --> 00:48:11,715
the Queen's body!

579
00:48:11,798 --> 00:48:12,883
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

580
00:48:13,508 --> 00:48:14,635
No!

581
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:20,932
Do not harm her. That is my body.

582
00:48:21,683 --> 00:48:24,936
My soul must return to that body.
Do not let her harm it.

583
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:27,648
Do not come close.

584
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:33,278
Otherwise, I will
destroy this body to pieces.

585
00:48:33,862 --> 00:48:35,739
She is a descendant of Mage Choi,

586
00:48:35,822 --> 00:48:39,076
the man who caused
the Great Chaos 200 years ago.

587
00:48:40,494 --> 00:48:43,705
And she was most likely the one
who created the Soul Ejectors,

588
00:48:44,623 --> 00:48:47,125
which explains the recent appearances
of soul shifters.

589
00:48:48,168 --> 00:48:50,128
This evil performer of sorcery

590
00:48:50,212 --> 00:48:52,798
revealed the ice stone
in front of the Unanimous Assembly

591
00:48:53,382 --> 00:48:55,342
and made a complete fool

592
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,345
of all the mages in Daeho.

593
00:48:59,471 --> 00:49:02,766
The royal family,
Cheonbugwan, and Jinyowon

594
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:05,394
have all been fooled

595
00:49:05,477 --> 00:49:10,524
by the Choi siblings this whole time.

596
00:49:11,942 --> 00:49:13,110
"Siblings"?

597
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,576
Honey, does this mean

598
00:49:22,703 --> 00:49:26,123
you and that shaman are siblings?

599
00:49:30,669 --> 00:49:32,462
You are a member of the Choi family?

600
00:49:40,429 --> 00:49:41,888
Yes, I am.

601
00:49:46,268 --> 00:49:47,519
I am sorry.

602
00:49:50,939 --> 00:49:53,316
Jin Bu-yeon,
the daughter you recently found,

603
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,026
is also a fake

604
00:49:56,236 --> 00:49:57,362
made by them.

605
00:49:58,739 --> 00:50:02,868
It turns out her next plan was
to shift souls into the body

606
00:50:02,951 --> 00:50:05,287
of Jinyowon's heir.

607
00:50:17,424 --> 00:50:18,633
Shaman Choi.

608
00:50:18,717 --> 00:50:20,302
Put down the dagger

609
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:23,346
and return that body
to Her Highness the Queen.

610
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:24,639
Do as I say,

611
00:50:25,557 --> 00:50:30,395
and I will spare your brother's life.

612
00:50:42,699 --> 00:50:44,409
You say I am evil.

613
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:48,705
But no one here

614
00:50:49,748 --> 00:50:52,793
deserves to call me that.

615
00:50:54,294 --> 00:50:55,754
Do you want to know

616
00:50:55,837 --> 00:50:59,633
how I managed to take over
the sacred body of the Queen?

617
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:05,972
She gladly gave up her body to me
because she wanted to shift souls

618
00:51:06,056 --> 00:51:08,642
into a younger and more beautiful body.

619
00:51:08,725 --> 00:51:09,684
Jin Ho-gyeong!

620
00:51:10,977 --> 00:51:13,855
Were you not the one who brought
the ice stone out into the world?

621
00:51:15,023 --> 00:51:18,276
You are the leader of Jinyowon,
the protector of its relics.

622
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,694
Yet you let the ice stone

623
00:51:19,778 --> 00:51:23,156
leave the four walls of Jinyowon so
it could be used for the alchemy of souls.

624
00:51:24,741 --> 00:51:28,662
And the very person who performed
the alchemy of souls

625
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:31,915
was a mage of Songrim.

626
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:34,459
Park Jin!

627
00:51:34,543 --> 00:51:37,254
You hid the truth,
despite knowing everything.

628
00:51:37,963 --> 00:51:42,175
You acted like you were eager
to catch everyone who performed sorcery.

629
00:51:42,259 --> 00:51:47,138
However, you were busy
trying to hide that man's faults.

630
00:51:56,857 --> 00:51:58,316
As for you, Jin Mu.

631
00:51:59,734 --> 00:52:03,530
Why are you just standing there
doing nothing?

632
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:09,703
Am I really the only one that is evil
based on the logic and justification

633
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:12,998
created by these people?

634
00:52:24,259 --> 00:52:26,303
Logic and justification are
created by those with power.

635
00:52:26,386 --> 00:52:31,266
But you have lost your power now,
so that makes you evil.

636
00:52:35,103 --> 00:52:37,063
Jin Mu, you do not fail to disappoint.

637
00:52:38,106 --> 00:52:41,985
Your loyalty is as fickle as the wind.

638
00:52:42,068 --> 00:52:44,112
Hand over the rest of the Soul Ejectors.

639
00:52:44,905 --> 00:52:46,406
We will return the Queen's body,

640
00:52:46,489 --> 00:52:48,575
and you will be set free
without petrification.

641
00:52:49,784 --> 00:52:54,039
I advise you to do as I say
if you want your brother to live.

642
00:52:55,123 --> 00:52:56,625
My sister.

643
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:59,419
Use the remaining Soul Ejector
to run away.

644
00:53:01,504 --> 00:53:04,299
This is the only thing left
that I can do for you.

645
00:53:06,843 --> 00:53:07,928
For that, I am sorry.

646
00:53:11,431 --> 00:53:12,766
Father!

647
00:53:12,849 --> 00:53:13,975
Father!

648
00:53:15,518 --> 00:53:16,478
Father!

649
00:53:24,361 --> 00:53:25,528
Father…

650
00:53:37,749 --> 00:53:39,209
Father…

651
00:53:59,312 --> 00:54:03,483
I will do as you wish
and get rid of the evil ice stone!

652
00:54:03,566 --> 00:54:04,776
However,

653
00:54:05,485 --> 00:54:07,445
once the ice stone is gone,

654
00:54:08,279 --> 00:54:13,243
everyone inside it will also die.

655
00:55:48,296 --> 00:55:49,798
-Look.
-What is that?

656
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:49,566
Jang Gang?

657
00:56:50,233 --> 00:56:51,192
"Jang Gang"?

658
00:56:51,901 --> 00:56:54,696
Jang Gang, the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan?

659
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,949
Jang Gang, is that really you?

660
00:56:58,533 --> 00:57:00,368
What are you doing here?

661
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:26,102
He is a soul shifter.

662
00:57:36,362 --> 00:57:38,490
The energy of the Soul Ejector is gone.

663
00:57:39,365 --> 00:57:42,202
Someone stopped it.

664
00:57:45,955 --> 00:57:47,415
Gwanju Jang Gang is here.

665
00:58:04,224 --> 00:58:05,642
Jang Gang…

666
00:58:06,851 --> 00:58:09,729
Did you block the energy
of the Soul Ejector…

667
00:58:11,064 --> 00:58:12,607
with your body?

668
00:58:19,447 --> 00:58:22,617
Do not go near him.

669
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,994
Jang Gang is a soul shifter
and has run wild.

670
00:58:25,703 --> 00:58:26,955
Look.

671
00:58:27,038 --> 00:58:29,916
His entire body is becoming petrified.

672
00:58:32,544 --> 00:58:33,419
He is right.

673
00:58:34,754 --> 00:58:37,882
I performed the forbidden alchemy of souls
and became a soul shifter,

674
00:58:38,591 --> 00:58:39,801
and now I am running wild.

675
00:58:41,302 --> 00:58:43,012
You are the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan.

676
00:58:43,096 --> 00:58:45,056
Are you confessing your use of sorcery?

677
00:58:45,139 --> 00:58:47,976
Master Lee Cheol,
a pupil of Master Seo Gyeong,

678
00:58:49,269 --> 00:58:52,897
has ordered me to confess my sins
in front of the Unanimous Assembly,

679
00:58:54,148 --> 00:58:55,817
and that is why I am here.

680
00:59:00,572 --> 00:59:03,116
If you have any energy left
to read this letter,

681
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:06,160
use the energy you have
to help those who are enduring

682
00:59:06,244 --> 00:59:07,912
the mess you have created.

683
00:59:09,372 --> 00:59:12,166
It will be a chance for you
to end what you have started.

684
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:15,837
Then the star will rise,

685
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,964
and the rock will descend.

686
00:59:22,427 --> 00:59:24,220
I am responsible

687
00:59:25,305 --> 00:59:28,391
for all the mistakes related to Songrim,
Jinyowon, and Cheonbugwan.

688
00:59:29,892 --> 00:59:31,936
I took the ice stone from Jinyowon

689
00:59:33,021 --> 00:59:35,023
and used it to perform sorcery.

690
00:59:36,441 --> 00:59:39,152
It was also me
who tried to keep it a secret.

691
00:59:40,653 --> 00:59:43,573
I will get petrified here
to make up for all my wrongdoings.

692
00:59:46,075 --> 00:59:48,953
Gwanju Jang Gang was the man
who started all this,

693
00:59:49,037 --> 00:59:51,581
so I will allow him to put an end to this

694
00:59:52,665 --> 00:59:53,958
with his death.

695
01:00:01,841 --> 01:00:04,636
I want all of you to witness
the tragic collapse of the man

696
01:00:05,595 --> 01:00:07,013
who performed sorcery.

697
01:00:07,096 --> 01:00:09,098
He may be a soul shifter,

698
01:00:09,182 --> 01:00:10,892
but you cannot let him die like this.

699
01:00:10,975 --> 01:00:13,478
His son, Jang Uk, is inside Jeongjingak.

700
01:00:13,561 --> 01:00:16,648
You should wait
until Uk gets out of there.

701
01:00:16,731 --> 01:00:20,109
He deserves to say goodbye to his father.

702
01:00:20,193 --> 01:00:21,903
He is not my son!

703
01:00:22,528 --> 01:00:24,572
You all know that
I blocked his gate of energy

704
01:00:24,656 --> 01:00:26,908
to prevent him
from walking in my footsteps.

705
01:00:30,745 --> 01:00:32,455
He already had a miserable childhood.

706
01:00:33,706 --> 01:00:36,000
Do not let him live
as the son of a sinner.

707
01:01:43,776 --> 01:01:45,236
Where am I?

708
01:01:50,992 --> 01:01:53,703
What is going on? Am I dead?

709
01:02:06,424 --> 01:02:07,592
So it happened.

710
01:02:08,676 --> 01:02:10,428
My energy to cast spells is gone.

711
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:32,492
Is this the ice stone?

712
01:02:33,701 --> 01:02:37,747
Did I finally get it now that I no longer
have the power to do anything with it?

713
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:40,583
Now, this is just

714
01:02:41,793 --> 01:02:43,544
nothing more than a stone to me.

715
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:09,904
It is the King's Star!

716
01:03:09,987 --> 01:03:12,532
The King's Star is up in the night sky!

717
01:03:49,026 --> 01:03:51,904
The King's Star has appeared.
The barrier around Jeongjingak is gone.

718
01:04:06,711 --> 01:04:08,462
The ice stone has vanished,

719
01:04:09,422 --> 01:04:11,591
and the King's Star has appeared.

720
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,136
The King's Star also appeared
when Master Seo Gyeong

721
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:17,597
ended the Great Chaos 200 years ago.

722
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:21,601
Then are you saying that
someone inside Jeongjingak

723
01:04:21,684 --> 01:04:24,729
was born with the same fate
as Master Seo Gyeong?

724
01:04:44,832 --> 01:04:46,667
He is the King's Star.

725
01:04:46,751 --> 01:04:48,669
He is the King's Star!

726
01:05:03,601 --> 01:05:05,436
The Crown Prince is

727
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:09,106
the newly risen King's Star!

728
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:11,400
-Your Royal Highness!
-Your Royal Highness!

729
01:05:25,998 --> 01:05:28,918
Uk was the one who was born
with the energy of the King's Star.

730
01:05:30,211 --> 01:05:33,005
Did he get rid of the ice stone?

731
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,285
My pupil, you have lost all your energy.

732
01:06:05,121 --> 01:06:09,125
Master, you also have returned
to being just Mu-deok.

733
01:06:11,752 --> 01:06:13,295
I do not mind

734
01:06:14,296 --> 01:06:15,881
since we are together.

735
01:06:52,418 --> 01:06:55,004
I heard the wedding is
going to be held at Songrim.

736
01:06:55,087 --> 01:06:57,840
Of course. The groom is a mage of Songrim.

737
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,134
I do not approve of this marriage.

738
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:02,636
I simply cannot believe
that they are getting married.

739
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,680
I saw them together a few times.

740
01:07:04,764 --> 01:07:06,432
They make a nice couple.

741
01:07:06,515 --> 01:07:09,310
What is wrong with you?
The groom could do better.

742
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:10,770
What are you talking about?

743
01:07:10,853 --> 01:07:12,772
That should be said about the bride.

744
01:07:12,855 --> 01:07:14,565
People could not stop talking

745
01:07:14,648 --> 01:07:16,984
about the Unanimous Assembly
and the King's Star.

746
01:07:17,068 --> 01:07:19,904
But now they are busy
talking about the upcoming wedding.

747
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:24,784
The leader of Songrim pushed for
this wedding knowing this would happen.

748
01:07:24,867 --> 01:07:28,245
I must say, I still cannot believe
that those two are getting married.

749
01:07:30,915 --> 01:07:34,293
Young Master Seo, I heard you did not eat.

750
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,879
I will eat when I am hungry. Do not worry.

751
01:07:36,962 --> 01:07:38,672
Shall I make you some noodles?

752
01:07:39,298 --> 01:07:40,925
You need to eat to take medicine.

753
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:46,055
I do not need to take it anymore.
Stop bothering me about it.

754
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:48,516
You are returning to Seoho Fortress soon.

755
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:50,559
You should eat well before you leave…

756
01:07:56,941 --> 01:07:58,442
My wound has healed,

757
01:07:59,443 --> 01:08:00,820
and I have regained my energy.

758
01:08:02,363 --> 01:08:04,573
I heard you still
moan in pain in your sleep.

759
01:08:05,491 --> 01:08:06,909
I know you are lying.

760
01:08:09,495 --> 01:08:10,996
It does not hurt much.

761
01:08:16,961 --> 01:08:20,297
You are such a terrible liar,
Young Master Seo.

762
01:08:22,091 --> 01:08:25,136
You are very pure at heart,
so whenever you are being untrue,

763
01:08:25,719 --> 01:08:27,721
it is easy to notice.

764
01:08:29,682 --> 01:08:31,433
It just shows on your face.

765
01:08:33,602 --> 01:08:36,522
It must have been hard for you
to hide it all along.

766
01:08:44,155 --> 01:08:45,322
I am sorry.

767
01:08:47,449 --> 01:08:48,909
And thank you…

768
01:08:50,786 --> 01:08:51,996
for protecting me.

769
01:08:58,586 --> 01:09:02,047
And Yul has also been
protecting you all along.

770
01:09:05,676 --> 01:09:07,720
Yul knows who you are.

771
01:09:09,096 --> 01:09:10,598
He knows you are a soul shifter

772
01:09:10,681 --> 01:09:12,558
and that you are Naksu the assassin.

773
01:09:13,434 --> 01:09:15,227
But he tried his best not to show it.

774
01:09:20,608 --> 01:09:24,361
He wanted to protect the girl
he had met in Danhyanggok.

775
01:09:32,828 --> 01:09:34,288
You told me that

776
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:37,499
this belonged to the friend
who saved you in Danhyanggok, right?

777
01:09:39,001 --> 01:09:40,127
Yes.

778
01:09:42,213 --> 01:09:44,506
I wanted to take her with me

779
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:46,675
to Seoho Fortress.

780
01:09:52,431 --> 01:09:55,976
She had a secret
that she was hiding from everyone,

781
01:09:58,062 --> 01:10:00,356
so I wanted to take her there
and help her hide.

782
01:10:05,152 --> 01:10:06,820
I promised that

783
01:10:07,655 --> 01:10:10,574
I would help you take her with you.

784
01:10:12,618 --> 01:10:16,497
But that person only exists
in your memory now.

785
01:10:17,456 --> 01:10:19,333
She no longer exists in this world.

786
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:30,052
At first, I thought

787
01:10:30,135 --> 01:10:33,389
burning this might be the way to help you
erase her from your memory.

788
01:10:34,848 --> 01:10:37,476
But you told me
you loved everything about Danhyanggok.

789
01:10:43,232 --> 01:10:44,566
Take this with you.

790
01:10:57,955 --> 01:11:00,082
I would like to check
if you are healing well,

791
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:03,294
so allow me
to feel your breathing three times.

792
01:11:24,106 --> 01:11:26,066
Let us say goodbye to each other

793
01:11:28,902 --> 01:11:31,697
while these three breaths last.

794
01:11:44,209 --> 01:11:46,587
I also enjoyed my time with you…

795
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:50,507
at Danhyanggok.

796
01:11:57,639 --> 01:11:58,974
Thank you for everything.

797
01:12:39,848 --> 01:12:42,434
It looks like your wound is healing well.

798
01:12:43,811 --> 01:12:48,273
I know the medicine is bitter,
but make sure you take it regularly.

799
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,407
I will.

800
01:12:58,075 --> 01:13:00,285
I will take it
no matter how bitter it may be.

801
01:13:05,082 --> 01:13:06,792
This time, it will fully heal.

802
01:13:46,165 --> 01:13:49,501
Your father took full responsibility
for everything that happened

803
01:13:49,585 --> 01:13:54,923
by sacrificing his life in the end.

804
01:13:55,799 --> 01:13:58,969
Thanks to him, Songrim and Jinyowon
were not penalized.

805
01:14:06,852 --> 01:14:09,396
He probably denied that you were his son

806
01:14:10,105 --> 01:14:14,526
because he did not want you
to be blamed for his wrongdoings.

807
01:14:18,197 --> 01:14:19,531
Do not worry.

808
01:14:20,032 --> 01:14:24,161
I stopped being bothered by the fact
that I might not be his son.

809
01:14:28,332 --> 01:14:31,793
Do you recognize your father?

810
01:14:32,669 --> 01:14:34,796
You have never met him before, have you?

811
01:14:37,424 --> 01:14:38,800
I have met him.

812
01:14:40,219 --> 01:14:41,637
He probably knew

813
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:44,389
who I was when we met.

814
01:14:45,474 --> 01:14:46,767
It looks as though

815
01:14:47,476 --> 01:14:49,144
you know who I am.

816
01:14:49,811 --> 01:14:52,147
You carry the sword
of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju,

817
01:14:52,231 --> 01:14:53,732
so you must be his son.

818
01:15:25,639 --> 01:15:29,017
This is the sword and robe that
the royal family had given to Jang Gang,

819
01:15:29,101 --> 01:15:32,396
the former Gwanju of Cheonbugwan
who died while performing sorcery.

820
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:37,192
We would like for you to tell us
what to do with his belongings.

821
01:15:37,776 --> 01:15:39,236
Songrim can keep them.

822
01:15:40,654 --> 01:15:42,739
Have you found Jin Mu,
the Assistant Gwanju?

823
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:44,616
We are still looking for him.

824
01:15:45,617 --> 01:15:48,412
We are sure that
he has not left the capital.

825
01:15:48,495 --> 01:15:50,205
He could have left
in another person's body.

826
01:15:51,456 --> 01:15:53,875
If he does what he did to me
and shifts his soul,

827
01:15:53,959 --> 01:15:55,544
how will Songrim recognize him?

828
01:15:56,670 --> 01:15:58,880
After all,
you were fooled all these years.

829
01:16:02,801 --> 01:16:04,136
Your Highness.

830
01:16:04,219 --> 01:16:07,931
Master Kang of Daegangtongun
ran wild and became petrified,

831
01:16:08,015 --> 01:16:10,100
but Sejukwon succeeded in saving him.

832
01:16:10,726 --> 01:16:14,271
If you ever run wild and get petrified,

833
01:16:14,354 --> 01:16:16,189
there is a way to treat it.

834
01:16:17,441 --> 01:16:18,734
What is the point?

835
01:16:19,276 --> 01:16:23,947
I will have to live in this horrible body
until the day I die.

836
01:16:26,074 --> 01:16:28,827
How could you let Jang Uk live
when his father was the one

837
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:31,038
who caused me to become like this?

838
01:16:31,121 --> 01:16:32,414
Jang Gang

839
01:16:32,998 --> 01:16:35,500
took full responsibility
by giving up his life.

840
01:16:36,418 --> 01:16:38,378
We also took away

841
01:16:39,254 --> 01:16:42,841
Jang Uk's rights to become
the next Gwanju of Cheonbugwan.

842
01:16:44,051 --> 01:16:45,844
He washed away his sins

843
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:49,097
by losing everything he had.

844
01:16:50,932 --> 01:16:54,478
When Jang Gang died,
he told us that Jang Uk was not his son.

845
01:16:54,561 --> 01:16:56,605
So it would be unfair
to hold him responsible.

846
01:16:56,688 --> 01:17:00,359
Jang Gang died without telling us
who Jang Uk's father was in the end.

847
01:17:08,533 --> 01:17:10,160
Master Jang Gang wanted me

848
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:13,413
to give this to you.

849
01:17:18,251 --> 01:17:20,837
He told me that this will show you

850
01:17:21,838 --> 01:17:24,049
who Young Master Jang's father is.

851
01:17:47,322 --> 01:17:48,490
I guess

852
01:17:49,741 --> 01:17:52,786
you also know the truth now,
Maidservant Kim.

853
01:17:54,413 --> 01:17:55,872
I cannot believe it.

854
01:17:56,915 --> 01:18:00,711
Madam Do-hwa gave birth
to the son of the late king?

855
01:18:01,378 --> 01:18:04,548
Uk was conceived
when the late king shifted souls

856
01:18:05,674 --> 01:18:08,385
and slept with Do-hwa.

857
01:18:09,094 --> 01:18:13,432
Jang Gang performed the alchemy of souls
and shifted souls

858
01:18:15,475 --> 01:18:17,102
with the late king.

859
01:18:19,187 --> 01:18:24,025
Master Jang ruined his son's life.

860
01:18:25,861 --> 01:18:27,487
If Young Master Jang finds out…

861
01:18:28,989 --> 01:18:30,574
I do not plan to tell him.

862
01:18:32,075 --> 01:18:35,704
Not only will I keep it from Uk,

863
01:18:36,872 --> 01:18:38,832
but I will also keep it from everyone.

864
01:18:42,836 --> 01:18:46,173
The King's Star that appeared
the night you destroyed the ice stone

865
01:18:46,256 --> 01:18:48,633
was engraved in a constellation plate.

866
01:18:48,717 --> 01:18:52,387
Everyone is excited to welcome a king
born with the energy of the King's Star.

867
01:18:52,471 --> 01:18:54,139
Would you like to see the plate?

868
01:18:56,057 --> 01:18:57,225
No.

869
01:19:09,613 --> 01:19:10,989
Did the Assistant Gwaju

870
01:19:12,032 --> 01:19:14,409
really shift souls and disappear?

871
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:47,400
Were you hiding inside Cheonbugwan
all this time?

872
01:19:47,901 --> 01:19:51,112
I have been waiting for a chance
to meet you, Your Royal Highness.

873
01:19:53,657 --> 01:19:56,076
Are you asking me to spare your life?

874
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,787
You are the only person who can save me,

875
01:19:58,870 --> 01:20:02,541
but I am also the only person
who can protect you.

876
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:06,044
Protect me from what?

877
01:20:06,127 --> 01:20:09,047
I will protect you
from the true owner of the King's Star.

878
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:13,343
-What are you talking about?
-You already know that

879
01:20:13,426 --> 01:20:15,846
you are not the true owner.

880
01:20:21,726 --> 01:20:25,647
The man who will outshine you
and will be worshipped by everyone.

881
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:29,568
The man who will make you collapse.

882
01:20:30,151 --> 01:20:31,570
You are next in line to be king,

883
01:20:31,653 --> 01:20:34,614
and Jang Uk, the owner of the King's Star,
should not be allowed

884
01:20:35,407 --> 01:20:36,658
to rise above you.

885
01:20:38,827 --> 01:20:43,498
I promise to get rid of
that ominous light for you.

886
01:20:49,296 --> 01:20:51,548
The one thing
that I desperately yearned for…

887
01:20:54,259 --> 01:20:56,011
actually belonged to Jang Uk.

888
01:21:23,914 --> 01:21:27,083
How pretty. You look beautiful.

889
01:21:28,668 --> 01:21:31,379
You look magnificent.

890
01:21:33,548 --> 01:21:35,008
You are about to drool.

891
01:21:35,592 --> 01:21:37,719
-You can take it off now.
-Why did you

892
01:21:37,802 --> 01:21:40,555
ask me to put this on anyway?
Why not the bride herself?

893
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:43,975
Her father is in a very bad state,
so she could not make it.

894
01:21:44,059 --> 01:21:46,436
Your build is similar to hers,
so that is why.

895
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:48,229
You can get changed now.

896
01:21:49,773 --> 01:21:52,025
Come on. Let us leave
so she can get changed.

897
01:21:52,776 --> 01:21:55,695
-Stop staring. Let us go.
-She is the most beautiful woman ever.

898
01:21:55,779 --> 01:21:57,113
She really is.

899
01:22:00,909 --> 01:22:02,035
I guess…

900
01:22:02,994 --> 01:22:04,621
I look quite nice.

901
01:22:06,456 --> 01:22:07,540
Oh, hey.

902
01:22:07,624 --> 01:22:09,376
Mu-deok is here, right? Where is she?

903
01:22:09,459 --> 01:22:10,710
Mu-deok is…

904
01:22:13,546 --> 01:22:15,340
She is in that room over there.

905
01:22:15,423 --> 01:22:16,883
-Go on inside.
-All right.

906
01:22:27,602 --> 01:22:28,853
Goodness.

907
01:22:29,646 --> 01:22:31,982
I heard there was a bride
about to get married soon.

908
01:22:32,774 --> 01:22:33,692
Is that you?

909
01:22:34,609 --> 01:22:35,610
No.

910
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:42,617
Look who it is. It is my master.

911
01:22:43,368 --> 01:22:45,495
I told you to wait for me at Sejukwon.

912
01:22:45,578 --> 01:22:48,415
-What are you doing here?
-Heo Yeom sent me to fetch some wine.

913
01:22:48,498 --> 01:22:50,166
Then Ju-wol asked me to put this on.

914
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:53,086
I need to get changed now.
Wait for me outside.

915
01:22:53,169 --> 01:22:54,462
No, wait.

916
01:22:54,546 --> 01:22:57,674
This is actually not a bad place.
After all, it is where we first met.

917
01:22:59,217 --> 01:23:00,885
Not a bad place for what?

918
01:23:02,721 --> 01:23:05,098
There is a very important ritual
that we must do.

919
01:23:06,057 --> 01:23:07,726
First, come sit here.

920
01:23:18,611 --> 01:23:20,071
What is going on?

921
01:23:20,905 --> 01:23:22,115
This is not necessary.

922
01:23:25,744 --> 01:23:29,164
Stop it. You are embarrassing me.
What is with you?

923
01:23:34,335 --> 01:23:36,212
It is only embarrassing at first.

924
01:23:36,296 --> 01:23:38,089
But you get used to it after 13 times.

925
01:23:39,382 --> 01:23:40,467
What?

926
01:23:41,092 --> 01:23:43,178
You've proposed 13 times?

927
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,806
Master.

928
01:23:47,515 --> 01:23:51,061
As of today,
I wish to end my training as your pupil.

929
01:23:54,147 --> 01:23:57,150
I am grateful that
you always pushed me to train harder

930
01:23:57,734 --> 01:23:59,986
despite how lacking I was.

931
01:24:02,155 --> 01:24:03,323
I know that

932
01:24:03,406 --> 01:24:05,784
you gave up your chance
to regain your energy.

933
01:24:06,576 --> 01:24:09,829
And I, too, chose to give up
the energy I tried so hard to build.

934
01:24:10,622 --> 01:24:14,667
But instead, I now have someone precious
that I wish to keep by my side forever.

935
01:24:18,463 --> 01:24:22,884
I do not wish to be used and discarded.
I wish to protect and cherish you.

936
01:24:23,551 --> 01:24:26,513
Thus, allow me to quit.

937
01:24:31,893 --> 01:24:33,394
I, Mu-deok, your master,

938
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:36,606
will allow my pupil, Jang Uk, to quit.

939
01:24:41,361 --> 01:24:42,403
All right, then.

940
01:24:43,613 --> 01:24:46,449
Marry me, Mu-deok.

941
01:25:18,731 --> 01:25:21,484
I have decided to get married
to Young Master Jang.

942
01:25:21,568 --> 01:25:22,777
There has been no woman around you.

943
01:25:22,861 --> 01:25:24,571
This will all be for Mu-deok.

944
01:25:24,654 --> 01:25:25,572
That cannot be!

945
01:25:25,655 --> 01:25:29,450
I will find the sword
that can help you destroy Jang Uk.

946
01:25:29,534 --> 01:25:31,870
Jin Mu must be killed.

947
01:25:31,953 --> 01:25:35,498
Are you saying that they had
all deceived and mocked me?

948
01:25:35,582 --> 01:25:37,876
They are trying to protect Jang Uk.

949
01:25:37,959 --> 01:25:40,003
An assassin has appeared in Sejukwon!

950
01:25:40,086 --> 01:25:42,005
I believe Mu-deok's body
originally belonged

951
01:25:42,088 --> 01:25:44,007
to someone with great divine powers.

952
01:25:45,175 --> 01:25:48,887
Naksu. You have given me hope.

953
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:55,935
