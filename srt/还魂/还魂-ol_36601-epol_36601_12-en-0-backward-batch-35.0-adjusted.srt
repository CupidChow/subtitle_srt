1
00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:38,198
People would wonder
if you suddenly disappeared.

2
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:40,492
Letting others witness you dying in public

3
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:42,786
will make things much easier.

4
00:00:44,913 --> 00:00:46,664
I would still like to save face.

5
00:00:47,665 --> 00:00:49,626
I hope it will not be a disgraceful death.

6
00:00:54,714 --> 00:00:56,883
-Master!
-My lord!

7
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:01,346
What is he saying?

8
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,348
-What happened?
-Look!

9
00:01:04,057 --> 00:01:05,934
Assassins!

10
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:37,423
Master!

11
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:49,310
I will be sure to use your body well.

12
00:02:42,947 --> 00:02:43,823
Young Master.

13
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:49,245
Darn it, Uk.

14
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:57,003
That is fine.

15
00:02:57,962 --> 00:02:58,963
Do not come in.

16
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:04,761
What a shame.

17
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:07,472
Uk landed more blows this time.

18
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,807
-Are there two more left?
-Yes.

19
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:13,436
Cha Beom will be up against him tomorrow.

20
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,521
Darn it. I would hate
to see Uk lose to him.

21
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:17,565
Should I go instead?

22
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:20,235
If I let Uk win,
then this will all be over.

23
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:21,778
I doubt that will make Uk happy.

24
00:03:22,278 --> 00:03:24,364
This is a bet against the Crown Prince.

25
00:03:24,447 --> 00:03:26,032
It will simply be outsmarting him.

26
00:03:29,202 --> 00:03:31,120
Uk may be losing, but he is improving.

27
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:34,207
Young Master.

28
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,960
Go to your room. Let me bring you a towel.

29
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:47,887
I do not know
who the last contender will be.

30
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,849
But Uk will not be defeated that easily.

31
00:04:06,322 --> 00:04:07,323
Uk!

32
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:12,787
Where is Young Master Jang?

33
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:14,872
You must be here for your young master.

34
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:16,666
Yes, my lady.

35
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,210
You must be Mu-deok.

36
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,588
-Yes, my lady.
-I see.

37
00:04:22,672 --> 00:04:25,633
You are the one
who is always by Young Master Jang's side.

38
00:04:26,217 --> 00:04:29,429
She must be the egret
that Maidservant Kim mentioned.

39
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:32,765
I am here to see him before I leave.

40
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:34,267
Come in. Right.

41
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,312
I even brought some snacks.
Would you like some?

42
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:39,147
No, thank you.

43
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:50,783
She is sophisticated and polite
just like Maidservant Kim said.

44
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,304
Why are you still drenched
and standing there?

45
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:56,682
Hey, look.

46
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,077
This is what that guy did, right?

47
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:18,830
I should try it again with my sword.

48
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:22,625
I thought you were dispirited
after being thrown into the lake.

49
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:25,419
But you were just reviewing your fight.

50
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,756
I was downcast and embarrassed
the first couple of times.

51
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,842
I am just mad
that I have lost eight times.

52
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:36,389
You used to only wear
neatly-ironed clothes.

53
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:39,350
Seeing how you are still
in those filthy, wet ones

54
00:06:40,476 --> 00:06:41,853
proves what you just said.

55
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:46,649
I am truly dirty.

56
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:53,823
You rushed yourself today.

57
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:57,243
You should not have charged at him
when he was in defense.

58
00:06:57,326 --> 00:07:00,288
You should have waited for him
to put his guard down.

59
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,498
Right.

60
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:05,334
Had you suddenly taken a step back
after landing those blows,

61
00:07:05,418 --> 00:07:08,796
he would have been relieved,
stopped defending,

62
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,339
and let down his guard.

63
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,134
Fighting is like a game of tug-of-war.

64
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,512
Your opponent will pull
if you feign letting your guard down.

65
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,640
That is when you should strike.

66
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:23,144
Thank you for your advice, master.

67
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:29,525
Where are you going?

68
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:33,070
I should bathe and get changed.

69
00:07:33,154 --> 00:07:34,780
I think I am reeking as well.

70
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,367
You must be here for your young master.

71
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,210
Do not go.

72
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,882
Do not go to your room and just stay here.

73
00:07:53,758 --> 00:07:56,302
-I will bring you your clothes.
-What for?

74
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:58,221
I can go get changed.

75
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,932
Why would you be a fool
and tire yourself out?

76
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:07,396
You are right.

77
00:08:09,482 --> 00:08:11,108
I am just being a fool.

78
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:16,405
You may go.

79
00:08:21,077 --> 00:08:22,119
Mu-deok.

80
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:23,621
Stop there.

81
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:26,499
What is it?

82
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:34,757
Sit down.

83
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:36,759
Come on.

84
00:08:42,682 --> 00:08:44,850
Goodness, look at your shoes.
They are drenched.

85
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:48,980
Why…

86
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:52,942
Why would you follow me
and try to jump into the water?

87
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,032
You see, there are times
when you are unnecessarily hard-working.

88
00:09:00,116 --> 00:09:02,743
Why do you put your heart into cleaning?

89
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:05,204
Just use me as your excuse and rest up.

90
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:10,418
Maidservant Kim sent
some abalones and dried yellow corvina.

91
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:13,379
You should have some yourself.
Do not give them all to me.

92
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:15,881
Do not worry.

93
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:20,678
Everyone treats me well
since I am close with Dang-gu,

94
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,179
the heir of Songrim.

95
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:25,391
That is what I thought.

96
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:30,605
I knew you would use
your power to your advantage.

97
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:39,071
You are injured.

98
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,367
I fought for eight days on end.

99
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:45,870
This is not my only wound.

100
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:49,749
Then where else?

101
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,501
Let us go to Sejukwon and get you treated.

102
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:54,170
I still have more fights left.

103
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,466
I should get injured as much as I can,

104
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,552
as much as my master expects of me.

105
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,236
Your feet will freeze.

106
00:10:20,363 --> 00:10:21,781
You should get changed too.

107
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:04,657
Maidservant Kim?

108
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:20,256
You are ready, Your Royal Highness.

109
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:23,342
The medicine does not stop being bitter.
Do you have anything sweet?

110
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:25,594
I will prepare the sweetest snack.

111
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:38,566
There should be a red jade
that goes with it.

112
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:41,485
They are only valuable
when they are together.

113
00:11:43,195 --> 00:11:44,822
Should I just throw this away?

114
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:25,571
What?

115
00:12:26,155 --> 00:12:27,364
What is wrong with this?

116
00:12:35,873 --> 00:12:38,000
What could this be?

117
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:54,642
Someone is pulling me in with great force.

118
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,105
This inexplainable attraction…

119
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:02,191
It is calling to me.

120
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:56,036
-Damn it.
-Damn it!

121
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,455
Why would you fill her jade with energy

122
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,541
and confuse me like that?

123
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:02,501
This greatly offends me.

124
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:03,419
Likewise.

125
00:14:03,502 --> 00:14:08,048
I am truly offended that
you were the reason why my heart raced.

126
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:10,342
Darn it.

127
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:13,929
By the way,

128
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:16,140
did you feel it too?

129
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:20,936
Did your heart thump…

130
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:25,316
-Darn it.
-Do not say that.

131
00:14:28,027 --> 00:14:29,153
Forget it.

132
00:14:29,945 --> 00:14:31,155
Seeing how surprised you are,

133
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:34,033
I guess you have never used this properly.

134
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:35,784
Right.

135
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:37,411
Since Mu-deok does not know magic,

136
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,705
I doubt you two were able
to share your energy.

137
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:40,873
You are right.

138
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:44,084
I did not know this jade had such power.

139
00:14:59,683 --> 00:15:01,393
That is enough!

140
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,772
-Darn it.
-Anyway, I learned something new

141
00:15:05,564 --> 00:15:07,066
because of you.

142
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,818
-Thank you.
-What is it?

143
00:15:09,902 --> 00:15:10,986
Are you planning to use it?

144
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:13,364
I doubt you will be able to.

145
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:16,158
Mu-deok will not get this back.

146
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:18,202
I still have two matches left.

147
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:20,788
I will get it back and put it to good use.

148
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:22,831
So please keep it safe until then.

149
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,834
And please do not ever

150
00:15:26,502 --> 00:15:27,920
fill it with your energy again.

151
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,423
The same goes for you.

152
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:39,181
Your Royal Highness, where have you been?

153
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,767
Should I take you in?

154
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:44,311
I can do that.

155
00:15:44,937 --> 00:15:47,231
There must be things you can do here too.

156
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:49,775
No, thank you.

157
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:52,695
-Eunuch Oh.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

158
00:15:52,778 --> 00:15:55,698
Find out who will be up against Uk next.

159
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:57,241
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

160
00:15:57,866 --> 00:15:59,034
You better be right.

161
00:15:59,702 --> 00:16:00,869
THE ART OF HYEONGONG

162
00:16:00,953 --> 00:16:01,829
Hey.

163
00:16:01,912 --> 00:16:03,831
How was Jang Uk?

164
00:16:03,914 --> 00:16:07,042
Jang Uk? It was a cakewalk to beat him.

165
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,170
-Are you ready for your match?
-Of course.

166
00:16:10,254 --> 00:16:12,715
At the very end, I will use Hyeongong to…

167
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:19,054
He is a mage from the Cha family
who can use Hyeongong.

168
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:21,765
He had been watching Uk all along.

169
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:25,686
He is a coward who has only stepped up
after seeing Uk lose several times.

170
00:16:26,562 --> 00:16:28,480
Uk might be able to beat him.

171
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:35,154
Hyeongong is a spell that
may look fancy on the outside.

172
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:38,198
But it will be useless
if the user lacks the skills.

173
00:16:39,116 --> 00:16:41,160
Beom may look intimidating
at first glance,

174
00:16:41,243 --> 00:16:42,661
but that could just be a front.

175
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:46,165
Yul sure can see through others.

176
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:47,750
Is that so?

177
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:50,669
But he was telling others
about how easy it would be

178
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,963
to beat Young Master Jang.

179
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:54,131
He is just worried.

180
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:57,426
Uk has improved greatly
in the past several days.

181
00:16:58,052 --> 00:17:00,637
He is scared that Uk will beat him.

182
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:06,101
I guess my young master has improved
quite a bit for him to be worried.

183
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:11,106
Are you that thrilled
that Uk has become stronger?

184
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,109
Of course. I cannot be any prouder.

185
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:18,489
Naksu is training Uk.

186
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:19,656
Yul.

187
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:23,911
Did you hear?

188
00:17:23,994 --> 00:17:25,704
There is a commotion in the capital.

189
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,748
What happened?

190
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:31,460
Master Kang from Daegangtongun
succumbed to his illness.

191
00:17:32,836 --> 00:17:33,879
But rumor has it

192
00:17:34,546 --> 00:17:36,673
that some assassins
attacked him last night.

193
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:40,844
My uncle and Master Heo
rushed over to his funeral.

194
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:44,181
What if more assassins
like Naksu have appeared?

195
00:17:56,193 --> 00:17:58,737
THE LATE KANG MAN-CHEON

196
00:18:00,697 --> 00:18:03,033
Why can we not offer our condolences?

197
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:07,788
Transporting precious goods
is our family business.

198
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:10,457
But if people find out
that the man of the house

199
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:14,253
was killed by some assassins,
we could become jobless.

200
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:16,547
We told everyone
he died of a contagious disease.

201
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:18,465
That is why no one can enter.

202
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,428
We understand.

203
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:26,306
Have you found any evidence
that could help us find the assassins?

204
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:29,935
Has an autopsy been carried out?

205
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:35,065
Master Kang was stabbed to death
in front of our eyes.

206
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:36,984
An autopsy is unnecessary.

207
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,404
We will cremate his body tonight.

208
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,030
That soon?

209
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:43,740
It is unfortunate.

210
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:45,659
But we must hurry
before the rumor spreads.

211
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:49,663
I am certain Master Kang would have
also wanted this for his family.

212
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:50,789
That is unacceptable.

213
00:18:50,873 --> 00:18:53,000
If you cremate his body,

214
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:56,253
there will be no evidence
that will link to the assassins.

215
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:00,132
This is a family matter.

216
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:03,302
I understand that you are worried.

217
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:07,306
But the leader of Songrim
does not need to concern himself with it.

218
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:11,018
An autopsy is needed.

219
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:12,811
Postpone the cremation.

220
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:18,025
Has Songrim gone as far as to meddle
in other families' funerals?

221
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:22,738
We are not meddling.

222
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:27,743
I am simply trying to prevent
the new man of the house

223
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:29,745
from making an irreversible mistake.

224
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:31,872
Why is Songrim's leader against this?

225
00:19:31,955 --> 00:19:33,498
What gives you the right?

226
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:37,127
Only recently did Naksu attack
the mages in the capital.

227
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:39,296
Now, new assassins have emerged.

228
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:42,758
There could be a link between this case
and Naksu who used sorcery.

229
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:44,635
That is why I am interfering.

230
00:19:45,844 --> 00:19:47,679
There was no sorcery involved.

231
00:19:47,763 --> 00:19:48,680
I witnessed it all.

232
00:19:48,764 --> 00:19:50,641
How can you be so sure without an autopsy?

233
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:55,479
The new man of the house
does not want an autopsy.

234
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,773
Jin Mu! You have no say in this.

235
00:19:58,357 --> 00:20:00,400
We have the right to interfere
if there are suspicions

236
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:02,069
of sorcery being involved.

237
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:04,613
Do you not agree, Lady Jin?

238
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:07,950
I believe

239
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:12,120
the Assistant Gwanju is right this time.

240
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,502
The family's heir witnessed
Master Kang's death.

241
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:22,130
And he has no choice but to hide it
due to their family business.

242
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:26,969
No evidence hinted
at sorcery being involved.

243
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:32,140
So I do not think Songrim
should cause a commotion here.

244
00:20:38,981 --> 00:20:41,191
I just want to protect his honor.

245
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:44,736
Please let us proceed
with this funeral discreetly.

246
00:21:07,718 --> 00:21:10,929
Jin Mu does not hesitate
to look down on Songrim now.

247
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:16,226
Why are they so against the idea?

248
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:19,563
-It is suspicious.
-By the way,

249
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:23,775
I had no idea
Lady Jin would take Jin Mu's side.

250
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,695
She used to hate her half-brother.

251
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:34,119
I was truly pleased when you took my side.

252
00:21:35,996 --> 00:21:37,039
Look.

253
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:41,335
Songrim had no choice but to back down
once we joined hands.

254
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:45,047
How close are you to finding Bu-yeon?

255
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:49,968
We searched all the areas
around Lake Gyeongcheondaeho

256
00:21:50,052 --> 00:21:53,096
for blind girls
who were around Bu-yeon's age.

257
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:58,268
I have been doing that for ten years now.

258
00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:59,394
To be honest,

259
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:02,814
I believe I found
the whereabouts of Bu-yeon.

260
00:22:04,274 --> 00:22:07,527
A young girl had washed up
near the lake ten years ago.

261
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:11,156
-Is that so?
-However…

262
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:14,785
she was long dead.

263
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:25,545
Mother, I doubt that was her.

264
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:28,256
I told my men to dig up her grave.

265
00:22:29,091 --> 00:22:31,468
If Bu-yeon truly is dead,

266
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:35,138
I will bring her body
back to you at all costs.

267
00:22:35,972 --> 00:22:37,516
That is unacceptable.

268
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:41,061
Bring my daughter back alive.

269
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:44,397
I will, so please calm down.

270
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,526
We will find her alive.

271
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,043
Did you take a good look?

272
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,213
They will be your mother
and younger sister.

273
00:23:08,922 --> 00:23:10,048
Do you think

274
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:13,176
they will think that I am their daughter?

275
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,594
You are dressed

276
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:18,807
like Bu-yeon when she was young.

277
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,892
But I am not sure if Ho-gyeong will agree.

278
00:23:23,353 --> 00:23:25,605
Then being well-dressed

279
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:29,234
will not benefit us.

280
00:23:29,818 --> 00:23:32,362
I must look shabbier and more pathetic.

281
00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:35,699
She is a mother who has lost her daughter.

282
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:39,828
I can only win her heart
by pulling at her heartstrings.

283
00:23:42,664 --> 00:23:43,790
Yes.

284
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:46,459
You are right, So-i.

285
00:23:50,714 --> 00:23:51,965
I will see to it…

286
00:23:54,676 --> 00:23:57,554
that I become a daughter
of the Jin family.

287
00:24:10,692 --> 00:24:12,319
You look much better now.

288
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:15,238
I tend to recover quickly.

289
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,793
This Hyeongong technique…

290
00:24:29,753 --> 00:24:31,129
is quite elaborate.

291
00:24:37,135 --> 00:24:40,931
I have my suspicions
regarding Master Kang's death.

292
00:24:53,318 --> 00:24:57,072
Master Kang was powerful
with a great mastery of spells.

293
00:24:57,155 --> 00:24:59,824
But he was already suffering
from a fatal illness.

294
00:25:00,617 --> 00:25:03,995
There was no need for anyone
to send the assassins.

295
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,206
Maybe someone had a grudge against him

296
00:25:06,998 --> 00:25:09,084
and wanted to kill him themselves.

297
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:10,085
No.

298
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:12,003
There must be a reason

299
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:15,799
why those assassins came,
although we do not know yet.

300
00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:22,097
Once the soul is shifted,
the former body becomes useless.

301
00:25:22,681 --> 00:25:24,724
But we cannot get rid of it that easily.

302
00:25:24,808 --> 00:25:28,270
In other people's eyes,
that body belongs to a powerful mage,

303
00:25:28,353 --> 00:25:30,230
an administrative officer, or a merchant.

304
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:33,525
They will only suspect something
if that individual disappears.

305
00:25:35,318 --> 00:25:40,031
Naksu was the one who took care of them.

306
00:25:40,115 --> 00:25:42,158
Do you mean the Shadow Assassin?

307
00:25:44,494 --> 00:25:47,080
Thanks to that crazy assassin,

308
00:25:47,664 --> 00:25:51,960
Songrim never suspected
that I was making soul shifters.

309
00:25:53,295 --> 00:25:55,588
Back when I was after Naksu,

310
00:25:55,672 --> 00:25:59,175
I thought she was just a lunatic
who wanted to show off her skills.

311
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:03,221
That is why I never suspected
the individuals that she killed.

312
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:07,767
Are you saying that she killed those

313
00:26:08,518 --> 00:26:10,812
whose souls have been shifted by Jin Mu?

314
00:26:10,895 --> 00:26:12,314
To be exact,

315
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:16,484
they must have been those
who were discarded afterward.

316
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:19,195
Did you not say
that Naksu was Cho Chung's daughter?

317
00:26:19,988 --> 00:26:24,784
Are you saying he took that little girl
and turned her into an assassin?

318
00:26:26,578 --> 00:26:28,997
That is why I never revealed myself to her

319
00:26:29,748 --> 00:26:31,958
and made her live
in the mountains by herself.

320
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,712
I took care of her
just enough for her to survive.

321
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:40,467
But she was determined
and grew to be remarkably strong.

322
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,553
Because…

323
00:26:44,137 --> 00:26:46,973
She thought by doing so
she would be avenging her parents.

324
00:26:47,057 --> 00:26:48,558
That is why she obeyed Jin Mu.

325
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:52,937
She was very useful.

326
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:56,441
Then a soul shifter ran wild before dying.

327
00:26:57,108 --> 00:26:58,401
Thanks to him,

328
00:26:59,444 --> 00:27:01,696
Songrim got wind of the alchemy of souls.

329
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:04,908
Once Jin Mu heard that we were after her,

330
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:08,453
he was probably afraid of getting caught.

331
00:27:09,245 --> 00:27:14,167
He probably sent Naksu to Songrim
despite knowing that she would die.

332
00:27:27,472 --> 00:27:29,766
Mu-deok, go and get some water.

333
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:30,892
Yes, ma'am.

334
00:27:39,442 --> 00:27:42,695
Mu-deok, will you seriously
not listen to me?

335
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:44,823
I told you to just get some rest.

336
00:27:47,826 --> 00:27:49,411
Then what about you?

337
00:27:49,494 --> 00:27:51,454
Did I not tell you to treat your wounds?

338
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:54,749
I stopped by Sejukwon.
At least I listened to you.

339
00:27:58,461 --> 00:27:59,671
Check for yourself.

340
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:04,175
I smell mugwort.

341
00:28:11,349 --> 00:28:12,684
What is wrong with you?

342
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:16,104
You know I am struggling these days.
I am just exhausted.

343
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,654
How warm.

344
00:28:27,323 --> 00:28:29,451
Did you get a hot mugwort massage?

345
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:32,370
Yes. I am warm, right?

346
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,374
Yes. You are.

347
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:44,466
She was used for all the wrong reasons
and met a terrible death.

348
00:28:45,508 --> 00:28:46,509
Naksu…

349
00:28:46,593 --> 00:28:49,429
I truly pity her.

350
00:28:58,855 --> 00:29:00,482
You are cool now. Let me go.

351
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:06,404
-Did you change your shoes?
-Yes.

352
00:29:06,488 --> 00:29:08,156
Did you have the food
Maidservant Kim brought?

353
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:11,534
Yes. I had already had some
before you even mentioned them.

354
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:14,078
Well done. Mu-deok.

355
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:18,750
I did not know how fascinating this was.

356
00:29:21,503 --> 00:29:22,587
The yin-and-yang jade?

357
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,672
I only found out because you had given it
to the Crown Prince.

358
00:29:25,423 --> 00:29:27,008
How is it fascinating?

359
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:29,052
-Show me.
-I cannot.

360
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:30,720
I will show you

361
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:32,931
once I get yours back.

362
00:29:34,432 --> 00:29:35,725
You will give it to me again

363
00:29:36,726 --> 00:29:38,144
after you get it back?

364
00:29:39,896 --> 00:29:42,315
Why? Will you not accept it?

365
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:49,656
I will retrieve it
and place it in your hand.

366
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:52,534
This thing has unbelievable powers.

367
00:29:52,617 --> 00:29:53,952
It is a relief we did not know.

368
00:29:54,035 --> 00:29:56,579
You are in for a shock once I get it back.

369
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:02,836
What kind of powers? Show me.

370
00:30:03,503 --> 00:30:06,381
The Crown Prince
foamed in the mouth and fainted.

371
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:08,383
It was terrifying.

372
00:30:08,466 --> 00:30:10,969
That makes sense. It was from Jinyowon.

373
00:30:11,052 --> 00:30:13,054
It could be a lethal weapon.

374
00:30:35,743 --> 00:30:37,328
Hello, Assistant Gwanju.

375
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,335
The leader of Songrim returned

376
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:47,547
to watch the cremation for himself.

377
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,341
What will you do this time around?

378
00:30:50,425 --> 00:30:53,177
I am only here to observe.

379
00:30:54,137 --> 00:30:57,098
This is the last time
I will ever see Master Kang.

380
00:30:57,181 --> 00:30:59,601
It is my duty to see him off.

381
00:31:32,425 --> 00:31:35,470
You have seen a soul shifter before,

382
00:31:35,553 --> 00:31:37,472
so you will recognize the blue mark.

383
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:41,768
Check and see if Master Kang's body
had been used for soul shifting.

384
00:31:41,851 --> 00:31:44,103
Even if we find out
that he has shifted souls,

385
00:31:44,187 --> 00:31:46,356
we will not know
whose body he has shifted into.

386
00:31:47,732 --> 00:31:51,694
There is something you must do
to help us find that out.

387
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:26,729
I know that you have
already mastered Chisu.

388
00:32:27,855 --> 00:32:29,857
I did not hide it on purpose.

389
00:32:29,941 --> 00:32:31,359
I am not scolding you.

390
00:32:32,276 --> 00:32:33,987
What I am about to ask you to do

391
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,614
is quite dangerous
and might suck away your energy.

392
00:32:37,407 --> 00:32:39,742
Only those
who have mastered Chisu can do it.

393
00:32:40,827 --> 00:32:43,955
A soul shifter runs wild
once their energy is lost.

394
00:32:44,706 --> 00:32:47,125
The body is still warm.

395
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:50,169
Pour your energy into him.

396
00:32:50,753 --> 00:32:53,339
and make him run wild.

397
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:22,201
My lord…

398
00:33:25,788 --> 00:33:27,123
What is it?

399
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:29,834
He is…

400
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,726
I will collect his bones, so step aside.

401
00:33:49,812 --> 00:33:52,732
This is a soul shifter

402
00:33:52,815 --> 00:33:55,985
who has been petrified after running wild.

403
00:33:58,654 --> 00:34:02,033
Now that we have solid evidence
of sorcery being involved,

404
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,661
can Songrim take over?

405
00:34:13,127 --> 00:34:17,548
Seeing how you are not disturbed
and even tried to hide it,

406
00:34:18,132 --> 00:34:20,593
you must have already known about this.

407
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:23,971
You already knew

408
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,519
that this was a soul shifter
who had run wild.

409
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:55,044
Judging by your skills,

410
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:58,256
I believe Master Kang's soul
is within that body.

411
00:34:59,924 --> 00:35:01,801
Then that body's original soul

412
00:35:01,884 --> 00:35:03,970
must be dead alongside your body.

413
00:35:04,053 --> 00:35:05,763
Cut that nonsense!

414
00:35:25,241 --> 00:35:26,450
You are running wild

415
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:28,995
after having lost blood and energy.

416
00:35:32,248 --> 00:35:35,501
The more you use your skills,
the faster you will become petrified.

417
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:37,420
You better stop.

418
00:35:43,885 --> 00:35:46,095
You should stop here.

419
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,353
-Do not kill him!
-Kill him.

420
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:42,211
A soul shifter who is running wild
is dangerous.

421
00:37:42,712 --> 00:37:44,505
Thankfully, Cheonbugwan got rid of him.

422
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:46,590
Since you have helped us,

423
00:37:46,674 --> 00:37:49,927
we will let Songrim take credit for this.

424
00:37:54,015 --> 00:37:56,017
-My lord.
-Yes?

425
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:08,571
Since you said we could take credit,

426
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:10,698
we will take the body and examine it.

427
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,577
Be my guest.

428
00:38:27,923 --> 00:38:29,592
I closed his gate of energy

429
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:32,386
to prevent more energy from seeping out.

430
00:38:33,137 --> 00:38:35,222
We need to revive him and make him talk.

431
00:38:36,223 --> 00:38:37,558
Will it be possible?

432
00:38:38,601 --> 00:38:42,480
He is pretty much a breathing stone.
Yet you want him to speak?

433
00:38:42,563 --> 00:38:44,023
This will not be easy.

434
00:38:52,365 --> 00:38:55,451
Are you worried
that he may still be alive?

435
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,663
Even so, they will not succeed.

436
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:03,167
Perhaps it is possible
with the help of the ice stone.

437
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:05,252
But that is their only bet.

438
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,048
Are you saying he can be revived
with the ice stone?

439
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:10,132
That is correct.

440
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:13,677
And you are in possession of that stone?

441
00:39:14,804 --> 00:39:16,263
You do not need to know that.

442
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,475
Get the assassins ready.

443
00:39:20,226 --> 00:39:21,769
I will find a way

444
00:39:21,852 --> 00:39:24,397
even if it means shifting the soul
of a Jeongjingak mage.

445
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:33,697
-Hey, Beom.
-What?

446
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:34,740
Let us go.

447
00:39:43,124 --> 00:39:44,375
THE ART OF HYEONGONG

448
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:46,043
PRESSING THE HEAD OF A LEOPARD STANCE

449
00:39:46,127 --> 00:39:47,962
DIRECT SENDING STANCE, CAULDRON STANCE

450
00:41:21,305 --> 00:41:22,473
Yul.

451
00:41:24,225 --> 00:41:25,643
Uk.

452
00:41:26,602 --> 00:41:27,978
Are you going to train?

453
00:41:29,146 --> 00:41:30,105
Yes.

454
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:31,815
And you?

455
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:39,198
I just slashed…

456
00:41:41,158 --> 00:41:42,493
a soul shifter.

457
00:41:46,413 --> 00:41:49,542
Master Kang who had passed away yesterday
was a soul shifter.

458
00:41:51,043 --> 00:41:52,378
Really?

459
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:54,296
But how did you know that?

460
00:41:55,631 --> 00:41:57,299
If they hide their blue mark,

461
00:41:57,383 --> 00:41:59,552
they can easily blend in
with other people.

462
00:42:00,469 --> 00:42:02,221
But once they run wild,

463
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,932
there is no turning back.

464
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,567
They will start to petrify
as their energy seeps out.

465
00:42:15,442 --> 00:42:18,487
They can prevent that
by feeding on others' energy.

466
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:21,490
But once they do that,

467
00:42:23,617 --> 00:42:25,578
they will no longer be humans,
but monsters.

468
00:42:28,789 --> 00:42:29,957
Monsters?

469
00:42:45,014 --> 00:42:47,391
And it is our duty to protect this world…

470
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,105
from such monsters.

471
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,366
We can also protect
the monsters from this world.

472
00:43:06,285 --> 00:43:07,911
Once we keep them in check,

473
00:43:08,746 --> 00:43:10,623
the world will be at peace.

474
00:43:11,832 --> 00:43:14,501
Everyone had high hopes for you
ever since you were little,

475
00:43:14,585 --> 00:43:17,546
so you think
you need to do something grand.

476
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:18,964
But I was told

477
00:43:20,215 --> 00:43:22,259
to sit still all my life.

478
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,929
I will follow

479
00:43:27,473 --> 00:43:29,266
my heart.

480
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:59,129
Jin Mu let Songrim find out
something critical.

481
00:43:59,213 --> 00:44:01,924
What if Songrim suspects
the palace as well?

482
00:44:02,675 --> 00:44:03,967
The Royal Palace…

483
00:44:04,968 --> 00:44:09,431
is not a place he can just barge into
like he did at Daegangtongun.

484
00:44:09,515 --> 00:44:12,559
If he does, I will be in danger.

485
00:44:13,143 --> 00:44:14,978
Ever since Gil-ju died,

486
00:44:15,062 --> 00:44:16,855
I was not able to feed on energy.

487
00:44:18,649 --> 00:44:21,276
I am afraid I will run wild.

488
00:44:24,655 --> 00:44:27,116
Could you share some of the power

489
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:29,618
of the ice stone with me?

490
00:44:30,953 --> 00:44:31,954
What did you say?

491
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:35,457
The only person who can serve you
despite knowing your true face…

492
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,338
is only me, is it not?

493
00:44:42,548 --> 00:44:43,757
Shaman.

494
00:44:45,008 --> 00:44:46,635
You little…

495
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:49,221
I told you never to address me like that.

496
00:44:51,265 --> 00:44:53,517
Would you like
to be petrified this instant?

497
00:44:56,103 --> 00:44:57,312
I know you cannot do that.

498
00:44:58,981 --> 00:45:01,525
I am the only one in this palace

499
00:45:01,608 --> 00:45:04,528
who knows that you are Shaman Choi,

500
00:45:04,611 --> 00:45:07,656
despite residing in the Queen's body.

501
00:45:09,074 --> 00:45:10,534
If I die,

502
00:45:10,617 --> 00:45:14,830
you will bring your sibling here
from Jinyowon?

503
00:45:19,168 --> 00:45:20,377
Furthermore,

504
00:45:21,128 --> 00:45:26,091
the real Queen is residing in your body.

505
00:45:28,135 --> 00:45:32,389
Should I not visit her from time to time?

506
00:45:32,973 --> 00:45:34,016
Right?

507
00:45:38,562 --> 00:45:40,689
It is getting difficult for me

508
00:45:41,732 --> 00:45:43,650
to live in this body.

509
00:45:45,652 --> 00:45:47,863
Tell Jin Mu

510
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:51,783
to shift my soul
into someone else's body once again,

511
00:45:53,494 --> 00:45:54,745
Your Highness.

512
00:45:58,165 --> 00:45:59,416
I understand.

513
00:46:00,501 --> 00:46:01,877
You may leave.

514
00:46:27,945 --> 00:46:29,238
Why are you here?

515
00:46:30,197 --> 00:46:32,407
I will let you beat me.
Then it will all be over.

516
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:39,164
I forfeit.

517
00:46:39,748 --> 00:46:41,041
Hey, Uk!

518
00:46:48,298 --> 00:46:49,841
You wanted to go before me.

519
00:46:49,925 --> 00:46:51,176
And you won.

520
00:46:58,183 --> 00:47:00,602
Dang-gu was willing to let you beat him.

521
00:47:00,686 --> 00:47:02,062
How could you refuse?

522
00:47:02,145 --> 00:47:04,523
I did not know
you were this proud of yourself.

523
00:47:04,606 --> 00:47:07,526
You gave me this signal
and told me not to fight him.

524
00:47:07,609 --> 00:47:08,694
When did I?

525
00:47:08,777 --> 00:47:10,612
I only looked at you out of relief.

526
00:47:10,696 --> 00:47:12,447
Then you should have signaled me.

527
00:47:13,115 --> 00:47:14,032
Like this.

528
00:47:14,116 --> 00:47:15,409
I did.

529
00:47:16,493 --> 00:47:19,788
How could I understand that?
Had I known, I would have just done it.

530
00:47:21,331 --> 00:47:22,916
You only have one chance left.

531
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:24,876
What will you do?

532
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,461
What, are you blaming me?

533
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:29,673
Why are you getting mad at me
when you gave that jade to him?

534
00:47:29,756 --> 00:47:32,301
Are you seriously
pointing fingers right now?

535
00:47:32,384 --> 00:47:33,844
How childish.

536
00:47:33,927 --> 00:47:36,430
Childish? Do you want me
to show you what real childishness is?

537
00:47:36,513 --> 00:47:37,472
I quit.

538
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:39,600
Should I keep this up?

539
00:47:49,693 --> 00:47:52,487
Mages have been guarding
Sejukwon since last night.

540
00:47:53,572 --> 00:47:56,491
The soul shifter's body must be in there.

541
00:47:56,575 --> 00:47:59,328
If it was a body, they would have
kept it in the secret room.

542
00:47:59,828 --> 00:48:02,539
Why would they take it to Sejukwon,
which is for the living?

543
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:15,052
I came by because I was curious
about what happened to the body.

544
00:48:15,135 --> 00:48:17,387
Please wait. I will inform our leader.

545
00:48:34,071 --> 00:48:37,491
I heard the leader was here at Sejukwon,
so I came to see him.

546
00:48:37,574 --> 00:48:40,077
No one is allowed
to enter Sejukwon at the moment.

547
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,454
Then I will meet
with Young Master Jang first.

548
00:48:42,537 --> 00:48:44,623
Please tell the leader that I am here.

549
00:48:46,208 --> 00:48:47,459
Jin Mu is here

550
00:48:48,835 --> 00:48:51,838
to check if the soul shifter
has really died or not.

551
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:55,342
Tell him to leave
since we are still investigating.

552
00:48:55,425 --> 00:48:58,512
Yes, my lord. However,
someone else is here to see you.

553
00:48:59,346 --> 00:49:00,472
Tell them to leave.

554
00:49:00,555 --> 00:49:03,141
No one is allowed anywhere near Sejukwon.

555
00:49:03,225 --> 00:49:04,184
Yes, my lord.

556
00:49:04,267 --> 00:49:06,728
I will tell Maidservant Kim
to leave as well.

557
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:09,147
What?

558
00:49:10,232 --> 00:49:11,400
Maidservant Kim?

559
00:49:11,483 --> 00:49:14,361
I will tell her
that the leader cannot meet anyone.

560
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,490
Hold on.

561
00:49:19,783 --> 00:49:23,203
She can be an exception.

562
00:49:32,879 --> 00:49:35,257
It has been a long time, Maidservant Kim.

563
00:49:54,568 --> 00:49:57,988
I stayed at Gwanju Jang Gang's residence
when I served him,

564
00:49:58,655 --> 00:50:01,616
and you made me
countless delicious dishes.

565
00:50:02,743 --> 00:50:04,202
You ate so much

566
00:50:04,703 --> 00:50:08,123
that your rice bowl was exceptionally big.

567
00:50:09,249 --> 00:50:10,375
Do you remember?

568
00:50:10,459 --> 00:50:13,628
You had a huge brass bowl.

569
00:50:13,712 --> 00:50:16,673
Back in the day, I was always hungry.

570
00:50:17,591 --> 00:50:21,178
You must have made
something scrumptious once again.

571
00:50:21,762 --> 00:50:24,890
Yes, I have. I made these snacks myself.

572
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,647
Honey biscuits.
I used to love them back in the day.

573
00:50:32,731 --> 00:50:33,940
Yes, indeed.

574
00:50:34,024 --> 00:50:37,027
Every time I gave some to you
to give to the Gwanju,

575
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:40,155
you would stash a few in your pockets.

576
00:50:41,364 --> 00:50:45,035
I did that because I was only allowed
to eat once he finished.

577
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:49,998
In any case, I benefited a lot
from the Gwanju while following him.

578
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:52,125
I had a chance to taste
such delicious treats

579
00:50:53,084 --> 00:50:55,545
and learn a special spell.

580
00:51:00,717 --> 00:51:04,137
Does it not taste sweeter
if you eat it in secret?

581
00:51:10,936 --> 00:51:12,145
That is exactly why

582
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:15,565
things that taste sweet are dangerous.

583
00:51:15,649 --> 00:51:19,653
Once you have a taste of it,
you desire it at all costs.

584
00:51:23,031 --> 00:51:24,616
You fail to distinguish

585
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:27,744
what you can have

586
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:31,164
and what you cannot.

587
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:36,002
You are hurting my feelings
by not letting me have any.

588
00:51:38,004 --> 00:51:41,550
Goodness, do not be so stingy with food.

589
00:51:45,762 --> 00:51:49,057
The Gwanju loved this snack.

590
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,017
How about his son?

591
00:51:51,101 --> 00:51:54,145
Young Master Uk loves
honey biscuits as well.

592
00:51:54,229 --> 00:51:56,690
Then shall we share this with him?

593
00:51:57,858 --> 00:52:02,153
I have many stories
to tell him about his father.

594
00:52:09,744 --> 00:52:13,039
You and Uk have nothing to talk about.

595
00:52:13,123 --> 00:52:14,833
You may leave.

596
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:17,752
He just wants a biscuit.
Do not be so heartless.

597
00:52:18,461 --> 00:52:21,631
You are not letting me share
the good memories with him.

598
00:52:21,715 --> 00:52:22,674
But then again,

599
00:52:24,467 --> 00:52:26,928
you must not want me
to touch what is yours.

600
00:52:29,764 --> 00:52:30,891
Wait.

601
00:52:31,766 --> 00:52:34,978
Here. This was actually
for our young master,

602
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:36,605
but you can have it instead.

603
00:52:37,147 --> 00:52:38,231
Maidservant Kim.

604
00:52:39,149 --> 00:52:40,358
Do not give that to him.

605
00:52:41,276 --> 00:52:43,320
If I truly wanted to have some,

606
00:52:43,862 --> 00:52:46,323
I would have easily stolen a few of them.

607
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:49,200
But I will let you win.

608
00:52:51,661 --> 00:52:55,916
It had been a while since we last met.
I am truly sad to say goodbye.

609
00:53:04,799 --> 00:53:06,051
Jin Mu used to take revenge

610
00:53:06,134 --> 00:53:09,012
if he was scolded for eating something.

611
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:11,264
They were just honey biscuits.

612
00:53:11,348 --> 00:53:12,974
You should have let him have them.

613
00:53:13,058 --> 00:53:15,143
I just did not want him to eat

614
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:20,315
what you worked so hard to make.

615
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:23,276
Sit down.

616
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,487
We have not seen each other in a while.

617
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:28,990
Let us chat over some tea.

618
00:53:32,619 --> 00:53:34,329
Is something wrong?

619
00:53:35,163 --> 00:53:36,706
You seem quite testy.

620
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,003
Do not worry.

621
00:53:43,171 --> 00:53:47,467
Once I have your honey biscuits,
I will feel better.

622
00:53:57,435 --> 00:53:58,728
Mu-deok.

623
00:53:59,896 --> 00:54:01,523
I need you to run an errand.

624
00:54:01,606 --> 00:54:03,566
An errand? What is it?

625
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:04,859
Go to Cheonbugwan.

626
00:54:06,069 --> 00:54:09,364
This just does not feel right,
so I need to send this over.

627
00:54:10,699 --> 00:54:11,950
Sure.

628
00:54:16,705 --> 00:54:18,623
Is something going on at Sejukwon?

629
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:22,210
I do not know the details.

630
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:25,797
But I think it is related
to last night's incident at Daegangtongun.

631
00:54:26,589 --> 00:54:28,758
I heard Cheonbugwan
and Songrim had a fight.

632
00:54:34,222 --> 00:54:35,098
Where is Yul?

633
00:54:35,181 --> 00:54:36,891
I have not seen him since last night.

634
00:54:36,975 --> 00:54:38,893
He must be doing something for the leader.

635
00:54:40,145 --> 00:54:41,271
Really?

636
00:54:42,856 --> 00:54:44,149
I just slashed…

637
00:54:46,276 --> 00:54:47,694
a soul shifter.

638
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:02,459
We must strengthen Songrim's boundaries.

639
00:55:02,542 --> 00:55:05,378
You are forbidden
from leaving Songrim for the time being.

640
00:55:07,297 --> 00:55:09,049
Those who have mastered Ryusu and more

641
00:55:09,132 --> 00:55:12,552
shall go to Sejukwon
and follow Sang-ho's orders.

642
00:55:12,635 --> 00:55:13,762
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

643
00:55:14,637 --> 00:55:15,555
Jang Uk.

644
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:17,891
You will stay here.

645
00:55:19,309 --> 00:55:21,019
Everyone except for Uk

646
00:55:21,102 --> 00:55:23,897
will follow Sang-ho and go to Sejukwon.

647
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,273
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

648
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,988
My lord.

649
00:55:32,864 --> 00:55:34,783
Why am I not going?

650
00:55:34,866 --> 00:55:37,660
You are exempt
since we do not need you there.

651
00:55:38,912 --> 00:55:40,789
Is there something dangerous there?

652
00:55:41,831 --> 00:55:43,208
Is it a soul shifter?

653
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:45,877
It is none of your concern.

654
00:55:46,628 --> 00:55:48,046
Do not be curious about it.

655
00:55:48,129 --> 00:55:50,924
Why are you keeping me in the dark
when I am also a mage here?

656
00:55:51,007 --> 00:55:54,344
You are excluded from everything.

657
00:55:54,928 --> 00:55:57,722
If you are bored of being alone,
you may leave Songrim.

658
00:55:57,806 --> 00:56:01,184
Go back to your home
and do whatever makes you comfortable.

659
00:56:03,853 --> 00:56:07,357
Yes, my lord.
Thank you for worrying about my comfort.

660
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:26,626
Mu-deok.

661
00:56:27,794 --> 00:56:30,004
Let us go to Chwiseonru
and have something tasty.

662
00:56:31,631 --> 00:56:35,093
All the mages were headed to Sejukwon.
Why are you not there?

663
00:56:36,678 --> 00:56:38,138
I was told to stay out of it

664
00:56:38,221 --> 00:56:41,224
and that I did not need
to concern myself with the matter.

665
00:56:41,808 --> 00:56:44,435
-Let us go.
-Maidservant Kim gave me an errand to do.

666
00:56:45,145 --> 00:56:47,605
Sure. Let us go together. Where to?

667
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,566
Cheonbugwan.

668
00:56:51,317 --> 00:56:52,235
Let us go.

669
00:56:56,990 --> 00:57:01,661
I heard that you told her
to shift you into another body.

670
00:57:03,788 --> 00:57:05,123
Will you do that?

671
00:57:05,915 --> 00:57:10,170
Then let me shift souls with that girl
who will enter Jinyowon as Jin Bu-yeon.

672
00:57:12,547 --> 00:57:14,257
I have been a eunuch for a while,

673
00:57:15,008 --> 00:57:16,718
so I do not mind a woman's body.

674
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:22,432
I would like to shift my soul
into a powerful body like the Shaman has.

675
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,351
"Shaman."

676
00:57:26,603 --> 00:57:28,938
She was offended by how you reminded her

677
00:57:29,022 --> 00:57:32,150
that she was a shaman dealing
with trifling affairs like divinations.

678
00:57:32,775 --> 00:57:34,360
I was only stating a fact.

679
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:41,493
I was also reminded today of how I used
to beg for food and steal snacks.

680
00:57:43,161 --> 00:57:47,207
They were indeed facts,
but I was still unhappy to hear them.

681
00:57:57,050 --> 00:58:00,220
Jin Mu wanted a honey biscuit
while visiting Songrim,

682
00:58:00,303 --> 00:58:02,096
but Park Jin did not let him have any.

683
00:58:02,722 --> 00:58:04,724
Maidservant Kim was worried
he would hold a grudge,

684
00:58:04,807 --> 00:58:06,768
so she wanted me to deliver this.

685
00:58:06,851 --> 00:58:09,812
Are you saying they were childish enough
to fight over some food?

686
00:58:09,896 --> 00:58:12,649
Our leader has a cheap way
of tormenting others.

687
00:58:12,732 --> 00:58:15,568
Why was he so picky about a honey biscuit?

688
00:58:15,652 --> 00:58:17,946
You are right. He was cheap.

689
00:58:25,078 --> 00:58:26,621
Here, at Cheonbugwan,

690
00:58:26,704 --> 00:58:29,499
we have records of all the constellations.

691
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:56,192
I will tell the Assistant Gwanju
that this was from the Jang family.

692
00:58:56,985 --> 00:59:00,613
Please tell him that
it was from Maidservant Kim.

693
00:59:01,906 --> 00:59:04,242
Tell him that we use a lot of oil
in our honey biscuits

694
00:59:04,325 --> 00:59:06,619
and that he should have them
with green tea.

695
00:59:06,703 --> 00:59:07,787
Yes, Young Master Jang.

696
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:10,498
We also use a lot of honey
for our honey biscuits.

697
00:59:10,582 --> 00:59:12,875
He should store them in a cool place
or they will become sticky.

698
00:59:12,959 --> 00:59:15,378
-Yes, Young Master Jang.
-Since we have brought that,

699
00:59:15,461 --> 00:59:17,422
-can I take a look inside?
-Yes--

700
00:59:17,505 --> 00:59:19,924
-Sorry?
-Thank you. It will not take long.

701
00:59:20,008 --> 00:59:20,925
Let us go.

702
00:59:22,594 --> 00:59:23,553
But…

703
00:59:31,394 --> 00:59:33,313
I have always wanted to visit.

704
00:59:33,396 --> 00:59:36,858
Despite my father being the Gwanju,
I never got to visit.

705
00:59:41,362 --> 00:59:43,656
Gosh, what is that?

706
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:48,036
You have been here, right?

707
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:50,246
Your father was
a constellation recorder mage.

708
00:59:51,414 --> 00:59:53,333
Did you come here for me?

709
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:59,047
You could have asked
someone else to run the errand.

710
00:59:59,714 --> 01:00:02,759
Was it not
because you wanted to come here?

711
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:10,475
My father brought me here often
when I was little.

712
01:00:11,601 --> 01:00:15,021
He even showed me the plate
that was recorded the day I was born.

713
01:00:16,481 --> 01:00:18,107
He was a considerate father.

714
01:00:21,611 --> 01:00:23,154
Come to think of it,

715
01:00:23,237 --> 01:00:26,324
I believe he recorded the constellation
on the day you were born.

716
01:00:28,701 --> 01:00:30,203
Is that so?

717
01:00:31,537 --> 01:00:35,041
The constellation of the day I was born
must be somewhere here.

718
01:00:48,388 --> 01:00:50,932
You had promised to shift my soul.

719
01:00:51,474 --> 01:00:54,102
But rather, you are making me run wild.

720
01:00:54,769 --> 01:00:56,187
You are no longer needed.

721
01:00:56,854 --> 01:00:59,273
You will turn into a stone now.

722
01:01:14,997 --> 01:01:16,290
You have gone insane.

723
01:01:35,226 --> 01:01:37,478
Once night draws in, the mages will come.

724
01:01:38,104 --> 01:01:39,647
Let us watch them
record the constellations.

725
01:01:39,731 --> 01:01:41,816
I heard it is a magnificent view.

726
01:01:44,026 --> 01:01:47,739
I would love that, but it will be
troublesome if we get caught.

727
01:01:47,822 --> 01:01:48,948
Let us just go home.

728
01:02:02,587 --> 01:02:04,255
Eunuch Kim has run wild.

729
01:02:04,338 --> 01:02:06,716
No one must find out
that he is a soul shifter.

730
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,720
He is still in Cheonbugwan.
We must find him before morning comes.

731
01:02:10,803 --> 01:02:11,971
Yes, my lord.

732
01:02:55,389 --> 01:02:56,849
I know you are here.

733
01:02:57,391 --> 01:02:59,685
Do not cause any more problems
and just come out.

734
01:02:59,769 --> 01:03:01,312
I will give you what you want.

735
01:03:09,403 --> 01:03:10,655
Come on out.

736
01:03:12,949 --> 01:03:14,867
-Come on out!
-I will.

737
01:03:19,914 --> 01:03:21,874
-Jang Uk.
-Yes.

738
01:03:27,421 --> 01:03:29,048
Why are you here?

739
01:03:29,549 --> 01:03:31,217
I am sorry. I was running an errand

740
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,844
and decided to take a look around.

741
01:03:37,139 --> 01:03:38,307
An errand?

742
01:03:38,933 --> 01:03:42,520
I heard you really wanted
our honey biscuits.

743
01:03:43,688 --> 01:03:45,064
Honey biscuits?

744
01:03:45,147 --> 01:03:47,191
She saw you were sad that
you did not have any honey biscuits,

745
01:03:47,275 --> 01:03:49,026
so Maidservant Kim told me
to send you some.

746
01:03:51,654 --> 01:03:54,073
Thank you. Tell her I said thank you.

747
01:03:54,824 --> 01:03:55,950
What?

748
01:03:57,368 --> 01:04:00,288
I thought you would be upset
that I came in here without asking.

749
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:01,914
Are you not mad?

750
01:04:01,998 --> 01:04:05,293
You only came here to give me
the honey biscuits. You may go.

751
01:04:06,586 --> 01:04:08,588
What a relief. To be honest…

752
01:04:10,131 --> 01:04:11,132
I have company.

753
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:14,427
Mu-deok, come out. He is not mad.

754
01:04:15,553 --> 01:04:17,471
She is my maid.

755
01:04:19,015 --> 01:04:20,808
I am Mu-deok,

756
01:04:20,892 --> 01:04:22,435
his maid.

757
01:04:24,979 --> 01:04:26,522
You were here as well.

758
01:04:27,231 --> 01:04:29,233
I thought you would be furious.

759
01:04:29,317 --> 01:04:32,445
I am truly grateful for your hospitality.

760
01:04:32,528 --> 01:04:33,821
Please enjoy the snacks.

761
01:04:33,905 --> 01:04:36,240
Let us know if you want more.

762
01:04:38,993 --> 01:04:40,244
Thank you.

763
01:04:40,328 --> 01:04:41,454
Let us go.

764
01:04:56,636 --> 01:04:59,847
He is a royal eunuch.

765
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:02,308
What is wrong with him?

766
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:04,977
He is a soul shifter.

767
01:05:05,853 --> 01:05:08,439
Look. He is running wild.

768
01:05:16,405 --> 01:05:18,824
I cannot believe a soul shifter
was inside the palace.

769
01:05:18,908 --> 01:05:19,951
It was probably

770
01:05:20,826 --> 01:05:22,119
his doing.

771
01:05:25,456 --> 01:05:26,832
I know you are here.

772
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:29,710
Do not cause
any more problems and just come out.

773
01:05:29,794 --> 01:05:31,545
I will give you what you want.

774
01:05:38,344 --> 01:05:39,762
Come on out!

775
01:05:48,354 --> 01:05:49,605
I will.

776
01:06:15,506 --> 01:06:16,716
Run.

777
01:06:19,844 --> 01:06:21,095
There is a door behind us.

778
01:06:34,108 --> 01:06:35,735
Why will you not let us leave?

779
01:06:36,736 --> 01:06:40,823
I do not think it is right to let a mage
who has barged in here leave so easily.

780
01:06:40,906 --> 01:06:43,075
You will be in a tight spot

781
01:06:44,076 --> 01:06:45,536
if I disappeared from Cheonbugwan.

782
01:06:45,619 --> 01:06:47,079
I never said I would harm you.

783
01:06:48,247 --> 01:06:50,458
Your body will still be around.

784
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,968
Uk.

785
01:08:03,614 --> 01:08:05,908
You are within a barrier that I have made.

786
01:08:10,496 --> 01:08:11,622
Do not worry.

787
01:08:12,498 --> 01:08:14,625
You will be unscathed
as long as you sit still.

788
01:08:16,252 --> 01:08:18,170
Wait there for now.

789
01:08:31,725 --> 01:08:33,227
Mu-deok, was it?

790
01:08:34,895 --> 01:08:36,856
So you were the maid

791
01:08:36,939 --> 01:08:41,152
who always stuck by his side
and caused a nuisance.

792
01:08:44,405 --> 01:08:46,407
There is a human here.

793
01:08:46,949 --> 01:08:49,076
Come and replenish your energy.

794
01:09:00,754 --> 01:09:02,214
After that,

795
01:09:02,798 --> 01:09:06,719
I will let you shift souls
with a young master as you wished.

796
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:22,234
Did that wench Shaman Choi

797
01:09:23,694 --> 01:09:25,821
tell you to kill me?

798
01:09:26,864 --> 01:09:28,824
I need your help.

799
01:09:29,575 --> 01:09:32,453
If you do not trust me,
I will stay outside.

800
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:36,582
Feed on her as you please.

801
01:10:28,259 --> 01:10:29,843
I need to get out of here.

802
01:11:24,773 --> 01:11:27,693
Master, help me once again.

803
01:11:28,444 --> 01:11:30,821
Give your hesitant pupil confidence.

804
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:43,500
Jang Uk.

805
01:12:23,624 --> 01:12:24,666
Mu-deok.

806
01:12:27,211 --> 01:12:28,379
Mu-deok!

807
01:13:01,245 --> 01:13:02,371
Mu-deok.

808
01:13:30,774 --> 01:13:31,984
Mu-deok.

809
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:36,447
I…

810
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:40,701
I just fed on his energy.

811
01:13:47,916 --> 01:13:49,126
Am I…

812
01:13:50,752 --> 01:13:52,296
running wild?

813
01:14:06,643 --> 01:14:08,562
-Mu-deok.
-Do not come near me.

814
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:23,494
No, you are fine.

815
01:14:24,244 --> 01:14:25,621
You are all right.

816
01:14:27,372 --> 01:14:29,208
-You will be fine.
-No.

817
01:14:30,209 --> 01:14:31,251
Do not touch me.

818
01:14:33,337 --> 01:14:34,963
If I am truly running wild,

819
01:14:37,174 --> 01:14:39,009
then you must not touch me.

820
01:14:42,513 --> 01:14:44,223
Otherwise, your energy will be stolen

821
01:14:45,098 --> 01:14:46,225
and you will die.

822
01:16:27,367 --> 01:16:29,536
There was a loud noise coming from
the Constellation Recording room.

823
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:30,996
Come on out!

824
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:34,041
Are you angry that we turned
your friend here into stone?

825
01:16:34,124 --> 01:16:36,877
You will never be able
to leave this place.

826
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:40,005
Are you saying that a member
of the Cho family is in this household?

827
01:16:40,088 --> 01:16:43,925
What if her spirit
is indeed lingering by Uk?

828
01:16:44,009 --> 01:16:47,929
If I had not left you
there in the mountains…

829
01:16:48,013 --> 01:16:49,931
you would not have to suffer this fate.

830
01:16:50,015 --> 01:16:51,433
You said you have bet your life?

831
01:16:51,516 --> 01:16:53,518
This time, place yourself for the bet.

832
01:16:53,602 --> 01:16:55,228
I will definitely win tomorrow.

833
01:16:55,312 --> 01:16:57,397
I only need those
who will definitely win the duel.

834
01:16:57,481 --> 01:17:00,067
If he is looking for
the ice stone to protect her…

835
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:01,151
They must not be together.

836
01:17:01,234 --> 01:17:03,695
Everything about you has been exposed.

837
01:17:06,406 --> 01:17:11,411
