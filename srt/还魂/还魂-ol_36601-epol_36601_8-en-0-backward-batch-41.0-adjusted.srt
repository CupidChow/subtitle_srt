1
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:11,677
Is that the alchemy of souls?

2
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:30,988
Is my soul being shifted right now?

3
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:20,347
My soul did not shift.

4
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,267
What happened?

5
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,067
Jang Uk.

6
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,236
Uk!

7
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,699
Uk!

8
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:41,035
Uk!

9
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,845
So you have shifted souls
with my pupil, Gil-ju.

10
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,723
Mu-deok.

11
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,021
I may have been too weak
to protect him from you.

12
00:03:09,897 --> 00:03:12,358
But I will make sure to end your life.

13
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,448
I did not know

14
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,243
you cared about Jang Uk that much.

15
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:24,203
Shut it!

16
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,498
Master!

17
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:29,708
It is me, Jang Uk.

18
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:31,877
We did not shift souls.

19
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,215
Look into my eyes.

20
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:38,801
It is me, right?

21
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:46,058
I am the only one
who can look at you from this close.

22
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,105
Do you recognize me?

23
00:05:12,686 --> 00:05:15,022
He had the blue mark on his body.

24
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:19,693
His soul must have re-entered his body.

25
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,071
Then why am I fine?

26
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:23,113
You are wrong.

27
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:25,407
You have changed as well. Look.

28
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,911
You do not have the bracelet,
yet you are not trembling.

29
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:34,458
You are right. I can move it freely now.

30
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,919
The Soul Ejector helped surge your energy.

31
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:40,714
The poison opened your gate of energy,
and the Soul Ejector surged your energy.

32
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:45,094
Uk, you truly are astoundingly lucky.

33
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:54,603
I am certain that I saw you there.

34
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,647
What?

35
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,293
Why?

36
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,796
Why are you fine?

37
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,841
You must have failed
due to your weak energy.

38
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:26,051
You are a soul shifter as well.

39
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,970
Naksu, you will also

40
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,931
be petrified and perish eventually.

41
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:34,059
Just like me

42
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,895
and your father.

43
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:42,901
My father?

44
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,570
That is right.

45
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,906
The constellation recorder mage.

46
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:49,700
Cho Chung!

47
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,036
My father…

48
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,291
was a soul shifter?

49
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,673
The four families were not the ones
who killed your entire family.

50
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:10,262
It was your father.
He had run wild and murdered them all.

51
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:14,391
Stay inside and do not come out.

52
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,394
If you see your father, run away.

53
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,104
Do not let him catch you.

54
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:26,695
Both you and your father were exploited

55
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:29,781
and will eventually be petrified and die.

56
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,743
Was the man who shifted my father's soul,

57
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,287
the Danju,

58
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:38,373
Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan?

59
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:41,919
Jin Mu is not our true Danju.

60
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:45,547
The real Danju is someone else.

61
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:48,675
-And who is that?
-The true Danju

62
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:52,346
can prevent you from running wild

63
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,517
since the real Danju
possesses the ice stone.

64
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,852
So who is the real Danju?

65
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:25,712
Mu-deok, are you all right?

66
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:28,173
I am fine.

67
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:30,968
Go after him. Hurry!

68
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,048
I must get out of here

69
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,718
before the poison
from the sorcery spreads.

70
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,327
Search the area.

71
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,661
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

72
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:04,227
It is empty.

73
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:11,693
It felt the energy of the sorcery.

74
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,863
Master Heo was right.
This Sapsali was indeed Gwigu.

75
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,783
Did the alchemy of souls
really take place here?

76
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:27,793
What are those?

77
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,753
They were on the ground.

78
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,130
Maybe this is the Soul Ejector.

79
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:39,137
This bracelet…

80
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:42,015
Is this not
Young Master Jang's binding bracelet?

81
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,767
Why is this here?

82
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,977
Does this mean Uk was here?

83
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:51,983
They fought here.

84
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,236
Do you think something happened to him?

85
00:10:57,572 --> 00:11:00,117
Please return to Songrim
and report what you saw here.

86
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:03,036
Dang-gu, go inside the fortress
and look for Uk.

87
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,038
-I will search this area.
-All right.

88
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:43,410
How did the Songrim mages
know to come here?

89
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:02,304
You are a soul shifter as well.

90
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,598
Naksu, you will also

91
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:07,726
be petrified and perish eventually.

92
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:09,811
Just like me

93
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,063
and your father.

94
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:16,985
Father.

95
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,969
Both you and your father…

96
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,224
were exploited and will eventually

97
00:12:48,683 --> 00:12:50,810
be petrified and die.

98
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:38,585
Why?

99
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:40,962
Why is it you again?

100
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:50,221
Is that the soul shifter?

101
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:52,307
No, she is Uk's maid.

102
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,644
I accidentally hurt her,
so I must get her treated.

103
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:05,070
Goodness, what a day.

104
00:15:05,153 --> 00:15:07,822
Gosh. Business was good today.

105
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,081
I must refill my energy,
or I will be petrified.

106
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,794
-Are you done?
-Yes, I am.

107
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,213
Then let us have a drink.

108
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,923
-All right.
-Hurry up!

109
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:26,174
Let us go.

110
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:30,136
I cannot return if I cause a commotion.

111
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,139
I need to find somewhere quiet
where I can take their energy.

112
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,650
Please move aside.

113
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,987
Right. Please go ahead.

114
00:16:29,904 --> 00:16:30,864
Master.

115
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:33,199
You cannot fool us
with those obvious tricks.

116
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,995
You have been following her
ever since you entered the capital.

117
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:46,838
That man has been following us.

118
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,970
You followed her all the way to this inn.

119
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:58,433
We just shared
the same destination, that is all.

120
00:16:58,516 --> 00:16:59,642
Do not lie.

121
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:02,520
You were staring at her the entire time!

122
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,730
I was not.

123
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:04,814
Sun-i.

124
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:07,192
Do not embarrass him anymore.

125
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:14,574
To follow me to my accommodation
was rude and uncomfortable.

126
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:18,119
If you do not want me
to find another inn this late,

127
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,329
please leave.

128
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:22,165
Lady.

129
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:25,335
Why do you think I was following you?

130
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,796
You are neither my debtor

131
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:31,132
nor someone I know,
so why do you think I followed you?

132
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,177
-That is because she is very--
-Shut up, Sun-i.

133
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,347
I want you to answer me.

134
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:43,728
Many men have given me trouble
because they followed me due to my looks.

135
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:44,979
So I thought

136
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:47,816
you were just one of them.

137
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:49,234
I see.

138
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:50,985
You are wrong.

139
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,739
Your looks did not impress me,

140
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:57,200
and I did not follow you either.

141
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:00,203
If that is the case,

142
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:03,540
I am sorry.

143
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:05,542
Then may I go upstairs now?

144
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:20,473
-Young Lady Heo.
-Yes?

145
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,183
You must eat.

146
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:25,395
Did that scum--

147
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:27,438
I mean…

148
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:30,900
Are you that embarrassed
that you might run into him again?

149
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,444
That is not why.

150
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,905
I just do not feel well.

151
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:38,241
You should change into dry clothes.

152
00:18:38,324 --> 00:18:40,743
I will get some porridge for you.

153
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,595
Are you all right?

154
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,726
What was that?

155
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:31,562
Were you after him?

156
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:33,606
Yes.

157
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:37,110
I am glad that you are unscathed.

158
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:39,070
Wait.

159
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:41,739
Thank you.

160
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,783
If you feel unwell,

161
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,327
visit Sejukwon in Songrim.

162
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,954
Do you know Sejukwon?

163
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:49,747
I am Sejukwon's…

164
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:55,586
Heo Yun-ok.

165
00:21:14,897 --> 00:21:17,984
Seeing that you have it
instead of your friend,

166
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:21,112
I am guessing that friend is gone.

167
00:21:24,657 --> 00:21:25,908
You knew…

168
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:29,454
who I was all along.

169
00:22:30,723 --> 00:22:31,974
Are you all right?

170
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:33,768
Hey, are you all right?

171
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:36,687
Try getting up. Slowly.

172
00:22:40,274 --> 00:22:41,818
It is a monster!

173
00:22:43,903 --> 00:22:44,946
A soul shifter.

174
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:46,114
It is a soul shifter!

175
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:48,449
-A soul shifter!
-A soul shifter!

176
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:24,443
The real Danju is someone else.

177
00:23:25,444 --> 00:23:29,115
The true Danju
can prevent you from running wild.

178
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:31,951
Go on. Go to your Danju.

179
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:35,830
Gil-ju went missing?

180
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:39,667
We have not heard from him
ever since he went after Jang Uk's maid.

181
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,795
Jang Uk's maid?

182
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,173
Why would he go after her?

183
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:48,926
To be honest,
he had been after Jang Uk all along.

184
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:53,681
The Spirit Plaque Naksu had left
was actually Jang Uk's.

185
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:57,560
He must have been after Jang Uk,
thinking he was involved.

186
00:23:57,643 --> 00:23:59,896
Then you should have told me sooner!

187
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:01,772
He told me to stay silent.

188
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:04,150
He must have wanted
to find firm evidence first.

189
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:06,903
Order all of our mages to look for Gil-ju.

190
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:14,827
Uk's binding bracelet was found

191
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,371
in the spot where
the alchemy of souls had taken place?

192
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,956
Dang-gu is looking for Young Master Jang.

193
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,083
Young Master Seo is searching
the area around the temple.

194
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,794
-They were at the temple?
-Yes, my lord.

195
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:27,924
I doubt Uk was capable
of carrying out the alchemy of souls.

196
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:29,342
Master Lee,

197
00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:31,928
what if someone else's soul
has shifted into Uk's body?

198
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:34,764
Do not worry. I am sure he is fine.

199
00:24:39,393 --> 00:24:41,562
She will protect him.

200
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,813
By the way,

201
00:24:42,897 --> 00:24:46,609
where is our leader among all this chaos?

202
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:49,237
Before Uk was born…

203
00:24:50,988 --> 00:24:53,032
About 20 years ago…

204
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:54,617
Did Jang Gang

205
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:57,328
perform the alchemy of souls?

206
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:04,835
The Gwanju of Cheonbugwan
performing sorcery?

207
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,004
That is absurd.

208
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,297
Jin Mu told me about it.

209
00:25:09,924 --> 00:25:11,968
I could not dare to hear from him,

210
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,971
so I came to you instead.

211
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:20,810
Madam Do-hwa…

212
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:23,771
was indeed once concerned

213
00:25:24,772 --> 00:25:27,692
that the Gwanju was interested
in learning a strange spell.

214
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:31,821
However, it did not last long.

215
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,657
He did not come home for a year.

216
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,828
He practiced spells with Jin Mu
in the Cheonbugwan Secret Room.

217
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:39,870
However,

218
00:25:39,954 --> 00:25:43,749
he stopped doing so
after his wife became pregnant.

219
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,549
Do-hwa gave birth to the late king's son.

220
00:25:52,216 --> 00:25:53,301
The late king

221
00:25:54,093 --> 00:25:56,804
passed due to a severe illness
and could not even move.

222
00:25:56,887 --> 00:25:58,264
So how is that possible?

223
00:26:00,224 --> 00:26:03,686
The alchemy of souls
would have made that possible.

224
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:07,023
As a mage,

225
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:10,526
he was just briefly curious about it.

226
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:11,527
No.

227
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,155
He committed something

228
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:16,907
irreparable…

229
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,704
to Do-hwa and Uk.

230
00:26:32,006 --> 00:26:35,384
A mage of Jeongjingak
is urgently looking for our young master.

231
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,896
I did not know you were here as well.

232
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:48,272
What is it?

233
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,649
I think Uk

234
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,277
fell victim to the alchemy of souls.

235
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,446
What?

236
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:21,222
That is Cheonbugwan.

237
00:27:21,764 --> 00:27:24,725
Could the real Danju
be inside those walls?

238
00:27:47,915 --> 00:27:50,501
This is the way to the royal palace.

239
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:54,171
Could the real Danju be in there?

240
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,141
I am from Cheonbugwan.

241
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,601
It must be urgent.

242
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:17,027
Let me see your face.

243
00:28:17,111 --> 00:28:19,029
This is urgent. Move aside.

244
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:20,406
Let me see your face.

245
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:43,971
A soul shifter.

246
00:28:46,932 --> 00:28:48,058
Go after him!

247
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,793
So the real Danju is inside the palace.

248
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,755
The ice stone, was it?

249
00:30:42,923 --> 00:30:44,466
You mentioned it.

250
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:49,263
I will find that and prevent her
from meeting the same fate as you.

251
00:31:20,502 --> 00:31:21,921
Hold on. Is he really…

252
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,256
Look at him!

253
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,883
Is he really dead?

254
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:27,760
-Touch him.
-Should I?

255
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:29,929
-Goodness!
-Goodness!

256
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:47,863
He tried to enter the palace
while running wild.

257
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,950
Did you kill him?

258
00:31:51,992 --> 00:31:53,452
How could we?

259
00:31:53,535 --> 00:31:56,372
An unknown mage suddenly appeared
and used a spell on him.

260
00:31:57,122 --> 00:31:59,375
Which family was he from?
Did you see his face?

261
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:01,001
No, my lord.
It was covered with a blue cloth.

262
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,754
However, I did see which spell he used.

263
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,387
It was Tansu.

264
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,726
-Tansu?
-Yes, I am sure of it.

265
00:32:18,852 --> 00:32:20,396
He flicked energy with his sword.

266
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:26,193
Tansu was the spell Naksu used.

267
00:32:26,276 --> 00:32:29,279
Was there another mage
who had mastered it?

268
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,791
I heard you caught
a soul shifter who had run wild.

269
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:44,753
We came here to see who it was.

270
00:32:46,046 --> 00:32:48,966
Sure. Feel free to take a look at him.

271
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,991
Is he not Gil-ju,

272
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,661
one of your men?

273
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,749
That is correct.

274
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:26,837
Bring his body inside
and make everyone leave.

275
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,796
Yes, my lord.

276
00:33:33,427 --> 00:33:36,597
Jin Mu was with me
when the alchemy of souls took place.

277
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:39,016
He is panicking as well.

278
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:43,479
He was not aware
of this alchemy of souls either.

279
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,567
I will take care of this
since it occurred inside Cheonbugwan.

280
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,360
It has nothing to do with Songrim.

281
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,154
Sure.

282
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,866
However, please ask us for help

283
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,786
if you ever need any.

284
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:03,832
Another soul shifter had run wild?

285
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,544
Fortunately, he was caught
and died of petrification.

286
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,630
And who was this soul shifter?

287
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:10,923
It was

288
00:34:11,006 --> 00:34:14,218
Gil-ju, a mage of Cheonbugwan.

289
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:18,180
Gil-ju had become a soul shifter?

290
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:22,267
Then was he caught in Cheonbugwan?

291
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,353
He was caught in front of the palace.

292
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:27,481
He tried to enter the premises
after running wild.

293
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,150
He was on his way here?

294
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,402
Then a mage suddenly appeared

295
00:34:32,486 --> 00:34:34,613
and subdued him by using Tansu.

296
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,993
And who was this mage?

297
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,664
Naksu was the one who killed Gil-ju.

298
00:34:43,747 --> 00:34:44,998
-What?
-Naksu?

299
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,500
She is back!

300
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:48,460
-Naksu?
-The assassin?

301
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:53,048
Last night, the mage who appeared
in front of the palace used Tansu.

302
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,925
That was the spell Naksu used.

303
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:56,718
-Goodness.
-Really?

304
00:34:56,802 --> 00:34:58,178
-It was hers?
-My gosh.

305
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,555
Hold on!

306
00:34:59,638 --> 00:35:00,973
Naksu is dead.

307
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:01,932
-Right.
-Right.

308
00:35:02,015 --> 00:35:04,935
Everyone here witnessed
her body turn to ash.

309
00:35:05,018 --> 00:35:07,354
I saw it with my own two eyes.

310
00:35:07,437 --> 00:35:08,605
-That is right.
-True.

311
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,108
Unlike her body, her soul is still alive.

312
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:14,570
The Shadow Assassin
has returned as a soul shifter!

313
00:35:14,653 --> 00:35:16,321
-What?
-Is that true?

314
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,323
-That cannot be.
-Really?

315
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,284
But Naksu is female.

316
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:22,411
It was a man who killed Gil-ju.

317
00:35:22,494 --> 00:35:25,664
He was a tall, young man
with a blue cloth covering his face.

318
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:28,333
Naksu shifted souls, right?

319
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,086
She must have shifted souls
with that tall man.

320
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,798
Then she must have become stronger.

321
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,968
She was powerful to begin with.

322
00:35:38,051 --> 00:35:41,513
But she has become invincible
thanks to shifting into a strong body.

323
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,142
Murdering Gil-ju is her revenge

324
00:35:45,225 --> 00:35:47,686
on Cheonbugwan for burning her body

325
00:35:48,353 --> 00:35:49,855
and killing her men.

326
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:51,356
Why us?

327
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,317
Songrim was the one who killed Naksu.

328
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:59,072
"The invincible Naksu
dressed in blue cloth has returned,

329
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:01,742
and Songrim is her next target."

330
00:36:01,825 --> 00:36:04,995
This is the rumor
that I have been hearing.

331
00:36:05,078 --> 00:36:07,956
The soul shifter was caught
only a few hours ago.

332
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,833
How is it we already have
such absurd rumors?

333
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:14,213
Such rumors tend to spread
like wildfire and be exaggerated.

334
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:15,964
And the rumor is reasonable.

335
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:19,009
The mage who killed Gil-ju used Tansu,

336
00:36:19,092 --> 00:36:21,470
and that is exactly the spell Naksu used.

337
00:36:21,553 --> 00:36:23,472
Who said she was the only one
who could use it?

338
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,768
I could master it
right now if I wanted to.

339
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:32,272
If this rumor spreads within Songrim,

340
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,442
I will hold you responsible.
So make sure that never happens.

341
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,277
Yes, my lord.

342
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:43,659
I am truly relieved
that it was not Young Master Jang

343
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:45,160
who had shifted souls and died.

344
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:49,289
But then why did we find
his belongings there?

345
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,168
We will know once we find him.

346
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:01,760
You do not look too well.

347
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:10,394
You should

348
00:37:11,144 --> 00:37:13,480
go home and wait for him there.

349
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,534
Are you feeling very unwell?

350
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,204
I was so surprised
that the honey biscuit I had last night

351
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,290
is giving me indigestion.

352
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,295
I was so shocked
when I heard about his soul shifting

353
00:37:36,378 --> 00:37:38,714
that even my soul exited
and entered my body again.

354
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,266
Is it really back?

355
00:37:52,185 --> 00:37:53,520
Is that you, Maidservant Kim?

356
00:37:54,354 --> 00:37:56,857
No, my lord. I am Maidservant Park.

357
00:37:58,066 --> 00:38:01,695
If I could, I would like to slap
Young Master Park's back for shocking me.

358
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,198
Slap mine instead.

359
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,162
I can allow that for Maidservant Park.

360
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:11,830
Go on.

361
00:38:11,913 --> 00:38:13,665
I have pretty strong hands.

362
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,709
It will hurt.

363
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,795
I will not be a baby about it,

364
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,172
so go on.

365
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,882
Goodness.

366
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,720
This means you have already hit me once.

367
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,348
Why?

368
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,184
Are you going to do something
to make me upset?

369
00:38:32,267 --> 00:38:34,770
Then take it back.

370
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:36,188
Hit me back.

371
00:38:37,022 --> 00:38:38,148
Go on.

372
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:40,567
Hurry up.

373
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:47,449
I do not want…

374
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,869
to hurt you.

375
00:38:53,246 --> 00:38:55,207
As Songrim's leader,

376
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:59,419
there will come a time
when I will have to be cold and heartless.

377
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,421
But I truly

378
00:39:02,547 --> 00:39:04,216
do not want to hurt you.

379
00:39:09,888 --> 00:39:11,223
Is your heart troubled

380
00:39:11,765 --> 00:39:15,227
because of what you asked me yesterday
regarding Master Jang Gang?

381
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,771
There has been chaos lately.

382
00:39:17,854 --> 00:39:19,856
But I have failed to be objective

383
00:39:20,857 --> 00:39:22,818
as the leader.

384
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:25,904
Your slap helped me come to my senses.

385
00:39:26,738 --> 00:39:29,950
I must act wisely from now on.

386
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,039
Feel free to hit me every now and then

387
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:38,959
as Maidservant Park.

388
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:42,045
If it is you,

389
00:39:43,046 --> 00:39:44,631
I can allow that.

390
00:40:00,814 --> 00:40:02,149
Why are you here?

391
00:40:02,232 --> 00:40:04,776
Master Heo ordered me
to trace the root of the sorcery.

392
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,154
And this is what I found here.

393
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,282
I must have left it behind.

394
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,243
Do you not need it anymore?

395
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,079
No, I am fine now.

396
00:40:16,788 --> 00:40:19,249
I almost lost that Jin family treasure.

397
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:21,585
Thank you for finding it.

398
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,713
You also left something else.

399
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,841
Are you not looking for Mu-deok?

400
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:30,927
Where is she?

401
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:34,306
I found her hiding in the forest.

402
00:40:35,765 --> 00:40:38,685
She was injured and bleeding profusely.

403
00:40:53,992 --> 00:40:54,910
Mu-deok.

404
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,787
Young Master.

405
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,790
How could you leave me behind?

406
00:41:00,874 --> 00:41:01,875
What?

407
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:07,088
You ran away and left me behind.

408
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,424
Go along with it.

409
00:41:13,136 --> 00:41:16,223
Right. I did indeed run away.

410
00:41:16,806 --> 00:41:17,766
That is right.

411
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:21,144
We had spotted the soul shifter
when we took shelter from the rain.

412
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,521
But thanks to you,

413
00:41:22,604 --> 00:41:25,899
I almost got ripped into shreds
by that soul shifter.

414
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:29,444
I am sorry.

415
00:41:31,029 --> 00:41:34,741
I was too terrified
that I did not think twice and ran away.

416
00:41:36,326 --> 00:41:39,704
Yul mistook Mu-deok for the soul shifter
and almost killed her.

417
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:43,416
Had he not treated her right away,
she would have died.

418
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,423
Yul.

419
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:54,427
Thanks for rescuing and treating Mu-deok.

420
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:02,102
Did you really run away
and leave her behind?

421
00:42:07,899 --> 00:42:09,734
Had I fought, I would have died.

422
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,820
We need to be selfish at times.

423
00:42:13,321 --> 00:42:15,407
Why are you staring at me?
Do you not agree?

424
00:42:16,783 --> 00:42:19,035
In any case, I am glad

425
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,830
that both of us are fine.

426
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,257
Right.

427
00:42:38,555 --> 00:42:40,390
I heard you are hiding in Danhyanggok.

428
00:42:40,974 --> 00:42:42,851
Did you hear that our leader made Songrim

429
00:42:42,934 --> 00:42:45,061
take responsibility
for the dishonor you made?

430
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,646
Jeez, I am sick of this.

431
00:42:47,397 --> 00:42:49,816
Why would he do that
when I am not from Songrim?

432
00:42:49,899 --> 00:42:52,027
The duel with the Crown Prince
is in two weeks.

433
00:42:52,652 --> 00:42:56,239
Do not enter the fortress
or cause any more trouble until then.

434
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,532
Just lie low.

435
00:43:03,538 --> 00:43:05,790
Thank you for treating me.

436
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,959
Uk seems fine
without the binding bracelet.

437
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,254
I guess he can control his energy now.

438
00:43:13,548 --> 00:43:16,426
He risked his life
and got what he wanted once again.

439
00:43:16,509 --> 00:43:18,011
And you were by his side again.

440
00:43:20,805 --> 00:43:24,601
If you were so bothered by that
you should have just let me die.

441
00:43:25,226 --> 00:43:26,353
Next time,

442
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:29,481
I might have to do just that.

443
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,572
Mu-deok.

444
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:39,908
Coming, Young Master.

445
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:43,703
Bye.

446
00:43:49,584 --> 00:43:51,628
Uk was unscathed.

447
00:43:52,545 --> 00:43:53,463
That is a relief.

448
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,299
Did he see

449
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,885
who was with Gil-ju
when the latter shifted souls?

450
00:43:58,968 --> 00:44:01,888
That person was probably
the one in the blue cloth.

451
00:44:01,971 --> 00:44:04,391
He was too busy running away to look back.

452
00:44:04,474 --> 00:44:06,184
Did you ask his maid?

453
00:44:07,602 --> 00:44:09,354
She must have witnessed the spell.

454
00:44:12,357 --> 00:44:13,608
Mu-deok…

455
00:44:19,614 --> 00:44:21,783
She probably will not know
even if she saw it.

456
00:44:22,992 --> 00:44:25,745
She is an ordinary maid
who does not know such spells.

457
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,583
What happened to your hand?

458
00:44:32,335 --> 00:44:33,169
Did you injure it?

459
00:44:35,713 --> 00:44:38,758
The Soul Ejector I had touched yesterday
had some leftover poison from the sorcery.

460
00:44:39,592 --> 00:44:40,677
But I am fine.

461
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:43,721
I shall take my leave.

462
00:45:21,843 --> 00:45:23,678
Why did you want to see me this time?

463
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:29,767
I heard you had taken
my wedding gifts that had arrived.

464
00:45:30,393 --> 00:45:31,728
Why did you do that?

465
00:45:31,811 --> 00:45:34,939
Were you worried I would destroy them?

466
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:39,027
I will keep them stored and give them back
during your next wedding.

467
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:40,987
Just throw them away.

468
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,406
Marriage is out of the picture for me.

469
00:45:44,407 --> 00:45:46,534
Do not be so embarrassed.

470
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:51,122
Your wedding was prepared in secret,
so not many know of it.

471
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:54,125
Really?

472
00:45:56,377 --> 00:45:58,505
Cho-yeon!

473
00:46:02,133 --> 00:46:03,885
I heard you are getting married.

474
00:46:04,677 --> 00:46:07,805
I heard you bought gifts
and hired a craftsman for your rings.

475
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:11,100
I guess word got out.

476
00:46:11,184 --> 00:46:12,101
Congratulations.

477
00:46:12,185 --> 00:46:14,437
Congratulations, Young Master Park.

478
00:46:15,104 --> 00:46:17,774
-Me?
-I know you two are getting married.

479
00:46:17,857 --> 00:46:19,692
He received the wedding gifts

480
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:21,611
and went with you to get your rings.

481
00:46:21,694 --> 00:46:22,820
Right?

482
00:46:22,904 --> 00:46:25,740
There was an absurd rumor
about you marrying Uk again.

483
00:46:26,324 --> 00:46:27,283
No, right?

484
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,035
You are marrying Young Master Park, right?

485
00:46:30,703 --> 00:46:31,746
That is true.

486
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:33,748
But please keep it quiet

487
00:46:33,831 --> 00:46:35,250
since it is a secret.

488
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:37,001
All right.

489
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:38,795
See you later.

490
00:46:40,046 --> 00:46:42,423
I told you it was Dang-gu.

491
00:46:42,507 --> 00:46:45,593
You are right.
She would be crazy to wed Uk again.

492
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,262
Tell me about it.

493
00:46:49,931 --> 00:46:51,015
Young Master Park.

494
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,892
Why did you say yes?

495
00:46:53,476 --> 00:46:55,770
This is better
than getting rejected by Uk twice.

496
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:59,190
Let us say
you broke it off with me this time.

497
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,067
After all, it will just be a rumor.

498
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:04,988
Will you be all right with that?

499
00:47:05,947 --> 00:47:07,490
You will be embarrassed.

500
00:47:08,741 --> 00:47:09,951
That is fine by me.

501
00:47:37,937 --> 00:47:38,896
Filthy Mu-deok?

502
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:42,942
Are you back here again?
Were you unharmed?

503
00:47:43,943 --> 00:47:44,944
Sorry?

504
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:49,407
Forget it. Move aside.

505
00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:56,706
Are you looking for Mu-deok again?

506
00:47:56,789 --> 00:47:59,542
Never mind.
Her dress just looked familiar.

507
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:03,338
Mu-deok sold it to us.

508
00:48:04,088 --> 00:48:06,090
-She sold it?
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

509
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:09,093
She said a thoughtless, young man
had given it to her.

510
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,595
She sold it saying

511
00:48:10,678 --> 00:48:12,639
that he was well-off
and would not want it back.

512
00:48:14,265 --> 00:48:16,893
Did she really say that?

513
00:48:16,976 --> 00:48:20,772
That is right. Filthy Mu-deok and silk
do not go hand in hand.

514
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:22,982
Watch what you say.

515
00:48:23,733 --> 00:48:24,609
Sorry?

516
00:48:24,692 --> 00:48:28,071
That is a nickname that I have given her.
Only I can call her that.

517
00:48:28,154 --> 00:48:29,280
So do not call her that.

518
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:31,282
I am sorry, Your Royal Highness.

519
00:48:32,992 --> 00:48:34,077
Also…

520
00:48:36,162 --> 00:48:38,456
she did not look too bad
in that silk dress.

521
00:48:39,165 --> 00:48:41,542
She looked much better
than you in that blue cloth.

522
00:48:42,126 --> 00:48:43,795
You must not like this.

523
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,631
What is that?

524
00:48:46,714 --> 00:48:49,342
Everyone here was wearing one.

525
00:48:49,425 --> 00:48:51,469
This is Naksu's cloth.

526
00:48:51,552 --> 00:48:52,595
Whose cloth?

527
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:56,057
Naksu, the soul shifter, killed a mage
of Cheonbugwan in front of the palace.

528
00:48:56,641 --> 00:48:58,810
Naksu had a blue cloth like this one.

529
00:48:58,893 --> 00:49:02,522
This blue cloth has become
a trend within the capital's walls.

530
00:49:08,069 --> 00:49:11,322
-Come and buy Naksu's blue cloth.
-I got one.

531
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,157
It will prevent your soul
from getting shifted.

532
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,659
-This one.
-Take it.

533
00:49:14,742 --> 00:49:17,161
I would like one too.

534
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,455
-This is Naksu's cloth.
-Try this on.

535
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,212
Naksu, the soul shifter in blue?

536
00:49:27,338 --> 00:49:29,590
Everyone thinks Naksu
has returned from the dead.

537
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,138
But thanks to Naksu in Blue,

538
00:49:35,221 --> 00:49:37,890
they have lost interest
in Uk's duel with the Crown Prince.

539
00:49:39,058 --> 00:49:41,018
I wonder where Uk and Mu-deok are.

540
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,521
They were not in Danhyanggok either.

541
00:49:44,397 --> 00:49:45,857
I am sure they are safe.

542
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:49,193
They will return after two weeks.

543
00:49:51,654 --> 00:49:53,281
By the way, Yul…

544
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,577
I got one too. Do you want to try it on?

545
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,250
All right.

546
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:11,382
Who in the world could it be?

547
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,635
This Naksu in blue cloth who uses Tansu?

548
00:50:22,643 --> 00:50:24,771
Did you say
this was the soul shifters' grave?

549
00:50:26,355 --> 00:50:27,940
Then he must be buried here.

550
00:50:29,817 --> 00:50:30,943
Your father.

551
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,489
As a little girl,

552
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:38,785
I thought he was unjustly murdered
by the mages of the four families.

553
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:43,122
Jin Mu took me under his wing,
and I called him Danju.

554
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,248
However…

555
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:48,377
my father was a soul shifter
who used sorcery.

556
00:50:50,087 --> 00:50:52,381
And I was used and abandoned.

557
00:50:55,968 --> 00:50:57,512
Like Gil-ju said,

558
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,389
I will eventually run wild as well.

559
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,646
Once I become petrified,

560
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,735
will you leave me here?

561
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:28,334
I found out where the real Danju was.

562
00:51:30,002 --> 00:51:33,047
Inside the palace.
The true Danju is in there.

563
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:40,388
Please tell me about the ice stone.

564
00:51:42,056 --> 00:51:43,349
Are you certain

565
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:47,186
that the ice stone was indeed destroyed

566
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:52,275
by Master Seo Gyeong
and the leader of Jinyowon 200 years ago?

567
00:51:55,069 --> 00:51:56,654
Are you sure…

568
00:51:58,239 --> 00:51:59,699
it is not somewhere in Songrim?

569
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,805
Hello, Danju.

570
00:52:39,113 --> 00:52:42,783
Gil-ju wanted the ice stone
and headed to the palace to see me.

571
00:52:43,951 --> 00:52:45,119
I was not aware

572
00:52:46,078 --> 00:52:48,581
that Gil-ju knew who the real Danju was.

573
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,208
The day the Choi family regains power,

574
00:52:51,834 --> 00:52:55,755
Songrim, the cause
of our family's downfall, gets destroyed,

575
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:00,968
and I control Daeho, is approaching.

576
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,264
And I have been waiting
for that day with bated breath.

577
00:53:06,682 --> 00:53:10,102
We must find and kill the one
who killed Gil-ju in front of the palace.

578
00:53:11,604 --> 00:53:14,065
That individual may have waited
for Gil-ju to go there,

579
00:53:14,148 --> 00:53:16,901
knowing the latter
was after the ice stone.

580
00:53:16,984 --> 00:53:19,570
If that individual knows
that the ice stone is in there,

581
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,447
you must find

582
00:53:22,573 --> 00:53:23,866
and kill them.

583
00:53:28,454 --> 00:53:29,914
I do not know who it is,

584
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,917
but the Danju inside the palace
has the ice stone.

585
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,711
And with that, Gil-ju said
a soul shifter may not run wild.

586
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:41,050
Are you saying we should enter
the royal palace and look for the Danju?

587
00:53:41,133 --> 00:53:43,135
It is impossible in my current state.

588
00:53:43,928 --> 00:53:46,389
I am a low-class mage
that was rejected by Jeongjingak.

589
00:53:47,014 --> 00:53:49,600
However, I will keep climbing up.

590
00:53:50,726 --> 00:53:53,229
And I will eventually enter
the palace walls.

591
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:55,856
Master.

592
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,359
I will find

593
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,778
that ice stone for you.

594
00:54:06,283 --> 00:54:07,326
Uk.

595
00:54:08,202 --> 00:54:10,538
Your master is neither strong enough
to pull you up

596
00:54:11,622 --> 00:54:14,291
nor support you from the bottom.

597
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,130
You were never like that to begin with.

598
00:54:19,672 --> 00:54:21,257
You always pushed me to my death.

599
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,681
But whenever you did that,
I found myself on a whole new level.

600
00:54:32,476 --> 00:54:34,311
Keep doing that

601
00:54:34,895 --> 00:54:36,522
and stay by my side.

602
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:47,700
Fine.

603
00:54:48,659 --> 00:54:50,786
I will do that and push you

604
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:53,205
to your death if you stop.

605
00:55:20,733 --> 00:55:23,819
I will find Uk and make sure
he does not come to fight the duel.

606
00:55:25,654 --> 00:55:26,947
Do not bother.

607
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,825
If he wants to come,

608
00:55:30,701 --> 00:55:31,660
let him.

609
00:55:31,744 --> 00:55:34,413
It is a formal match among mages.

610
00:55:35,164 --> 00:55:37,374
We cannot intervene
even if one of them dies.

611
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,253
If death occurs,

612
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,715
then that is that.

613
00:55:49,136 --> 00:55:50,679
Will you not stop it?

614
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:57,311
The Unanimous Assembly asked Uk to fight

615
00:55:57,394 --> 00:55:59,480
on Songrim's behalf.

616
00:56:00,397 --> 00:56:02,316
Whether he becomes a coward and runs away

617
00:56:03,025 --> 00:56:05,111
or honorably dies during the duel,

618
00:56:05,903 --> 00:56:10,783
I will only watch
as the leader of Songrim.

619
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:47,213
His Majesty and the Queen are here.

620
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:23,082
One month ago, Go Won,
Daeho's royal Go family member,

621
00:58:23,165 --> 00:58:26,710
challenged Jang Uk, the eldest son
of the Jang family, to a duel.

622
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:30,339
And Songrim received
the challenge on Uk's behalf.

623
00:58:31,131 --> 00:58:33,175
Whoever signs the paper

624
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,469
cannot hold his opponent responsible

625
00:58:36,428 --> 00:58:39,473
for their death even if that occurs.

626
00:58:41,183 --> 00:58:44,979
The match will commence at noon.

627
00:58:45,646 --> 00:58:47,731
If he does not show up by then,

628
00:58:48,524 --> 00:58:50,526
we will accept his defeat.

629
00:58:53,237 --> 00:58:58,242
You must mention the punishment
he will get if he does not show up.

630
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:06,125
If Jang Uk does not show up today,

631
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:11,005
his right to become
Cheonbugwan's next Gwanju…

632
00:59:12,923 --> 00:59:14,341
will be lost.

633
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:36,363
Come here.

634
00:59:38,115 --> 00:59:39,950
What are in those crocks?

635
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,412
They are full of water.

636
00:59:43,996 --> 00:59:45,539
Crocks full of water?

637
01:00:18,238 --> 01:00:20,199
My lord, it is noon.

638
01:00:20,282 --> 01:00:22,242
Close the Training Center's door.

639
01:00:23,452 --> 01:00:24,620
I must announce

640
01:00:25,871 --> 01:00:27,373
his defeat.

641
01:00:47,434 --> 01:00:48,352
Close the door.

642
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:04,660
Jang Uk is here!

643
01:01:14,002 --> 01:01:14,920
Young Master…

644
01:01:45,617 --> 01:01:46,618
Young Master.

645
01:01:48,203 --> 01:01:49,204
It will be all right.

646
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:56,086
JANG UK

647
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:18,358
Now that you have signed the paper,

648
01:02:18,442 --> 01:02:19,943
no one can intervene

649
01:02:20,694 --> 01:02:22,696
even if you die while fighting.

650
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:25,073
I am aware of that.

651
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:29,995
Mother.

652
01:02:30,078 --> 01:02:32,706
Please use our plaque to stop this duel.

653
01:02:33,457 --> 01:02:36,251
He will surely die
in the Crown Prince's hands.

654
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,337
He showed up because he was ready to die.

655
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:41,131
Your wedding has fallen through.

656
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:43,967
His fate has nothing to do with us now.

657
01:02:57,481 --> 01:02:58,857
You may commence the duel.

658
01:03:28,053 --> 01:03:30,264
First, do not do anything and just defend.

659
01:03:30,347 --> 01:03:32,516
If you make the first move
with your current skills,

660
01:03:34,059 --> 01:03:35,227
you will die.

661
01:03:37,145 --> 01:03:39,064
You must only attack him

662
01:03:40,232 --> 01:03:41,817
when he loses his focus.

663
01:04:19,855 --> 01:04:21,815
I trust that he has placed them.

664
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:24,610
Did you say you could enter Songrim
whenever you pleased?

665
01:04:25,652 --> 01:04:26,820
Yes. Why?

666
01:04:27,863 --> 01:04:29,406
I have a favor.

667
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,825
Could you put some water
in the Training Center

668
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:33,994
so that he can use Tansu during the duel?

669
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:51,178
I feel uneasy about those crocks.

670
01:04:52,888 --> 01:04:53,847
Break them.

671
01:05:53,657 --> 01:05:54,700
Young Master.

672
01:06:06,378 --> 01:06:07,504
Tansu.

673
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:26,398
Your Royal Highness.

674
01:06:26,481 --> 01:06:27,566
The match

675
01:06:28,108 --> 01:06:29,276
has ended.

676
01:06:34,322 --> 01:06:36,658
This is cheating. It does not count!

677
01:06:46,501 --> 01:06:48,045
That was Tansu.

678
01:06:48,962 --> 01:06:51,923
Only those
who have reached Chisu can do it.

679
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:56,553
How could he have mastered that
when his gate of energy just opened?

680
01:06:56,636 --> 01:06:57,971
I am certain

681
01:06:58,055 --> 01:07:01,308
that a master has helped him in secret.

682
01:07:01,391 --> 01:07:04,519
How could anyone have possibly helped him

683
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:06,438
when all of us were watching?

684
01:07:06,521 --> 01:07:07,981
Do not be stubborn!

685
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:10,567
Jang Uk, tell us yourself.

686
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:13,195
Is it true that you have learned Tansu

687
01:07:13,278 --> 01:07:14,988
by reaching Chisu in such a short time?

688
01:07:16,531 --> 01:07:17,866
That is not true.

689
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,786
I do not know how to gather my energy.

690
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:23,121
I can only use Tansu if there is water.

691
01:07:23,705 --> 01:07:26,416
I only learned how to flick the water.

692
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,794
Then who taught you that?

693
01:07:30,587 --> 01:07:32,798
Someone must have taught you that skill.

694
01:07:35,967 --> 01:07:37,010
No one did.

695
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:39,971
Look at him.

696
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,140
He is being ridiculous,

697
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,768
claiming that
he learned it single-handedly.

698
01:07:47,854 --> 01:07:50,440
I spotted some water crocks
in this building.

699
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:54,194
Who placed them here?

700
01:07:55,862 --> 01:07:57,697
Was it your master?

701
01:07:59,574 --> 01:08:01,034
I trained by myself.

702
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:02,494
I will not buy that!

703
01:08:02,577 --> 01:08:04,454
Jang Uk, explain yourself.

704
01:08:07,916 --> 01:08:11,044
Who helped you train all this time?

705
01:08:21,179 --> 01:08:22,264
It was me.

706
01:08:34,901 --> 01:08:36,486
I was with him.

707
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,448
Everything he just said is true.

708
01:08:44,119 --> 01:08:45,287
And who are you?

709
01:08:46,204 --> 01:08:48,123
How dare you intervene?

710
01:08:48,206 --> 01:08:49,291
Silence!

711
01:08:50,041 --> 01:08:52,711
He is Hemp Master Lee,

712
01:08:52,794 --> 01:08:54,504
a pupil of Master Seo Gyeong.

713
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:56,423
Greet him this instant!

714
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:01,636
Goodness. Hello, master.

715
01:09:04,472 --> 01:09:07,893
I saw everything
during my time in Danhyanggok with him.

716
01:09:07,976 --> 01:09:10,687
He practiced flicking waterdrops
all day long.

717
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:15,442
And by his side

718
01:09:16,943 --> 01:09:19,321
was no one other than his maid.

719
01:09:21,364 --> 01:09:24,409
Master Lee has vouched for him.

720
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:30,916
Do you have any other objections?

721
01:10:05,867 --> 01:10:07,494
Let us go, Your Majesty.

722
01:10:24,594 --> 01:10:27,347
Bring Jang Uk into Cheonbugwan.

723
01:10:40,485 --> 01:10:43,905
The son of Gwanju Jang Gang
is incredible indeed.

724
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:49,035
Since you do not have a master yet,
Cheonbugwan will happily accept you.

725
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:51,705
Do not be ridiculous.

726
01:10:51,788 --> 01:10:54,124
If anything, I should be his master.

727
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:57,335
I opened his gate of energy
and gave him a torrent of my energy.

728
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,838
Uk, come to Sejukwon.

729
01:10:59,921 --> 01:11:02,215
I will teach you what I know.

730
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:04,551
How about joining Jinyowon?

731
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:08,138
As Cho-yeon's former betrothed,

732
01:11:08,221 --> 01:11:11,474
we will consider you family
and teach you our spells.

733
01:11:15,937 --> 01:11:17,147
Jang Uk.

734
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:20,275
If you wish to join Songrim Jeongjingak,

735
01:11:21,985 --> 01:11:23,278
we will accept you.

736
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:43,590
Mu-deok.

737
01:11:43,673 --> 01:11:47,427
They all want me. Where should I go?

738
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:01,691
You should join Songrim for now,

739
01:12:02,567 --> 01:12:03,693
Young Master.

740
01:12:13,703 --> 01:12:15,789
I, Jang Uk,
the eldest son of the Jang family,

741
01:12:16,581 --> 01:12:18,666
will join Songrim Jeongjingak.

742
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:18,810
Young Master Jang has become
a mage of Jeongjingak.

743
01:13:18,893 --> 01:13:22,105
We have a welcome ceremony
for our newest mage, Jang Uk.

744
01:13:22,772 --> 01:13:24,941
I hate your master so much,
it is gut-wrenching.

745
01:13:25,024 --> 01:13:25,942
Of course.

746
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:30,947
If that love is fickle,
then I do not need it.

747
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:31,990
Please let me in.

748
01:13:32,073 --> 01:13:32,907
Mu-deok.

749
01:13:32,991 --> 01:13:35,326
I must be with my young master.

750
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:36,536
For now, go home and wait.

751
01:13:36,619 --> 01:13:38,955
Young Master Jang snuck out
and has come home.

752
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:41,583
Young Master! Wait there.

753
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:43,835
-I will go to you.
-I found the exam papers.

754
01:13:44,502 --> 01:13:45,753
No matter what happens,

755
01:13:45,837 --> 01:13:48,256
I will go into Songrim,
where Young Master Jang is.

756
01:13:48,339 --> 01:13:49,549
Mu-deok.

757
01:13:49,632 --> 01:13:52,635
I can do anything
if it means being able to see you.

758
01:13:55,555 --> 01:14:00,560
