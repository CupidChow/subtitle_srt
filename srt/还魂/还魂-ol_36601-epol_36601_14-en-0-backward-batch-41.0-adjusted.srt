1
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:30,112
I heard you have been going fishing
with Uk these days.

2
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:34,408
That is true.
It is so boring to fish alone.

3
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,952
You once said that

4
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:40,456
Uk shares the same fate
as Master Seo Gyeong.

5
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:44,001
Is that why you are encouraging
and guiding him?

6
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,421
I am not the one guiding him.

7
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:51,967
Then is there someone else?

8
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,428
Who is it?

9
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:56,847
Do you know who that person is?

10
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:07,149
No one is teaching Uk
how to do spells right now.

11
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,651
I can be sure of it.

12
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,946
It was confirmed by his maid
who is always by his side.

13
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:16,826
Are you saying he progressed
that much single-handedly?

14
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:18,869
He may have become a mage of Jeongjingak

15
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,330
thanks to his schemes and good luck.

16
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:22,915
But he has no skills.

17
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:25,793
I am sure you have heard
of our ongoing bet.

18
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:28,504
He has yet to win once.

19
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:31,257
You are right.

20
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,885
If he had a master, his master would have
prevented him from being humiliated.

21
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:38,097
Reading Words of the Heart
had won him respect.

22
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,182
But our bet has humiliated him.

23
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,769
Seeing how he has not given up,

24
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,437
that object

25
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,316
must mean a lot to him.

26
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,446
Are you all right? Can you see?

27
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,407
Yes. And you, Young Master?

28
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,576
Did you get hurt anywhere?

29
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:01,287
You are right.

30
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:06,208
I did not know
how important this was to him.

31
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:12,047
Once Uk returns,

32
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,967
Beom would want to have
their duel right away.

33
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,427
But he is busy fishing right now?

34
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,513
And Mu-deok is letting him do that?

35
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,556
Gosh.

36
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,141
I doubt she would have let him.

37
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:25,728
So you can also see
that Uk listens to Mu-deok.

38
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:29,773
He is stubborn about things
no matter what others tell him.

39
00:02:29,857 --> 00:02:31,817
But he always listens to Mu-deok.

40
00:02:34,862 --> 00:02:37,615
We can also protect
the monsters from this world.

41
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,410
The monster
he was talking about was Naksu.

42
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:48,375
If he is looking for
the ice stone to protect her…

43
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,380
-They must not be together.
-What?

44
00:02:54,673 --> 00:02:55,716
Why not?

45
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:58,469
Do you not like that they are close?

46
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:01,847
I do not.

47
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,726
If they end up going down the wrong path,

48
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,397
there will be nothing I can do.

49
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:25,454
Uk is someone who can potentially
bring chaos to the world.

50
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,459
What if we support and raise him
into an uncontrollable individual

51
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:33,003
and he becomes the center
of the world's attention?

52
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:36,423
Are you afraid that he will desire
to become king according to his fate

53
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,593
and bring chaos to Daeho?

54
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:44,348
It may be possible
if he learns of the King's Star.

55
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:46,892
It will forever broaden his horizons

56
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:51,522
and desire to achieve greatness.

57
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,316
Jin.

58
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:57,903
How long did it take you to reach Chisu?

59
00:03:58,737 --> 00:03:59,697
Chisu?

60
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:03,325
It did not take me long to reach Ryusu,

61
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,579
but it did take some time to reach Chisu.

62
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:15,713
It took me three years
to look into the sky's energy,

63
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,466
three years to read the land's energy,

64
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:25,306
and four years to feel
the energy around me.

65
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:31,437
The energy from the sky and land,
and water that bridges between them.

66
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,316
It took me ten years to master them all

67
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:39,361
and reach Chisu.

68
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,529
That is incredible.

69
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:43,324
It took me 13 years.

70
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:45,701
And it took Yeom twice as long.

71
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:50,247
I was the second fastest after Jang Gang.

72
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,915
But you see…

73
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,218
We say this energy flows
between heaven and earth.

74
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:06,722
But in fact, this is just water.

75
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:13,562
It took us over ten years
to finally grasp this energy.

76
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:17,941
But there are those
who can do that from birth.

77
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,628
Simply put, they are geniuses.

78
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,714
But to the world,

79
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:44,510
they seem reckless, unreliable,

80
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:47,221
and even dangerous at times.

81
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,600
Did I just

82
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,311
reach Chisu?

83
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,109
That is because
they are different from the rest of us.

84
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,077
Some could be jealous of them.

85
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,337
While others could be worried about them.

86
00:06:23,006 --> 00:06:24,424
I will definitely win tomorrow.

87
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:28,470
I caught it.

88
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,015
Really?

89
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,767
Uk.

90
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,061
You have reached Chisu.

91
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:45,904
We react that way because we do not know
how they will use their terrifying powers.

92
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,534
Will he save this world
like Master Seo Gyeong did?

93
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:53,996
Or will he do the very opposite?
We do not know.

94
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:56,623
So are you saying

95
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,003
that you will continue to watch him?

96
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:06,133
Do not worry. I am debating as well.

97
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:10,345
If we need to get rid of that power,

98
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:14,099
I will do so with my own hands.

99
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:22,983
Uk, is your probation period over?

100
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:24,318
That is why I am back.

101
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:25,819
So you destroyed Cheonbugwan?

102
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,154
Do not exaggerate.

103
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,033
-Hey.
-You are finally back.

104
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,661
I am your final opponent.

105
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,664
-I see.
-I feel bad that

106
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:42,920
you will not be able to win
since I happen to be your last opponent.

107
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:49,801
You are right.

108
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:52,888
I hope the finale will not be boring.

109
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:54,806
I am counting on you.

110
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,235
What was that?

111
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:08,070
Did he undergo a new kind of training?

112
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:10,072
I heard he only went fishing.

113
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:12,574
Do not worry. He is just talking big.

114
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:17,788
I will humiliate him
in front of the Crown Prince today.

115
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:20,958
Your Royal Highness.

116
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,545
My foolish young master
lost nine duels so far

117
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:28,423
and thus made you lose
nine precious gold toads.

118
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:31,385
I do not deserve to look you in the eye.

119
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:35,222
Is there one duel left?

120
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:37,099
He trained hard,

121
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:39,518
so he will not disappoint you
this time around.

122
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:41,228
If I am not to be disappointed,

123
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,896
he should lose again.

124
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:50,070
You took me for a fool.

125
00:08:50,153 --> 00:08:53,198
You were using my gold
to train your young master.

126
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:56,326
Thanks to the duels,

127
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,247
you had the satisfaction of watching
my young master get humiliated.

128
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,916
I believe that alone was worth the gold.

129
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,419
Yes, they were entertaining.

130
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:07,671
I hope he will lose this time again

131
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:11,008
so I can see you cry
after losing this to me.

132
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:13,885
Uk has the other half, does he not?

133
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:17,139
Since he had given this to you,

134
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:19,391
was this a symbol of love?

135
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:23,562
Did you give this up so you could use me?

136
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:30,319
If Uk loses and this becomes mine,

137
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:31,987
I will destroy it.

138
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,906
You must lose something as well.

139
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:36,867
What a pity.

140
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,244
Your heartwrenching love
will be thrown away.

141
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,959
Do as you please.

142
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:48,337
That jade did its job

143
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,589
by allowing my young master
to have ten duels.

144
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:53,717
Did you not say that
this was precious enough to bet your life?

145
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:57,471
If he and I shared feelings
worth betting my life on,

146
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,225
losing that would not affect
the feelings we have toward each other.

147
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,985
So you really do not care
if you lose this?

148
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,279
Fine.

149
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,698
Then I will throw this away.

150
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,752
So it really meant nothing to you.

151
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,880
Then you have deceived me.

152
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:34,257
You had said
it was your most precious belonging.

153
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:37,177
But if you do not care about it,
that means you have lied.

154
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,597
How will you pay for what you have done?

155
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,432
You said you have bet your life?

156
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,226
Fine.

157
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,729
This time, place yourself for the bet.

158
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:51,691
I already lost nine gold toads.

159
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:53,777
I do not wish to lose another.

160
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,612
The reward for this next duel

161
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:58,198
will be you.

162
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:02,202
Do as you please.

163
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:03,453
If Jang Uk loses,

164
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,374
you will be serving whoever beats him.

165
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,920
Yes, Your Royal Highness.
I will keep that in mind.

166
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:30,605
So you are Uk's last opponent?

167
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,608
I am Cha Beom.

168
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,402
I will defeat him no matter what.

169
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,196
You must win this duel.

170
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,823
If you fail,

171
00:11:39,906 --> 00:11:42,576
I will see to it
that you never succeed in life as a mage.

172
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:46,329
Can you give me your word?

173
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,625
There are always variables in every duel…

174
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,835
Forget it!

175
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:55,255
I only need those
who will definitely win the duel.

176
00:11:55,338 --> 00:11:56,715
Give me your word.

177
00:11:56,798 --> 00:11:59,342
I am afraid I cannot do that,
Your Royal Highness.

178
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:01,094
No one expected him…

179
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,473
to defeat you either.

180
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:09,519
There is only one person who can beat him

181
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,189
at all costs.

182
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:13,273
It is Seo Yul.

183
00:12:19,237 --> 00:12:20,489
Seo Yul.

184
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:35,253
The bet started as nothing serious.

185
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:38,089
But I am beyond annoyed at this point.

186
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:42,677
I spent nine gold toads
just to put that arrogant Uk in his place.

187
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:46,640
Imagine how ridiculous I will look

188
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:50,602
if he happens to win the final match
due to some bizarre reason.

189
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:54,731
So I need someone
who can beat him for certain.

190
00:12:54,814 --> 00:12:57,484
As the best mage of Jeongjingak
and my cousin,

191
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:59,027
I believe you are the only one.

192
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:03,990
I know you two are very close.

193
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:09,162
But as the Crown Prince and your cousin,

194
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:11,498
could you help me out this once?

195
00:13:15,335 --> 00:13:16,628
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

196
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:19,756
Really?

197
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:22,884
You will fight Uk for me?

198
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:24,678
I will win.

199
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,846
I give you my word.

200
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:31,476
That is right.
You of all people can do that.

201
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,937
Did Mu-deok really promise to serve

202
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,855
whoever beat Uk?

203
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:38,567
Yes. Instead of the gold toad…

204
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:45,657
She decided to put herself as the bet.

205
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,701
Then I will beat Uk

206
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:50,829
and take her in as my maid.

207
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,501
All right, then.

208
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,546
The person fighting Jang Uk
for his last duel. Step forward.

209
00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:28,825
Uk.

210
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,786
The person you will be fighting against

211
00:14:32,495 --> 00:14:33,747
is me.

212
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:56,019
Yul could not have volunteered
just so he could let Uk win, right?

213
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:57,103
No way.

214
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,273
When Dang-gu volunteered,
Uk refused to fight him.

215
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,775
He will not let Uk win.

216
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:05,403
He gave the Crown Prince his word
and said he would beat Uk.

217
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,909
You may begin.

218
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,217
Yul was right.

219
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,095
Uk has greatly improved.

220
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,528
That is my shield spell.

221
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:47,737
When did he master that?

222
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:52,325
He just picked them up
through his previous duels.

223
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:56,329
Did he master all of his opponents' spells
from his previous nine duels?

224
00:15:56,413 --> 00:16:00,166
He has learned and is mimicking
some spells from his previous duels.

225
00:17:00,226 --> 00:17:01,352
He did it.

226
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,848
The duel has ended.

227
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,434
Seo Yul has won.

228
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:46,689
I knew it.

229
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,902
Uk lost all ten duels.

230
00:17:51,694 --> 00:17:54,656
How did he use Tansu at the end?

231
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:57,784
He collected the energy in the air
and turned it into water.

232
00:17:57,867 --> 00:17:58,785
That is absurd.

233
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:02,413
Only those
who have reached Chisu can do that.

234
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,219
When did you reach Chisu?

235
00:18:16,803 --> 00:18:20,515
I told you yesterday that
I had something surprising to tell you.

236
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:22,058
That is incredible.

237
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,227
Congratulations.

238
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,186
Uk!

239
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:28,648
You have reached Chisu.
Congratulations, my friend!

240
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:30,608
Did you see that?

241
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:33,945
Our fellow mage, Jang Uk,
has reached Chisu!

242
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,031
-Really?
-Hey.

243
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,075
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

244
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,619
-You are amazing.
-Congratulations!

245
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,787
Hey!

246
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:45,456
Let us head to Sejukwon.

247
00:18:54,757 --> 00:18:57,218
Mu-deok just left with the Crown Prince.

248
00:18:57,802 --> 00:19:00,471
They are probably
putting an end to their bet.

249
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:03,224
I am just worried they may be
up to something ridiculous again.

250
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,976
I will go and check.

251
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:08,563
Yes. You should take care of her.
After all, you are now her owner.

252
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:15,111
That is what we want
the Crown Prince to think.

253
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:19,782
So Yul can go to see Mu-deok.

254
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:21,618
Uk, come with me to Sejukwon.

255
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,329
Let us go. Hurry.

256
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,540
-Be careful. Come on.
-That hurts.

257
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,125
Watch out.

258
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:38,426
Like you said, my young master
was defeated ten times.

259
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,845
You have won, Your Royal Highness.

260
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:45,391
You already knew
that he had reached Chisu.

261
00:19:46,976 --> 00:19:49,771
That is why you did not hesitate
to place yourself as the bet.

262
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:52,065
Had Master Cha Beom competed
like he was supposed to,

263
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:54,400
my young master would have won.

264
00:19:55,818 --> 00:19:57,487
He is no longer your young master.

265
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,366
You will be serving Yul from now on.

266
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,038
You said you two shared
quite intimate feelings.

267
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,457
All right.

268
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,961
I hope you continue doing that
while serving a new owner.

269
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,776
That is ridiculous.

270
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:39,153
How could he have reached Chisu already?

271
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:41,864
It is true. We all witnessed it.

272
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,366
Is this true?

273
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,271
My goodness!

274
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,774
He is truly incredible!

275
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,401
Uk, look at you!

276
00:21:18,484 --> 00:21:20,653
-That hurts!
-Sorry!

277
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:23,364
Master Heo, I am in pain.

278
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:26,200
You stepped up because you were worried

279
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:28,411
that I might have to serve
Master Cha Beom, right?

280
00:21:28,494 --> 00:21:30,830
Thank you so much for your kindness.

281
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:32,707
You will be serving me from now on.

282
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,377
That was a promise
I had made for the duel.

283
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,671
I need to pretend
to keep up with my promise.

284
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:39,839
Of course.

285
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:43,426
Feel free to let me know
if you need me to run any errands.

286
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:44,677
I will not need anything from you.

287
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:47,347
You can visit Uk whenever you want.

288
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:50,391
However,

289
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:53,603
there is one thing I ask of you.

290
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:58,608
Once I complete my training here
and return to Seoho Fortress,

291
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,611
there is someone
I would like to take with me.

292
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:04,489
Please help me

293
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:06,949
do that.

294
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,245
I did not know you had someone like that.

295
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:14,624
Give me your word.
Promise that you will help me.

296
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:21,422
You are asking me this favor as my owner.

297
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:24,050
I will do so at all costs.

298
00:22:35,144 --> 00:22:38,314
There is a soul shifter
in Sejukwon right now.

299
00:22:38,397 --> 00:22:40,149
So how could you bring Uk here?

300
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,568
What could I have done? He was hurt.

301
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:46,322
I told him to rest up for a few days.

302
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:49,659
-Is he badly hurt?
-No.

303
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:51,160
It is nothing serious.

304
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:55,915
How reckless of him to fight against Yul.

305
00:22:55,998 --> 00:22:58,543
We should have just let him
keep fishing with Master Lee.

306
00:22:58,626 --> 00:23:00,294
We should not have summoned him.

307
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:04,882
They must have done
more than just fishing.

308
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:10,054
Uk reached Chisu.

309
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:11,889
What?

310
00:23:13,307 --> 00:23:14,767
Is that not incredible?

311
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,269
How unbelievable.

312
00:23:16,352 --> 00:23:18,229
He is indeed extraordinary.

313
00:23:26,112 --> 00:23:28,531
What have you been learning

314
00:23:29,365 --> 00:23:33,244
while fishing

315
00:23:33,327 --> 00:23:34,954
with Master Lee?

316
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:38,499
I learned how to catch a Golden Fish.

317
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,919
So he was determined
to help you reach Chisu.

318
00:23:42,503 --> 00:23:45,590
-Has he taken you in as his pupil?
-No, Master Heo.

319
00:23:45,673 --> 00:23:47,633
There is a reason
why he is taking care of me.

320
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,970
And what could that be?

321
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,974
Was there something

322
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,893
that…

323
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,729
he told you about?

324
00:24:01,647 --> 00:24:03,482
It was regarding a family matter.

325
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:05,985
I caught onto it and asked him first.

326
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:13,451
It seems like you are already aware of it.

327
00:24:15,995 --> 00:24:17,205
I had hoped…

328
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:20,791
you would not find out.

329
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:22,960
No.

330
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,255
It was not something I could turn
a blind eye to upon finding out.

331
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:29,175
What will you do?

332
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:34,972
About Maidservant Kim.

333
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:44,815
What about her?

334
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,568
Master Lee is trying to win
Maidservant Kim over

335
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,612
by treating me well.

336
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,490
So what will you do?

337
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:58,246
I mean, Master Lee is a wonderful man
who has helped me greatly.

338
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:00,706
But still…

339
00:25:01,707 --> 00:25:05,127
I thought I should give you
the opportunity first,

340
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:06,796
given our history together.

341
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:12,009
What opportunity?

342
00:25:13,135 --> 00:25:16,222
Did you know that Master Lee
has recently been staying at our house?

343
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:19,934
I was wondering where he was staying.

344
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:22,228
So he has been staying at your house.

345
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:23,312
Yes.

346
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,565
Since I am away, they must be enjoying
a lovely meal together.

347
00:25:26,649 --> 00:25:28,734
Since she has a soft heart,

348
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,320
she loves providing for
and feeding others.

349
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,823
It is only a matter of time
until she falls for him.

350
00:25:35,908 --> 00:25:37,618
I truly hope

351
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,538
she can marry a loving man.

352
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:45,543
If it is fine with you,

353
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:49,213
I would like to root for them.

354
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,730
Master Lee is unbelievably older than her.

355
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,567
But on the outside,
he looks younger than you.

356
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,193
It is still absurd.

357
00:26:11,277 --> 00:26:14,488
He practices chastity while training.

358
00:26:15,364 --> 00:26:17,116
How could they get married?

359
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,245
I had cut off my libido to train,
but I have since recovered.

360
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,872
It is not impossible.

361
00:26:22,955 --> 00:26:24,999
Marriage should be consensual.

362
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,210
She needs to want it as well.

363
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:29,962
She has been in love

364
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:34,759
with a certain individual
for all these years.

365
00:26:36,218 --> 00:26:37,386
Jin.

366
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:43,434
Do you really think
she is still in love with Jang Gang?

367
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,730
I know her the best.

368
00:26:48,314 --> 00:26:51,275
So please do not assume things.

369
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,738
Goodness.

370
00:26:55,821 --> 00:26:57,865
You call others slow-witted

371
00:26:57,948 --> 00:27:00,409
when you are the slow one.

372
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,869
You know nothing!

373
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:05,289
It has been ages
since she stopped loving Jang Gang.

374
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,232
He was here

375
00:27:32,858 --> 00:27:34,151
last time as well.

376
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:41,075
It is freshly-made quince tea.

377
00:27:41,158 --> 00:27:42,243
It is fragrant.

378
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:46,747
Is it not good to keep
withered flowers at home.

379
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,083
It is not easy to find flowers
since it is colder now.

380
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:51,710
But I should listen to you
and throw them out.

381
00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:54,713
I liked how the flowers

382
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:56,674
kept me company.

383
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,024
I completely forgot about the cups
and only brought the kettle.

384
00:28:20,614 --> 00:28:22,616
How did they come back to life?

385
00:28:23,784 --> 00:28:25,578
Was it Master Lee?

386
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:28,372
How beautiful.

387
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,016
He must have been

388
00:28:47,975 --> 00:28:50,227
the one who gave her

389
00:28:51,854 --> 00:28:53,439
those wildflowers too.

390
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:04,575
You are truly kind and warmhearted.

391
00:29:05,451 --> 00:29:06,619
Am I?

392
00:29:07,286 --> 00:29:09,789
Feel free to stay here
as long as you want.

393
00:29:09,872 --> 00:29:11,624
I will cater to you as best as I can.

394
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,418
Thank you.

395
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,132
Was she Jang Gang's wife?

396
00:29:22,468 --> 00:29:25,638
Yes. She is very beautiful, is she not?

397
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:29,391
She must be the woman Jin
was head over heels with as Yeom said.

398
00:29:32,978 --> 00:29:38,025
She has not withered away
and is still just as beautiful.

399
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,530
Perhaps that is why
he still cannot forget her.

400
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,282
Or perhaps,

401
00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:47,660
he just does not like me.

402
00:29:48,494 --> 00:29:49,703
I do not know.

403
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,920
I understand it was
the Crown Prince's command.

404
00:29:58,003 --> 00:30:00,256
But how could he forbid me
from visiting Mu-deok?

405
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:02,174
She must be worried sick about me.

406
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,844
I am sure she is just busy.

407
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:06,720
I told her you were doing fine.

408
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:07,721
No.

409
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:10,224
Do you think
she would be relieved after hearing that?

410
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,934
She needs to see me in person.

411
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,019
Come here.

412
00:30:17,064 --> 00:30:18,983
Seeing her will only hurt you.

413
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:24,989
I use this homing bird
to send letters to Seoho Fortress.

414
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:31,912
It would take three to four days
for a horse to arrive there.

415
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,664
Does this bird really fly that far?

416
00:30:34,248 --> 00:30:35,374
How incredible.

417
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:49,972
Do you have the whistle I gave you?

418
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:53,684
I am sorry. I do not carry it with me.

419
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,356
It was given to you
by the person you are in love with.

420
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,274
I am hurt.

421
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,829
The homing bird will return
after two long blows on this whistle.

422
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:16,540
You seemed to be good at this.

423
00:31:17,124 --> 00:31:18,334
Give it a try.

424
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,198
There.

425
00:31:52,326 --> 00:31:53,827
The bird has returned.

426
00:31:56,163 --> 00:31:57,748
Now, do two short ones.

427
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:23,440
I only said that to put him at ease.

428
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:26,235
He was worried that his pet bird
might have suffered during the winter,

429
00:32:27,152 --> 00:32:28,779
so I told him that.

430
00:32:31,323 --> 00:32:34,034
See? Mu-deok is doing well.

431
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:40,082
Wait. Uk.

432
00:32:40,165 --> 00:32:43,377
What exactly did the Crown Prince
and Mu-deok bet on?

433
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,837
The thing you wanted to get.

434
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:50,175
It does not matter.
I cannot get it now since I lost.

435
00:32:56,682 --> 00:33:00,644
But how could she look
so nonchalant after losing it?

436
00:33:08,944 --> 00:33:11,155
-So what was it?
-Do not ask.

437
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:15,367
Why have you not once visited Uk
in Sejukwon?

438
00:33:16,785 --> 00:33:19,538
There is no need to mind me
just because I am your new owner.

439
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:22,166
That is not why.

440
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:24,668
I am just trying not to be shameless.

441
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:38,724
So you really do not care
if you lose this?

442
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:45,814
I must find it.
I need to find it by tonight.

443
00:33:47,107 --> 00:33:49,943
Only then can I see him without shame.

444
00:34:01,955 --> 00:34:03,290
I knew it.

445
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,003
Uk has cut off his libido.

446
00:34:09,963 --> 00:34:11,924
He dishonored the mages and ran away.

447
00:34:12,007 --> 00:34:15,803
It was odd how he improved so quickly
and beat the Crown Prince.

448
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:18,263
He chose to become Master Lee's pupil

449
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,099
and has practiced chastity.

450
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:21,600
Did you all see Master Lee?

451
00:34:22,184 --> 00:34:23,602
He was Master Seo Gyeong's pupil,

452
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:25,479
and Master Heo was his pupil.

453
00:34:25,562 --> 00:34:27,689
But he looks younger than our leader.

454
00:34:27,773 --> 00:34:30,192
That is because he practiced chastity.

455
00:34:30,275 --> 00:34:34,113
I heard he does not age because he reached
a high degree at such a young age.

456
00:34:34,196 --> 00:34:37,241
Really? I heard he became young again
thanks to a spell.

457
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:38,200
A spell?

458
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:41,203
Whatever the case may be,
Uk sure is determined.

459
00:34:41,286 --> 00:34:42,746
So what if he has reached Chisu?

460
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,665
If it were me,

461
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:48,544
I would have never practiced chastity.

462
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,838
Of course not. Me neither.

463
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:52,756
-He is so persistent.
-Tell me about it.

464
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:57,678
They are just jealous.

465
00:34:59,471 --> 00:35:02,808
Young Master Jang is subjected
to all sorts of horrible rumors.

466
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:11,942
I was able

467
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:16,155
to get some much-needed sleep lately
thanks to her medicine.

468
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:21,952
I am glad
that your herbal medicine is effective.

469
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:26,498
I used the valerian that I got
from the wetlands of Wol Fortress.

470
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,375
It is known for its calming effect.

471
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:32,254
It must have helped you relax
and fall asleep better.

472
00:35:32,796 --> 00:35:35,257
I can see why Master Heo recommended you.

473
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,178
Thankfully, I am now able
to get some sleep.

474
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:42,556
But the ringing in my ears
and the splitting headache still remain.

475
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:45,017
They have worsened
after the news of the soul shifter

476
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,894
surprised you last month.

477
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:49,521
A soul shifter tried to enter the palace.

478
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:52,441
There could easily be one in here already.

479
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,443
Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu

480
00:35:54,526 --> 00:35:56,528
strengthened the security,
so do not worry.

481
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,239
The soul shifter who tried to enter
the palace was one of his men.

482
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,116
There were also rumors

483
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,161
about a soul shifter
being spotted in Cheonbugwan.

484
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:07,748
I cannot trust anyone.

485
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:14,004
It seems like your anxiety
stems from your heart, Your Majesty.

486
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:17,591
What do you think about finding
an alternative way to calm yourself?

487
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:22,137
Do you know Hemp Master Lee?

488
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,264
The last pupil of Master Seo Gyeong.

489
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:26,934
I have heard of him

490
00:36:27,017 --> 00:36:28,977
but only saw him once in Songrim.

491
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,982
My grandfather was his pupil,
so I have heard stories about him.

492
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:38,028
He may be able to relieve your anxiety.

493
00:36:38,987 --> 00:36:40,822
Are you saying he can tell

494
00:36:40,906 --> 00:36:42,991
if there is a soul shifter around me?

495
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,619
I do not know him that well
since I have not met him.

496
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:49,331
Perhaps you could invite him
to your palace and ask for his help.

497
00:36:55,754 --> 00:36:57,589
I told you to clean her room every day!

498
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:00,217
How could you let the water
in this vase rot?

499
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,469
I am sorry, my lady!

500
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,013
Imagine if Bu-yeon returned

501
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,140
and saw this vase full of stagnant water.

502
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:08,892
She would be disappointed in me.

503
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:11,561
Change the bedsheets,

504
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:13,021
and get rid of that!

505
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,065
She cannot see,
so why would you place that there

506
00:37:15,148 --> 00:37:16,817
and run the risk of her tripping?

507
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,957
Dozens of girls have come,

508
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,626
but none of them were Bu-yeon.

509
00:37:35,168 --> 00:37:39,381
Being disappointed over and over again
must have made Mother easily distressed.

510
00:37:39,464 --> 00:37:40,799
I agree.

511
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,553
But it will be your birthday soon.

512
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,559
-Here.
-What is this?

513
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,148
Father, they are so pretty.

514
00:37:57,691 --> 00:37:59,776
But it is not my birthday yet.

515
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,487
I will get you
something prettier on your birthday.

516
00:38:04,072 --> 00:38:06,450
I will try it on right now.
Please put it on for me.

517
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:09,036
Sure.

518
00:38:13,373 --> 00:38:17,252
Let me see how pretty you are.

519
00:38:17,919 --> 00:38:21,631
You always used to braid my hair
back when I was little.

520
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:30,057
Mother never did that.

521
00:38:32,517 --> 00:38:34,436
I am sorry. Did that hurt a lot?

522
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,646
I am fine.

523
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:54,748
I must have lost my touch
since it had been a while.

524
00:38:54,831 --> 00:38:55,832
I am sorry.

525
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:59,002
That is all right. Do I look pretty?

526
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,254
You are always beautiful.

527
00:39:34,788 --> 00:39:36,832
Park Jin shot me with this bow.

528
00:39:39,584 --> 00:39:41,086
I was defeated that day.

529
00:39:41,169 --> 00:39:44,548
I cannot give any excuses
or take back the outcome of a fight.

530
00:39:47,092 --> 00:39:49,052
But once I regain my strength,

531
00:39:50,011 --> 00:39:53,014
I would like to have
a proper fight with him.

532
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,069
What are you doing?

533
00:40:07,654 --> 00:40:09,531
I am cleaning, my lord.

534
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,118
Be careful what you touch.

535
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,872
Touch a weapon filled with the energy
of a high-degree mage,

536
00:40:16,955 --> 00:40:19,749
and a girl like you could get hurt.

537
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:23,587
Even I am aware of that, my lord.

538
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:27,382
But I did wonder
why you would place this here

539
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:30,051
when I have to clean the desk.

540
00:40:30,135 --> 00:40:32,888
I usually hang it up well.

541
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:35,140
I simply forgot.

542
00:40:35,223 --> 00:40:36,933
But you are still young.

543
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:40,604
I cannot believe
you are already forgetful.

544
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:44,566
I am just worried as a member of Songrim.

545
00:40:44,649 --> 00:40:47,652
What if you forget to pay me?

546
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:49,529
My lord.

547
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:53,116
Please be healthy. You are still young.

548
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:59,414
I will come back later to clean, my lord.

549
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,589
What a clever

550
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:10,008
and daring girl she is.

551
00:41:10,717 --> 00:41:12,260
How did Mu-deok

552
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:15,347
and Uk first meet?

553
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,932
I do not know the details,

554
00:41:17,015 --> 00:41:20,852
but I heard he paid her debt
and took her out of Chwiseonru.

555
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,063
Then go to Chwiseonru

556
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:25,774
and ask around about her.

557
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:30,028
Find out her background
and what kind of girl she is.

558
00:41:31,112 --> 00:41:32,948
I am just curious that is all.

559
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:38,370
I do not know well either.

560
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:41,498
But the broker who brought her here
is in the capital at the moment.

561
00:41:41,581 --> 00:41:44,209
I will tell him to go to Songrim.

562
00:41:46,836 --> 00:41:49,047
Hey, you there.

563
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:53,218
We met in Sari Village, right?

564
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,512
What is it this time?

565
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:56,763
So-i.

566
00:41:56,846 --> 00:41:58,807
Have you not seen her in the capital?

567
00:41:59,307 --> 00:42:01,601
Do you know where she could be?

568
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,771
I do not know.
She is not a native of Sari Village.

569
00:42:05,355 --> 00:42:08,608
She only stayed for a few months
and then stole the villagers' belongings.

570
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,068
Let me know if you catch her.

571
00:42:15,073 --> 00:42:17,492
Where can I find her?

572
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,455
Darn it.

573
00:42:23,206 --> 00:42:25,584
You have made some bad friends, So-i.

574
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:30,130
Could she have gone to find Mu-deok?

575
00:42:33,633 --> 00:42:36,219
I will take you to Jinyowon soon.

576
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,888
But there is something
we need to take care of first.

577
00:42:48,815 --> 00:42:51,276
Here. Eat this.

578
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,528
You took my purse, right?

579
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:54,863
Give me back my ring.

580
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:03,371
Are they the ones you met in the capital?

581
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,499
That is correct,
but why did you bring them here?

582
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:09,377
I love that you are persistent and smart.

583
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:11,838
But that is also what makes you dangerous.

584
00:43:12,922 --> 00:43:14,924
There is something I want you to see.

585
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:32,942
Assistant Gwanju.

586
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:36,279
Thank you for feeding me.

587
00:44:38,007 --> 00:44:39,467
Be afraid.

588
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:43,471
Betray me or get your cover blown,
and you will meet the same fate.

589
00:44:49,394 --> 00:44:50,395
All right.

590
00:44:51,354 --> 00:44:53,982
Tell me if there is anyone else
who will recognize you.

591
00:44:54,482 --> 00:44:55,817
I must get rid of them.

592
00:44:57,318 --> 00:44:58,695
Is there anyone else?

593
00:45:02,657 --> 00:45:03,825
Yes, my lord.

594
00:45:07,203 --> 00:45:10,790
Search thoroughly.
I definitely threw it in there.

595
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,250
I cannot find it.

596
00:45:12,834 --> 00:45:15,128
Search over there.

597
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:17,964
I had searched that area thoroughly,
but there was nothing.

598
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:19,757
Look again.

599
00:45:19,841 --> 00:45:21,217
I can barely see--

600
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:23,595
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

601
00:45:24,137 --> 00:45:26,097
I am pretty sure it is in here somewhere.

602
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,849
Yes, look over there.

603
00:45:32,437 --> 00:45:33,771
What are you doing?

604
00:45:35,982 --> 00:45:37,275
It is none of your business. Go on.

605
00:45:38,443 --> 00:45:41,988
I am afraid Eunuch Oh
will needlessly suffer.

606
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:45,658
So I must say something. May I?

607
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,285
What is it?

608
00:45:48,703 --> 00:45:49,662
Could you possibly

609
00:45:50,705 --> 00:45:51,789
be looking

610
00:45:52,582 --> 00:45:54,125
for this?

611
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,711
You found it?

612
00:45:56,794 --> 00:46:00,215
I searched day and night
and found it not too long ago.

613
00:46:04,844 --> 00:46:06,262
You threw it away.

614
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,516
Since I picked it up,
it is mine once again.

615
00:46:10,183 --> 00:46:11,017
Goodness.

616
00:46:13,895 --> 00:46:16,272
Eunuch Oh, you can stop and come out.

617
00:46:17,607 --> 00:46:18,900
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

618
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:21,528
Darn it.

619
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,323
Thanks to you,
I retrieved something precious.

620
00:46:25,907 --> 00:46:29,077
I owe this all to you,
Your Royal Highness.

621
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,704
That is right.

622
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:35,750
I did not destroy it
or throw it too far away.

623
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:38,336
You only found it
because I threw it nearby.

624
00:46:38,419 --> 00:46:43,925
If I may dare to try to understand you,

625
00:46:44,008 --> 00:46:47,136
could you be giving yourself credit
and being grumpy

626
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,264
because you feel bad?

627
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:52,850
As Filthy Mu-deok,
you ought to just listen to what I say.

628
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:54,727
How dare you try to understand me?

629
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,771
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

630
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:01,150
Your Royal Highness.

631
00:47:04,946 --> 00:47:06,072
Your Royal Highness.

632
00:47:06,155 --> 00:47:09,826
Master Heo told me to tell you
that Master Lee is here.

633
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:12,078
All right. Is he at Sejukwon?

634
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:15,623
Yes, Your Royal Highness.
His pupil, Jang Uk, is with him.

635
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,836
It is said that Uk
made such sudden progress

636
00:47:19,919 --> 00:47:21,838
thanks to Master Lee's bizarre training.

637
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:23,673
If that were not the case,

638
00:47:23,756 --> 00:47:25,883
he would not have been able
to hold a candle to you.

639
00:47:28,886 --> 00:47:29,846
Let us go.

640
00:47:41,941 --> 00:47:44,444
You are now serving Seo Yul
instead of Jang Uk.

641
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:47,488
Had I competed and beat Uk,

642
00:47:47,572 --> 00:47:49,282
you would have served me instead.

643
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:51,159
Had you competed instead,

644
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,871
there would have been no chance
of you becoming my owner.

645
00:47:54,954 --> 00:47:57,665
I would have let him win out of pity.

646
00:47:58,249 --> 00:47:59,667
Do you not pity him?

647
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,419
Everyone in Songrim knows

648
00:48:01,502 --> 00:48:03,755
that Uk is practicing chastity.

649
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,174
-Right?
-Do not feign ignorance.

650
00:48:06,257 --> 00:48:07,550
You must know best.

651
00:48:08,134 --> 00:48:10,178
Are you not the one who serves him

652
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,180
the chaste herb tea every day?

653
00:48:12,263 --> 00:48:13,431
I have never done that.

654
00:48:13,514 --> 00:48:16,601
How else did he reach Chisu so quickly?

655
00:48:17,977 --> 00:48:19,979
He is not even Jang Gang's real son.

656
00:48:21,314 --> 00:48:25,026
His mother married into the Jang family
and gave birth to an illegitimate son.

657
00:48:25,735 --> 00:48:28,363
Now, her son will end
his family's line for good.

658
00:48:29,697 --> 00:48:33,493
His father blocked his gate of energy
so Uk would not carry on the family line.

659
00:48:33,576 --> 00:48:36,537
But he managed to open it again,
so he should at least be chaste.

660
00:48:37,455 --> 00:48:38,539
That is true.

661
00:48:39,832 --> 00:48:43,044
You are obnoxious and despicable.

662
00:48:43,628 --> 00:48:44,462
What?

663
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:47,256
What did you just say?

664
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:51,177
-You heard me.
-How dare you?

665
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,222
-Say it again.
-Then you will hit me.

666
00:48:54,305 --> 00:48:55,556
Tell me this instant!

667
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,185
Tell them.

668
00:49:09,487 --> 00:49:10,697
If they must hear it,

669
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:14,575
make sure you tell them loud and clear.

670
00:49:20,373 --> 00:49:23,459
You are obnoxious and despicable!

671
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:28,047
That is what she said. Did you get that?

672
00:49:28,673 --> 00:49:29,507
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

673
00:49:30,591 --> 00:49:33,344
Mu-deok, I had given you something.

674
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,595
Show them.

675
00:49:41,477 --> 00:49:43,229
I had bestowed that sachet to you.

676
00:49:43,312 --> 00:49:47,442
If someone hits, swears,
or mistreats you while I am not around,

677
00:49:47,525 --> 00:49:49,318
you must tell me.

678
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:51,529
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

679
00:49:53,614 --> 00:49:54,866
You may go.

680
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,627
It is foolish of you to make an enemy

681
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:10,298
of someone so powerful out of jealousy.

682
00:50:19,724 --> 00:50:21,392
You have ink on your shoulder.

683
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:24,771
You can erase that black ink
with white rice.

684
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:28,107
The two colors may contrast one another.

685
00:50:28,941 --> 00:50:31,569
But mix them together,
and they will get rid of that stain.

686
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,696
Those were some wise words.

687
00:50:34,447 --> 00:50:36,866
Where did you read that,
Your Royal Highness?

688
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,744
Somewhere.

689
00:50:39,827 --> 00:50:42,079
It is something you may see
on a highly competitive exam.

690
00:50:56,552 --> 00:50:58,429
Is my young master not here?

691
00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:04,727
I heard you were injured.
Are you better now?

692
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:08,272
Yes, thanks to you.
Thank you for sending me the medicine.

693
00:51:10,274 --> 00:51:14,362
Maidservant Kim invited me over
for dinner recently.

694
00:51:15,696 --> 00:51:18,783
Can you join us?

695
00:51:19,742 --> 00:51:20,660
Sure.

696
00:51:22,787 --> 00:51:25,706
Then I will set a date and tell Mu-deok.

697
00:51:26,582 --> 00:51:28,084
Do you know my maid?

698
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:31,212
There was a time
when I visited you but left

699
00:51:31,295 --> 00:51:32,922
without being able to see you.

700
00:51:33,714 --> 00:51:36,259
That day, she was in your room.

701
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,140
Do not go.

702
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:46,143
Do not go to your room and just stay here.

703
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:48,896
I will bring you your clothes.

704
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,024
What was that?

705
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,235
Was she making a move on me?

706
00:51:54,777 --> 00:51:56,320
What do you mean?

707
00:51:58,239 --> 00:51:59,365
It is nothing.

708
00:52:06,497 --> 00:52:07,498
Wait.

709
00:52:08,749 --> 00:52:10,793
Stay still.

710
00:52:11,752 --> 00:52:12,920
It left.

711
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,089
-Did it?
-Yes.

712
00:52:17,216 --> 00:52:19,135
-It has left.
-I was so startled.

713
00:52:32,189 --> 00:52:33,316
Mu-deok.

714
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,959
Mu-deok, we meet again.

715
00:52:55,379 --> 00:52:57,256
Take care of yourself.

716
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,674
I will see you at the palace.

717
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,092
Right.

718
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,274
What is it? Did you run here?

719
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:17,109
I did.

720
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:19,862
It took you long enough to visit me
after learning that I was hurt.

721
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:20,780
What is it?

722
00:53:20,863 --> 00:53:23,157
What could be more shocking
than serving someone else?

723
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,200
It is not that.

724
00:53:24,283 --> 00:53:26,243
The other mages were gossiping about you.

725
00:53:26,327 --> 00:53:27,495
I wanted to know the truth.

726
00:53:27,578 --> 00:53:29,914
I see. So you heard about it as well.

727
00:53:29,997 --> 00:53:31,749
Why rush over
when you know it is not true?

728
00:53:31,832 --> 00:53:35,127
Who knows? You even caught
a Golden Fish while I was away.

729
00:53:35,878 --> 00:53:38,047
You could have become
Master Lee's pupil for all I know.

730
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,257
What? That is definitely not true.

731
00:53:40,341 --> 00:53:41,384
Forget it.

732
00:53:41,467 --> 00:53:43,469
I even suggested it to you.

733
00:53:44,261 --> 00:53:45,888
I guess it cannot be helped.

734
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,848
How can I prove it to you?

735
00:53:49,016 --> 00:53:50,351
You said it could not be helped.

736
00:54:00,152 --> 00:54:01,153
See?

737
00:54:03,656 --> 00:54:05,074
I am not a woman to you.

738
00:54:05,157 --> 00:54:08,202
If you want to prove it,
go embrace that pretty lady.

739
00:54:09,578 --> 00:54:11,622
Then should I really do it?

740
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,875
Yes. Do it.

741
00:54:14,959 --> 00:54:16,627
You better not say otherwise.

742
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,087
Fine, do it!

743
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:54,999
You told me to attack

744
00:54:55,082 --> 00:54:57,460
when my opponent least expects it.

745
00:54:58,627 --> 00:55:02,006
I have followed your teachings, my master.

746
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,595
Fine. Well done. I am proud of you.

747
00:55:09,847 --> 00:55:11,015
By the way,

748
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,311
I heard you ran into her
in my room last time.

749
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,564
What about it?

750
00:55:18,647 --> 00:55:20,357
Is that why you stopped me from going?

751
00:55:24,153 --> 00:55:25,696
Did that happen?

752
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:28,032
I do not remember.

753
00:55:28,741 --> 00:55:30,826
Understanding you is much harder
than controlling

754
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,286
Lake Gyeongcheondaeho's energy.

755
00:55:33,746 --> 00:55:35,498
You were pulling me in, were you not?

756
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,503
Master, I am going to the palace today.

757
00:55:40,586 --> 00:55:42,463
The King invited Master Lee,

758
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:45,174
and I will be accompanying him.

759
00:55:45,257 --> 00:55:47,885
I had wanted to see the Queen
once again and it worked out.

760
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,179
Be safe.

761
00:55:51,472 --> 00:55:54,308
I will. I will tell you everything
once I return.

762
00:56:02,274 --> 00:56:03,317
Uk.

763
00:56:07,613 --> 00:56:08,906
I found this.

764
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:14,662
I just so happened to find it.
I thought I should tell you.

765
00:56:16,914 --> 00:56:17,915
Go.

766
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,603
Why would the leader of Songrim
look for me?

767
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:42,731
-Do you remember Mu-deok?
-Yes.

768
00:56:42,815 --> 00:56:45,818
He wants to know
about her time in Sari Village.

769
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:49,155
He could just ask her directly. Why me?

770
00:56:49,238 --> 00:56:50,197
She is here.

771
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,741
She is not. She is in Songrim.

772
00:56:52,825 --> 00:56:53,951
She is?

773
00:56:54,743 --> 00:56:57,580
What could a blind girl be doing there?

774
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:02,418
Master Lee wanted you two and Jang Uk

775
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:04,336
to accompany him to the palace.

776
00:57:05,504 --> 00:57:06,839
Uk too?

777
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:09,467
Is he all better now?

778
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,427
We need to leave right away. Get ready.

779
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:22,396
Please be careful at the palace.

780
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,857
The ice stone is there.

781
00:57:26,525 --> 00:57:28,110
I am aware of that.

782
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:31,363
Since they are shamelessly hiding it,

783
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:34,408
I have decided to be brazen
as well and make my move.

784
00:57:39,997 --> 00:57:42,583
The last time I was invited to the palace,

785
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,586
you were this little.

786
00:57:46,128 --> 00:57:49,131
I remember enjoying the candies

787
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,509
you had brought from there.

788
00:57:51,592 --> 00:57:52,760
By the way,

789
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:56,972
should you not prepare
a gift for His Majesty?

790
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,016
I have prepared one already.

791
00:57:59,099 --> 00:57:59,975
Yeom.

792
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,895
Send the gift over to the palace on time.

793
00:58:02,978 --> 00:58:04,522
Yes, master.

794
00:58:04,605 --> 00:58:06,190
Was it between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.?

795
00:58:06,273 --> 00:58:07,691
Between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., you fool.

796
00:58:08,275 --> 00:58:10,027
Right. I am sorry.

797
00:58:10,736 --> 00:58:12,738
Write it down so you will not forget.

798
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,157
You used to be easily distracted.

799
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:18,160
Now that you have aged,
you have become forgetful as well.

800
00:58:20,454 --> 00:58:21,580
Let us go.

801
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,749
-Goodbye, master.
-Goodbye, master.

802
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:27,628
I just cannot get used to seeing that.

803
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,366
Mu-deok.

804
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,869
The leader would like to see you.

805
00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:03,539
The leader?

806
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:13,424
Mu-deok.

807
00:59:26,645 --> 00:59:31,150
Everything about you
has been exposed by this man over here.

808
00:59:32,109 --> 00:59:35,696
I told him about your eyes.

809
00:59:40,284 --> 00:59:41,827
Will my cover get blown?

810
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:46,123
My lord, you see…

811
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:50,127
She was not the only one who lied.

812
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:55,132
Her grandmother begged me,
so I played along with it.

813
00:59:55,924 --> 00:59:59,303
Her family has always been poor.

814
00:59:59,386 --> 01:00:01,305
She lied about being blind

815
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:04,350
to avoid getting sold off to pay the debt.

816
01:00:04,433 --> 01:00:06,644
It is something like
those who pretend to limp

817
01:00:06,727 --> 01:00:08,687
to avoid fighting at war.

818
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:12,566
Why did you lie about being blind
when you were sold off to Chwiseonru?

819
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:17,613
She was planning to run away.

820
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,115
Sure, she was sold off due to the debt.

821
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:23,661
But it would have been easier
to run away if she pretended to be blind.

822
01:00:24,286 --> 01:00:26,622
-Right?
-That is correct.

823
01:00:26,705 --> 01:00:29,667
I was on the run
when I first met Young Master Jang.

824
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:33,045
He took pity and took me in.

825
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:38,092
I am sorry for lying, my lord.

826
01:00:39,301 --> 01:00:40,552
What I did was wrong.

827
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:43,347
Other than lying about that,

828
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:45,265
she has never done anything wrong.

829
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:49,061
She has always been
a great granddaughter and a kind girl.

830
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,991
Why did you lie for me?

831
01:01:04,076 --> 01:01:07,037
I just did my money's worth.

832
01:01:07,621 --> 01:01:08,914
Your money's worth?

833
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:14,002
But are you really not blind?

834
01:01:17,214 --> 01:01:18,090
But then again,

835
01:01:18,173 --> 01:01:21,635
I did find it odd from the beginning.

836
01:01:22,636 --> 01:01:24,763
-What?
-Despite being blind,

837
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,099
you always recognized
whoever was in front of you.

838
01:01:27,182 --> 01:01:29,226
You even knew
whether it would snow or rain.

839
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:34,314
Many villagers thought
you were lying about being blind.

840
01:01:34,398 --> 01:01:37,317
They were creeped out and avoided you.

841
01:01:38,485 --> 01:01:40,154
-I see.
-Anyway,

842
01:01:40,237 --> 01:01:42,698
come to the ferry inn
if you ever need my help again.

843
01:01:42,781 --> 01:01:43,824
All right?

844
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,492
Right.

845
01:01:46,034 --> 01:01:48,328
Did you meet with So-i?

846
01:01:49,413 --> 01:01:50,581
So-i?

847
01:01:50,664 --> 01:01:52,666
She is in the capital right now.

848
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,543
Some thugs were looking for her.

849
01:01:54,626 --> 01:01:57,045
I wonder what she did this time.

850
01:01:57,129 --> 01:02:00,424
She was the one who robbed your house
after your grandmother passed away.

851
01:02:01,258 --> 01:02:03,385
Do not get involved with her.

852
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:06,054
It seems you are also hiding things
Songrim does not know.

853
01:02:07,431 --> 01:02:10,642
You said you did your money's worth.
Who paid you?

854
01:02:10,726 --> 01:02:11,810
Ju-wol.

855
01:02:16,732 --> 01:02:18,233
You do not need to thank me.

856
01:02:18,734 --> 01:02:20,778
It was Young Master Jang's money.

857
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:30,120
If anyone asks or seeks Mu-deok,

858
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:31,330
use this money.

859
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:35,083
And of course, half of it is yours.

860
01:02:35,751 --> 01:02:38,670
I was not hiding something heinous either.

861
01:02:38,754 --> 01:02:40,672
I got my share as well.

862
01:02:41,757 --> 01:02:43,550
And I like you.

863
01:02:44,551 --> 01:02:46,220
I am truly grateful.

864
01:02:46,303 --> 01:02:49,014
So what really happened to your eyes?

865
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,187
Forget it.

866
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:56,980
You must have your reasons.

867
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:05,864
Had Uk not taken any measures beforehand,
Park Jin would have found out.

868
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:09,117
If I get caught,
I will be putting Uk in danger as well.

869
01:03:24,341 --> 01:03:26,260
Welcome, Master Lee Cheol.

870
01:03:27,177 --> 01:03:29,471
I am grateful
for your invitation, Your Majesty.

871
01:03:31,723 --> 01:03:33,642
Did that wench Shaman Choi

872
01:03:34,226 --> 01:03:36,186
tell you to kill me?

873
01:03:39,439 --> 01:03:41,650
Shaman Choi.

874
01:03:41,733 --> 01:03:43,485
Could that be who the Queen really is?

875
01:03:49,783 --> 01:03:50,826
Mu-deok.

876
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:56,081
That So-i you were talking about.

877
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:59,334
It could have been her who came by
looking for you a few days ago.

878
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:02,713
I heard she was dangerous, so be careful.

879
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:09,052
I will not be able to recognize her
since I do not know her face.

880
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:11,847
Should I have asked that man for details?

881
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:15,100
Come to the ferry inn
if you ever need my help again.

882
01:04:16,226 --> 01:04:17,769
Ferry inn.

883
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:28,155
Everything about you
has been exposed by this man over here.

884
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:49,551
Is Broker Kim from Sari Village here?

885
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:51,470
Yes, he just arrived.

886
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:53,555
He is in the last room
on the second floor.

887
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:02,648
Mister, it is me, Mu-deok.

888
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:30,384
Mister.

889
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:44,731
Master Lee.

890
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:47,609
If you were Master Seo Gyeong's pupil,

891
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:49,736
you must be well over a century old.

892
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:52,447
So how do you maintain
such a youthful appearance?

893
01:05:53,031 --> 01:05:56,159
How old do I look, Your Majesty?

894
01:05:57,369 --> 01:05:59,871
You look like
you are in your mid-thirties.

895
01:05:59,955 --> 01:06:02,582
At most, forty years old.

896
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:07,087
You are right. That is my biological age.

897
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:08,964
What?

898
01:06:09,047 --> 01:06:11,842
My soul is over a century old.

899
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:15,429
My body from birth
had turned into ashes long ago.

900
01:06:15,512 --> 01:06:18,181
This body did not originally belong to me.

901
01:06:20,392 --> 01:06:21,268
Wait.

902
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:24,771
Does that mean you have switched bodies?

903
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:25,856
That is correct.

904
01:06:26,898 --> 01:06:29,276
I am a soul shifter.

905
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,244
Your Majesty.

906
01:06:39,327 --> 01:06:43,457
Did you not summon me today
to find the soul shifter?

907
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:45,208
I will do just that.

908
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:49,171
I can recognize soul shifters.

909
01:07:00,515 --> 01:07:04,561
He knew from the beginning
that Mu-deok was a soul shifter.

910
01:07:29,711 --> 01:07:30,587
You must be the one

911
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,381
who killed him.

912
01:08:15,924 --> 01:08:17,551
What were all those bodies?

913
01:08:17,634 --> 01:08:20,053
What kind of life has Mu-deok led?

914
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:22,931
Mu-deok is hiding something

915
01:08:23,014 --> 01:08:25,809
-that must not be revealed.
-My goodness!

916
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:28,645
Instead, it will let you know by barking.

917
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:33,108
As expected, there are
more soul shifters within the palace.

918
01:08:33,191 --> 01:08:35,694
If it is revealed that King's Star
was created by sorcery,

919
01:08:35,777 --> 01:08:38,196
it will spell the end of Songrim.

920
01:08:38,738 --> 01:08:39,573
It is dangerous.

921
01:08:39,656 --> 01:08:42,242
You may not know her,
but she knows who Mu-deok is.

922
01:08:42,325 --> 01:08:43,493
We need Jang Gang.

923
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:46,079
We will have to wait
until he returns of his own accord.

924
01:08:47,372 --> 01:08:48,957
Mu-deok, what are you doing here?

925
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,251
I cannot leave Young Master Jang.

926
01:08:51,334 --> 01:08:54,504
Keep loving me to death.

927
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:01,845
