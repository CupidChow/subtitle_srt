1
00:00:53,296 --> 00:00:54,798
You poor thing.

2
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,884
Child, eat this.

3
00:00:57,967 --> 00:00:59,135
Child.

4
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:02,806
Go on.

5
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:08,728
I will bring you more meat.

6
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:10,730
Eat slowly.

7
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:52,313
Mom.

8
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,284
Geon!

9
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:52,832
I told you to reach out to me
if anything were to happen to him.

10
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,667
How could you let things come to this?

11
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:57,295
He will be fine
once he absorbs human energy.

12
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,880
He returns back to normal.

13
00:02:58,963 --> 00:03:00,840
Your son has run wild.

14
00:03:04,677 --> 00:03:06,179
I shall retrieve his soul.

15
00:03:07,138 --> 00:03:08,848
No!

16
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:11,392
You were the one
who turned my son into a soul shifter.

17
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:13,645
Either get him another body,

18
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:15,980
or feed him the energy of human souls!

19
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:18,024
Bring back my son.

20
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,276
Bring back my son!

21
00:03:20,944 --> 00:03:23,029
If word gets out that
I used forbidden sorcery,

22
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,615
we will both be doomed.

23
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:27,867
No…

24
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:28,785
Please…

25
00:03:33,164 --> 00:03:35,541
No, please. Geon.

26
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,045
Stay with me for just a bit longer.

27
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:40,797
My son…

28
00:04:53,286 --> 00:04:56,831
Why do the bodies of soul shifters
turn like rocks when they run wild?

29
00:04:56,914 --> 00:05:00,209
A crack forms when the bodies clash
with the souls they carry,

30
00:05:01,294 --> 00:05:03,338
which causes them to lose energy.

31
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:06,591
This is already the eighth soul
that has run wild.

32
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:09,552
I guess I should stop shifting souls.

33
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:11,971
You should go to the royal palace.

34
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:16,768
His Majesty has been asking
about the new spell

35
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:18,519
that you have been trying to master.

36
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:54,514
I hear…

37
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:58,392
you have been trying to master
a new kind of spell.

38
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:02,563
It is nothing grand.
It is just a trick I tried out for fun.

39
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:06,442
I know I cannot ask to live for longer.

40
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:07,693
However,

41
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:10,947
it saddens me that I do not have an heir.

42
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:13,783
I wish you a quick recovery.

43
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,078
I cannot do anything with this sick body.

44
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,039
But I might have a chance

45
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:24,794
if I were to live in a body
that is young and healthy.

46
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:29,715
There is no way for humans
to switch bodies.

47
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,263
But you can.

48
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:40,518
The alchemy of souls.

49
00:06:48,985 --> 00:06:50,862
That is forbidden sorcery.

50
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:54,240
If a soul clashes with the body,
it could even turn into an evil spirit.

51
00:06:54,323 --> 00:06:55,908
How could I dare

52
00:06:55,992 --> 00:06:58,536
move the soul of a king
to another person's body?

53
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,038
How about your body?

54
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,210
Not for too long. Just seven days.

55
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:08,671
Let us switch bodies for just seven days.

56
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:14,927
I heard you once gave a soul
a dead man's body

57
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,347
and that it lived in that body
for over half a year.

58
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:23,728
I am a king protected by the skies,
and you are the best mage in this land.

59
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,313
So what is there to worry about?

60
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:29,901
And after seven days,
you can turn things back.

61
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:36,157
You have mastered the ability
to do something

62
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,742
that only the best mages can do.

63
00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:40,870
Yet you are just wasting your time

64
00:07:40,953 --> 00:07:42,914
shifting souls into dead bodies.

65
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:48,961
Jang Gang.

66
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,380
Give this king a different body.

67
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,877
His Majesty and I have switched bodies.

68
00:10:43,594 --> 00:10:45,846
I shall make Do-hwa mine.

69
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,432
If she bears a child,
know that it is mine.

70
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:52,186
Do-hwa.

71
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:57,733
Do-hwa.

72
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:00,694
You are very beautiful.

73
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:14,375
No, that cannot happen.

74
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:21,757
That cannot happen.

75
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:23,634
No!

76
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:49,034
The energy of the sky
rules the wind, clouds, and rain.

77
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:51,162
This energy reached the ground

78
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,957
and created a huge form of energy.

79
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,418
A country was built around
Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,

80
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:59,462
a lake that embodied that energy.

81
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:03,174
The name of the country was Daeho,
due to the enormous lake it had.

82
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:08,512
Humans who had the power
to control this great energy

83
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:10,264
were called mages.

84
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:15,352
This story is about the mages of Daeho,
a place that does not exist

85
00:12:15,436 --> 00:12:17,396
in both history books or maps.

86
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:37,041
20 YEARS LATER

87
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:47,885
So you are Naksu,

88
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,970
the Shadow Assassin
who has been going around

89
00:12:50,596 --> 00:12:52,014
killing the mages in the city.

90
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:53,682
They call me Naksu,

91
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:56,060
for wherever I go,

92
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,311
heads fall to the ground.

93
00:12:58,062 --> 00:12:59,772
A beautiful name, is it not?

94
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,024
Kill her.

95
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:05,361
Shoot!

96
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:05,124
Do not let her get away.

97
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,292
-Capture her.
-Yes, my lord!

98
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,890
Let us go that way. Follow me.

99
00:16:32,443 --> 00:16:33,694
Over there!

100
00:17:23,786 --> 00:17:25,162
I will not die like this.

101
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:27,206
I cannot.

102
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:40,135
Goodness, you are so impatient.
I am coming.

103
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:57,486
What do you want?

104
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:02,741
Oh, my goodness!

105
00:18:27,432 --> 00:18:28,725
TAVERN

106
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,484
She is dead.

107
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,549
She does not have the blue mark.

108
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,930
This blue mark proves that
her soul has left this body.

109
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,808
Does that mean she failed

110
00:19:10,976 --> 00:19:12,352
to enter another body?

111
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:46,094
SONGRIM

112
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:50,474
One.

113
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:53,727
Two.

114
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,563
Three.

115
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,460
Yul, come here.

116
00:20:22,673 --> 00:20:24,216
Is she Naksu?

117
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,009
Yes.

118
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:30,555
This mark shows that
her soul has left the body.

119
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:34,017
Remember this mark.
When someone tries to switch bodies,

120
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:37,813
it leaves a blue bruise like this
right on top of their heart.

121
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:41,817
Does that mean her soul escaped her body?

122
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,404
She seems to have tried,
but I think she failed.

123
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:48,365
This proves that her soul
has escaped her body,

124
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:52,286
but we found no signs of her soul
having entered another body.

125
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:04,798
-It is a whistle.
-A whistle?

126
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:07,759
I once had a similar one myself
back when I had a pet bird.

127
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,139
Did she have a pet bird?

128
00:21:12,222 --> 00:21:14,224
I think she had it for quite a while.

129
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:16,810
It looks like it is an important item.

130
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:20,772
She may have been an assassin
who killed people like it was nothing,

131
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:25,235
but she was still human.
She must have had a story of her own.

132
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,746
A lot of people have
already seen Naksu's body.

133
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:38,040
Word will spread
about the alchemy of souls.

134
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:41,710
Has it been 20 years
since we have seen a soul shifter?

135
00:21:42,252 --> 00:21:43,253
Yes.

136
00:21:44,338 --> 00:21:47,758
The last soul shifter ran wild
and ended up killing many people.

137
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:52,095
I am worried that might happen again.

138
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,057
Uncle!

139
00:21:56,892 --> 00:21:59,644
Uncle, I heard Naksu was a soul shifter.

140
00:22:00,228 --> 00:22:02,147
Master Heo, did you see her too?

141
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,692
You seem awfully excited to start rumors.

142
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:08,445
Rumors have already spread.
I came as soon as I heard.

143
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:10,906
-Where did you hear it?
-At Chwiseonru.

144
00:22:10,989 --> 00:22:12,699
You are a mage of Jeongjingak.

145
00:22:12,783 --> 00:22:16,578
But instead of practicing,
you go to bars and listen to rumors.

146
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:22,626
Songrim Jeongjingak is not only a place
for mages to practice their spells,

147
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,586
but also a place to gather information.

148
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:28,006
Also, Dang-gu here will

149
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,258
follow in your footsteps

150
00:22:30,342 --> 00:22:32,427
and become the leader
of the Songrim household.

151
00:22:32,511 --> 00:22:34,346
He should know his liquor.

152
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:35,472
Now, tell me.

153
00:22:36,181 --> 00:22:38,475
Which liquor tastes best at Chwiseonru?

154
00:22:39,434 --> 00:22:42,395
I do not go there as often anymore
now that Uk is not here.

155
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:44,481
"Uk"? The son of Jang Gang?

156
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:48,944
Is he not learning how to write
at the village school in Yeongchundang?

157
00:22:49,027 --> 00:22:51,113
He got kicked out of there ages ago.

158
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:53,115
Right now, he is in Gisan.

159
00:22:53,198 --> 00:22:56,910
I sent him to receive training
from Buddhist Monk Ho-yeon.

160
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:02,082
Uk went to train
at a Buddhist temple this time?

161
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:06,545
Today, I shall end my training.

162
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:10,715
You have not even finished your training.

163
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,927
How dare you decide
to end the training without my permission.

164
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,387
You asked me to expand my knowledge,

165
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,306
so I read and memorized
hundreds of spell books.

166
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,142
You asked me to train my mind,

167
00:23:20,225 --> 00:23:22,769
so I patiently sharpened
hundreds of swords.

168
00:23:22,853 --> 00:23:26,773
However, you never taught me
any kind of spell.

169
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:29,734
The only lesson I learned here is that

170
00:23:29,818 --> 00:23:34,322
you have no intentions
of teaching me spells at all.

171
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:37,367
Now that I have learned a big lesson,

172
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,119
I would like to end it and leave.

173
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:42,831
The leader of Songrim asked me
to keep you here for three years.

174
00:23:42,914 --> 00:23:46,209
I know you are building a sanctuary
with the money I paid you in advance.

175
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:49,171
I will not ask for a refund,
so I hope it is successfully built.

176
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:54,301
Where do you think you are going?
I never said you could leave!

177
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:59,598
Did it sound like
I was asking for your permission?

178
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:04,269
You were conceived
through your mother's affair

179
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,021
and were abandoned by your father.

180
00:24:06,104 --> 00:24:08,607
So what would you know
about respecting your master?

181
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,443
I refuse to teach a guy like you.

182
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,654
I may not know much about
respecting a master,

183
00:24:14,738 --> 00:24:16,364
but I do know how to be a creditor.

184
00:24:16,448 --> 00:24:18,033
Say one more word,

185
00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:20,327
and you will not be able
to build that sanctuary.

186
00:24:21,953 --> 00:24:23,747
Because I will be getting a refund.

187
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:29,211
No one in this world will teach you spells
because of your father.

188
00:24:29,294 --> 00:24:31,838
Goodness, thank you for your concern.

189
00:24:32,881 --> 00:24:36,384
I will find my own master.

190
00:24:37,135 --> 00:24:40,263
Someone extremely powerful and skilled.

191
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,199
Mu-deok, are you all right?

192
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:03,013
Why did I have to enter
a body like this one?

193
00:26:06,016 --> 00:26:08,226
I am sure she was blind.

194
00:26:13,356 --> 00:26:15,150
But why is it that I see?

195
00:26:15,817 --> 00:26:17,527
Is it because I am a different soul?

196
00:26:20,322 --> 00:26:23,116
She did not even have a blue mark
showing I entered her body.

197
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,617
How unusual.

198
00:26:25,702 --> 00:26:28,747
Try to bear with the motion sickness.
We are almost there, Mu-deok.

199
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,250
"Mu-deok."

200
00:26:32,334 --> 00:26:35,837
She is a blind girl from the countryside
who got sold off to the fortress.

201
00:26:39,382 --> 00:26:40,759
Sit down. You will fall.

202
00:26:51,728 --> 00:26:53,188
Thanks for the journey.

203
00:26:54,064 --> 00:26:55,065
I will be off now.

204
00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:08,787
What is wrong with me?

205
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:10,705
I have no strength.

206
00:27:11,456 --> 00:27:13,875
Is this body not capable of
even climbing this?

207
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,128
My arms feel weak.

208
00:27:18,046 --> 00:27:19,297
Mister!

209
00:27:19,881 --> 00:27:21,508
-Help me!
-What…

210
00:27:21,591 --> 00:27:23,343
-Mister!
-Oh, dear!

211
00:27:23,426 --> 00:27:24,761
Mu-deok, hold on!

212
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:25,720
Mister!

213
00:27:25,804 --> 00:27:28,473
Turn the boat around! Go back!

214
00:27:28,556 --> 00:27:30,141
-My goodness.
-Oh, dear! Mu-deok!

215
00:27:30,225 --> 00:27:31,309
I will fall.

216
00:27:31,393 --> 00:27:32,435
Mister!

217
00:27:44,322 --> 00:27:48,410
Why were you hanging from there
when you cannot even see?

218
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:49,828
You could have gotten hurt.

219
00:27:51,663 --> 00:27:53,123
This is really bad.

220
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:55,041
My strength is gone.

221
00:28:00,547 --> 00:28:02,006
Is it motion sickness again?

222
00:28:02,674 --> 00:28:05,885
I am so worried about how weak you are.

223
00:28:06,469 --> 00:28:07,929
Weak.

224
00:28:08,012 --> 00:28:10,390
This body is
unbelievably unhealthy and weak.

225
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:14,227
I should not switch bodies too soon.
Let us stay as Mu-deok for now.

226
00:28:14,853 --> 00:28:17,147
I am sorry, Mister.

227
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,481
It is fine.

228
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:20,233
It is all because your body is weak.

229
00:28:20,984 --> 00:28:22,152
Let us fill ourselves up.

230
00:28:34,998 --> 00:28:35,832
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

231
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:37,667
Today, let us eat good food.

232
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:39,127
It is chicken. Enjoy.

233
00:28:40,462 --> 00:28:42,964
As an assassin,
I am sensitive to the smell of blood.

234
00:28:43,047 --> 00:28:46,926
Thus, I do not eat animals that shed
the same colored blood as humans.

235
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,678
-I will pass.
-Just eat.

236
00:28:56,644 --> 00:28:59,272
It is my first time eating meat.

237
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:01,775
It is delicious.

238
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:07,614
Eat up.

239
00:29:07,697 --> 00:29:11,326
I really did not want to send you there,

240
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:14,204
but it was the only place
that agreed to take a blind person.

241
00:29:16,623 --> 00:29:19,751
"There"? Where are you talking about?

242
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:25,673
An old woman took her in
after she lost both her parents.

243
00:29:25,757 --> 00:29:27,926
But she got sick and recently passed away.

244
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:30,512
The debt she had due to her illness
got passed onto her,

245
00:29:30,595 --> 00:29:32,472
which is why she's here to be sold off.

246
00:29:32,555 --> 00:29:33,515
I will be off now.

247
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:36,768
You cannot sell
this poor soul to a brothel.

248
00:29:36,851 --> 00:29:39,229
-I wish you well.
-But…

249
00:29:41,397 --> 00:29:44,359
I cannot believe he fed me chicken
just to sell me to this place.

250
00:29:44,442 --> 00:29:47,570
I will rip you to pieces
as soon as I regain my power.

251
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:50,156
You are way too skinny.

252
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,076
I wonder if you will become prettier
if you become chubbier.

253
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,578
Just give up.
Getting chubby will not make me prettier.

254
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:58,748
I am useless and not suitable
to work at a brothel.

255
00:29:58,832 --> 00:30:00,208
Sell me off to someplace else.

256
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,418
You talk very eloquently.

257
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:04,170
I heard you sing well.

258
00:30:04,254 --> 00:30:06,631
I hope you sing as well as you talk.

259
00:30:09,384 --> 00:30:12,262
You should wash first.
And doll yourself up.

260
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:28,361
You even know how to dance?

261
00:30:28,945 --> 00:30:30,071
Did it look like a dance?

262
00:30:30,989 --> 00:30:34,158
If my moves contained power,
your arm would have fallen right off.

263
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,039
I am older than you,
so you should speak in honorifics.

264
00:30:40,123 --> 00:30:42,458
You better treat
our customers with respect too.

265
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:44,919
You just wait. I will kill you too.

266
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:50,008
A lot of powerful people
come to our brothel.

267
00:30:50,592 --> 00:30:53,761
The Four Seasons of Daeho
are also regulars of Chwiseonru.

268
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:56,055
The four what?

269
00:30:56,139 --> 00:30:59,434
There are four different types
of beautiful people in Daeho Fortress.

270
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:01,603
And they are called the Four Seasons.

271
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:19,662
The daughter of the Jin family
who has the vitality of spring.

272
00:31:20,496 --> 00:31:21,414
Jin Cho-yeon.

273
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,807
The heir of the Park family
who has the energy of a hot summer.

274
00:31:39,891 --> 00:31:41,142
Park Dang-gu.

275
00:31:52,946 --> 00:31:56,282
The genius of the Seo family
who is as noble as the sunset in fall.

276
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:58,117
Seo Yul.

277
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:20,098
Then there is Jang Uk,
the successor of the Jang family

278
00:32:20,181 --> 00:32:23,685
who is as dazzling as the winter snow.

279
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:34,153
The Jin, Park, Seo, and Jang family.

280
00:32:34,237 --> 00:32:37,240
They are the most well-known
mage families in Daeho.

281
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:39,325
Their children are known as
the Four Seasons.

282
00:32:40,451 --> 00:32:43,079
Is that what they are called
in the fortress?

283
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:48,251
There is my summer prince.

284
00:32:53,131 --> 00:32:55,216
If he is the heir of the Park family,

285
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,593
he must be Park Jin's nephew.

286
00:33:00,221 --> 00:33:01,139
Park Jin.

287
00:33:04,684 --> 00:33:07,145
He was there that night too.

288
00:33:16,654 --> 00:33:17,697
Jin.

289
00:33:18,656 --> 00:33:19,782
Seo.

290
00:33:20,491 --> 00:33:21,701
Jang.

291
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,619
Park.

292
00:33:32,962 --> 00:33:33,963
The Four Seasons?

293
00:33:35,423 --> 00:33:39,218
Once I come across all four of you,
it will be the end of it.

294
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,724
May you greet your deaths
as beautifully as your names.

295
00:33:48,811 --> 00:33:51,481
Who are you here to meet today?

296
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:55,401
My uncle told me
to come and fetch someone.

297
00:33:55,985 --> 00:33:58,154
Fetch someone? Who?

298
00:33:58,237 --> 00:34:00,865
A trainee in Gisan

299
00:34:00,948 --> 00:34:03,868
humiliated his master and got sent away.

300
00:34:04,994 --> 00:34:07,497
I bet this is where he is hiding.

301
00:34:08,372 --> 00:34:09,999
Will you look at that?

302
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:13,336
He must have craved seafood
because he was stuck in the mountains

303
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:15,421
for so long.

304
00:34:15,505 --> 00:34:17,381
I guess he is in that room.

305
00:34:37,151 --> 00:34:38,236
Goodness.

306
00:34:39,403 --> 00:34:41,656
Thanks to you, my uncle has to go

307
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:44,742
all the way to Gisan
to beg for the monk's forgiveness.

308
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:49,580
Meanwhile, you are here
enjoying this damn crab.

309
00:34:49,664 --> 00:34:51,332
No, I have not eaten it.

310
00:34:51,415 --> 00:34:52,750
It is such a hassle to eat.

311
00:34:53,334 --> 00:34:55,670
I am glad you came.
Break the shell with your spell.

312
00:34:56,671 --> 00:34:57,922
Unbelievable.

313
00:34:58,005 --> 00:35:01,968
I do know how to crack the shell
and pick out just the meat.

314
00:35:02,051 --> 00:35:04,720
But maybe I should use that spell on you,
not the crab.

315
00:35:04,804 --> 00:35:08,224
Dang-gu, if that monk had been
kind enough to at least teach me that,

316
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:10,309
I would not have left that way.

317
00:35:10,393 --> 00:35:12,061
What good is it if you cannot do it?

318
00:35:12,145 --> 00:35:14,063
Your dad blocked you from casting spells.

319
00:35:14,147 --> 00:35:15,731
Then he should have helped me break that.

320
00:35:15,815 --> 00:35:19,318
That is what masters do.
They help their students.

321
00:35:19,402 --> 00:35:22,071
No one in Daeho is brave enough

322
00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:24,323
to go against your dad like that.

323
00:35:24,407 --> 00:35:25,992
But some live fearlessly.

324
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:27,285
For example,

325
00:35:28,244 --> 00:35:30,163
the Shadow Assassin, Naksu.

326
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:35,668
Do not be ridiculous.

327
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:39,005
I heard she is so skilled that
even the leader cannot beat her.

328
00:35:40,298 --> 00:35:41,632
She is dead.

329
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,136
Her soul left her body,
so that means she might still be alive.

330
00:35:46,637 --> 00:35:47,930
Who told you that?

331
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:51,225
Do you think I am here
just so I can eat crab?

332
00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:52,560
This is the fastest place

333
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:54,812
to hear everything that goes on in Daeho.

334
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:56,772
Pick out the meat already.

335
00:35:56,856 --> 00:35:59,650
Put those spells to good use
and pick out the crab meat.

336
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:02,987
Why can you not pick out
the meat yourself, you lazybones?

337
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,993
You look pretty now that you have washed.

338
00:36:09,076 --> 00:36:10,244
Let me put makeup on you.

339
00:36:11,454 --> 00:36:13,956
Ju-wol, I will just do it myself.

340
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,751
But how? You cannot even see.

341
00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:19,962
I have never done this in my life,

342
00:36:20,046 --> 00:36:22,131
so I need to prepare myself.

343
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:25,676
I would like to be alone for a while.

344
00:36:27,637 --> 00:36:29,889
Sure. Come out when you are ready.

345
00:36:41,025 --> 00:36:43,277
Being blind makes it easier
to fool people.

346
00:36:44,445 --> 00:36:46,072
I need money to run away.

347
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:50,076
Are these made of real gold?

348
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:53,120
This is jade.

349
00:36:53,955 --> 00:36:57,041
Mu-deok, try applying this new rouge.

350
00:36:58,668 --> 00:36:59,543
What are you doing?

351
00:37:01,087 --> 00:37:03,422
Ju-wol, what is wrong?

352
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,969
Can you see?

353
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:19,855
Catch Mu-deok! Catch the thief!

354
00:37:25,653 --> 00:37:26,946
It is too high.

355
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:36,205
That way!

356
00:37:59,979 --> 00:38:01,439
What are you looking at?

357
00:38:19,248 --> 00:38:20,374
You…

358
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:29,675
Do not make a sound.

359
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,388
I heard a blind girl
recently joined the place.

360
00:38:35,014 --> 00:38:36,057
But you can see.

361
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,811
They told me your name.

362
00:38:40,895 --> 00:38:42,938
I think it started with a "D"
or something.

363
00:38:43,022 --> 00:38:44,106
No.

364
00:38:45,441 --> 00:38:46,650
Oh, I remember.

365
00:38:47,568 --> 00:38:48,444
Mu-deok.

366
00:38:50,237 --> 00:38:52,531
Yes, I am Mu-deok.

367
00:38:53,407 --> 00:38:56,118
I know what you look like,

368
00:38:56,202 --> 00:38:58,496
so if you do not stay quiet until I leave,

369
00:38:58,579 --> 00:39:00,373
I will come back and behead you.

370
00:39:04,293 --> 00:39:05,336
What is so funny?

371
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:08,672
You have beautiful eyes.

372
00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:12,510
Cut the nonsense.

373
00:39:13,636 --> 00:39:16,639
Right, sorry.
Only your eyes are beautiful.

374
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:19,725
You must be crazy.

375
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:27,525
Mu-deok.

376
00:39:28,234 --> 00:39:29,527
Mu-deok!

377
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:33,739
Come on. There is not much in there.

378
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:36,867
Just…

379
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,869
take this instead.

380
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:43,374
Hey…

381
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:05,312
-What are you looking at?
-What? Nothing.

382
00:40:10,693 --> 00:40:11,652
Dang-gu.

383
00:40:13,237 --> 00:40:16,115
I heard Naksu,
the Shadow Assassin, uses Tansu.

384
00:40:16,198 --> 00:40:18,117
What do you know about Tansu?

385
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,703
I know enough.
I read about it in my free time.

386
00:40:21,203 --> 00:40:22,121
TANSU

387
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,540
You see, Tansu is

388
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:27,960
a type of swordsmanship
that only the best mages can learn.

389
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:30,838
You flick energy with a blade
just like how you flick water.

390
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:33,382
A single strike is enough to kill someone.

391
00:40:43,142 --> 00:40:45,478
But why do you ask?

392
00:40:46,145 --> 00:40:49,607
I am just wondering if this crab leg
almost could have killed me.

393
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,526
Give it here. Give it to me.
I will pick out the meat--

394
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:57,198
Listen, Uk.
You are aiming at a vital point.

395
00:40:58,782 --> 00:41:00,034
I could die.

396
00:41:00,117 --> 00:41:02,286
Yes, she aimed at my vital point
in just one go.

397
00:41:05,414 --> 00:41:08,417
But why did she roll off then?

398
00:41:14,048 --> 00:41:17,426
Why is it that this tiny body
keeps craving food?

399
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,762
If I do not eat, I only become weaker.

400
00:41:20,304 --> 00:41:21,639
I have no other choice.

401
00:41:32,316 --> 00:41:34,610
Now is not the time to fight.
I should hold it in.

402
00:41:40,366 --> 00:41:41,992
The mages of Jeongjingak are here.

403
00:41:47,414 --> 00:41:49,750
I heard an assassin
has entered Songrim Jeongjingak.

404
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:51,919
What fool would break into Jeongjingak?

405
00:41:52,002 --> 00:41:54,213
She aimed for the leader, but got caught.

406
00:41:54,296 --> 00:41:55,756
The assassin is a young lady.

407
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,299
My goodness gracious.

408
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:31,458
He would have seen my dead body.

409
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:33,002
He likely did not recognize me.

410
00:42:34,128 --> 00:42:37,756
I am sure he did not recognize
the whistle either.

411
00:42:47,141 --> 00:42:49,852
There are no signs of Naksu
having visited this place.

412
00:42:50,561 --> 00:42:53,355
I think she failed to find a new body.

413
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,192
Even if she succeeded,
she probably is not showing herself

414
00:42:57,276 --> 00:42:59,570
because she is facing a problem.

415
00:42:59,653 --> 00:43:02,448
An assassin with a revealed identity
must be discarded.

416
00:43:04,908 --> 00:43:06,869
We will have to
retrieve her body and sword.

417
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:09,204
Get rid of all everything
that has to do with her.

418
00:43:09,288 --> 00:43:13,250
What happens if she is still alive?

419
00:43:14,835 --> 00:43:17,212
She will either get killed
for being a soul shifter,

420
00:43:17,296 --> 00:43:19,548
or her soul will clash with her new body,

421
00:43:19,632 --> 00:43:21,258
and she will turn into a rock.

422
00:43:21,842 --> 00:43:24,303
I trained her to become the best assassin.

423
00:43:25,179 --> 00:43:26,430
It is a pity.

424
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:36,398
How much longer do you need?

425
00:43:36,482 --> 00:43:40,444
It is expensive,
so I need to take a closer look.

426
00:43:40,527 --> 00:43:43,822
I will not ask for too much.
Just pick a price and pay me.

427
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,076
Over here!

428
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:49,578
-It is her.
-What is going on?

429
00:43:49,662 --> 00:43:50,788
Take her away!

430
00:44:06,428 --> 00:44:08,931
Where am I? Did I get caught?

431
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,684
Then is this Songrim?

432
00:44:14,895 --> 00:44:16,271
Are you awake?

433
00:44:16,355 --> 00:44:18,691
Who are you? Where is this place?

434
00:44:22,736 --> 00:44:25,656
It is the house of Master Jang Gang,
the head of Cheonbugwan.

435
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,410
"Jang Gang"?
So this is the Jang family's house?

436
00:44:33,831 --> 00:44:38,293
I wonder why Young Master
brought home such a weak girl.

437
00:44:38,377 --> 00:44:40,879
-"Young Master"?
-That is right.

438
00:44:40,963 --> 00:44:44,758
Young Master Jang Uk paid money
to bring you here from the brothel.

439
00:44:44,842 --> 00:44:48,387
I heard you stole
his Jade Plaque at the brothel.

440
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:51,682
Take this instead.

441
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:54,935
Hey…

442
00:44:55,853 --> 00:44:57,604
Why would he bring me here?

443
00:44:57,688 --> 00:45:00,607
I was worried when he said
he was going to bring home a girl,

444
00:45:01,233 --> 00:45:03,026
but you put me at ease.

445
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,778
He only helped out of pity.

446
00:45:05,571 --> 00:45:07,865
Here. Get changed.

447
00:45:07,948 --> 00:45:09,158
Mu-deok.

448
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:11,243
-What is this?
-What do you think?

449
00:45:11,326 --> 00:45:13,120
It is your uniform as a servant.

450
00:45:13,203 --> 00:45:17,249
Also, you need to speak to me
using honorifics.

451
00:45:18,834 --> 00:45:20,419
Young Master Jang is weak,

452
00:45:20,502 --> 00:45:22,379
so he gets tired very easily.

453
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:24,715
Make sure you do things
as soon as you are asked.

454
00:45:25,299 --> 00:45:28,927
And always put on a smile
no matter what he says.

455
00:45:30,137 --> 00:45:31,221
Where is my answer?

456
00:45:32,389 --> 00:45:34,475
-Yes, ma'am.
-Good.

457
00:45:35,058 --> 00:45:38,479
He wanted to see you as soon as possible,
so get changed and go see him.

458
00:45:38,562 --> 00:45:39,646
Answer me.

459
00:45:40,355 --> 00:45:41,482
Yes…

460
00:45:42,649 --> 00:45:43,484
Miss.

461
00:45:45,194 --> 00:45:47,070
I would rather you call me "ma'am."

462
00:45:51,408 --> 00:45:52,576
"Young Master"?

463
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:55,454
Why would he bring me home?

464
00:45:58,665 --> 00:46:00,042
You have beautiful eyes.

465
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:02,503
Did he fall for me?

466
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:05,380
For this face?

467
00:46:07,049 --> 00:46:08,675
He has very low taste.

468
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:18,560
Anyway, it might be safer for me

469
00:46:18,644 --> 00:46:21,063
to live here until I fully recover.

470
00:46:22,523 --> 00:46:26,568
If he is head over heels for me,
at least he will treat me right.

471
00:46:27,736 --> 00:46:29,321
Then…

472
00:46:29,404 --> 00:46:33,200
I guess I will have to continue
living my life as Mu-deok here.

473
00:46:34,576 --> 00:46:37,496
Young Master. It is me, Mu-deok.

474
00:46:38,455 --> 00:46:39,581
Come in.

475
00:46:50,634 --> 00:46:51,552
Young Master.

476
00:46:51,635 --> 00:46:53,679
Thank you so much for saving my life

477
00:46:53,762 --> 00:46:56,181
and bringing me here.

478
00:46:57,224 --> 00:46:59,309
It just took a few men to drag you here.

479
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:03,730
-I am disappointed.
-I know it was rude of me

480
00:47:03,814 --> 00:47:07,859
to threaten you with a crab leg,
but I hope you will put that behind you.

481
00:47:07,943 --> 00:47:09,444
You sound a lot more polite now.

482
00:47:09,528 --> 00:47:11,572
I will do my best to serve you right.

483
00:47:12,281 --> 00:47:13,782
Fine, you do that.

484
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:16,243
Mu-deok, go and get me some water.

485
00:47:16,994 --> 00:47:18,161
Yes, Young Master.

486
00:47:25,419 --> 00:47:26,253
Gosh.

487
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:28,755
I am not thirsty. It is to wash myself.

488
00:47:29,506 --> 00:47:31,592
Oh, I see. I understand, Young Master.

489
00:47:36,138 --> 00:47:38,390
I will just take a bath
instead of washing my face.

490
00:47:45,105 --> 00:47:46,481
Gosh, that is hot.

491
00:47:46,565 --> 00:47:48,525
This is much too hot.

492
00:47:50,193 --> 00:47:51,612
Right, Young Master.

493
00:47:57,909 --> 00:47:59,411
Oh, gosh. It is cold.

494
00:47:59,995 --> 00:48:01,872
The water is freezing.

495
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:06,043
It is not freezing.

496
00:48:06,126 --> 00:48:08,503
It is. I will catch a cold
if I wash in cold water.

497
00:48:10,339 --> 00:48:12,132
-What is his deal?
-It is so cold.

498
00:48:12,215 --> 00:48:13,383
Did he not fall for me?

499
00:48:13,467 --> 00:48:14,926
What are you doing, Mu-deok?

500
00:48:16,136 --> 00:48:19,348
Yes, Young Master.
I will pour in some more hot water.

501
00:48:25,187 --> 00:48:26,021
It is salty.

502
00:48:26,897 --> 00:48:27,898
Too sweet. Too spicy.

503
00:48:27,981 --> 00:48:29,524
It is too long. What is this taste?

504
00:48:29,608 --> 00:48:30,859
I'm not going to eat.

505
00:48:34,321 --> 00:48:36,031
The water smells weird.

506
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,658
It smells?

507
00:48:38,659 --> 00:48:39,951
Bring me a new bucket.

508
00:48:43,038 --> 00:48:43,955
Get a different blanket.

509
00:48:44,915 --> 00:48:47,209
I want the blue blanket tonight.

510
00:49:09,564 --> 00:49:13,443
He does not do anything,
but he washes three times a day.

511
00:49:17,364 --> 00:49:18,532
I will kill him.

512
00:49:18,615 --> 00:49:22,244
Once I regain my energy,
he'll be the first one I kill.

513
00:49:26,415 --> 00:49:29,209
Young Master, I brought you cold water.

514
00:49:29,918 --> 00:49:32,337
-I brought…
-Forget it. The water has cooled

515
00:49:32,421 --> 00:49:33,880
to just the right temperature.

516
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,425
Good work…

517
00:49:36,508 --> 00:49:38,885
I mean, your work was all in vain,
Mu-deok.

518
00:49:50,063 --> 00:49:51,481
If only I had the power…

519
00:49:52,274 --> 00:49:55,527
If I just had a fraction
of the power I used to have…

520
00:50:07,664 --> 00:50:08,874
What is going on?

521
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:12,836
What is happening?

522
00:50:29,853 --> 00:50:31,021
What is so funny?

523
00:50:32,439 --> 00:50:33,356
What?

524
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:36,026
What is with that smile?

525
00:50:37,027 --> 00:50:38,111
It is nothing.

526
00:50:38,195 --> 00:50:39,780
The water is nice and cold.

527
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:42,032
Go fetch my clothes.

528
00:50:42,115 --> 00:50:43,366
Right, Young Master.

529
00:50:45,285 --> 00:50:46,411
Gosh.

530
00:50:52,292 --> 00:50:53,126
What are you doing?

531
00:50:54,836 --> 00:50:56,171
Here you go.

532
00:50:58,548 --> 00:51:00,509
You may leave. Get some rest.

533
00:51:01,176 --> 00:51:02,427
Yes, Young Master.

534
00:51:14,189 --> 00:51:18,276
That Spirit Plaque will allow me
to break the barrier and enter Songrim.

535
00:51:20,195 --> 00:51:21,822
But I cannot do that right now

536
00:51:21,905 --> 00:51:23,990
because I do not have
the power to cast spells.

537
00:51:25,617 --> 00:51:26,868
I should find my sword.

538
00:51:28,411 --> 00:51:31,331
I might get my power back
if I find my sword.

539
00:51:34,793 --> 00:51:36,253
With that Spirit Plaque,

540
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,631
I will be able to enter Songrim.

541
00:51:43,802 --> 00:51:47,639
SONGRIM

542
00:51:48,807 --> 00:51:52,060
How long do you plan to keep
Naksu's body at Jeongjingak?

543
00:51:52,727 --> 00:51:54,813
If she succeeded in finding a new body,

544
00:51:55,355 --> 00:51:56,439
Naksu…

545
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,859
will come back for her sword.

546
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:03,864
She will come here looking for her body.

547
00:52:05,198 --> 00:52:07,284
Let us see how things turn out.

548
00:52:13,957 --> 00:52:17,085
Maybe it is because
your father's room is always empty,

549
00:52:17,919 --> 00:52:19,546
but it never seems to get dusty.

550
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:22,424
I wonder when he will return.

551
00:52:26,386 --> 00:52:29,848
The colors in your mother's portrait
are starting to fade away.

552
00:52:30,473 --> 00:52:32,934
We should call a painter
to repaint the colors.

553
00:52:55,624 --> 00:52:58,084
I memorized all the books
you told me to read.

554
00:52:58,668 --> 00:53:00,712
Now, teach me how to practice spells

555
00:53:00,795 --> 00:53:02,881
just like how you taught Yul and Dang-gu.

556
00:53:11,473 --> 00:53:14,184
That sword belongs to your father.

557
00:53:14,267 --> 00:53:15,560
Take it out.

558
00:53:28,698 --> 00:53:30,784
Due to the spell that has been cast on me,

559
00:53:30,867 --> 00:53:33,370
I am unable to take out a sword
that has a spell on it.

560
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:36,122
You cannot even take out
your own father's sword.

561
00:53:36,206 --> 00:53:37,874
How do you expect to learn spells?

562
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:40,835
Why can you not open my gate of energy
so I can practice casting spells?

563
00:53:40,919 --> 00:53:41,836
I…

564
00:53:43,046 --> 00:53:44,422
cannot do that.

565
00:53:45,799 --> 00:53:49,219
Then find me another master.

566
00:53:49,928 --> 00:53:51,346
No master can do that.

567
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:54,724
No one in Daeho will be able
to go against your father

568
00:53:54,808 --> 00:53:56,726
and open your gate of energy.

569
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:58,269
Then are you saying

570
00:53:59,229 --> 00:54:01,106
I will never have
the ability to practice spells?

571
00:54:01,189 --> 00:54:02,148
That was

572
00:54:02,232 --> 00:54:06,403
the fate given to you by your father.

573
00:54:07,362 --> 00:54:09,239
Why!

574
00:54:09,322 --> 00:54:11,241
Why would he decide my own fate?

575
00:54:12,492 --> 00:54:14,869
No one even considers him
as my true father anyway!

576
00:54:16,413 --> 00:54:17,872
I will find someone.

577
00:54:18,957 --> 00:54:22,961
A master who will open my gate of energy
and teach me how to practice spells.

578
00:54:23,795 --> 00:54:25,588
I will find someone myself.

579
00:54:26,965 --> 00:54:29,342
Then I will take out that sword
and break it in two.

580
00:54:55,577 --> 00:54:58,038
I heard Young Master Jang
got expelled again.

581
00:54:58,705 --> 00:55:01,916
Why would the son of the great Lord Jang
always get in so much trouble?

582
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,710
He is not his son.

583
00:55:03,793 --> 00:55:06,129
Do-hwa, the most beautiful woman in Daeho,

584
00:55:06,212 --> 00:55:08,590
slept with another man and had Jang Uk.

585
00:55:09,174 --> 00:55:10,800
I doubt that rumor is true.

586
00:55:10,884 --> 00:55:13,970
Then why would he block his son
from casting spells

587
00:55:14,054 --> 00:55:15,972
and live his life like a vagabond?

588
00:55:16,973 --> 00:55:21,019
I wonder if he is really weak
because his father put a spell on him.

589
00:55:30,737 --> 00:55:32,697
The Spirit Plaque should be
here somewhere.

590
00:55:47,003 --> 00:55:48,463
Where is it?

591
00:56:13,822 --> 00:56:15,782
Why did I have to hide here?

592
00:56:15,865 --> 00:56:17,450
What will he think of me?

593
00:56:18,368 --> 00:56:19,619
What should I say to him?

594
00:56:26,126 --> 00:56:28,795
This was not what I had in mind
when I brought you here.

595
00:56:30,797 --> 00:56:31,631
Well…

596
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,926
You kept saying you were cold,

597
00:56:35,009 --> 00:56:37,053
so I was just heating the bedding for you.

598
00:56:37,137 --> 00:56:40,014
If you lie down right away,
it will be nice and warm all night.

599
00:56:40,098 --> 00:56:41,266
Is that so?

600
00:56:42,851 --> 00:56:44,018
How kind of you.

601
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,650
-Good night, then.
-Where are you going?

602
00:56:52,819 --> 00:56:54,195
You came to keep me warm.

603
00:56:55,947 --> 00:56:57,240
Keep my bed

604
00:56:57,907 --> 00:56:59,033
nice and hot

605
00:57:00,368 --> 00:57:01,494
all night long.

606
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,747
Heat it up.

607
00:57:09,002 --> 00:57:12,172
What? Does he really like me?

608
00:57:12,255 --> 00:57:13,840
Have I fallen for his tricks?

609
00:57:22,223 --> 00:57:23,099
Young Master…

610
00:57:24,058 --> 00:57:26,644
My body is not warm enough
to keep you warm.

611
00:57:26,728 --> 00:57:28,730
Ever since I was young,
I easily got the chills.

612
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:31,566
So my body temperature is always very low.

613
00:57:38,573 --> 00:57:39,782
All right.

614
00:57:53,421 --> 00:57:56,466
I do not plan on doing
what you want me to do.

615
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:08,686
Bring the brazier closer to me.

616
00:58:12,565 --> 00:58:13,733
The brazier?

617
00:58:14,317 --> 00:58:17,362
I just wanted you to bring
the brazier near my bed

618
00:58:17,445 --> 00:58:18,530
and keep it hot.

619
00:58:22,867 --> 00:58:24,327
Keep it hot.

620
00:58:30,959 --> 00:58:31,834
Here.

621
00:58:32,418 --> 00:58:34,295
This is too close.

622
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:37,090
It will be too hot.

623
00:58:37,966 --> 00:58:39,968
Oh, right. It will be too hot.

624
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:45,807
I will sell you if the fire goes out.

625
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:47,517
Keep the fire alive all night.

626
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,726
All right, Young Master.

627
00:59:00,613 --> 00:59:03,950
All right. Dang-gu is here.

628
00:59:07,453 --> 00:59:09,664
What is that? It is a whistle.

629
00:59:10,415 --> 00:59:11,249
Yes.

630
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:13,876
I swear I made this.

631
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,171
Oh, right. I remember.
You used to have a pet bird.

632
00:59:17,255 --> 00:59:19,090
Why? Are you planning to get a new one?

633
00:59:20,425 --> 00:59:21,634
No, not exactly.

634
00:59:21,718 --> 00:59:23,636
I just found this on someone unexpected.

635
00:59:24,804 --> 00:59:27,056
I wonder why she had it.

636
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,349
Maybe you gave it to her.

637
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:31,019
Maybe you forgot that you gave it to her.

638
00:59:31,102 --> 00:59:32,186
No.

639
00:59:33,062 --> 00:59:35,356
I clearly remember who I gave this to.

640
00:59:52,457 --> 00:59:55,251
Then go ask her.

641
01:00:02,091 --> 01:00:04,844
You are going to go at this hour?

642
01:00:04,927 --> 01:00:06,346
I need to check something.

643
01:02:01,586 --> 01:02:03,045
Who are those guys?

644
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,021
Intruders!

645
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:22,440
We have intruders!

646
01:02:22,523 --> 01:02:23,816
Intruders!

647
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:23,543
Go on.

648
01:03:54,574 --> 01:03:55,616
Out of the way!

649
01:04:36,157 --> 01:04:38,743
Yul, what is going on?

650
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:43,789
The Training Center is on fire.

651
01:04:51,756 --> 01:04:53,466
Who is at Jeongjingak?

652
01:04:53,549 --> 01:04:55,051
Master Yul and Dang-gu.

653
01:04:58,262 --> 01:04:59,639
Uncle, are you all right?

654
01:05:00,848 --> 01:05:02,058
The intruders all left.

655
01:05:04,226 --> 01:05:05,937
Jeongjingak is empty.

656
01:05:16,697 --> 01:05:18,115
-Find them.
-Yes, my lord.

657
01:05:28,584 --> 01:05:30,211
Who were those guys?

658
01:05:31,212 --> 01:05:33,130
Did the Danju send them here?

659
01:05:36,217 --> 01:05:39,595
The soul you need to collect this time
is Park Jin, the leader of Songrim.

660
01:05:43,391 --> 01:05:44,517
Right.

661
01:05:45,601 --> 01:05:47,812
He must have sent them here
to retrieve my body.

662
01:05:55,695 --> 01:05:56,946
Who is there?

663
01:06:30,146 --> 01:06:31,022
Young Master?

664
01:06:45,244 --> 01:06:46,704
What are you doing here?

665
01:06:50,124 --> 01:06:51,417
Because of your eyes.

666
01:06:52,585 --> 01:06:53,461
My eyes?

667
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:17,777
I knew the moment I saw you.

668
01:07:20,446 --> 01:07:21,864
You are my master.

669
01:08:05,616 --> 01:08:08,994
The soul shifter.
Naksu, the Shadow Assassin.

670
01:08:09,078 --> 01:08:13,290
I have been searching for someone who
can break this spell to call my master.

671
01:08:13,374 --> 01:08:14,917
I want you to be my master.

672
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,627
What original nonsense.

673
01:08:17,294 --> 01:08:20,089
They are going to catch
Naksu's men who are in here.

674
01:08:20,172 --> 01:08:23,634
We will find that soul shifter.

675
01:08:24,343 --> 01:08:25,845
Feign ignorance even if I get caught.

676
01:08:27,638 --> 01:08:29,390
Stay right by my side.

677
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:33,018
The people I have met so far
only wanted me dead.

678
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:38,816
You are the first person
who tried to save me.

679
01:08:38,899 --> 01:08:41,152
Even if we meet again
and come this close to each other,

680
01:08:41,235 --> 01:08:42,319
I will spare you.

681
01:08:46,574 --> 01:08:51,579
