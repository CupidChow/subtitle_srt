00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:00:03,387 --> 00:00:04,889
Throughout my life,

3
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:07,433
I spent most of my time
on this tree alone.

4
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:09,977
So I wonder what it was

5
00:00:10,061 --> 00:00:13,689
that made me wait
for someone to come for me.

6
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:15,733
Because we made a promise.

7
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:18,360
You may not have remembered me,

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,238
but you remembered
our promise to be together,

9
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:23,365
which is why you waited for me.

10
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:47,723
I asked you to carry me last time,
but you just left.

11
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,273
There.

12
00:00:56,982 --> 00:00:57,983
Are you happy?

13
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:03,906
If this is a brief chance
to keep the promise we made,

14
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,243
let us spend time together
like any other couple

15
00:01:07,326 --> 00:01:11,539
who have met after pining
and longing for each other.

16
00:01:18,504 --> 00:01:20,297
These chestnuts have already matured.

17
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:28,556
-You are right.
-Shall we cook them in rice?

18
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:30,141
Sure.

19
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:35,688
Do you remember throwing things at me
when I was cooking last time?

20
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:38,816
-I did?
-"I did"?

21
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,235
You even threw a knife at me.

22
00:01:41,944 --> 00:01:43,404
-Like this?
-Do not do it.

23
00:01:43,487 --> 00:01:44,864
I bet I threw it like this.

24
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,463
All right.

25
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:04,800
I will pretend as if this is nothing more

26
00:02:04,884 --> 00:02:07,052
than just another ordinary day together

27
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,056
and I will watch over you until the end.

28
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,729
We should make chestnut rice

29
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:19,398
since both you and Master Lee like it.

30
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:23,819
Master Lee?

31
00:02:25,487 --> 00:02:27,656
He is currently at his hut in Danhyanggok.

32
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,075
He was the one who brought me here.

33
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:49,428
Did the Unanimous Assembly ask you
to take the ice stone out of Jang Uk?

34
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:51,055
I told them I could not

35
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:55,434
because there is another soul shifter
he has yet to catch.

36
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,813
I see you have decided
to let him catch you.

37
00:03:03,776 --> 00:03:06,278
Then you should go to Danhyanggok.

38
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:09,949
I am also responsible
for how things turned out for you two,

39
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:13,494
and I cannot sit back
and do nothing like I did before.

40
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:14,411
It is time

41
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:16,830
that I do my part.

42
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:23,295
What is it that you have to do with us?

43
00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:28,425
I did nothing when you were
a young master and a servant.

44
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:31,762
I also did not interfere
when you were a master and a pupil.

45
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:33,806
However,

46
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:36,016
I cannot sit by and watch
as one must be hunted

47
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,601
and the other must be the hunter.

48
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,771
So I wish to put an end
to your current relationship.

49
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:46,986
You saved my life,
so I will accept whatever choice you make.

50
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:49,905
Then will you follow my decision
no matter what?

51
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:00,666
Then I want you two…

52
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:07,506
to have a wedding.

53
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,260
I shall be your witness.

54
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:13,595
I want you two to be officially married.

55
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:22,479
Let us get ready.

56
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:25,858
The weather is nice,
so let us get it done and over with.

57
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:26,942
All right.

58
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:41,665
Listen, you two.

59
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,876
Is this a matriculation ceremony?

60
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,462
Oh, do you wish to be my pupil?

61
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:48,714
Will you drink chaste herb tea

62
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:50,299
and practice chastity starting today?

63
00:04:50,382 --> 00:04:51,800
-No.
-No way.

64
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:53,594
This is a wedding.

65
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:55,596
You should be facing each other.

66
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,556
Oh, right.

67
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:02,728
A wedding ceremony
is how you announce your marriage

68
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:04,730
to the people around you.

69
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:07,191
But it is also to inform the skies.

70
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,735
"We have decided to be together."

71
00:05:09,818 --> 00:05:12,905
"Therefore, no one can set us apart."

72
00:05:12,988 --> 00:05:14,281
That is what the message is.

73
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,619
Now, Jang Uk of the Jang family and…

74
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:24,583
Come to think of it,

75
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,627
you have four names.

76
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:31,340
You were born as Cho Yeong,
but you grew up as the assassin, Naksu.

77
00:05:31,423 --> 00:05:32,966
Then you lived as Mu-deok,

78
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,677
and now you are Jin Bu-yeon.

79
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:39,056
I never had a chance to live

80
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,725
with just one name.

81
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:44,478
Which name shall I call you by?

82
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,982
The name that my parents gave me
when I was born.

83
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:53,779
I would like to be called Cho Yeong.

84
00:05:58,492 --> 00:05:59,576
Uk and Yeong.

85
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,663
Your name means "light."

86
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:04,665
And your name means "shadow."

87
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:06,625
Light and shadow.

88
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:09,962
It may be that you two

89
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:13,048
were fated to meet from the start.

90
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:18,804
Let us now begin the wedding ceremony
of Jang Uk and Cho Yeong.

91
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:32,401
It is a wedding drink.

92
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,373
If you drink that,

93
00:06:46,457 --> 00:06:48,041
it means we are officially married.

94
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:51,837
Go on. Drink up.

95
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:00,220
If you turn this off,
I will take you with me.

96
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:03,474
You and I…

97
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,018
have liked each other for a long time.

98
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:13,734
I shall always stay by your side
at this distance.

99
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,612
That is my promise.

100
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:21,241
I must be going crazy…

101
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:23,368
because of you.

102
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,622
I found another use for you.

103
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:30,334
After all, you are offering
to substitute for her.

104
00:07:33,295 --> 00:07:34,963
But this is my hand that you are holding,

105
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,259
and it will be me who holds you
and puts you to bed at night.

106
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:46,141
So when you are looking at me,
see me for who I am.

107
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:50,312
You look pretty.

108
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,440
You told me to see you for who you were.

109
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:56,235
That is what I am trying to do.

110
00:07:56,318 --> 00:07:57,319
I will also…

111
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:03,617
boast to everyone that you lit up
a dark path for me late at night.

112
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,578
Sure, go ahead.

113
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,418
I plan to find my own room.

114
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:18,173
I will find out who I really am
and decorate my room with my own traits.

115
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:20,801
I hope…

116
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:23,679
that makes it easier for you to find me.

117
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:28,016
I will keep you warm
and help you rest comfortably.

118
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:30,852
I just pine for you.

119
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,355
That is why I came to see you.

120
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,198
I liked you from the start.

121
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:47,536
I knew the moment I saw you.

122
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:49,830
You are my husband.

123
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,335
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

124
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:59,131
You have informed the skies
through this ceremony,

125
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:01,925
so I wish you a long life together.

126
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:08,223
Among all the married couples
I have seen through my entire life,

127
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:10,684
you two are the dearest.

128
00:09:31,663 --> 00:09:32,497
I promised you

129
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,584
that I would bring you up here.

130
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,794
You were right.
You can see the world from up here.

131
00:09:39,671 --> 00:09:40,714
It is nice.

132
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:49,389
Now that I look at you like this,

133
00:09:51,642 --> 00:09:53,727
it feels as if it has been a long time
since we last met,

134
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:56,355
but it also feels as if we met yesterday.

135
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,568
It feels strange.

136
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:15,791
It feels like I held your hand
a long time ago.

137
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:20,337
But it also feels like I only
recently held it for the very first time.

138
00:10:25,634 --> 00:10:27,219
Everything is clear to me now.

139
00:10:27,302 --> 00:10:28,553
Deep down inside,

140
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,932
I recognized you from the start.

141
00:10:34,393 --> 00:10:36,061
Just like when we first met.

142
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:40,315
I recognized the girl
with the blue marks in her eyes.

143
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:45,779
I recognized you.

144
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,175
Do you think Bu-yeon
is with Jang Uk right now?

145
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:10,762
Jang Uk will have gone to find her

146
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,764
because of what she said
at the Unanimous Assembly.

147
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:15,058
Why did you not stop her?

148
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,185
Jang Uk got rid of Jin Mu,

149
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:19,396
and Bu-yeon found the Jinyowon Plaque.

150
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,982
Regardless of anything,

151
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:25,569
the truth is that
they both protected Jinyowon.

152
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:31,366
I would like to think that
she is looking out for the two of them.

153
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,617
"She"?

154
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:36,746
I asked them
how they first met each other here.

155
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,375
They said someone had
opened the door to this place.

156
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,377
Do you really believe

157
00:11:42,461 --> 00:11:45,255
that her soul remained in Jinyowon
along with the ice stone

158
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,174
and was reborn as my daughter?

159
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:49,342
How is that even possible?

160
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:52,971
My existence is proof that it is possible.

161
00:11:57,058 --> 00:11:59,644
I am alive because I entered
the dead body of a young boy.

162
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,025
She may have done the same.

163
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:08,111
Let us say you are right
and that it is possible.

164
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:12,991
What could be the reason
that she chose to stay?

165
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:14,576
I am sure there is a good reason

166
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:19,331
why she chose to stay with the ice stone
instead of leaving 200 years ago.

167
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:23,460
It sounds like you know
what that reason may be.

168
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:29,007
She must have protected the ice stone
because it was going to be used one day.

169
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:35,931
Jin Seol-ran and my master, Seo Gyeong,
went through the Great Chaos,

170
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:41,061
and I fear that the same kind of chaos
may occur once again.

171
00:12:43,104 --> 00:12:44,397
The fire bird is safe.

172
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:47,901
Jin Mu is dead.

173
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,311
Heo Yeom stocked this place
with food and firewood

174
00:13:23,395 --> 00:13:25,939
knowing I would come back here one day.

175
00:13:26,898 --> 00:13:28,650
It will be enough to last you a month.

176
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,443
A month?

177
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:32,404
What is the matter? Is it too short?

178
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,576
I did not come
hoping to spend a lifetime together.

179
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:41,413
I just came to stay by her side
until the very last moment.

180
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:44,833
That could last a month, two weeks,

181
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,210
or even just a few days.

182
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:51,131
But I decided not to keep count.

183
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:53,842
I am going to believe

184
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,553
that we will always have tomorrow.

185
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,141
How many of Naksu's memories
have returned?

186
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:03,810
There is still

187
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:07,147
a memory she does not recall.

188
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:09,733
You said you were dying to know

189
00:14:10,525 --> 00:14:12,652
how I felt at that last moment with you.

190
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:18,617
That moment will probably be

191
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,411
the very last memory
that comes back to me.

192
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,420
When I recall that last memory…

193
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:35,425
I will give you a sign like this.

194
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:41,306
Then I will tell you what I remember.

195
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:45,810
It will be…

196
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,066
my last love letter to you.

197
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,907
In the past, I could not understand

198
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,201
why Master Seo Gyeong
kept his love letter unsent

199
00:15:01,826 --> 00:15:03,453
despite having written it.

200
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:08,083
But now I understand why he would
have been unable to send that letter.

201
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,919
That love letter was for Jin Seol-ran.

202
00:15:12,754 --> 00:15:17,050
I hope the love you have for each other
will somehow reach her as well.

203
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,932
Heo Yeom also got me new bedding.

204
00:15:24,015 --> 00:15:25,684
Maybe it is in storage.

205
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,313
Jin Seol-ran?

206
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,508
What is this barrier? Did you create it?

207
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:20,780
That is the fire bird.

208
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:35,712
The fire bird will dry out the world.

209
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:39,466
I hoped that something so tragic
would never happen.

210
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,012
But the foolish greed of humans
will lead the world to burn to ashes.

211
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:45,680
The fire bird

212
00:16:47,057 --> 00:16:48,141
is going to escape?

213
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:50,393
I just showed you

214
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:53,104
what is going to happen to this world.

215
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:57,859
I foresaw this happening
a very long time ago.

216
00:16:57,942 --> 00:16:59,861
You are able to see the future?

217
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:01,988
Who are you?

218
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:03,490
A priestess?

219
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,493
You used the yin-and-yang jade
to summon me, right?

220
00:17:07,077 --> 00:17:10,413
I could not leave, for I was scared
that the world would fall into ruin.

221
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:13,833
But I only ended up contributing
to the summoning of the fire bird

222
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:15,293
and making this world burn.

223
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:18,963
I am not capable
of stopping what will happen.

224
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:21,800
It can only be stopped by the man

225
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:25,011
who was born against the laws of nature
under the King's Star.

226
00:17:28,473 --> 00:17:32,727
I have been hiding under the shadow
that was created by your light.

227
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:37,148
Now I plan to cast that shadow aside
and step out into the world.

228
00:17:37,232 --> 00:17:38,650
Cast the shadow aside

229
00:17:39,943 --> 00:17:41,069
and step out into the world?

230
00:17:43,446 --> 00:17:44,364
Does that mean

231
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,991
you are Jin Bu-yeon?

232
00:17:49,661 --> 00:17:50,662
That is right.

233
00:17:51,746 --> 00:17:54,040
That is the name I was given
when I was reborn.

234
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,962
Jin Bu-yeon attracted your shadow,

235
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:01,297
used it,

236
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,342
and will make it disappear.

237
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:08,221
The world I foresaw
will come no matter what.

238
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:09,139
And when it does,

239
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,725
tragic events will occur.

240
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:26,823
Just as Jin Seol-ran helped Seo Gyeong
stop the Great Chaos a long time ago,

241
00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:30,535
you are the only person
who can stop the fire bird,

242
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:35,874
and Jin Bu-yeon must come into this world
to help you achieve that.

243
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:11,576
Jin Bu-yeon attracted your shadow,

244
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:13,828
used it,

245
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:16,080
and will make it disappear.

246
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:18,249
Did you meet…

247
00:19:20,877 --> 00:19:21,711
Jin Bu-yeon?

248
00:19:28,218 --> 00:19:29,219
Yes.

249
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:36,017
I ended up seeing something

250
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:41,231
that is inevitable.

251
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:48,029
According to Jin Mu's plan,

252
00:19:48,112 --> 00:19:50,323
we must first take the fire bird
out of Jinyowon.

253
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:53,117
Then we must confiscate
the Jinyowon Plaque

254
00:19:53,201 --> 00:19:55,119
by gathering another Unanimous Assembly.

255
00:19:55,203 --> 00:19:57,247
We need to keep Songrim out of it,

256
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,915
but how will we justify it?

257
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,376
We must use Jang Uk as our justification.

258
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,671
He disobeyed the King's command,
did he not?

259
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,214
That is right.

260
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,717
When should we gather
the Unanimous Assembly?

261
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:12,178
Are you all right?

262
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,540
Forget about the Unanimous Assembly
and the Jinyowon Plaque.

263
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:42,208
We have no time to waste.

264
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:45,628
We must go to Jinyowon at once
and bring out the fire bird.

265
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:46,796
We must do it now!

266
00:20:49,674 --> 00:20:52,760
Why did His Majesty gather the mages
of the Unanimous Assembly at this hour?

267
00:20:52,844 --> 00:20:54,304
I do not know why,

268
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:57,181
but I think one of the mages
is a soul shifter.

269
00:20:57,932 --> 00:21:00,268
He absorbed the energy
of one of the eunuchs.

270
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:03,771
A soul shifter is in the palace?

271
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:05,982
Then His Majesty is in danger.

272
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,151
-We must stop him.
-It is hard to believe,

273
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,569
but I think that soul shifter

274
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:12,113
is someone you know, Your Royal Highness.

275
00:21:12,196 --> 00:21:13,197
Someone I know?

276
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:16,451
Who?

277
00:21:17,452 --> 00:21:18,703
It is me, Your Royal Highness.

278
00:21:25,877 --> 00:21:28,838
You are the Queen's relative
from Seoho Fortress, are you not?

279
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:31,215
I see you fail to recognize me
because my appearance has changed.

280
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:32,342
It is me.

281
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:34,594
Your long-time master

282
00:21:34,677 --> 00:21:35,970
and Gwanju of Cheonbugwan,

283
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:37,680
Jin Mu.

284
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:39,432
Jin Mu?

285
00:21:43,227 --> 00:21:44,437
How can you be Jin Mu?

286
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,397
I shifted into another body
when I was in Gwido.

287
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:48,608
You shifted your soul?

288
00:21:48,691 --> 00:21:51,569
His Majesty sent someone for me,
so I was able to live.

289
00:21:51,652 --> 00:21:53,071
His Majesty saved you?

290
00:21:53,154 --> 00:21:55,782
I came back to help the King
and the Unanimous Assembly

291
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:57,200
achieve their goal.

292
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:58,117
Shut your mouth!

293
00:21:58,743 --> 00:22:00,369
His Majesty would never
see eye to eye with you.

294
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,080
Jin Mu is telling the truth.

295
00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:11,214
Jin Mu will be standing with me
and the Unanimous Assembly.

296
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:12,632
Your Majesty.

297
00:22:12,715 --> 00:22:14,592
Jin Mu, did you say you wish to take away

298
00:22:14,675 --> 00:22:16,594
the Crown Prince's Gold Plaque?

299
00:22:18,513 --> 00:22:19,514
Yes, Your Majesty.

300
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:24,936
His Royal Highness stabbed me in the back,

301
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,522
so I should return the favor.

302
00:22:29,941 --> 00:22:31,818
I shall take away
the Crown Prince's Gold Plaque.

303
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:36,572
You are no longer the heir to the throne.

304
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:45,206
Keep him locked up in here
until I say otherwise.

305
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,666
Yes, Your Majesty.

306
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,795
Your Majesty, you are being fooled by him.

307
00:22:52,964 --> 00:22:54,215
Your Majesty!

308
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:11,357
Jin Mu.

309
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:17,113
What are you trying to do by fooling
the King and Unanimous Assembly?

310
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,448
I am merely picking up where I left off.

311
00:23:22,994 --> 00:23:25,496
I shall head to Jinyowon
and bring out the fire bird.

312
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:50,646
Is Young Lady Bu-yeon

313
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:52,773
also not here?

314
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,277
Is she with Young Master Jang?

315
00:23:57,778 --> 00:23:58,779
Lady Jin.

316
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:02,033
What is going on between them?

317
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:05,995
I cannot tell you anything right now.

318
00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:08,915
Time will solve everything,

319
00:24:08,998 --> 00:24:10,583
so please have patience and wait.

320
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:14,295
Does that mean you know where they are?

321
00:24:18,007 --> 00:24:18,841
Maidservant Kim.

322
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:22,053
My mother still has not fully recovered

323
00:24:22,136 --> 00:24:23,930
after helping Young Master Seo.

324
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:27,433
She needs to rest, so please go back home.

325
00:24:30,811 --> 00:24:33,856
Lady Jin, the mages
of the Unanimous Assembly are here.

326
00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:35,399
What?

327
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:44,700
What do you think you are doing?

328
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:47,620
How dare you attempt to enter Jinyowon
without my permission!

329
00:24:48,871 --> 00:24:50,873
Apologies, Lady Jin.

330
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:55,461
We need to take out the artifact
that is needed for the lake's rite.

331
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,338
Open the door to Jinyowon.

332
00:24:57,421 --> 00:25:00,216
You came barging in here
at this late hour to get the artifact

333
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:01,676
for the lake's rite?

334
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,386
The royal family has approved it,

335
00:25:04,178 --> 00:25:06,138
so all you need to do is open that door.

336
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:07,306
I cannot do that.

337
00:25:07,848 --> 00:25:10,226
I cannot open that door
even if the royal family orders it.

338
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:14,188
Have you forgotten
about the Jinyowon Plaque?

339
00:25:14,272 --> 00:25:18,651
All the mages of the Unanimous Assembly
are here except for Songrim,

340
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:21,070
so we shall confiscate the plaque.

341
00:25:21,946 --> 00:25:23,489
Give us the plaque.

342
00:25:23,572 --> 00:25:25,574
This is ridiculous.

343
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:26,951
I cannot let you do that.

344
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:28,369
Enough!

345
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,333
I told you we have no time.

346
00:25:47,638 --> 00:25:50,349
-Mother!
-Make one more step and your mother dies.

347
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:53,311
Ho-gyeong.

348
00:25:54,603 --> 00:25:56,230
Your brother has shifted souls.

349
00:25:57,148 --> 00:26:01,485
Open that door before I suck out
all the energy of the Jin family

350
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:02,737
that you are so proud of.

351
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:05,740
Jin Cho-yeon!

352
00:26:08,117 --> 00:26:09,035
Open that door.

353
00:26:09,827 --> 00:26:13,164
Or I will drain your mother's energy
until she is as dry as firewood.

354
00:26:14,498 --> 00:26:15,374
Mother…

355
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,379
Open the door.

356
00:26:20,463 --> 00:26:21,464
Do it now!

357
00:26:24,842 --> 00:26:26,135
He is a soul shifter.

358
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,220
If he drains Lady Jin's energy,
she will die!

359
00:26:28,304 --> 00:26:29,430
Hurry and open the door!

360
00:27:07,635 --> 00:27:10,054
Quickly go to Songrim
and ask them for help.

361
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:11,931
Hurry.

362
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:16,769
Mother!

363
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:09,488
Mother, are you all right?

364
00:28:15,453 --> 00:28:17,246
Is that the fire bird's egg?

365
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,169
-What is that sound?
-What is that?

366
00:28:23,252 --> 00:28:26,213
Jinyowon must be collapsing
now that the fire bird's egg is out.

367
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:28,758
We must leave now.

368
00:28:38,642 --> 00:28:39,643
Ho-gyeong.

369
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:44,857
I could have absorbed all your energy,
but I could not bear to.

370
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:48,235
Anything that belongs to Jinyowon
makes me sick to my stomach.

371
00:28:53,991 --> 00:28:55,075
Mother.

372
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:56,619
Your wound is deep.

373
00:28:58,662 --> 00:29:00,664
We cannot let them take the fire bird.

374
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:04,168
Go to Songrim right now
and ask them for help.

375
00:29:06,921 --> 00:29:08,547
Jin Cho-yeon! Go now!

376
00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:09,465
Hurry!

377
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:12,218
Yes, Mother.

378
00:29:31,612 --> 00:29:32,655
Jinyowon…

379
00:29:33,489 --> 00:29:34,740
is collapsing.

380
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:46,919
No.

381
00:29:47,545 --> 00:29:48,546
No…

382
00:29:56,178 --> 00:29:57,012
Lady Jin.

383
00:29:58,639 --> 00:30:01,058
Lady Jin, are you all right?

384
00:30:01,141 --> 00:30:04,395
Please take me inside Jinyowon.

385
00:30:04,478 --> 00:30:06,313
If Jinyowon collapses,

386
00:30:06,397 --> 00:30:09,900
all the relics inside will escape.

387
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,863
I must use my divine powers
to keep them there.

388
00:30:22,496 --> 00:30:23,414
Hold onto me.

389
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:26,250
I will take you inside.

390
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:46,896
My lord.

391
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,732
-Young Master Park.
-Are you all right?

392
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:52,401
The mages of the Unanimous Assembly
took the fire bird.

393
00:30:53,444 --> 00:30:54,695
Jinyowon is going to collapse.

394
00:30:58,574 --> 00:31:00,743
I will check on Jinyowon.

395
00:31:01,577 --> 00:31:03,662
Go and follow the mages
who took the fire bird.

396
00:31:04,413 --> 00:31:06,707
-Yes, my lord.
-The fire bird is a dangerous relic,

397
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,334
so I shall go with Young Master Park.

398
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:10,461
My mother is severely injured.

399
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:13,088
Please help her, Lord Park.

400
00:31:13,881 --> 00:31:14,715
All right.

401
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:22,181
Uncle.

402
00:31:37,488 --> 00:31:38,697
Where is Lady Jin?

403
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,450
She went inside
to keep the relics from escaping.

404
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:44,036
Maidservant Kim went in there with her.

405
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,329
Maidservant Kim?

406
00:31:47,414 --> 00:31:49,375
Maidservant Kim is inside Jinyowon?

407
00:31:57,841 --> 00:31:59,051
Maidservant Kim!

408
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:01,512
Maidservant Kim, are you in there?

409
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,848
Lord Park, I am in here!

410
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:13,941
The relics are escaping!

411
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:15,734
If it collapses,

412
00:32:15,818 --> 00:32:18,362
all the other dangerous relics
will escape as well!

413
00:32:20,364 --> 00:32:21,532
I must seal the door.

414
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:24,201
Maidservant Kim, hurry up and leave.

415
00:32:24,284 --> 00:32:25,577
If you do not, you will die.

416
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:26,620
What?

417
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:30,749
The relics are starting to escape.

418
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:32,376
I must seal the door!

419
00:32:34,336 --> 00:32:35,170
What about you?

420
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,635
Maidservant Kim!

421
00:32:48,642 --> 00:32:50,185
It is going to collapse soon!

422
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:54,189
If we do not seal the door,
we will not be able to stop the relics!

423
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:55,107
No!

424
00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:58,235
I cannot seal the door.
Maidservant Kim is still…

425
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:04,366
My wife is still in there.

426
00:33:08,996 --> 00:33:10,080
My lord!

427
00:33:10,748 --> 00:33:11,582
Seal…

428
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:13,792
the door.

429
00:33:27,723 --> 00:33:29,475
Maidservant Kim!

430
00:33:32,853 --> 00:33:35,105
We cannot let this place collapse.

431
00:33:36,273 --> 00:33:37,107
So please…

432
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:39,735
seal the door.

433
00:33:45,783 --> 00:33:47,451
I understand.

434
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,496
My lord.

435
00:33:51,497 --> 00:33:52,664
I will be all right.

436
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:56,460
So seal the door.

437
00:33:58,087 --> 00:33:59,254
Hurry!

438
00:34:00,297 --> 00:34:02,591
My lord! It is about to collapse!

439
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,710
Even if you decide to seal that door,

440
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:43,048
I know how heartbreaking
it will be for you,

441
00:34:43,632 --> 00:34:45,300
so it does not upset me so much.

442
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:53,285
I do not mind it.

443
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:57,789
Yeon…

444
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:04,379
Yeon…

445
00:36:36,078 --> 00:36:37,537
Lord Park Jin.

446
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,623
Do not fall into despair.

447
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:43,001
You still have a chance to save her.

448
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:47,839
I will give you the power
to save the person you love.

449
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:13,865
Your Majesty…

450
00:37:15,158 --> 00:37:16,535
is this what you

451
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:20,080
and the Unanimous Assembly both want?

452
00:37:20,163 --> 00:37:21,456
I told you.

453
00:37:22,249 --> 00:37:24,543
Everyone wants to share
the power of the ice stone.

454
00:37:24,626 --> 00:37:27,296
It would be greedy of Songrim
to keep it for themselves.

455
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:31,466
The power should be divided
among the powerful mage families of Daeho

456
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,845
and used wisely through common consent.

457
00:37:34,928 --> 00:37:36,305
So you plan to awaken

458
00:37:37,806 --> 00:37:42,227
the dangerous fire bird
just to achieve that?

459
00:37:42,311 --> 00:37:44,646
The lake's rite will bring us rain

460
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,315
and help us get the ice stone.

461
00:37:47,649 --> 00:37:49,026
Then we will seal it back.

462
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:53,071
What about the world
that will burn to ashes because of it?

463
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:55,657
Does that not matter to you?

464
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,369
All things require sacrifice.

465
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,997
Worrying about insignificant things

466
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,333
only prevents us
from achieving what we want.

467
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:06,376
Do you not wish

468
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:08,462
to save Maidservant Kim?

469
00:38:09,963 --> 00:38:12,382
Do not be a hypocrite
and pretend that is not what you want.

470
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:19,973
Evil…

471
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:24,895
always does what it wants
without ever stopping.

472
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:27,939
But why is it that virtue

473
00:38:29,232 --> 00:38:33,320
always needs to prove itself
over and over again?

474
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:37,783
Yes.

475
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,951
I do wish to save her.

476
00:38:41,828 --> 00:38:45,123
I would do anything to save her,
even if it meant

477
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:47,459
I would lose my sanity.

478
00:38:49,711 --> 00:38:50,796
But even so,

479
00:38:52,422 --> 00:38:53,256
I will…

480
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:58,887
stop you from getting what you want.

481
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,891
Not a single one of you

482
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:06,436
has the right to laugh at me…

483
00:39:09,856 --> 00:39:11,233
and call me…

484
00:39:15,112 --> 00:39:16,154
a hypocrite.

485
00:39:51,106 --> 00:39:52,399
Stop right now…

486
00:39:56,778 --> 00:39:59,322
or I will break the barrier
of the fire bird.

487
00:41:16,149 --> 00:41:18,693
This place is going to burn down.

488
00:41:19,402 --> 00:41:20,570
We need to leave.

489
00:41:30,914 --> 00:41:32,832
He fought against
the representatives of eight families

490
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:34,084
and still made it this far.

491
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:36,795
He really was a highly skilled mage.

492
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,255
What a waste.

493
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:42,133
If he held hands with us,
I would have helped him shift souls.

494
00:41:42,217 --> 00:41:44,177
But he willingly chose death,

495
00:41:44,261 --> 00:41:45,845
so there is nothing we can do.

496
00:43:05,175 --> 00:43:06,676
Lord Park!

497
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:11,640
-Lord Park!
-Lord Park!

498
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,227
-Lady Jin!
-Lord Park!

499
00:43:18,146 --> 00:43:21,441
Lord Park!

500
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:30,659
Uk.

501
00:43:31,701 --> 00:43:32,702
Uk…

502
00:43:32,786 --> 00:43:34,871
Uk, Jin is…

503
00:43:34,954 --> 00:43:36,289
Jin is…

504
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:41,586
-Lady Jin!
-Lord Park!

505
00:44:23,086 --> 00:44:24,129
Last night,

506
00:44:25,338 --> 00:44:27,132
the fire bird was taken from Jinyowon.

507
00:44:27,757 --> 00:44:30,260
Lady Jin and Maidservant Kim
went inside Jinyowon

508
00:44:30,343 --> 00:44:32,637
in an attempt
to stop the relics from escaping…

509
00:44:35,056 --> 00:44:36,141
and passed away.

510
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:40,478
Not even Jin Cho-yeon could open
the collapsed door to Jinyowon

511
00:44:41,396 --> 00:44:43,106
so we could not collect their bodies.

512
00:44:43,189 --> 00:44:44,232
Because of that…

513
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:47,277
their coffins are empty.

514
00:44:47,944 --> 00:44:51,573
As for Lord Park, he tried to stop them
from breaking the fire bird's barrier,

515
00:44:53,074 --> 00:44:54,742
but the fire bird's energy
set the place on fire,

516
00:44:55,743 --> 00:44:56,911
and he passed away there.

517
00:44:58,288 --> 00:44:59,789
The place completely burned down.

518
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:02,542
The only thing
we found there was his sword.

519
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:05,336
I was locked up
after they took away my Gold Plaque.

520
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:08,631
I narrowly escaped
when the fire broke out.

521
00:45:09,299 --> 00:45:11,259
My father, the King of this country,

522
00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:14,387
is with the Unanimous Assembly.

523
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:15,889
This all happened

524
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:20,894
because Jin Mu was able
to shift his soul into Seo Yun-o's body.

525
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:24,022
I would barge into Cheonbugwan
right this instant,

526
00:45:25,482 --> 00:45:27,317
but they have the fire bird.

527
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:31,571
We cannot make rash decisions.

528
00:45:31,654 --> 00:45:34,157
If people find out
that the fire bird got out,

529
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,575
there will be extreme chaos.

530
00:45:35,658 --> 00:45:37,994
Let us quietly hold their funerals.

531
00:45:38,077 --> 00:45:40,330
Then we must stop them
from waking the fire bird.

532
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:42,916
The fire bird will awaken.

533
00:45:46,002 --> 00:45:46,836
I was told that

534
00:45:47,754 --> 00:45:49,464
it is going to happen no matter what.

535
00:45:51,633 --> 00:45:52,592
However…

536
00:45:55,803 --> 00:45:57,222
these three did not pass away.

537
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:04,812
If the disaster created
by human greed was foreseen,

538
00:46:04,896 --> 00:46:07,732
the will to stop it can become a variable…

539
00:46:09,943 --> 00:46:11,528
and change the outcome.

540
00:46:29,546 --> 00:46:31,297
Jin will be all right.

541
00:46:33,341 --> 00:46:34,467
Do not cry too much.

542
00:46:35,051 --> 00:46:35,885
All right.

543
00:46:50,316 --> 00:46:53,319
Lady Jin, you have used up
too much of your energy.

544
00:46:55,738 --> 00:46:57,240
Not only did they take the fire bird,

545
00:46:58,908 --> 00:47:01,286
but I also failed to stop all the relics…

546
00:47:03,204 --> 00:47:04,581
from escaping Jinyowon.

547
00:47:04,664 --> 00:47:07,584
You put your life at risk
and did your best.

548
00:47:10,336 --> 00:47:12,505
Was it Bu-yeon who entered Jinyowon…

549
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,216
while it was collapsing?

550
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,301
Yes.

551
00:47:17,176 --> 00:47:19,721
Jinyowon's door was built
by Jin Seol-ran as well.

552
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:25,059
Bu-yeon created a door that allowed her
to enter Jinyowon from Danhyanggok.

553
00:47:32,692 --> 00:47:36,988
While she entered Jinyowon
and stopped it from collapsing,

554
00:47:37,572 --> 00:47:41,367
I followed her instructions
and went to find the fire bird.

555
00:47:44,412 --> 00:47:45,997
I could not find the fire bird.

556
00:47:47,373 --> 00:47:49,208
But fortunately, I was able to save Jin.

557
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,088
Does that mean Naksu no longer lives

558
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:57,133
in that body?

559
00:47:57,216 --> 00:47:58,468
She left the body,

560
00:47:59,594 --> 00:48:02,513
which led Bu-yeon
to completely regain her divine powers.

561
00:48:10,563 --> 00:48:12,357
It took you so long
to find each other again.

562
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:16,819
But you were not even given
a full day together.

563
00:48:40,259 --> 00:48:41,552
The yin-and-yang jade

564
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:44,722
is shared by couples
in order to stay together.

565
00:48:45,306 --> 00:48:46,307
So we can no longer…

566
00:48:49,644 --> 00:48:51,521
be sharing this.

567
00:49:21,175 --> 00:49:22,677
When I recall that last memory…

568
00:49:24,846 --> 00:49:26,347
I will give you a sign like this.

569
00:49:34,731 --> 00:49:35,857
I guess we were…

570
00:49:38,484 --> 00:49:40,570
never fated to recognize each other
at first sight.

571
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:44,282
My birth led to your father's death.

572
00:49:46,075 --> 00:49:47,702
Then you killed me to avenge him.

573
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:49,954
You are right.

574
00:49:51,038 --> 00:49:52,874
Judging by the fate that we share…

575
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:56,335
we probably should not have met.

576
00:49:57,253 --> 00:49:58,171
But…

577
00:50:00,089 --> 00:50:01,466
fate was not what brought us…

578
00:50:02,759 --> 00:50:04,552
to recognize each other at first sight.

579
00:50:06,053 --> 00:50:06,888
We…

580
00:50:08,014 --> 00:50:11,601
lightened up each other's lives
when we needed each other the most.

581
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,228
We embraced the shadows that came with it…

582
00:50:16,022 --> 00:50:17,774
and chose to love each other.

583
00:50:19,776 --> 00:50:20,693
So now…

584
00:50:23,029 --> 00:50:24,405
there is only one reply I can give you

585
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,869
in our last moment together.

586
00:50:39,462 --> 00:50:40,421
I love you.

587
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:03,087
Songrim is mourning,
and the fire bird is in our hands.

588
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:05,965
Neither Jang Uk nor Songrim
will be able to do anything now.

589
00:52:06,674 --> 00:52:09,969
Tonight, I will wake the fire bird
and perform the lake's rite.

590
00:52:10,052 --> 00:52:13,264
Then after tonight, I will be able to use
the power of the ice stone

591
00:52:13,347 --> 00:52:15,975
and finally abandon this weak, ill body.

592
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:20,771
People could show up to hinder our plan,

593
00:52:20,855 --> 00:52:23,024
so please gather all the guards
protecting Daeho Fortress

594
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:24,650
and have them protect Cheonbugwan.

595
00:52:24,734 --> 00:52:27,612
I will send my army to Cheonbugwan.

596
00:52:27,695 --> 00:52:29,572
I want you to safely awaken the fire bird

597
00:52:30,156 --> 00:52:31,991
and bring me the ice stone.

598
00:52:37,997 --> 00:52:39,373
Your Royal Highness,

599
00:52:39,457 --> 00:52:41,876
please stop the King
from mobilizing his army.

600
00:52:44,378 --> 00:52:48,633
But I no longer have the Gold Plaque
that gives me power over the army.

601
00:52:54,931 --> 00:52:55,806
Use this.

602
00:52:57,683 --> 00:52:59,518
This was left for you by the late king.

603
00:53:00,853 --> 00:53:02,480
This country does not need a king

604
00:53:02,563 --> 00:53:06,025
who does not care
whether or not the world burns to ashes.

605
00:53:07,735 --> 00:53:09,612
It needs a king who wishes to stop it.

606
00:53:19,538 --> 00:53:21,499
I already stole your King's Star.

607
00:53:21,582 --> 00:53:24,043
Now I will even be using your Gold Plaque.

608
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:25,670
Jang Uk.

609
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:31,884
Have you really never dreamed of
becoming the most powerful person

610
00:53:32,927 --> 00:53:33,761
in this world?

611
00:53:36,263 --> 00:53:37,890
I have already climbed

612
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:41,852
to the very peak of this world
with the person…

613
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:44,355
I made that promise with.

614
00:53:46,565 --> 00:53:47,483
That is…

615
00:53:50,695 --> 00:53:51,821
more than enough for me.

616
00:54:05,751 --> 00:54:07,795
While we perform the lake's rite,

617
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:11,465
the King will send his army
to Cheonbugwan and protect it.

618
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:13,509
Jang Uk and Songrim might come to stop us.

619
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,762
What are you worried about?
We have the fire bird.

620
00:54:16,846 --> 00:54:18,055
You saw Park Jin.

621
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:21,350
He could not do anything
despite his strength and power.

622
00:54:21,434 --> 00:54:24,270
I guess you are right.
Once we break the fire bird's barrier,

623
00:54:24,353 --> 00:54:26,772
Jang Uk and Songrim will become helpless.

624
00:54:26,856 --> 00:54:28,566
Awakening the fire bird is dangerous.

625
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:32,278
If the flames burst toward us
while we break the barrier,

626
00:54:32,361 --> 00:54:34,864
we will instantly be reduced to ashes.

627
00:54:34,947 --> 00:54:37,283
If the fire bird fails to fly
after being disturbed

628
00:54:37,366 --> 00:54:39,326
and its energy of fire bursts…

629
00:54:41,954 --> 00:54:43,706
all of Daeho Fortress will burn.

630
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:46,125
They will not be able to do anything…

631
00:54:49,628 --> 00:54:51,130
fearing that the fire bird might awaken.

632
00:54:58,345 --> 00:55:01,182
I am going to go to Cheonbugwan
and awaken the fire bird.

633
00:55:03,893 --> 00:55:06,896
You are going to awaken the fire bird,
not stop it from awakening?

634
00:55:06,979 --> 00:55:09,607
If the awakening
of the fire bird is inevitable,

635
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:13,277
it is better to let it happen
while we still have control over it

636
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,821
so we can change the outcome.

637
00:55:16,822 --> 00:55:18,240
At the place where the energy of the sky

638
00:55:18,324 --> 00:55:20,451
reached the ground
and created a huge form of energy,

639
00:55:20,534 --> 00:55:23,079
I will get rid of the fire bird
that is filled with the energy of fire.

640
00:55:23,162 --> 00:55:24,288
In order to do that,

641
00:55:25,372 --> 00:55:26,665
I must awaken the fire bird.

642
00:55:44,809 --> 00:55:47,103
I checked the energy of the sky
through the constellation basin.

643
00:55:47,186 --> 00:55:50,231
The energy of fire will be strongest
between 7 and 9 p.m. tonight.

644
00:55:50,314 --> 00:55:54,151
Once that time comes,
I shall begin the lake's rite.

645
00:56:04,495 --> 00:56:08,707
Cheonbugwan will begin performing
the rite between 7 and 9 p.m. tonight.

646
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:09,667
During that time?

647
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,839
Have the guards protecting Daeho Fortress
headed to Cheonbugwan?

648
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:18,551
The leader of the guards
will be here soon to give you a report.

649
00:56:18,634 --> 00:56:19,468
Good.

650
00:56:53,252 --> 00:56:54,753
Is it not time yet?

651
00:56:54,837 --> 00:56:57,965
Why is the leader of the guards
not here to report yet?

652
00:56:58,048 --> 00:56:59,633
The guards will not be going anywhere.

653
00:57:08,851 --> 00:57:09,852
I…

654
00:57:11,145 --> 00:57:13,606
withdrew the order you gave, Your Majesty.

655
00:57:13,689 --> 00:57:15,107
What is that?

656
00:57:16,317 --> 00:57:17,651
Is that not a Gold Plaque?

657
00:57:20,362 --> 00:57:22,698
It is the Gold Plaque of the man
you have feared all your life.

658
00:57:23,824 --> 00:57:25,868
The man born under the King's Star.

659
00:57:28,537 --> 00:57:29,371
The King's Star?

660
00:57:29,455 --> 00:57:30,998
The man born under the King's Star

661
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:34,126
will stop what is happening
at Cheonbugwan.

662
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:38,088
Father.

663
00:57:40,716 --> 00:57:42,801
It is time you step down from the throne…

664
00:57:45,846 --> 00:57:47,515
that kept you anxious all your life.

665
00:57:52,853 --> 00:57:53,979
What…

666
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,760
Relics that will ignite
the fire bird's energy

667
00:59:07,386 --> 00:59:08,971
are placed all over the canal.

668
00:59:09,555 --> 00:59:11,098
We must find and destroy them all.

669
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:12,641
-Let us hurry.
-Yes, my lady.

670
00:59:22,568 --> 00:59:24,653
Songrim forces have entered Cheonbugwan.

671
00:59:25,279 --> 00:59:27,906
It is not time yet, but let us begin.

672
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:29,074
It is dangerous to rush it.

673
00:59:29,158 --> 00:59:30,993
If the energy of fire explodes,
we will all die.

674
00:59:31,076 --> 00:59:32,995
If we lose the fire bird,
we will all be doomed.

675
00:59:33,078 --> 00:59:34,663
That is better than burning to death.

676
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:36,457
Count me out.

677
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:50,262
No one here has the right to stop this.
Otherwise, you will die.

678
00:59:52,514 --> 00:59:53,474
Now…

679
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:56,560
I want all of you to wake the fire bird!

680
00:59:56,644 --> 00:59:58,228
Jin Mu is right.

681
00:59:58,312 --> 01:00:01,774
Let us wake the fire bird
so we can get the ice stone.

682
01:00:22,711 --> 01:00:25,756
You were supposed to be careful.
Why is it suddenly awakening?

683
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,523
Jang Uk. What are you doing?

684
01:00:42,606 --> 01:00:44,608
I am helping you all awaken the fire bird.

685
01:00:56,161 --> 01:00:57,329
Jang Uk, stop!

686
01:00:57,996 --> 01:01:01,917
If the energy of fire explodes,
it will kill us all!

687
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,171
Did you expect to live
while the world went up in flames?

688
01:01:09,216 --> 01:01:10,884
I am sorry, but I cannot allow that.

689
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:11,802
Jang Uk.

690
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:14,304
Do you plan to kill
everyone in the Unanimous Assembly?

691
01:01:15,764 --> 01:01:18,183
Is this not the kind of world you wanted?

692
01:01:18,892 --> 01:01:22,438
Take a close look at what it is like
for someone with strength

693
01:01:24,314 --> 01:01:25,858
to gain and wield even greater power.

694
01:01:45,252 --> 01:01:46,086
Jang Uk.

695
01:01:55,512 --> 01:01:57,055
You were right, Jang Uk.

696
01:01:58,432 --> 01:02:00,976
In a world where those with strength
gain greater power,

697
01:02:02,102 --> 01:02:04,730
the weak will just perish.

698
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:12,130
Jin Bu-yeon safely arrived at Cheonbugwan.

699
01:03:12,881 --> 01:03:16,093
She and Yul are waiting for the fire bird
by the constellation basin.

700
01:03:17,427 --> 01:03:18,262
All right.

701
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:21,807
Take this to Jin Bu-yeon and tell her

702
01:03:22,724 --> 01:03:26,103
that I will be waiting
at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

703
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:37,739
I found Jang Uk's constellation plate
where the Crown Prince said it would be.

704
01:03:46,832 --> 01:03:48,417
Is the fire bird safe?

705
01:03:54,923 --> 01:03:57,467
Jin Bu-yeon has
regained all of her divine powers.

706
01:03:57,551 --> 01:03:58,927
And the fire bird is safe.

707
01:04:02,681 --> 01:04:04,391
She will awaken it
atop the constellation basin.

708
01:04:08,937 --> 01:04:11,398
We got rid of all the relics
that would prevent the fire bird

709
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:12,691
from going to Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

710
01:04:30,918 --> 01:04:33,837
The star in the very center
of the Big Dipper is the King's Star.

711
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:39,217
Now she will wake the fire bird

712
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:42,137
and send it to the King's Star.

713
01:04:42,804 --> 01:04:43,847
I heard that

714
01:04:43,931 --> 01:04:47,809
the seven stars gather their energy
and send it to the King's Star.

715
01:04:47,893 --> 01:04:50,395
But right now, there are only six of us.

716
01:04:50,479 --> 01:04:53,106
No, there are seven.

717
01:04:54,149 --> 01:04:55,817
There is one more person…

718
01:04:58,695 --> 01:05:00,030
who was always beside Uk.

719
01:05:00,739 --> 01:05:01,782
Now she will wake the fire bird

720
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:05,327
and send it to Uk
at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

721
01:05:55,544 --> 01:05:56,878
-How beautiful.
-What is that?

722
01:05:56,962 --> 01:05:59,006
-What is that?
-Do you know what that is?

723
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:00,465
Look at that.

724
01:06:02,259 --> 01:06:04,177
The fire bird is awake.

725
01:08:21,189 --> 01:08:22,816
Jang Uk did it.

726
01:08:24,401 --> 01:08:25,235
The fire bird

727
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:27,654
has disappeared.

728
01:08:43,753 --> 01:08:45,297
-Jin Bu-yeon.
-Shaman.

729
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:46,339
Bu-yeon.

730
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:33,053
To the light that has saved the world,

731
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:37,265
I shall now return your shadow.

732
01:09:39,017 --> 01:09:41,061
A light that embraces a shadow

733
01:09:41,937 --> 01:09:45,023
will never be lost in darkness.

734
01:09:54,699 --> 01:09:56,660
1 YEAR LATER

735
01:09:56,743 --> 01:09:58,119
Peekaboo.

736
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:00,247
How lovely.

737
01:10:01,206 --> 01:10:04,668
I cannot believe two of these
precious babies came out at once.

738
01:10:04,751 --> 01:10:06,086
Peekaboo.

739
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:07,587
How lovely.

740
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:08,880
Peekaboo.

741
01:10:08,964 --> 01:10:10,173
-How lovely.
-How lovely.

742
01:10:10,257 --> 01:10:13,385
What are Dan and Gang doing here again?

743
01:10:13,969 --> 01:10:14,928
Oh, dear.

744
01:10:15,637 --> 01:10:16,805
My goodness.

745
01:10:17,639 --> 01:10:18,598
There we go.

746
01:10:18,682 --> 01:10:21,101
Are you Gang or Dan?

747
01:10:21,184 --> 01:10:24,312
He came with his wife to leave them here
to visit his mother-in-law.

748
01:10:24,396 --> 01:10:26,690
They always ask you to babysit for them

749
01:10:27,482 --> 01:10:28,525
and go on dates.

750
01:10:29,442 --> 01:10:30,360
What about us?

751
01:10:30,443 --> 01:10:31,945
We are newlyweds too.

752
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:35,573
This is why we are never able
to go on trips to places far away.

753
01:10:36,157 --> 01:10:37,826
Stop babysitting for them.

754
01:10:37,909 --> 01:10:40,662
If you keep doing this,
they will never stop asking.

755
01:10:41,246 --> 01:10:42,539
It is just for a while.

756
01:10:42,622 --> 01:10:45,500
What would you do
if they were Uk's babies?

757
01:10:48,962 --> 01:10:51,673
-Would you still not babysit them?
-Young Master Jang?

758
01:10:53,466 --> 01:10:56,386
I can babysit 12 babies
if it is for Young Master Jang.

759
01:10:56,469 --> 01:10:59,431
Your young master
still comes first, right?

760
01:10:59,514 --> 01:11:01,725
He will forever be your number one.

761
01:11:01,808 --> 01:11:03,768
Goodness, do not be jealous.

762
01:11:06,855 --> 01:11:08,148
What a relief.

763
01:11:08,231 --> 01:11:10,692
They are both handsome
because they take after Young Lady Jin.

764
01:11:10,775 --> 01:11:14,070
They have long arms and legs
because they take after Dang-gu.

765
01:11:14,154 --> 01:11:17,741
I know the babies are adorable
but do not babysit them all the time.

766
01:11:17,824 --> 01:11:18,950
Only once in a while.

767
01:11:21,411 --> 01:11:23,038
-Goodness.
-What is the matter?

768
01:11:23,621 --> 01:11:25,290
Maybe it is the honey biscuits
I ate earlier.

769
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:28,793
Is it…

770
01:11:31,046 --> 01:11:34,174
-Is it what I think it is?
-No, it cannot be.

771
01:11:47,896 --> 01:11:49,856
Nothing is for sure yet.

772
01:11:54,527 --> 01:11:56,613
I have high expectations for you.

773
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,700
Next time, I hope you have twin girls.

774
01:12:03,411 --> 01:12:07,707
Does that mean you are disappointed
that Gang and Dan are sons?

775
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:10,126
I am not disappointed,
but they took their father's last name.

776
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:13,296
I am merely asking for a daughter
who will carry on our family line.

777
01:12:14,214 --> 01:12:16,591
Uk told me not to dream
of having a daughter

778
01:12:16,674 --> 01:12:18,802
since they are planning
to give birth to one.

779
01:12:20,804 --> 01:12:23,098
Did you say they are at North Fortress?

780
01:12:23,181 --> 01:12:27,435
They caught one at North Fortress,
then headed straight to Seoho Fortress.

781
01:12:27,519 --> 01:12:29,354
But I do not know when they will return.

782
01:12:29,437 --> 01:12:32,190
They promised to return
to celebrate the twins' 100th day.

783
01:12:32,899 --> 01:12:33,733
Right.

784
01:12:33,817 --> 01:12:37,612
Bu-yeon agreed to help out at Jeongjingak,
so they might return sooner than planned.

785
01:12:37,695 --> 01:12:40,490
What do you mean,
Bu-yeon agreed to help out at Jeongjingak?

786
01:12:40,573 --> 01:12:43,284
Jeongjingak is recruiting new mages,

787
01:12:43,368 --> 01:12:45,787
and she promised Yul to interview them.

788
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:49,332
Jeongjingak is recruiting mages
through interviews?

789
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:51,793
Seo Yul is now in charge of Jeongjingak,

790
01:12:51,876 --> 01:12:53,753
which was established
by Master Seo Gyeong.

791
01:12:53,837 --> 01:12:56,506
He made that decision
as the new leader of Jeongjingak.

792
01:12:56,589 --> 01:12:57,882
QUALIFICATIONS
ANYONE WITH PASSION AND DETERMINATION

793
01:13:00,135 --> 01:13:04,222
Is this really how you plan to recruit
new mages for Jeongjingak?

794
01:13:04,305 --> 01:13:06,891
Then all sorts of people will apply.

795
01:13:06,975 --> 01:13:09,894
Word has spread that Seo Yul is in charge
of gathering pupils at Jeongjingak.

796
01:13:09,978 --> 01:13:12,772
All the mages' children in the capital
are very excited about it.

797
01:13:12,856 --> 01:13:15,733
However, if we recruit them this way,
children from prestigious families

798
01:13:15,817 --> 01:13:18,027
will most likely not apply out of pride.

799
01:13:18,111 --> 01:13:20,613
When Master Seo Gyeong built Jeongjingak,
he would have wanted more

800
01:13:21,197 --> 01:13:24,242
than for us to train children
from prestigious families.

801
01:13:24,826 --> 01:13:28,163
But not everyone
has the power to cast spells.

802
01:13:28,246 --> 01:13:30,039
I am not recruiting just anyone.

803
01:13:30,707 --> 01:13:33,293
I will pick people
with good energy and potential.

804
01:13:33,376 --> 01:13:37,839
And based on that,
those two were the ones that you picked?

805
01:13:44,846 --> 01:13:48,224
The most powerful priestess in Daeho
saw their energy and recommended them.

806
01:13:48,308 --> 01:13:51,352
She even told me that
if Sun-i is trained well,

807
01:13:51,436 --> 01:13:54,147
she could even outshine
her own husband, Jang Uk.

808
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:56,608
She has the potential to outshine Jang Uk?

809
01:13:56,691 --> 01:13:58,735
They are my first pupils.

810
01:13:58,818 --> 01:14:02,238
I will train them rigorously
and make sure they outperform Uk.

811
01:14:09,329 --> 01:14:11,664
Seo Yul has always been
fixated on being the best,

812
01:14:11,748 --> 01:14:14,000
even when he used to train at Jeongjingak.

813
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:18,838
Those two are going to have it tough
thanks to their persistent master.

814
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:22,675
Anyway, what matters is that
Jin Bu-yeon vouched for them.

815
01:14:22,759 --> 01:14:24,427
So they must have something special.

816
01:14:24,511 --> 01:14:28,014
I heard that she also secretly takes part

817
01:14:28,097 --> 01:14:31,309
in interviewing potential wives
for His Majesty the King.

818
01:14:34,521 --> 01:14:35,480
She interviews them?

819
01:14:43,363 --> 01:14:44,572
Master Heo.

820
01:14:44,656 --> 01:14:46,699
Why are you staring at Young Lady Heo?

821
01:14:46,783 --> 01:14:50,662
I am trying to see
if she is fit to be a queen.

822
01:14:51,788 --> 01:14:52,622
A queen?

823
01:14:52,705 --> 01:14:56,751
A long time ago,
I gave Jang Uk my torrent of energy,

824
01:14:56,834 --> 01:15:01,297
and he promised
to grant me a wish in return.

825
01:15:01,381 --> 01:15:03,633
Married couples are one
both in body and spirit,

826
01:15:03,716 --> 01:15:06,177
so if the wife takes part
in choosing the queen,

827
01:15:06,261 --> 01:15:08,972
I can ask them to pick my granddaughter.

828
01:15:10,431 --> 01:15:13,393
But Master Heo. Young Lady Heo
is currently seeing someone.

829
01:15:14,352 --> 01:15:15,186
What?

830
01:15:16,062 --> 01:15:16,896
Who?

831
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,357
A young man once came with a broken arm.

832
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,651
Since then, he brings flowers for her
every time he visits.

833
01:15:23,611 --> 01:15:24,654
Is that so?

834
01:15:26,614 --> 01:15:28,449
-What kind of man is he?
-He is handsome.

835
01:15:28,533 --> 01:15:30,493
He is as handsome as Young Master Seo.

836
01:15:30,577 --> 01:15:31,411
Really?

837
01:15:32,537 --> 01:15:34,872
I had no idea Yun-ok was seeing someone.

838
01:15:35,915 --> 01:15:37,584
I am so proud of her.

839
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:40,628
Then instead of asking her
to pick my granddaughter as queen,

840
01:15:40,712 --> 01:15:43,298
I shall ask her to interview that man.

841
01:15:43,381 --> 01:15:45,508
Picking a wife for His Majesty
is more urgent.

842
01:15:46,092 --> 01:15:48,428
He focuses only
on taking care of political affairs,

843
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:50,513
and he frequently
invites Master Lee to the palace.

844
01:15:51,306 --> 01:15:52,599
Rumors say that His Majesty

845
01:15:52,682 --> 01:15:55,852
even may have
appointed Master Lee as his master.

846
01:15:55,935 --> 01:15:56,811
What?

847
01:15:57,645 --> 01:16:00,064
Does that mean he is practicing chastity?

848
01:16:00,648 --> 01:16:03,526
They say the King of Daeho
has cut off his libido.

849
01:16:03,610 --> 01:16:05,403
But then what about his successor?

850
01:16:05,486 --> 01:16:07,071
Did you not hear the rumor?

851
01:16:07,155 --> 01:16:09,073
Rumor has it that
the king before the last had a son.

852
01:16:09,741 --> 01:16:12,035
Yes, they say that his son is Jang Uk.

853
01:16:12,118 --> 01:16:15,496
No wonder Jang Uk
was always so extraordinary.

854
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:19,125
The moment I saw him
beat the Crown Prince in a fight,

855
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:21,377
I knew there was
something special about him.

856
01:16:21,461 --> 01:16:23,004
Should I also try practicing chastity?

857
01:16:23,087 --> 01:16:24,922
Cut the nonsense.

858
01:16:25,006 --> 01:16:26,549
Those men are unbelievable.

859
01:16:26,633 --> 01:16:28,760
His Majesty should quickly get married

860
01:16:28,843 --> 01:16:31,054
so that people stop saying
he cut off his libido.

861
01:16:31,137 --> 01:16:33,640
I cannot believe people think
that I, the King, cut off my libido.

862
01:16:35,725 --> 01:16:36,851
That is surely

863
01:16:37,477 --> 01:16:40,730
the most absurd thing I have heard
since a bogus shaman told me

864
01:16:40,813 --> 01:16:42,273
to adopt a turtle as my son.

865
01:16:43,358 --> 01:16:44,692
-I am the King.
-Exactly.

866
01:16:44,776 --> 01:16:47,403
That is why you should
quickly find yourself a wife.

867
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,821
But Jin Bu-yeon promised

868
01:16:48,905 --> 01:16:52,325
to come back and send royal notices
to the women she already picked out.

869
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:54,243
When will those two be back?

870
01:16:54,327 --> 01:16:58,206
What they are doing is also important,
and they still seem pretty busy.

871
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:01,292
How many relics escaped Jinyowon
when it collapsed?

872
01:17:01,376 --> 01:17:02,960
A total of 31 escaped,

873
01:17:03,044 --> 01:17:05,254
and they have captured 12 as of now.

874
01:17:05,338 --> 01:17:09,217
Among those, there is a mouse
that goes around in human form,

875
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:12,261
and a dangerous pipe that lures children.

876
01:17:12,345 --> 01:17:14,597
Amid them, a crock that spreads rumors
and causes strife,

877
01:17:14,681 --> 01:17:18,976
and a crying frog that spreads plagues
are especially dangerous.

878
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:21,604
They will have to stay busy
in order to catch them all.

879
01:17:28,236 --> 01:17:29,445
Jang Uk will likely use that

880
01:17:29,529 --> 01:17:32,740
as an excuse to reject my every offer
to make him the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan.

881
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:36,202
I will suggest it once again
the next time I meet him.

882
01:17:36,786 --> 01:17:38,705
I will tell him to drop by the palace

883
01:17:38,788 --> 01:17:41,249
since Your Majesty misses him dearly.

884
01:17:46,045 --> 01:17:47,797
This is the pottery that holds Gwiseo.

885
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:51,467
Tell them to capture the mouse
and put it in here.

886
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:53,094
All right.

887
01:17:53,678 --> 01:17:57,598
I am relieved that you stopped
many relics from escaping.

888
01:17:58,391 --> 01:18:00,601
If the swarm of mosquitoes
that causes earthquakes had escaped,

889
01:18:00,685 --> 01:18:02,061
it would have been very dangerous.

890
01:18:02,145 --> 01:18:05,440
I was able to live that day thanks to her.

891
01:18:06,274 --> 01:18:07,108
Do you

892
01:18:08,234 --> 01:18:10,361
no longer feel agony whenever you see her?

893
01:18:11,612 --> 01:18:13,156
Like you said,

894
01:18:13,239 --> 01:18:17,827
if it was really Jin Seol-ran's soul
that was born through Bu-yeon's body,

895
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:20,079
and she chose that girl
to protect that body

896
01:18:20,163 --> 01:18:21,831
as she left this world,

897
01:18:23,291 --> 01:18:27,712
I choose to believe that
my daughter is living on thanks to her.

898
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:36,429
This mouse eats the clippings
of someone who trims their nails at night

899
01:18:36,512 --> 01:18:38,806
and takes the appearance of that person.

900
01:18:39,974 --> 01:18:44,395
It transforms to look just like you,
then goes to your house

901
01:18:44,979 --> 01:18:47,315
and eats your parents alive!

902
01:18:51,819 --> 01:18:52,653
So…

903
01:18:53,946 --> 01:18:58,743
always be careful
where you throw away your nail clippings.

904
01:19:01,829 --> 01:19:05,082
If you are scared, you can go
and pray to the tree at Danhyanggok.

905
01:19:05,166 --> 01:19:08,419
There is a gigantic tree in Danhyanggok,

906
01:19:08,503 --> 01:19:12,632
and when there is a full moon,
two people appear on top of that tree.

907
01:19:12,715 --> 01:19:16,719
They saved my big sister
when she was being chased by a tiger.

908
01:19:17,303 --> 01:19:20,431
They also summoned fireflies
and lit up the dark path for her.

909
01:19:21,015 --> 01:19:23,017
-Really?
-Is that true?

910
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:26,229
Do they show up there often?

911
01:19:26,312 --> 01:19:29,607
Yes, I heard the man is very tall
and the woman is very beautiful.

912
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:32,318
They are a married couple.

913
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:34,445
He is a bright light
that protects the world,

914
01:19:35,112 --> 01:19:38,950
and she is a shadow that protects him
by embracing the darkness surrounding him.

915
01:19:48,709 --> 01:19:49,794
Darling.

916
01:19:49,877 --> 01:19:52,922
How long are you going
to make me carry you up here?

917
01:19:53,005 --> 01:19:54,006
For eternity.

918
01:19:55,091 --> 01:19:56,801
-For eternity?
-You promised.

919
01:19:57,385 --> 01:19:58,219
Right.

920
01:19:59,053 --> 01:20:01,681
What is the matter?
Are you already tired of doing it?

921
01:20:01,764 --> 01:20:03,641
-No, of course not.
-Forget it. Let us go down.

922
01:20:03,724 --> 01:20:04,892
No, wait.

923
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:10,273
It is not that I am tired of doing it.

924
01:20:10,356 --> 01:20:12,316
You were once a mage who mastered Chisu.

925
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,695
So I am merely telling you
to challenge yourself.

926
01:20:15,778 --> 01:20:18,239
There is no need,
for I possess divine powers.

927
01:20:18,823 --> 01:20:20,116
You want me to train again?

928
01:20:21,033 --> 01:20:23,452
No way. Never.
I get sick just thinking about it.

929
01:20:23,536 --> 01:20:25,913
Gosh, back when you were my master,

930
01:20:25,997 --> 01:20:27,957
did you not always scold me
for being lazy?

931
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,543
You were able to come this far
thanks to your great master.

932
01:20:30,626 --> 01:20:33,629
-What?
-Be grateful and treat her well.

933
01:20:34,422 --> 01:20:35,256
All right, fine.

934
01:20:36,215 --> 01:20:39,010
So did you find the creature
you were looking for?

935
01:20:39,677 --> 01:20:41,220
-Did you see it?
-Yes.

936
01:20:41,888 --> 01:20:42,722
I saw it.

937
01:20:44,849 --> 01:20:46,309
It is in the west of the forest.

938
01:20:53,816 --> 01:20:56,193
It is a cat, a wily beast
that escaped from Jinyowon.

939
01:20:56,861 --> 01:20:58,029
A cat?

940
01:21:03,576 --> 01:21:06,579
Hey, I thought you said it was a cat?

941
01:21:07,288 --> 01:21:10,625
That growl sounds like
it may be strong enough to eat a tiger.

942
01:21:11,292 --> 01:21:13,753
It is as big as an elephant.

943
01:21:13,836 --> 01:21:15,087
That is going to be

944
01:21:16,088 --> 01:21:17,673
one cute cat.

945
01:21:28,559 --> 01:21:29,727
Stay close to me.

946
01:21:38,152 --> 01:21:38,986
Here it comes.

947
01:21:40,738 --> 01:21:41,906
Go and take care of it.

948
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:59,525
