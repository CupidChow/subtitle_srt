ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You and I…

3
00:00:00,217 --> 00:00:01,385
have liked each other for a long time.

4
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:02,928
What?

5
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:08,350
I remember when we exchanged
this yin-and-yang jade.

6
00:00:10,603 --> 00:00:11,520
You remember what?

7
00:00:11,604 --> 00:00:13,564
Last time, you made up
a nonexistent witness.

8
00:00:14,774 --> 00:00:16,317
Are you making up memories now?

9
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:20,988
"They are bird's eggs."

10
00:00:22,364 --> 00:00:23,699
"I will choose first."

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,287
"I pick red. You can have the blue one."

12
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:32,124
I will choose first.

13
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,959
I pick red. You can have the blue one.

14
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:39,173
See?

15
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:40,966
I am not lying this time.

16
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:47,807
How did you know that?

17
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:51,477
It came to me as soon as I held this jade.

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,478
Why you?

19
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:55,105
Maybe…

20
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:58,901
because I am a priestess
with great divine powers.

21
00:01:04,115 --> 00:01:05,950
There is no way that memory is mine.

22
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,077
It probably belongs
to the owner of this blue jade.

23
00:01:11,163 --> 00:01:12,498
This yin-and-yang jade

24
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,042
is from Jinyowon, is it not?

25
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:19,004
I must have seen it there
when I was young.

26
00:01:19,672 --> 00:01:22,466
I got these flashbacks when I saw it,
so I thought they were my memories.

27
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:25,344
But it turns out they were the owner's.

28
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:29,098
Her memory remains…

29
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,518
inside that jade?

30
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:38,858
I guess I really am a powerful priestess.

31
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:40,860
I can see memories that remain in objects.

32
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:48,075
I was hoping you would be happy
that I started getting my powers back,

33
00:01:49,535 --> 00:01:51,412
but you came running thinking it was her.

34
00:01:52,997 --> 00:01:53,998
You must be disappointed.

35
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,249
Yes.

36
00:01:56,876 --> 00:01:58,127
I am greatly disappointed.

37
00:01:59,628 --> 00:02:02,548
I will put this back where I found it.

38
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:24,904
It collapsed again.

39
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:28,407
Why did you raise
that stone tower in the mountain?

40
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:33,078
Were you not mourning her death?
Were you praying she would come back?

41
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:35,664
You really knocked it down well.

42
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,938
Do not try to fix
what you have already broken.

43
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:01,232
I really did not touch it.
It collapsed on its own.

44
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,149
Is that so?

45
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:06,612
So you were not using your powers
to merely disappoint me?

46
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:09,490
I am telling the truth.

47
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,535
I found this jade by chance,

48
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:16,956
and when I first had a flashback,
I thought it was my memory.

49
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,627
If you had come
before I even realized anything,

50
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,380
I would have been happy.

51
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,926
Good to know that I am not the only one
who is disappointed.

52
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,804
How could you think that memory was yours?

53
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:33,764
Because you have what was hers?

54
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:37,893
Did you get
any other flashbacks like this?

55
00:03:37,977 --> 00:03:38,811
No.

56
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:41,021
That was all I saw.

57
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:46,068
Taking a peek at someone else's memory
is not exactly enjoyable, you see.

58
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,030
Take it.

59
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:55,244
Why? You said you felt elated
when you thought it was yours.

60
00:03:55,828 --> 00:03:57,246
Tell me if you see anything else.

61
00:03:58,122 --> 00:04:00,416
Like you said,
we liked each other for a long time.

62
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:03,585
I am dying to know how she felt

63
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:07,214
right before she died.

64
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:08,674
I cannot see anything else.

65
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,635
Let go. You are hurting me.

66
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,429
Keep the jade.

67
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:15,806
You will see more as you regain powers.

68
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,559
Are you putting me
in between you and that dead girl?

69
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:20,811
You did that yourself
by calling me with that.

70
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,319
Thanks to this,
I have found another use for you.

71
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:31,280
I buried questions in that stone tower,

72
00:04:31,363 --> 00:04:33,240
thinking I would never
hear answers to them.

73
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,493
I might be able to hear them through you.

74
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:38,370
I called you hoping you would not come.

75
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:41,290
You should not have come.

76
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,838
So this is why no one believed it

77
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:51,050
when they heard about our marriage.

78
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:55,304
I was excited about nothing.

79
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:57,181
You got what you wanted by marrying me.

80
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:59,016
You escaped from Jinyowon,

81
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,018
found a place to stay, and gained freedom.

82
00:05:02,644 --> 00:05:03,520
You are right.

83
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:08,484
I feel more at ease now that I have
nothing to look forward to.

84
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,361
I guess this stone tower
was your real wife.

85
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:13,405
I will make sure

86
00:05:13,989 --> 00:05:15,365
to build it back to how it was.

87
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:16,700
Do as you wish.

88
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,726
That jerk.

89
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,230
So this stone tower is his lawful wife,
while I am his second wife?

90
00:05:47,064 --> 00:05:48,649
He should have told me.

91
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:52,653
Then I would not
have gotten jealous of this stone tower.

92
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:01,703
This is all Uk's fault.

93
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:05,874
That horrible, mean jerk.

94
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:19,638
I should have known
that he was a rotten jerk

95
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:20,973
the first time I met him.

96
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:24,309
No, wait.

97
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:26,437
He would be "a rotten husband."

98
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,877
Gosh, I am hungry.

99
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:01,096
What was that? A wolf?

100
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,308
I hope there are no tigers
on this mountain.

101
00:07:24,453 --> 00:07:26,788
Fine! Just come and eat me alive!

102
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,126
If a tiger eats me alive,

103
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:34,296
then maybe he will build
a stone tower for me.

104
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:10,624
I was expecting a tiger,

105
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:14,169
but bugs came instead.

106
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,428
Did I summon them?

107
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:44,801
Young Lady Bu-yeon!

108
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:48,138
-My lady!
-My lady!

109
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,390
-My lady!
-Where are you?

110
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:53,644
-Young Lady Bu-yeon!
-Please answer if you are there!

111
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:54,853
-My lady!
-Here!

112
00:09:54,936 --> 00:09:57,230
-My lady, where are you?
-I am right here!

113
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:59,107
My lady, is that you?

114
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,401
Oh, dear.

115
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:11,870
We were worried about you, my lady.

116
00:10:11,953 --> 00:10:13,497
Let us go home now.

117
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,040
Come on down.

118
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,169
-Slowly. Be careful.
-Thank you.

119
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:22,130
It gets chilly here at night.

120
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:26,176
Here you go.

121
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:30,639
My goodness. Let us walk back down.

122
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:32,182
-Thank you.
-Let us go.

123
00:10:33,558 --> 00:10:34,935
Did something happen, my lady?

124
00:10:38,814 --> 00:10:41,566
Prepare a hot bath for her
as soon as we get home.

125
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:51,118
I took care of the powder incident
like you told me to, Your Royal Highness.

126
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:54,204
Report to me if you hear any rumors
about the Queen getting involved

127
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:56,164
with sorcery again.

128
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:57,332
Of course.

129
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,459
But, Your Royal Highness,

130
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:01,837
why did you bring that to the palace?

131
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,923
I could not leave it to die
when it kept looking at me like that.

132
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:06,842
I was wary that the shaman
who suggested it would curse me

133
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:08,552
so I brought it home just in case.

134
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:09,678
A shaman?

135
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,763
Yes, some shaman.

136
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:14,933
She told me to raise this turtle
instead of having kids.

137
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:16,977
Who does she think she is?

138
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,146
How dare she say that
to Your Royal Highness!

139
00:11:19,229 --> 00:11:20,480
She likely did not know.

140
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,316
She thought I was a eunuch.

141
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,901
-She must be ignorant.
-Then

142
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,362
I shall raise the turtle,
Your Royal Highness.

143
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,073
No, it is too late.

144
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:32,993
It already knows that I am its owner.
It only listens to me.

145
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,037
-It does?
-Yes. Watch.

146
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:37,747
All right, Turtle.

147
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:38,707
Stick your neck out.

148
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,209
Did you see that?

149
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:44,129
I see.

150
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:46,465
She said it had good energy.

151
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,844
It is very clever.
Next time, I should make him flip over.

152
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:54,222
But, Your Royal Highness,
turtles die if they do that.

153
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:56,183
-Really?
-Yes.

154
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:02,439
Turtle, do not ever flip on your back.
That is an order.

155
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:06,318
It is not flipping over.

156
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,403
That is one handsome turtle.

157
00:12:58,286 --> 00:13:02,123
They call me Naksu, for wherever I go,
heads fall to the ground.

158
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:05,627
I will shift my soul
into a new body and return.

159
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,509
Help!

160
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:15,762
Help!

161
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:17,681
-Help!
-Look!

162
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,266
-Swim this way!
-Over here!

163
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:20,934
-Keep swimming!
-Come on!

164
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:23,311
Naksu is here!

165
00:13:23,395 --> 00:13:26,481
Naksu is here!

166
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:28,316
Naksu became a grotesque

167
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,694
and killed everyone
at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho!

168
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,237
She said she would shift souls and return!

169
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,489
Naksu is here! Run away!

170
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:37,117
Hurry up and run! Save yourselves!

171
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,410
Naksu is here!

172
00:13:38,493 --> 00:13:39,369
Run away!

173
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,620
Escape!

174
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:41,872
Save yourselves!

175
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,082
-Run!
-Naksu is here!

176
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:45,542
-Naksu is back!
-It is Naksu!

177
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,044
-Naksu is back!
-Hurry! Run!

178
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,514
Yul, is that you?

179
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,644
What brings you here?

180
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:05,687
I came last night.

181
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:08,732
Chwiseonru is nice,
but Jeongjingak feels more like home.

182
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,613
What about you?
Why are you here and not at your house?

183
00:14:14,696 --> 00:14:16,615
I also like it better here.

184
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:18,283
Should you not prefer it elsewhere?

185
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:20,410
You have someone waiting for you at home.

186
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,120
You must have met her already.

187
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:27,000
Maidservant Kim insists that
we have a wedding ceremony.

188
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:30,253
I am keeping myself
out of trouble until then.

189
00:14:32,547 --> 00:14:34,341
So it is something to congratulate, right?

190
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,301
Truly?

191
00:14:40,305 --> 00:14:42,140
How do you feel? Do you feel better?

192
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:44,059
You were severely ill before you left.

193
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,103
You still do not look well.

194
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:48,772
I am still tired from the journey.

195
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,441
That is even stranger.

196
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:54,235
It has been days already.
That is not like you.

197
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:01,701
The air feels cold here in Jeongjingak
since it has been empty for too long.

198
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:04,829
It is hot outside,
but it is chilly in here.

199
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:07,582
It is probably because of me.

200
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:11,461
The ice stone attracts wraiths,
so the air around me always feels cold.

201
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:15,548
I see.

202
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:19,427
Then it must

203
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,472
always be cold for you.

204
00:15:30,605 --> 00:15:31,439
Yul.

205
00:15:32,357 --> 00:15:34,150
Do not pity me with that face of yours.

206
00:15:34,818 --> 00:15:36,361
Hearing you comfort me

207
00:15:36,444 --> 00:15:38,947
makes me want to fall into your arms
for a big hug.

208
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:47,872
I can give you a hug.

209
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:50,834
Come on.

210
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,628
What is with you?
What happened during the past three years?

211
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:57,257
-Were you lonely?
-Yes, I was.

212
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,592
-Let me hug my friend.
-What is wrong with you?

213
00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:01,636
-Let me give you a hug.
-No, just stop.

214
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,762
What is going on?

215
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:04,931
What are you guys doing?

216
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,726
Are you leaving me out
because you both slept here last night?

217
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:09,853
Then I might just move in here too.

218
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,313
Dang-gu, Yul is being strange.

219
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:14,065
He used to be pure and naive.

220
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:16,776
-But look at him. He has become sly.
-Has he?

221
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,779
Yul was always as pure as the driven snow.

222
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:20,947
Has he become depraved?

223
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,199
Has he changed?

224
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:26,327
Have I changed?

225
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,372
They say you die
if you change all of a sudden.

226
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,671
It is good that I had a chance
to see you before that happened.

227
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:38,423
I am glad I returned.

228
00:16:38,506 --> 00:16:41,301
Yes, but you will soon regret
having come back.

229
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:43,845
My uncle invited us
over to his place for breakfast.

230
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,474
-Tell him I went back.
-You did not see me here.

231
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:49,851
If you guys do not go,

232
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:51,644
I will have to finish
all three portions alone.

233
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:55,398
We are friends, right?

234
00:16:57,609 --> 00:16:59,110
-Help me.
-What shall we do?

235
00:16:59,194 --> 00:17:00,987
-Let us go.
-All right. Come on.

236
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:03,865
Right, let us go eat.

237
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:06,910
All right, I hope you enjoyed your meal.

238
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,078
Here is the dessert.

239
00:17:09,204 --> 00:17:12,290
We managed to finish a whole meal,
so a rice cake will be easy.

240
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,084
At least this is it.

241
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,543
Normal rice cakes are boring,

242
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:17,670
so I came up with a name for this dessert.

243
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:20,423
These are called
"Leave-it-to-luck Rice Cakes."

244
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:24,886
Two of the three are filled with honey,
and one is filled with fish sauce.

245
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:26,346
Sounds fun, does it not?

246
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:27,388
It took me

247
00:17:27,472 --> 00:17:29,099
two days…

248
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,018
and one night to come up with this.

249
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:34,229
Why did you even think of making this?

250
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,024
Eating this rice cake will tell you
how your day will go.

251
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:40,902
Whoever picks the fish sauce rice cake
will have a lousy day,

252
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:41,903
so watch out.

253
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:43,613
Go on and pick one each.

254
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,741
Fish sauce gives out a strong smell.

255
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:50,870
I inserted energy as I made the rice cakes
to prevent that from happening.

256
00:17:50,954 --> 00:17:54,415
You will not be able to smell
the fish sauce.

257
00:18:01,506 --> 00:18:03,842
You used your precious energy
to make rice cakes?

258
00:18:03,925 --> 00:18:05,385
You must be bored.

259
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:06,469
Yes, I am.

260
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:09,180
You can tell how bored I am
by these rice cakes.

261
00:18:09,264 --> 00:18:11,432
Go on and pick one.

262
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:13,643
I struggle with making
these kinds of decisions.

263
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:15,979
Then I'll go first.

264
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:33,830
-It has honey.
-I was going to pick that one.

265
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:38,001
I do not want to be the last one.

266
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:48,928
-It has honey.
-Why did you have to do this?

267
00:18:49,012 --> 00:18:50,930
You just turned my day into a lousy one.

268
00:18:51,014 --> 00:18:52,015
No, Uk.

269
00:18:52,682 --> 00:18:54,475
Why eat it? You know it has fish sauce.

270
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,852
You can have a bite of mine.

271
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:56,978
You guys.

272
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,899
Are you not going to check
what is inside this rice cake?

273
00:19:00,982 --> 00:19:04,277
You already told us that
one was filled with fish sauce.

274
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,946
Are you sure, though?

275
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,240
Yes, Uncle. I believe you.

276
00:19:09,824 --> 00:19:12,785
I do not wish
to risk my chances just to check.

277
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:16,122
Based on the rules, this one is filled
with fish sauce without a doubt.

278
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:20,627
If we doubt the rules,
nothing will ever be predictable.

279
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:35,099
-Is it honey?
-It has fish sauce, right?

280
00:19:37,852 --> 00:19:39,145
What was the purpose of this joke?

281
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:42,774
Life is unpredictable,
but you choose your own destiny.

282
00:19:42,857 --> 00:19:45,526
No matter how sweet or bitter it may be,

283
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,571
you must taste it yourself and swallow it.

284
00:19:51,032 --> 00:19:52,158
I forgot the rice punch.

285
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:53,868
Wait here.

286
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:04,003
-What was it?
-Based on his logic,

287
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:08,049
neither of you will believe
what I tell you.

288
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:11,594
I am the only one who knows what I chose.

289
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,555
It was fish sauce, was it not?

290
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:18,518
Here you all are.

291
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:20,603
What is it?

292
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,065
What brings you here?

293
00:20:24,148 --> 00:20:27,026
A ridiculous rumor spread overnight,
but it cannot be taken lightly.

294
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,361
What ridiculous rumor?

295
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:32,824
People were massacred on a boat
crossing Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,

296
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:34,993
and they say it was Naksu's doing.

297
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:40,039
Naksu?

298
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:42,709
How is that possible? She is dead.

299
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:45,086
They say her soul turned into a grotesque
and showed up at the lake

300
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:47,922
and claimed that
she would shift souls and return.

301
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:50,550
The capital is in an uproar
because of what happened.

302
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:02,061
Everyone, here are charms
that will protect you from Naksu's ghost!

303
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:05,023
These charms will protect you
from Naksu's murderous spirit!

304
00:21:05,106 --> 00:21:08,151
-Gather around!
-This charm fends off soul shifters.

305
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,485
Naksu will come for your body.

306
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:10,528
Protect yourself with this.

307
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:12,030
Sure, take one.

308
00:21:25,293 --> 00:21:27,211
Protect yourself and your family

309
00:21:27,295 --> 00:21:28,254
-from Naksu!
-Please give me one.

310
00:21:28,338 --> 00:21:30,131
-Here.
-Protect yourself with this charm.

311
00:21:30,214 --> 00:21:31,215
Here you go.

312
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:39,348
I should not be selling this,
but here is one just for you.

313
00:21:41,225 --> 00:21:42,351
Mother.

314
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:43,936
You look fine.

315
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,651
I checked all the boats, but none of them
had suffered a mass murder recently.

316
00:21:50,735 --> 00:21:54,697
That means someone is lying
about Naksu's return.

317
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,116
Ghost stories about Naksu
have always been around.

318
00:21:58,326 --> 00:22:01,204
But what is this story
about her returning as a soul shifter?

319
00:22:02,497 --> 00:22:05,500
Soon, it will be the third anniversary
of Naksu's death.

320
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,795
They believe she will shift souls
and return that day.

321
00:22:08,878 --> 00:22:09,712
I see.

322
00:22:10,254 --> 00:22:12,256
So that is why this rumor spread.

323
00:22:14,008 --> 00:22:15,802
Uk must feel perturbed.

324
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:18,721
It really is

325
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,015
a lousy day for him today.

326
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,851
I need to know who started the rumor.

327
00:22:23,935 --> 00:22:26,854
People at Gaema Village
spread the rumor now and then

328
00:22:26,938 --> 00:22:29,398
to make money selling charms.
Do not waste your time.

329
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,526
But it all started from that unknown boat.

330
00:22:33,361 --> 00:22:37,448
Can you find out who it was
that swam out of the lake?

331
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:39,617
Of course.

332
00:22:43,538 --> 00:22:46,415
Rumors about Naksu spread in an instant.

333
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,835
She causes trouble even after she is dead.

334
00:22:48,918 --> 00:22:52,964
The young ladies of the capital
are busy searching for charms

335
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:54,715
to protect their bodies from Naksu.

336
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,595
Everyone is so afraid of Naksu,
but do they even know what she looks like?

337
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:02,098
I, for one, do not.

338
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:03,516
Do they?

339
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,602
Some say she was taller
and bigger than most men.

340
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:09,480
Some say she keeps herself hidden
because she is ugly.

341
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:10,398
On the other hand,

342
00:23:11,732 --> 00:23:13,609
some say she is unbelievably beautiful.

343
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:14,527
Really?

344
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,779
Back when she was alive,
she was a shadow assassin.

345
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:18,739
Then she hid in a servant girl's body.

346
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:23,327
I guess no one knows
what she will look like this time.

347
00:23:23,995 --> 00:23:24,829
That is right.

348
00:23:45,516 --> 00:23:47,894
People must be very frightened of Naksu.

349
00:23:48,978 --> 00:23:50,479
Was she that scary?

350
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,273
Are you here to buy a charm?

351
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:57,862
I was just curious
since everyone is buying these.

352
00:23:57,945 --> 00:24:00,615
If that charm really does
protect you from Naksu,

353
00:24:00,698 --> 00:24:02,450
then you will need one for sure.

354
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:05,369
She will probably be
the most upset with you

355
00:24:05,453 --> 00:24:07,121
since you stole her lover.

356
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:10,166
Though perhaps you could not.

357
00:24:12,793 --> 00:24:14,670
You knew Naksu?

358
00:24:16,005 --> 00:24:18,799
The girl I knew was a small girl
who worked as a servant.

359
00:24:18,883 --> 00:24:21,260
She was feisty and unlucky.

360
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:24,513
I placed an order for 30 charms.
I also want a pack of incense sticks.

361
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:26,432
-Sure.
-I will light them on the day she died.

362
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:28,976
Were you close with her?

363
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,020
Goodness, no.

364
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:34,315
I would never say that.
I have a business to run.

365
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,569
How about a drink?

366
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:45,076
Madam, the Crown Prince is here.

367
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:47,662
The Crown Prince?
It has been quite a while.

368
00:24:47,745 --> 00:24:50,498
He asked for the cinnamon and ginger wine,
which is what he used to drink.

369
00:24:51,165 --> 00:24:55,127
Young Lady, I need to go and serve
a very important customer.

370
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:57,004
Wait for me in the corner room.

371
00:24:57,588 --> 00:24:59,090
Do we have
any cinnamon and ginger wine left?

372
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:01,842
The Crown Prince?

373
00:25:10,518 --> 00:25:13,312
She bought so many.
These are really expensive.

374
00:25:13,396 --> 00:25:14,272
Shaman.

375
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,776
Turtle Shaman.

376
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:20,319
So it is you.

377
00:25:23,698 --> 00:25:25,074
You are that eunuch.

378
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:27,034
We meet again.

379
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,038
Are you also here to sell charms?

380
00:25:31,872 --> 00:25:34,083
I see you are making money
selling such paltry items.

381
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,168
The owner here bought these.

382
00:25:36,252 --> 00:25:39,255
You sold everything?
You must have made some money.

383
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,882
You can use that money to buy that turtle.

384
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,885
Did you not buy it that day?

385
00:25:44,969 --> 00:25:46,512
You just left it there?

386
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,055
What is so bad about that?

387
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:50,349
Why would I buy something so useless?

388
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:53,561
I told you it had good energy.
It was cute too.

389
00:25:53,644 --> 00:25:54,770
Cute, my foot.

390
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,108
Do you even know
what kind of pets I already own?

391
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,319
I own a peacock and a white horse.

392
00:26:01,402 --> 00:26:02,987
They are more impressive
than mere turtles.

393
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:04,447
I see.

394
00:26:07,908 --> 00:26:09,577
A turtle may not be that impressive

395
00:26:10,328 --> 00:26:12,705
if he has something else in his heart.

396
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:16,959
I guess I cannot resent him

397
00:26:18,252 --> 00:26:20,004
for abandoning me.

398
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:23,382
What?

399
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,176
Did someone abandon you?

400
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:29,472
My husband left and is not returning home.

401
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:30,473
Your husband?

402
00:26:32,475 --> 00:26:33,476
Why?

403
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:38,689
I see.

404
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:41,692
Your husband must have
a peacock of his own.

405
00:26:45,863 --> 00:26:47,406
I apologize for making you buy the turtle

406
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:49,950
when you already have something you like.

407
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:53,162
It may be dead,
but I should check if it is still there.

408
00:26:54,205 --> 00:26:55,539
It is no longer there.

409
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:57,333
I took it home.

410
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,876
You said it had good energy.

411
00:27:00,044 --> 00:27:02,129
I took it home
and found that it was clever and cute.

412
00:27:03,297 --> 00:27:04,840
It still is nothing
compared to my peacock.

413
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:06,384
But it has its own charm.

414
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:09,720
So you should also

415
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:11,847
keep your chin up.

416
00:27:13,057 --> 00:27:14,308
I was right.

417
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:17,645
You really are a good person.

418
00:27:21,857 --> 00:27:22,775
Whatever.

419
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:27,029
How is the turtle? Is it doing well?

420
00:27:28,322 --> 00:27:30,533
Do you miss it? Would you like to see it?

421
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,660
If so, I could bring the turtle here.

422
00:27:33,494 --> 00:27:34,453
Can you really?

423
00:27:34,537 --> 00:27:36,789
I am assuming you came here
with the Crown Prince.

424
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,874
Are you allowed to do that?

425
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:40,584
Oh, the Crown Prince…

426
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:45,506
His Royal Highness will not mind it.

427
00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:49,093
He seems like a kind man.

428
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:54,140
I will leave the turtle here for a bit,
so drop by and take a look.

429
00:27:54,223 --> 00:27:55,307
I will.

430
00:27:56,183 --> 00:27:57,685
I should be off now.

431
00:27:57,768 --> 00:27:59,937
You should also get going, Eunuch.

432
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:08,863
Your Royal Highness.

433
00:28:09,613 --> 00:28:11,115
Do you feel better?

434
00:28:11,198 --> 00:28:12,867
They found cinnamon and ginger wine.

435
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,993
Let us go in.

436
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:15,953
Forget it.

437
00:28:16,036 --> 00:28:19,498
I feel better after a short chat.
Let us return to the palace.

438
00:28:20,624 --> 00:28:23,461
If we go back now, Jang Uk will be there.

439
00:28:24,128 --> 00:28:26,839
His Majesty summoned him
to discuss the Naksu rumor.

440
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:28,048
Jang Uk?

441
00:28:28,716 --> 00:28:30,301
Why are you telling me that now? Move.

442
00:28:31,594 --> 00:28:33,471
Well, you wanted to come for a drink.

443
00:28:33,554 --> 00:28:35,723
Your Royal Highness!
Are you on your way to see Jang Uk?

444
00:28:35,806 --> 00:28:36,724
Your Royal Highness!

445
00:28:44,148 --> 00:28:46,817
They say Naksu the grotesque appeared
at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

446
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:48,944
The boats that need to cross
are stuck there,

447
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:51,697
and it has been
causing transportation problems.

448
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:54,283
Jang Uk, I want you
to get rid of the grotesque

449
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:55,993
and set the people's minds at ease.

450
00:28:56,076 --> 00:28:58,579
If I get involved to get rid of something
that does not even exist,

451
00:28:58,662 --> 00:29:01,624
it will only cause people to think
that it really does exist.

452
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:08,088
I also do not believe the rumors,
but things are getting out of hand.

453
00:29:08,172 --> 00:29:10,800
Let them talk.
It will die away sooner or later.

454
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:14,845
But, Your Majesty,

455
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:16,847
if Jang Uk does not take action,

456
00:29:16,931 --> 00:29:20,601
I am afraid it might cause people
to become even more anxious.

457
00:29:20,684 --> 00:29:22,144
How so?

458
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:24,063
The soul shifter that appeared this time

459
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:28,067
is different from the soul shifters
that he previously got rid of.

460
00:29:28,943 --> 00:29:30,486
She is Naksu.

461
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:37,409
Jang Uk, you and Naksu
were betrothed to each other.

462
00:29:37,493 --> 00:29:40,412
Everyone in Daeho Fortress
knows that fact.

463
00:29:42,122 --> 00:29:42,957
Your Majesty,

464
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:45,835
that is what concerns me.

465
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:48,462
I am afraid that people might think

466
00:29:48,546 --> 00:29:51,507
that he is refusing to get involved not
because it does not exist

467
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,300
but because he still cares for her.

468
00:29:54,176 --> 00:29:57,221
During the past three years,
Jang Uk used the power of the ice stone

469
00:29:57,304 --> 00:29:59,765
to get rid of soul shifters
with the Unanimous Assembly's permission.

470
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:01,976
People were afraid
of the power he possessed,

471
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:04,353
but they believed he would
protect them from sorcery.

472
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:08,440
But they might start doubting that
because of this rumor about Naksu.

473
00:30:09,525 --> 00:30:11,151
That is what worries me.

474
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:14,029
Jin Mu has a point.

475
00:30:14,738 --> 00:30:18,284
Jang Uk, I want you to do your best
to get rid of Naksu the grotesque

476
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:20,452
to subdue any unnecessary concerns.

477
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,209
Yes, Your Majesty.

478
00:30:28,252 --> 00:30:29,378
If you are so worried,

479
00:30:30,212 --> 00:30:31,881
I will catch her myself.

480
00:30:34,508 --> 00:30:35,551
I give you my word.

481
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:37,928
I will take my leave.

482
00:31:17,635 --> 00:31:20,220
How can he get rid of something
that does not exist?

483
00:31:20,304 --> 00:31:21,513
Exactly.

484
00:31:22,556 --> 00:31:25,059
Naksu does not exist,
so he cannot get rid of her.

485
00:31:25,142 --> 00:31:29,647
However, Jang Uk will forever
be haunted by her.

486
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,525
People believe Naksu will shift souls
and return to Jang Uk.

487
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:38,072
Every soul shifter that appears before him
will be considered to be Naksu.

488
00:31:38,155 --> 00:31:40,824
And if that soul shifter kills anyone,

489
00:31:40,908 --> 00:31:45,287
the blame will not only be placed on Naksu
but on Jang Uk as well.

490
00:31:45,955 --> 00:31:50,501
Jang Uk will constantly chase after Naksu
although she does not exist,

491
00:31:50,584 --> 00:31:52,336
and it will never end.

492
00:31:53,253 --> 00:31:56,131
People's fear, doubts, and concerns
will keep him trapped

493
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:58,008
in a vicious cycle.

494
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:05,182
You are going to bind Jang Uk
by using Naksu against him.

495
00:32:05,265 --> 00:32:07,434
I am doing this for you,
Your Royal Highness.

496
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:09,728
The first thing I will do

497
00:32:09,812 --> 00:32:12,898
is to bring Jinyowon to the royal palace.

498
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:15,067
Jinyowon?

499
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,696
I cannot let Jang Uk marry Jin Bu-yeon,
the heir to Jinyowon.

500
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:23,033
Naksu will help us separate the two.

501
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,794
I found the man who saw Naksu on that boat
and swam back to land.

502
00:32:33,877 --> 00:32:34,920
Who was it?

503
00:32:35,504 --> 00:32:38,424
It was a man named Byeong-gu.
He did odd jobs on the boat.

504
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:40,592
I think he spread the rumor

505
00:32:40,676 --> 00:32:43,595
after he was paid by shamans
who make money selling charms.

506
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,266
He swam out of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho
in the middle of the night.

507
00:32:48,142 --> 00:32:49,977
That is what helped spread the rumor.

508
00:32:50,853 --> 00:32:54,648
He could not have risked his life
just to help spread a false rumor.

509
00:32:54,732 --> 00:32:56,942
They say he gambles every chance he gets.

510
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:59,611
I will search the gambling houses
in the capital.

511
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:19,631
Leave Daeho Fortress for now.

512
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:24,553
Do not come back
until the sixth of next month.

513
00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:26,430
Is that when Naksu died?

514
00:33:26,513 --> 00:33:27,973
Is she really

515
00:33:28,057 --> 00:33:30,142
going to shift souls and return that day?

516
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:38,358
If she really does come back,

517
00:33:38,442 --> 00:33:39,693
I would like to meet her.

518
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:43,572
I have a lot of questions I need to ask.

519
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:53,832
I think I have heard enough
about their relationship.

520
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,375
You can stop.

521
00:33:55,459 --> 00:33:58,587
This is where they first met each other.

522
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,297
He proposed to her here as well.

523
00:34:01,298 --> 00:34:03,967
I know what happened between the two.

524
00:34:04,051 --> 00:34:06,053
I have heard enough. Just stop.

525
00:34:06,136 --> 00:34:08,680
One time when she was drunk,

526
00:34:08,764 --> 00:34:11,558
Young Master Jang came
and carried her home himself.

527
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,104
She always took these honey biscuits home

528
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:18,107
because she knew how much he liked them.

529
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,172
Here. Let us drink.

530
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:52,224
Once again, I was summoned to the palace
by His Majesty the King

531
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:53,809
and my cousin, the Queen.

532
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:56,353
Yesterday, I drank tea with Gwanju Jin Mu.

533
00:34:56,436 --> 00:34:59,690
Then you will not be returning
to Seoho Fortress?

534
00:35:00,274 --> 00:35:04,444
Jeongjingak was established by Master Seo,
a member of the Seo family.

535
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:05,696
But since it is in ruins,

536
00:35:05,779 --> 00:35:07,489
I plan to restore it
as a member of the Seo family.

537
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:08,866
Jeongjingak?

538
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:10,325
You are incredible.

539
00:35:11,702 --> 00:35:12,786
That is my plan.

540
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,122
I still need to talk to the Queen.

541
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:19,710
Where is the owner?

542
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:21,253
I am here to treat my guests.

543
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:25,090
She is with Jin Bu-yeon,
the eldest daughter of the Jin family.

544
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:26,842
Jin Bu-yeon?

545
00:35:32,389 --> 00:35:34,266
This is where he met and proposed to her?

546
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:35,851
I should not have heard any of that.

547
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:42,900
Marry me.

548
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:47,821
What was that?

549
00:35:55,412 --> 00:35:57,206
It was her memory.

550
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,793
Her memories really do keep
coming back to me.

551
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,215
My lady.

552
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:07,883
Someone wishes to see you.

553
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:09,968
He says you are both acquainted.

554
00:36:19,186 --> 00:36:20,020
Yul.

555
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:22,231
Hey, long time no see.

556
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,193
Uncle Yun-o,

557
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,820
are you not heading back
to Seoho Fortress early tomorrow?

558
00:36:28,904 --> 00:36:30,781
I have decided to stay
in the capital for a bit.

559
00:36:30,864 --> 00:36:32,366
Yul, come sit down.

560
00:36:32,449 --> 00:36:34,117
I only came to say goodbye.

561
00:36:34,785 --> 00:36:36,245
I said sit.

562
00:36:36,954 --> 00:36:38,705
You are in for something fun.

563
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,416
You know Jin Bu-yeon,
the girl I almost married, right?

564
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,085
I heard she was here,
so I called her over.

565
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:44,586
He says she is a little dull,

566
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,422
but he had decided to marry her
because she was pretty.

567
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:50,550
We were curious about her,
so he called her over to show her to us.

568
00:36:50,634 --> 00:36:53,262
If a woman shows up to meet
the man she was previously betrothed to,

569
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:55,264
that would really mean she is daft.

570
00:36:56,765 --> 00:36:59,643
You all seem to have
misunderstood my uncle.

571
00:37:02,104 --> 00:37:03,230
He was extremely excited

572
00:37:03,313 --> 00:37:05,732
to become the son-in-law
of the great Jin family.

573
00:37:06,316 --> 00:37:08,694
But the wedding got canceled
on the day of the ceremony.

574
00:37:09,278 --> 00:37:12,656
You have no idea how disappointed he was
that the marriage fell through.

575
00:37:14,283 --> 00:37:16,285
But you asked if he could show her to you?

576
00:37:17,828 --> 00:37:21,081
Think about how upset and sad
he will feel if he sees her right now.

577
00:37:25,168 --> 00:37:26,003
Uncle,

578
00:37:26,753 --> 00:37:29,631
allow me to apologize
on behalf of my friends

579
00:37:30,757 --> 00:37:32,384
for putting you in an awkward spot.

580
00:37:53,822 --> 00:37:55,699
Did you call for me?

581
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:57,034
Yes, I did.

582
00:37:58,201 --> 00:38:00,329
The night is late. Let us leave.

583
00:38:02,956 --> 00:38:05,042
The evening only just started.

584
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:07,377
Did you call for me to walk me home?

585
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:08,295
Yes.

586
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:12,257
Will you not get lost tonight?

587
00:38:27,981 --> 00:38:28,815
I apologize.

588
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:31,818
I was a bit worked up earlier.

589
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:33,487
I lost my way again.

590
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,364
You lost your way a long time ago.

591
00:38:36,365 --> 00:38:38,241
But I stayed quiet to help you cool down.

592
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:42,788
By any chance,

593
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:45,374
are you not feeling well?

594
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,087
Like I said, I can see energy.

595
00:38:51,088 --> 00:38:54,299
Why is there something strange
inside your body?

596
00:38:55,675 --> 00:38:58,178
With that in your body, things could get--

597
00:38:58,261 --> 00:38:59,262
Please just ignore it.

598
00:39:02,265 --> 00:39:03,100
Please.

599
00:39:03,183 --> 00:39:05,227
Leaving your illness untreated
is a foolish thing to do.

600
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:09,648
We promised

601
00:39:10,524 --> 00:39:11,900
to be two foolish friends.

602
00:39:13,902 --> 00:39:17,489
Please let my foolishness slide
as a friend.

603
00:39:35,257 --> 00:39:37,759
Would you like some?
I packed them because they were delicious.

604
00:39:40,137 --> 00:39:42,431
Eating something sweet
will make you feel better.

605
00:39:46,435 --> 00:39:48,019
Uk loves honey biscuits.

606
00:39:48,103 --> 00:39:49,271
I know.

607
00:39:50,897 --> 00:39:52,315
That is why I packed them.

608
00:39:56,069 --> 00:39:58,655
What kind of snacks do you like?

609
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:02,534
I like pine pollen tea snacks.

610
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:03,910
Really?

611
00:40:05,078 --> 00:40:06,371
You have expensive tastes.

612
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:24,055
I once had

613
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,809
a similar conversation with someone.

614
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:32,147
Did that person ever treat you
to pine pollen tea snacks?

615
00:40:33,482 --> 00:40:34,399
Come to think of it…

616
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:36,860
she never did.

617
00:40:48,622 --> 00:40:49,915
What are you doing here?

618
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,669
The King gave you orders.
You should be by the lake.

619
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:58,715
That could not have come from there.

620
00:40:58,798 --> 00:41:03,053
Still, the people are scared.
Not a single boat has sailed recently.

621
00:41:04,137 --> 00:41:05,972
Move. You are in my space.

622
00:41:06,056 --> 00:41:07,349
I am going to bed.

623
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:09,976
Right…

624
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:14,314
Are you going to sleep here?

625
00:41:15,482 --> 00:41:17,526
-No way.
-I am not here to sleep.

626
00:41:18,527 --> 00:41:19,361
What is wrong?

627
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,696
Are you so excited
that you cannot even sleep?

628
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,323
Because they say Naksu is coming back?

629
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,327
What are you staring at?

630
00:41:28,245 --> 00:41:30,497
You built a stone tower
and waited for her.

631
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:35,168
That no longer exists. It collapsed.

632
00:41:35,252 --> 00:41:36,253
Uk.

633
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:40,632
Did you change your mind
because of what I said?

634
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:41,591
Of course not.

635
00:41:42,759 --> 00:41:44,219
Jin Bu-yeon smashed it down.

636
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:49,432
Actions really do speak louder than words.

637
00:41:49,516 --> 00:41:52,269
She promised to protect you,
and she is doing it well.

638
00:41:52,852 --> 00:41:55,272
That is what she said
when she first came to see us.

639
00:41:56,189 --> 00:41:57,899
She said she would protect you.

640
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:04,197
Get out of here.
Go home and protect your wife.

641
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:07,450
I was making dumplings in the kitchen,

642
00:42:08,368 --> 00:42:10,161
and all the ladies there were concerned

643
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:15,000
that your bride will be the first person
that Naksu goes after when she appears.

644
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,295
They say ghosts also get jealous.

645
00:42:20,922 --> 00:42:22,257
Is that what they were after?

646
00:42:26,136 --> 00:42:26,970
What?

647
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:31,182
My lord, I will eat all of your dumplings.

648
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:33,476
So let me sleep here tonight.

649
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,978
I have another favor to ask.

650
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:36,855
Sure.

651
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:41,943
Uk, I will go and steam some dumplings.

652
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:43,778
Let us take our time talking.

653
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:44,904
Goodness.

654
00:42:45,947 --> 00:42:47,198
Fifty or a hundred?

655
00:42:47,282 --> 00:42:48,992
First, I will bring 50.

656
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,214
Your Majesty,

657
00:43:03,298 --> 00:43:06,676
I would like to hold a banquet
outside the palace walls.

658
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,679
I thought you did not wish to meet anyone
while you were in that body.

659
00:43:10,972 --> 00:43:11,973
What banquet?

660
00:43:13,308 --> 00:43:17,520
I heard young ladies are scared
to leave their homes because of Naksu.

661
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:22,817
It is ridiculous that the entire capital
is afraid of Naksu.

662
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:26,655
So you wish to alleviate the situation
by holding a banquet?

663
00:43:27,364 --> 00:43:31,242
I plan to hold it
on the day Naksu supposedly returns.

664
00:43:33,161 --> 00:43:37,082
It will be held outdoors with young ladies
who believe Naksu is after them,

665
00:43:37,165 --> 00:43:40,043
and we will enjoy a beautiful

666
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:42,962
and extravagant banquet together.

667
00:43:46,216 --> 00:43:47,884
The Queen has invited
Young Lady Jin Bu-yeon

668
00:43:47,967 --> 00:43:49,344
to her banquet.

669
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:51,262
The Queen's banquet?

670
00:43:51,346 --> 00:43:52,889
She has not held one in years.

671
00:43:57,477 --> 00:43:59,562
I was invited?

672
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:01,147
Yes, my lady.

673
00:44:02,732 --> 00:44:05,777
Every time I went to the Queen's banquet
with Madam Do-hwa,

674
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,656
it always felt great
to watch everyone fix their eyes

675
00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:11,658
on the person I helped doll up.

676
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:14,119
I will get to feel that once again.

677
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:17,539
We do not have much time.

678
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:20,667
It is time to get busy.

679
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:25,505
We need to find the right outfit first.

680
00:44:26,381 --> 00:44:28,591
We must get Dressmaker Cho's outfits
before anyone else does.

681
00:44:29,592 --> 00:44:30,885
Mr. Lee!

682
00:44:36,724 --> 00:44:38,101
Fetch the next one.

683
00:44:38,601 --> 00:44:39,894
Very nice.

684
00:44:39,978 --> 00:44:41,521
That one is beautiful too.

685
00:44:41,604 --> 00:44:42,564
No.

686
00:44:43,398 --> 00:44:44,899
That will not do!

687
00:44:44,983 --> 00:44:46,234
Did Dressmaker Cho truly make that?

688
00:44:47,152 --> 00:44:48,653
Yes, very nice.

689
00:44:55,535 --> 00:44:56,494
Is it too much?

690
00:44:58,371 --> 00:44:59,456
It is out of fashion.

691
00:45:06,087 --> 00:45:06,921
It is too racy.

692
00:45:09,174 --> 00:45:10,592
You look pretty in everything.

693
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:13,344
How are we going to choose
out of all these outfits?

694
00:45:13,428 --> 00:45:16,014
My goodness, this is just the beginning.

695
00:45:16,097 --> 00:45:18,725
You should at least try on 30 outfits
before choosing.

696
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,435
What? 30?

697
00:45:21,478 --> 00:45:23,688
Help her try this one.

698
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:24,898
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

699
00:45:37,118 --> 00:45:37,952
Hey.

700
00:45:38,036 --> 00:45:38,870
Mr. Lee.

701
00:45:39,913 --> 00:45:41,706
I want you to visit Dressmaker Oh now.

702
00:45:41,789 --> 00:45:43,708
-Again?
-Just go.

703
00:45:44,292 --> 00:45:47,128
I am sure she feels uneasy
because of that crazy rumor.

704
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:50,465
If we exhaust her with this,
her mind will be at peace for a bit.

705
00:45:50,548 --> 00:45:52,926
All right. I will be right back.

706
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,304
By the way,
Young Master Jang came home earlier.

707
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:57,305
He is in his study.

708
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:58,223
Really?

709
00:45:59,015 --> 00:45:59,849
He came home?

710
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,025
I am all changed.

711
00:46:10,026 --> 00:46:11,194
How do I…

712
00:46:15,031 --> 00:46:15,949
You look busy.

713
00:46:17,492 --> 00:46:21,079
Your outfit is extravagant for someone
who is awfully confident about her looks.

714
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,790
Do not be mistaken.

715
00:46:23,873 --> 00:46:26,543
I was not trying to look good for you.

716
00:46:26,626 --> 00:46:28,503
Yes, I know.
The Queen invited you to a banquet.

717
00:46:30,296 --> 00:46:32,173
You may not have dressed for me,
but may I see?

718
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:37,762
You look pretty.

719
00:46:45,562 --> 00:46:46,479
I mean, the outfit does.

720
00:46:49,691 --> 00:46:50,525
Give me your hand.

721
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,193
Why?

722
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:54,988
You hurt your hand
while taking it out on the stone tower.

723
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:58,366
Your nails have grown.

724
00:46:58,449 --> 00:46:59,826
Ask Maidservant Kim to trim them for you.

725
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:01,619
I am not a child.

726
00:47:01,703 --> 00:47:03,329
Why would I ask her
to trim my nails for me?

727
00:47:03,413 --> 00:47:05,415
Do as I say. You are precious.

728
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:09,294
I mean, your nails are.

729
00:47:11,504 --> 00:47:13,006
Why are you suddenly mentioning my nails?

730
00:47:14,424 --> 00:47:15,258
All right, then.

731
00:47:15,883 --> 00:47:16,926
I will leave you to it.

732
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:27,312
Wait.

733
00:47:31,065 --> 00:47:31,899
By any chance…

734
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,491
When you go to the banquet,

735
00:47:41,367 --> 00:47:42,910
sit where everyone can see you.

736
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:45,955
I want everyone there to see you that day.

737
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:47,540
No one will be interested in me.

738
00:47:47,624 --> 00:47:51,210
They will be busy talking about your wife
who might return to life that day.

739
00:47:51,294 --> 00:47:53,755
That is why you should show everyone

740
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:55,256
that you are my wife now.

741
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:02,639
Then…

742
00:48:05,224 --> 00:48:08,353
can I wear the ornament
with your family crest?

743
00:48:10,313 --> 00:48:11,814
-Sure.
-Can I also…

744
00:48:12,815 --> 00:48:16,027
tell everyone that we get along well?

745
00:48:19,447 --> 00:48:20,948
-Of course.
-I will also…

746
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:24,994
boast to everyone

747
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,456
that you lit up a dark path for me…

748
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:32,210
late at night.

749
00:48:34,504 --> 00:48:36,214
Sure, go ahead.

750
00:49:02,115 --> 00:49:03,449
You seem very happy tonight.

751
00:49:05,284 --> 00:49:06,869
Did you like the outfits?

752
00:49:06,953 --> 00:49:08,538
I saw some bugs.

753
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:13,501
That is why I am happy.

754
00:49:31,728 --> 00:49:33,604
Here is what Young Master Jang asked for.

755
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:36,149
Will it be safe?

756
00:49:36,899 --> 00:49:37,817
Do not worry.

757
00:49:39,527 --> 00:49:42,572
Will you also be attending
the banquet tonight?

758
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,823
Yes.

759
00:49:43,906 --> 00:49:46,951
You look very pretty in that outfit.

760
00:49:48,703 --> 00:49:50,830
This is what I always wear.

761
00:49:50,913 --> 00:49:53,249
I will be wearing something else
for the banquet.

762
00:49:53,332 --> 00:49:58,337
Are you saying you will look
even more beautiful than you do now?

763
00:49:58,421 --> 00:50:00,006
Do not be ridiculous.

764
00:50:00,089 --> 00:50:01,340
There is no need for that.

765
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:04,051
If you look even prettier than you do now,

766
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:08,181
imagine how intimidated
the young ladies will feel tonight.

767
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,475
Do you think so?

768
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:13,728
Then I guess I should tone it down.

769
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:15,104
Yes, you should.

770
00:50:15,188 --> 00:50:16,147
Go easy on them.

771
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:17,440
All right.

772
00:50:18,733 --> 00:50:21,319
It has been a while
since you last attended a grand event.

773
00:50:21,402 --> 00:50:22,737
I hope you dress up nicely.

774
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:26,991
I like it when a man dresses
at his finest.

775
00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:28,284
All right.

776
00:50:28,367 --> 00:50:31,913
I will show you how dashing I can become.

777
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:48,971
Young Master Park.

778
00:50:56,145 --> 00:50:56,979
Maidservant Kim.

779
00:50:57,063 --> 00:50:58,439
Are you attending the event?

780
00:50:58,523 --> 00:51:01,317
Yes, I will be attending
with Young Lady Bu-yeon.

781
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,445
If you happen to see Cho-yeon there…

782
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:09,033
could you give these to her for me?

783
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,454
These diamonds are called
"The Dragon's Tears."

784
00:51:13,538 --> 00:51:15,832
I heard they were purchased by Songrim
not too long ago.

785
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:18,835
-How did you get your hands on--
-I bought them.

786
00:51:19,877 --> 00:51:23,464
But if Young Lady Jin wears these,

787
00:51:23,548 --> 00:51:26,300
everyone will know that they are from you.

788
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:29,136
I am not sure
if she will accept this gift.

789
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,721
If she refuses to accept them,

790
00:51:31,681 --> 00:51:33,349
it would mean she turned me down.

791
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:35,726
Forget it.

792
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:39,522
It will be unbearable for me
if she rejects me once and for all.

793
00:51:41,232 --> 00:51:44,819
Then are you never going to
make a move on Young Lady Jin?

794
00:51:47,613 --> 00:51:49,365
Do you think she will accept?

795
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:53,619
-Or will she refuse?
-We will know once we give them to her.

796
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,622
I guess you are right.

797
00:51:56,706 --> 00:51:59,000
You never know what is in the rice cake
until you bite into it.

798
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:12,388
Uncle,

799
00:52:13,389 --> 00:52:16,183
I am hoping for honey,
but I am afraid it might be fish sauce.

800
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:19,854
But I will bravely bite into it

801
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:21,480
and swallow my destiny.

802
00:52:24,817 --> 00:52:26,110
Please give these to her.

803
00:52:33,075 --> 00:52:35,453
The Queen's banquet is about to start.

804
00:52:37,246 --> 00:52:38,581
Is Jin Bu-yeon there?

805
00:52:38,664 --> 00:52:41,959
Everyone who was invited is in attendance,
so she is probably there.

806
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:43,669
What about Jang Uk?

807
00:52:43,753 --> 00:52:46,923
He is sailing Lake Gyeongcheondaeho
due to the King's orders.

808
00:52:50,051 --> 00:52:53,346
What if a soul shifter appears
and kills Jin Bu-yeon?

809
00:52:54,597 --> 00:52:56,682
What will people think
of that soul shifter?

810
00:52:56,766 --> 00:53:00,478
They will naturally believe
that the soul shifter is Naksu.

811
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:03,981
If Jin Bu-yeon gets attacked,
it will become Naksu's doing.

812
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,902
Then everything will become
Jang Uk's responsibility.

813
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:13,491
Naksu will help us separate the two.

814
00:53:15,326 --> 00:53:17,703
Your Royal Highness,
would you like to attend the banquet?

815
00:53:18,663 --> 00:53:20,331
It will soon be time
to choose the crown princess.

816
00:53:20,414 --> 00:53:23,626
It will most likely be
one of the ladies at the banquet.

817
00:53:23,709 --> 00:53:25,586
You should pick the woman you like.

818
00:53:26,921 --> 00:53:27,755
No.

819
00:53:29,423 --> 00:53:31,133
I do not have the final say anyway.

820
00:53:31,217 --> 00:53:33,302
I am afraid of what I might do

821
00:53:33,386 --> 00:53:35,179
if I fall for someone I cannot have.

822
00:53:44,146 --> 00:53:46,732
I do not wish to have
someone from Songrim enter Jinyowon.

823
00:53:46,816 --> 00:53:48,025
What brings you here?

824
00:53:51,404 --> 00:53:53,489
I am not here on behalf of Songrim.

825
00:53:53,572 --> 00:53:55,408
It is for a young lad
who is like a son to me

826
00:53:56,325 --> 00:53:58,786
and your daughter.

827
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:01,247
If you are talking about Bu-yeon,

828
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:04,250
tell Jang Uk to bring her back
right this instant.

829
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:06,252
Before that, let us talk about Naksu.

830
00:54:08,921 --> 00:54:09,922
We must get rid of her first.

831
00:54:10,006 --> 00:54:12,341
Naksu? She is dead.

832
00:54:12,425 --> 00:54:14,885
Do not tell me you also believe
that ridiculous rumor.

833
00:54:14,969 --> 00:54:18,597
That ridiculous rumor
could end up killing your daughter.

834
00:54:20,391 --> 00:54:21,851
We need Jinyowon's help.

835
00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:35,072
I am Jin Cho-yeon,

836
00:54:35,156 --> 00:54:36,449
the second daughter of the Jin family.

837
00:54:39,035 --> 00:54:39,869
You must be

838
00:54:41,037 --> 00:54:42,788
Jin Ho-gyeong and Jin U-tak's daughter.

839
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:53,299
I am Heo Yun-ok
of the Heo family from Wol Fortress.

840
00:54:53,382 --> 00:54:55,843
She is the granddaughter
of Master Heo Yeom.

841
00:54:57,678 --> 00:54:58,971
Greetings are not needed between us.

842
00:54:59,055 --> 00:55:01,640
We meet quite often
because you are my physician.

843
00:55:21,243 --> 00:55:23,496
I am Jin Bu-yeon,
the eldest daughter of the Jin family.

844
00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:26,165
She is betrothed to Young Master Jang Uk.

845
00:55:26,248 --> 00:55:28,000
I thought they were married.

846
00:55:29,043 --> 00:55:31,545
We are preparing
for a grand wedding ceremony.

847
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:33,380
We ask for your blessing.

848
00:55:33,464 --> 00:55:36,258
That means she still belongs to Jinyowon.

849
00:55:36,342 --> 00:55:38,302
I invited one person from each family.

850
00:55:38,385 --> 00:55:40,221
But there are two people
from the Jin family.

851
00:55:40,888 --> 00:55:42,515
Send the second daughter,
Jin Cho-yeon, away.

852
00:55:48,562 --> 00:55:49,396
Your Highness,

853
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,359
Jin Cho-yeon is the true heir of Jinyowon.

854
00:55:53,442 --> 00:55:55,569
If one of us must leave,

855
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:58,656
it should be me, not my younger sister.

856
00:56:03,077 --> 00:56:03,911
Forget it.

857
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:06,705
You both came, so just enjoy the banquet.

858
00:56:07,957 --> 00:56:11,168
Thank you for allowing me to attend
such a beautiful banquet.

859
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:32,356
It feels nice to be
outside the palace walls.

860
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,816
All right, everyone.

861
00:56:33,899 --> 00:56:35,609
Let us enjoy the banquet.

862
00:56:47,872 --> 00:56:49,999
Beautiful, are they not?

863
00:56:56,714 --> 00:56:58,466
There we go!

864
00:56:58,549 --> 00:56:59,884
Let us play again.

865
00:56:59,967 --> 00:57:01,260
Come on, get a grip.

866
00:57:01,844 --> 00:57:04,221
Let us play again. Deal the cards.

867
00:57:04,305 --> 00:57:06,182
-Damn it.
-Give us the cards.

868
00:57:07,057 --> 00:57:08,392
What is that punk doing here?

869
00:57:09,018 --> 00:57:11,103
I told him to stay away until tonight.

870
00:57:11,187 --> 00:57:12,396
Gosh.

871
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,690
I guess his addiction called him in early.

872
00:57:14,773 --> 00:57:16,817
He came to play since he had money.

873
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:17,943
That lunatic.

874
00:57:20,446 --> 00:57:22,823
All right. Let me see.

875
00:57:22,907 --> 00:57:25,201
I won! I won the money!

876
00:57:25,826 --> 00:57:27,495
Who here is Byeong-gu?

877
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:33,292
Byeong-gu?

878
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:37,213
Hey, leave if you are not here to gamble.

879
00:57:37,296 --> 00:57:38,797
-All right?
-Get out of my way.

880
00:57:41,592 --> 00:57:42,468
What are you doing?

881
00:58:02,738 --> 00:58:04,573
-Be quiet and leave.
-I am sorry.

882
00:58:07,201 --> 00:58:08,619
I told you not to come back.

883
00:58:08,702 --> 00:58:11,413
-You lunatic, why did you not wait?
-I am sorry.

884
00:58:19,338 --> 00:58:20,172
It was you.

885
00:58:51,453 --> 00:58:53,038
You must feel upset.

886
00:58:53,622 --> 00:58:56,166
You were introduced as his betrothed,
not his wife.

887
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:59,336
It is all right.
He shows me more than enough affection.

888
00:59:01,505 --> 00:59:04,800
Did you not take my advice to heart?

889
00:59:04,883 --> 00:59:06,218
Of course, I did.

890
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:09,471
Thanks to you,
there were some difficulties between us,

891
00:59:09,555 --> 00:59:11,599
but we have become a lot closer since.

892
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:12,516
Thank you.

893
00:59:22,651 --> 00:59:26,363
Everyone, Young Master Jang

894
00:59:26,447 --> 00:59:30,242
has sent fireworks
to celebrate the Queen's banquet.

895
00:59:34,288 --> 00:59:35,623
We will get to see fireworks?

896
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:36,999
I have never seen them before.

897
00:59:37,082 --> 00:59:39,376
He sent them because his betrothed,
Young Lady Bu-yeon,

898
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:42,087
asked him if he could lighten up

899
00:59:42,171 --> 00:59:43,756
the night sky for her.

900
00:59:44,548 --> 00:59:46,967
-Oh, my goodness.
-I am jealous.

901
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:47,926
-Lucky her.
-She is lucky.

902
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:53,182
Soon, fireworks will bloom
in the night sky like flowers.

903
00:59:53,265 --> 00:59:54,391
I hope you look forward to it.

904
00:59:58,395 --> 00:59:59,897
Let us go outside.

905
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:02,066
-Shall we watch it from outside?
-Sure.

906
01:00:13,369 --> 01:00:14,787
You should go to the back garden.

907
01:00:32,805 --> 01:00:35,432
You came here yourself?

908
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:39,561
To lighten up the night sky?

909
01:00:40,854 --> 01:00:41,689
Yes.

910
01:00:42,439 --> 01:00:44,566
Did you boast around?

911
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:46,443
Yes.

912
01:00:46,527 --> 01:00:50,072
Now everyone here truly believes
that we are married.

913
01:00:50,155 --> 01:00:51,281
Good.

914
01:00:51,365 --> 01:00:54,118
Then Naksu will show up here soon.

915
01:00:55,327 --> 01:00:56,161
Naksu?

916
01:00:56,245 --> 01:00:59,873
This event was arranged to summon Naksu.

917
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:02,084
Why?

918
01:01:03,669 --> 01:01:07,423
So that my wife would get killed by Naksu.

919
01:01:09,007 --> 01:01:10,134
Bu-yeon.

920
01:01:11,218 --> 01:01:12,052
I am sorry,

921
01:01:13,262 --> 01:01:14,763
but you will have to die now.

922
01:01:31,447 --> 01:01:32,364
Look at that!

923
01:01:37,035 --> 01:01:37,870
That is beautiful.

924
01:01:53,177 --> 01:01:54,762
If a soul shifter

925
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:56,638
kills Jin Bu-yeon in front of everyone,

926
01:01:56,722 --> 01:01:59,349
people will naturally think it was Naksu,

927
01:01:59,433 --> 01:02:01,477
and the blame will go to Jang Uk.

928
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,063
Jang Uk and Jinyowon will become enemies,

929
01:02:05,147 --> 01:02:08,609
and Jinyowon will fall into our hands.

930
01:03:05,499 --> 01:03:06,375
Bu-yeon!

931
01:03:08,919 --> 01:03:10,087
Bu-yeon.

932
01:03:12,214 --> 01:03:13,048
Bu-yeon.

933
01:03:13,632 --> 01:03:14,591
That was Naksu.

934
01:03:15,509 --> 01:03:19,596
Naksu murdered Jang Uk's wife,
Jin Bu-yeon.

935
01:03:26,061 --> 01:03:26,895
Bu-yeon.

936
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:30,774
Bu-yeon…

937
01:03:52,671 --> 01:03:54,298
Young Lady Bu-yeon is safe.

938
01:04:13,191 --> 01:04:15,611
How are you alive?

939
01:04:17,571 --> 01:04:19,072
You were dead.

940
01:04:19,781 --> 01:04:21,783
The person that died just now was not me.

941
01:04:21,867 --> 01:04:24,578
It was a white mouse called Gwiseo,
a relic from Jinyowon.

942
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:25,871
"Gwiseo"?

943
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,041
A mouse that eats the clippings

944
01:04:29,124 --> 01:04:32,252
of someone who trims their nails at night
can take the appearance of that person.

945
01:04:33,295 --> 01:04:35,380
The mouse that ate
Young Lady Bu-yeon's nail clippings

946
01:04:36,131 --> 01:04:38,717
was the one that got stabbed.

947
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,801
She is right.

948
01:04:40,636 --> 01:04:43,388
What you saw earlier
was Gwiseo from Jinyowon.

949
01:04:48,769 --> 01:04:49,937
How did that get here?

950
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:55,275
Your mother sent it here
to protect her eldest daughter.

951
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:16,004
It looks like everything went well.

952
01:05:16,088 --> 01:05:17,506
Now, Uk just needs to go

953
01:05:19,257 --> 01:05:21,009
and get rid of the soul shifter.

954
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:27,391
The soul shifter that attacked me

955
01:05:27,474 --> 01:05:30,227
is currently being chased
by Young Master Jang.

956
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:36,274
If I do not get rid of Naksu myself,

957
01:05:37,275 --> 01:05:39,361
people will constantly
spread rumors about her.

958
01:05:41,154 --> 01:05:42,781
I want her to rest in peace.

959
01:05:42,864 --> 01:05:43,699
So…

960
01:05:46,868 --> 01:05:48,078
help me out.

961
01:05:50,163 --> 01:05:52,290
Once he gets rid of
Naksu the soul shifter,

962
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:53,917
she will forever

963
01:05:55,502 --> 01:05:56,962
be gone from our lives.

964
01:06:12,227 --> 01:06:13,353
She is not moving.

965
01:06:13,437 --> 01:06:15,147
I think she is dead.

966
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:17,065
-She looks dead.
-Goodness.

967
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:51,933
Today, I got rid of Naksu,
the soul shifter that appeared

968
01:06:52,017 --> 01:06:53,518
at the Queen's banquet.

969
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:56,730
Was it really Naksu?

970
01:06:58,065 --> 01:07:00,901
She was after Jang Uk's betrothed,
so it must have been her.

971
01:07:01,485 --> 01:07:03,695
Now Naksu is gone

972
01:07:04,863 --> 01:07:05,697
for good.

973
01:07:09,868 --> 01:07:11,078
I hope this puts you at ease…

974
01:07:13,163 --> 01:07:14,414
and gives you peace.

975
01:07:36,144 --> 01:07:38,230
I made the rumor
with the shamans at Gaema Village

976
01:07:38,313 --> 01:07:40,565
so that we could make some money
selling charms.

977
01:07:42,901 --> 01:07:46,446
All I did was make up a rumor.
Arrest me if you wish.

978
01:07:52,911 --> 01:07:54,329
You kept sending me medicine, right?

979
01:07:57,082 --> 01:07:58,792
You must know what is inside my body.

980
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:02,546
You will be fine

981
01:08:03,547 --> 01:08:04,756
as long as you take the medicine.

982
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:06,383
I…

983
01:08:08,718 --> 01:08:10,345
did not take the medicine you sent.

984
01:08:12,931 --> 01:08:14,141
You did not take it?

985
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:18,145
Without that medicine,
you must be in severe pain.

986
01:08:18,854 --> 01:08:19,688
Tell me.

987
01:08:20,522 --> 01:08:21,731
What is inside my body?

988
01:08:24,484 --> 01:08:25,861
I would at least like to know…

989
01:08:27,988 --> 01:08:29,030
before I die.

990
01:08:36,288 --> 01:08:39,040
I heard Naksu died.

991
01:08:39,124 --> 01:08:41,251
-Yes, that is right.
-Tell me in detail.

992
01:08:41,334 --> 01:08:42,169
Yeom.

993
01:08:42,252 --> 01:08:43,587
I am here.

994
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:46,923
-Yeom!
-Master Lee!

995
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:49,176
Master Lee!

996
01:08:51,928 --> 01:08:52,762
Master Lee!

997
01:08:53,722 --> 01:08:54,556
Master Lee.

998
01:08:59,561 --> 01:09:00,812
Master Lee,

999
01:09:00,896 --> 01:09:02,731
where have you been?

1000
01:09:02,814 --> 01:09:04,232
It has been three years.

1001
01:09:04,316 --> 01:09:07,110
Yeom, you have aged even more
in those three years.

1002
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:12,490
Where did you stay?

1003
01:09:12,574 --> 01:09:13,700
You were not at Danhyanggok.

1004
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:16,161
I spent time treating a patient.

1005
01:09:16,244 --> 01:09:17,204
A patient?

1006
01:09:17,287 --> 01:09:18,872
Lady Jin's daughter.

1007
01:09:19,581 --> 01:09:21,499
I heard she recently married Jang Uk.

1008
01:09:21,583 --> 01:09:22,417
What?

1009
01:09:22,918 --> 01:09:26,046
You treated Jin Bu-yeon?

1010
01:09:26,129 --> 01:09:26,963
Yes.

1011
01:09:27,631 --> 01:09:30,425
I saved her life, woke her up,

1012
01:09:31,426 --> 01:09:32,636
and erased what was unnecessary.

1013
01:09:46,316 --> 01:09:47,150
You did not visit

1014
01:09:47,734 --> 01:09:50,028
the cliff where she met her demise,
did you?

1015
01:09:50,987 --> 01:09:51,947
See for yourself

1016
01:09:52,697 --> 01:09:53,740
and then mourn for her.

1017
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,345
I want her to rest in peace.

1018
01:10:16,805 --> 01:10:18,807
It may not have been Naksu,

1019
01:10:19,641 --> 01:10:21,726
but more wraiths tend to swarm around him

1020
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:24,354
on days when he uses
the power of the ice stone.

1021
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:37,575
You are the first person

1022
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:40,412
who tried to save me.

1023
01:10:41,538 --> 01:10:42,998
I almost died thanks to you.

1024
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:45,834
My crazy master.

1025
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,628
My pupil.

1026
01:10:49,754 --> 01:10:51,047
I, Jang Uk, your pupil,

1027
01:10:51,131 --> 01:10:53,967
will serve and protect my master,
Mu-deok, with all my heart.

1028
01:10:55,885 --> 01:11:00,265
I am the egg
that is at the top of the tree.

1029
01:11:01,308 --> 01:11:03,393
You are the only one
who can take care of me.

1030
01:11:04,352 --> 01:11:05,270
Fine.

1031
01:11:05,854 --> 01:11:09,065
I will take you to the top of that tree.

1032
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,445
I also missed you.

1033
01:11:14,195 --> 01:11:15,488
That is my reply.

1034
01:11:17,782 --> 01:11:18,616
Jang Uk.

1035
01:11:20,285 --> 01:11:21,578
I like you a lot.

1036
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,335
Jang Uk.

1037
01:12:03,536 --> 01:12:04,371
Jang Uk.

1038
01:12:05,663 --> 01:12:06,706
Are you all right?

1039
01:12:18,676 --> 01:12:19,803
I could not cry.

1040
01:12:22,347 --> 01:12:23,181
It felt like…

1041
01:12:25,767 --> 01:12:27,519
I was really abandoning you there.

1042
01:14:34,604 --> 01:14:37,524
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

1043
01:14:38,191 --> 01:14:39,526
There is no need to force them together…

1044
01:14:40,485 --> 01:14:45,323
You have taken what Jin Ho-gyeong
has tried so hard to hide.

1045
01:14:45,406 --> 01:14:46,449
You should stop as well, Gwanju.

1046
01:14:46,533 --> 01:14:48,201
If you wish to stop me,

1047
01:14:48,284 --> 01:14:51,120
you should go to Jang Uk
and reveal everything to him.

1048
01:14:51,204 --> 01:14:53,414
I returned to settle things one last time.

1049
01:14:53,498 --> 01:14:55,041
You look like you are about to cry.

1050
01:14:55,124 --> 01:14:58,419
Tear out the heart and break it to pieces…

1051
01:14:59,546 --> 01:15:02,382
I shall always stay by your side
at this distance.

1052
01:15:03,883 --> 01:15:04,926
That is my promise.

1053
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:11,975
