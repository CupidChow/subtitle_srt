1
00:00:05,212 --> 00:00:08,382
Daeho once suffered
from a long and unusual drought.

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,721
It was so bad that it even caused
Lake Gyeongcheondaeho

3
00:00:13,804 --> 00:00:15,556
to completely dry up.

4
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:26,567
The mages of Daeho performed a grand rite

5
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,360
to fill the lake back up with energy.

6
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:37,620
Then enormous hailstones
started falling from the sky.

7
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,674
But among the many hailstones,

8
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:53,636
there was one that did not melt.

9
00:00:55,721 --> 00:01:00,559
This unmelting hailstone
first turned into fire,

10
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,520
then stone,

11
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,814
and then water.

12
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:09,235
Then it turned back
into its original form, ice.

13
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,780
In that process, it produced black powder.

14
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:18,494
This powder was called the Soul Ejector,
which was used in the alchemy of souls.

15
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:25,042
The power of the Soul Ejector
was truly astonishing.

16
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:30,798
One could bring the dead back to life
by summoning back their souls.

17
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:34,301
One could shift souls
from one body to another.

18
00:01:36,178 --> 00:01:38,264
One could even expel
the soul of the living

19
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:40,850
and steal their energy.

20
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:52,027
Eventually, that boundless power
ended up causing chaos.

21
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:05,124
In order to possess the unmelting ice
that produced the Soul Ejector,

22
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:10,796
the battle of mages turned into bloodshed,
and Daeho became a living hell.

23
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,600
The man who ended the long-lasting battle

24
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,314
was Master Seo Gyeong,
the founder of Songrim.

25
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:39,867
I was his pupil.

26
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,620
That ice stone sounds amazing.

27
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:45,664
Where is it? I would like to see it.

28
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,292
It is an extremely frightening stone.

29
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,085
Sorcery using the stone's power

30
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:53,797
created wicked things
that could hurt people.

31
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,551
Boy, where did you get that wooden doll?

32
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,511
I found it up in the mountain.

33
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:05,392
Would you like to trade it for this?

34
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:06,936
Yes.

35
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:18,155
This is a relic cursed with sorcery.

36
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,582
-What was that?
-What was that?

37
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,710
That was a dangerous item
created with sorcery.

38
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,046
I know what they are.
They are called relics.

39
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,465
Jinyowon has lots of them.

40
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:39,385
That is right.

41
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:42,304
Inside Jinyowon, there are relics
that are much more dangerous.

42
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,975
There, you will find many peculiar items

43
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:48,352
that were made
with the power of the ice stone.

44
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:59,697
They sit there waiting for an opportunity
to come out into the world again.

45
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,795
Should I take you in?

46
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:16,755
No, thank you.

47
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:20,676
I may be a filthy girl
whom everyone avoids,

48
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,138
but I refuse to serve just anyone.

49
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:26,390
Damn it. How dare she.

50
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,892
She should have been grateful.

51
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:32,604
This batch of cinnamon and ginger wine
has quite a strong scent of cinnamon.

52
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,940
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

53
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:39,611
It smells of cinnamon.

54
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,533
That impudent girl.

55
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:46,118
Is there something bothering you?

56
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:48,912
The filth from Filthy Mu-deok
must have gotten on me.

57
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:51,373
The stench will not go away.

58
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,917
It smells wonderful.

59
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:58,839
Forget it. Get out.

60
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:00,841
Leave already.

61
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:02,426
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

62
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,853
I showed her mercy
and saved her from trouble.

63
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:15,022
I even gave her my sachet
and a silk dress.

64
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,074
How ungrateful of her.

65
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:32,748
-I am grateful.
-I told you to leaveâ€¦

66
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:40,756
Filthy Mu-deok?

67
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,299
How did you get in here?

68
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:46,303
I have that sachet you gave me.

69
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,266
You must be here
because you need something from me again.

70
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,936
You have been thinking about me,
Your Royal Highness,

71
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,104
so I came to see you.

72
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,314
Are you saying you can read my mind?

73
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:01,860
Good.

74
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:07,491
Have a glass of cinnamon and ginger wine
that is a lot stronger than the last one.

75
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,544
It smells wonderful.

76
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,421
It does?

77
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:29,471
I must say, I really like this place.

78
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:34,685
I hope you continue to think of me
just like you did today.

79
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,146
I will come to visit whenever you do.

80
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,243
The palace is a great place.

81
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,707
You get to dress in silk,

82
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,170
and it is filled with different kinds
of aromatic wine.

83
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,466
But do you know
why I keep thinking of you?

84
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,138
Because you are Filthy Mu-deok.

85
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,268
But right now, you do not reek of filth.

86
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:19,688
Your Royal Highness.

87
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:20,647
Who are you?

88
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,867
You caught me.

89
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,216
Something wicked just came in here.

90
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:48,759
-Search around.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

91
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:55,682
Why did it show up looking like Mu-deok?

92
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,067
Search every corner again.

93
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,443
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

94
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,241
The Crown Prince is here.

95
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:14,284
The Crown Prince?

96
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,960
I am in search of someone.

97
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:24,795
I was told that she would be here.

98
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:29,466
Is there something going on?
There seems to be a disturbance.

99
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,303
A maid caused trouble and disappeared,
so we were looking for her.

100
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,388
A maid?

101
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:36,223
She does not work for us.

102
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:38,475
Her name is Mu-deok.
She serves the Jang family.

103
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,185
She is whom I am looking for.

104
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:42,729
Did something happen?

105
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:45,482
That maidâ€¦

106
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:49,903
accidentally broke the yin-and-yang jade
that was going to be used

107
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:51,822
to make my wedding rings.

108
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,745
I told you to be careful.

109
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,163
What will you do now?

110
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:02,082
I apologize, my lady.

111
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,959
Please forgive me.

112
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:06,295
I will ask her owner to come here.

113
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:08,463
Take her away
and lock her up in the annex.

114
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:12,593
I am sorry!

115
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,469
Forgive me, my lady!

116
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:16,763
She must have been scared
about getting punished.

117
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,058
While she was locked up,
she stole the jade and ran away.

118
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:26,356
Seeing as we still have not found her,

119
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,276
it looks as if she has
already fled this place.

120
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,738
She got scared and ran away?

121
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,115
A bold girl like her?

122
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:39,745
Mages from Jeongjingak are here to visit.

123
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,173
Your Royal Highness, what brings you here?

124
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:52,841
What about you, Yul?

125
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:54,426
To look for someone.

126
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,971
Did you also come here
looking for Mu-deok?

127
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,514
Yes.

128
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,975
I am here for Mu-deok.

129
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:12,194
She broke the yin-and-yang jade,

130
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:14,571
then ran away with it
to avoid getting punished.

131
00:10:15,238 --> 00:10:18,700
But why did you not
get the wedding rings made?

132
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:23,580
I went to Chwiseonru to lend you my hand,
but I heard you already had left.

133
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:27,459
I just decided to postpone it.

134
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:31,421
Yul, why are you looking for Mu-deok?

135
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:35,884
I also saw the exact same illusion as you,
Your Royal Highness.

136
00:10:55,695 --> 00:10:57,322
How did you enter Songrim?

137
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,494
I came because you kept longing for me.

138
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:06,915
What do you mean?

139
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,585
You were longing for
the one you met at Danhyanggok.

140
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,087
Stop fooling around.

141
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,463
I was longing for you?

142
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:16,007
-I have never done that.
-You are lying.

143
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:17,926
You kept the whistle.

144
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,182
The broken leg did not bother you.

145
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,853
And you were not scared to get scolded.

146
00:11:30,063 --> 00:11:31,898
Because you liked her a lot.

147
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:39,781
Continue to think about her like that.

148
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:49,124
Then I will come to see you.

149
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:56,089
Youâ€¦

150
00:11:56,965 --> 00:11:57,966
are not human.

151
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:10,812
Are you going to get rid of me?

152
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,274
Then you will never get to see me again.

153
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:47,390
It was not her. It was an illusion.

154
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:51,645
Does that mean
what I saw was also an illusion?

155
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:54,523
It was odd, so I went to Chwiseonru
looking for Mu-deok.

156
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:56,650
They told me she was dragged here.

157
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,111
She was not dragged here.
She was here to run an errand.

158
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:03,532
And she disappeared
with something precious.

159
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,118
We are in search of a thief,
not an illusion.

160
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,917
There is her owner.

161
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:32,352
Is Master Lee not here today again?

162
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:35,146
He is a man who wanders like the wind.

163
00:13:35,855 --> 00:13:37,357
He left me the dog and left.

164
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,069
Was Gwigu also made from the ice stone?

165
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:44,948
Master Seo Gyeong made this
with the energy from the ice stone

166
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:47,158
in hopes of finding traces of sorcery.

167
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,912
Uk broke Gwigu's pottery,

168
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,999
so Master Lee
summoned the spirit from Jinyowon

169
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,334
and put it inside this dog.

170
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,713
Do you really not know
where Master Seo Gyeong

171
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,132
sealed the ice stone?

172
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:04,968
I do not know.

173
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:08,847
Do you think the alchemy of souls
started to occur again

174
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,099
because someone managed
to unseal the ice stone?

175
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:15,979
The only way for someone to shift souls
without mastering Hwansu

176
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,231
is by using the ice stone.

177
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:21,568
I am certain that someone
unsealed the ice stone

178
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:23,778
and brought it out into the world again.

179
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,073
Well, that is not good.

180
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:31,286
We cannot let the disaster
from 200 years ago repeat itself.

181
00:14:32,787 --> 00:14:35,916
We must find the ice stone.

182
00:14:45,592 --> 00:14:48,094
I was given orders to give this to you.

183
00:14:58,396 --> 00:15:01,149
I thought you were
going to lie low for a while.

184
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:04,611
Are you planning on
shifting another person's soul?

185
00:15:08,531 --> 00:15:10,367
Tell them that I safely received this.

186
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:12,494
I will.

187
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,920
Hurry up and find a eunuch
who can replace him.

188
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:27,842
Your soul will be shifted into that body,
so choose wisely.

189
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,094
Yes, sir.

190
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,180
I did not serve the Danju

191
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:34,265
just to shift my soul
into a eunuch's body.

192
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:38,353
I will use Naksu

193
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:40,772
to get the body I want.

194
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:52,200
My maid has committed a disgraceful act.

195
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,703
I am fully responsible as her master.

196
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:57,163
I apologize.

197
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,087
You must be upset about having lost
the jade to be used for the wedding rings.

198
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:07,632
I pleaded to my mother
for that yin-and-yang jade.

199
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:10,593
Yin-and-yang jade wedding rings

200
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:12,846
allow couples to have
a long and happy marriage.

201
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:15,181
But it is broken now.

202
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,434
I did not know that
it held such a deep meaning.

203
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:19,894
I must say, I am upset too.

204
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:25,483
We will find you a more valuable jade
for the wedding rings.

205
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:30,864
I appreciate your sincere apology.

206
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:33,658
-You may all leave now.
-Thank you.

207
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,659
I cannot do that.

208
00:16:36,953 --> 00:16:38,204
I need to find Mu-deok.

209
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:43,418
I want to find that wicked maid

210
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:46,129
and have her return the yin-and-yang jade.

211
00:16:46,963 --> 00:16:50,717
She is weak and she has short legs,
so she will not have traveled far.

212
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,346
I would like your permission to stay
and look for her myself.

213
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:01,311
You have my permission.

214
00:17:02,228 --> 00:17:03,271
Thank you.

215
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:07,275
Now that I have your permission,
I would like you to open the door.

216
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,154
Open the door to Jinyowon,

217
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:13,990
where relics and artifacts reside.

218
00:17:33,676 --> 00:17:37,097
Jinyowon's entrance can only be opened
by a member of the Jin family.

219
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,142
Right now, Cho-yeon and I are
the only ones who can open this door.

220
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,062
There is no way she is in there.

221
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:45,647
I saw Mu-deok's illusion.

222
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,026
Maybe you were dreaming.

223
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,988
How can you be sure that
it was an illusion created by a relic?

224
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,031
I saw it too.

225
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,785
It was an illusion disguised as Mu-deok.

226
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:04,124
All the relics that have the power
to create illusions are inside Jinyowon.

227
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:05,500
Let us go inside and check.

228
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:08,920
All right. I will open the door.

229
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:14,259
However, this place is filled
with dangerous relics and artifacts.

230
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,846
You could be possessed by sorcery
and be unable to return.

231
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,641
Young Master, it is too dangerous.

232
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,519
I will go with him.

233
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,274
As will I.

234
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,321
It sounds fun.

235
00:18:35,947 --> 00:18:38,449
When will I get a chance
to enter Jinyowon again?

236
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,184
Go on inside.

237
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:05,810
I will give you an hour.

238
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:22,952
We should tell the leader.

239
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:28,124
Mu-deok.

240
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,335
Mu-deok!

241
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:37,884
So this is Jinyowon.

242
00:19:38,676 --> 00:19:42,764
They say everything here is so precious.
Not a single one can be bought with money.

243
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:45,225
Will you please be quiet?
We are not here on a tour.

244
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:47,477
You are not the owner.

245
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:51,689
But I guess that could change
if you marry into the Jin family.

246
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:54,651
Lucky you.

247
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:57,403
All these precious treasures
will become yours, Jin Uk.

248
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,658
If you envy me so much,
you can marry into this family instead.

249
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,995
But even if you do become the owner,
how will you control anything?

250
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,330
You are a low-level mage.

251
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:09,749
If you are so great,
can you touch anything here?

252
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,628
The leader of Jinyowon told us
not to touch anything.

253
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:16,714
What an excuse.
You are just too scared to touch them.

254
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,055
-Damn it.
-What was that?

255
00:20:24,138 --> 00:20:25,556
I do not know. What was that?

256
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:28,434
Are you all right?

257
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:30,603
Something odd must be in there.

258
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:33,189
Were you not startled?

259
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,775
I was startled.

260
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:38,778
It is dark in here, so be careful.

261
00:20:41,864 --> 00:20:43,324
Was he really startled?

262
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,868
Yes. When Yul gets startled,
he loses his sense of direction.

263
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:47,161
Yul, do not go that way!

264
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:49,831
It is the other way.

265
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:52,625
We must go that way.

266
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:58,548
Let us all be careful.

267
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:03,177
Yul is always so calm,

268
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:06,347
but he can be a scatterbrain
when he is startled too.

269
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:08,016
I guess so.

270
00:21:13,688 --> 00:21:15,189
Just make sure to be careful.

271
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,692
Be careful yourself.

272
00:21:19,193 --> 00:21:20,611
Wait for me.

273
00:21:57,732 --> 00:21:59,484
How did I get stuck in here?

274
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,705
I should have held it in.

275
00:22:14,373 --> 00:22:16,375
I should not have provoked her.

276
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:19,879
I told you to be careful.

277
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:23,007
You wait here.
Young Master Jang will be here soon.

278
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:26,219
Young Lady Jin,
what is going to happen to me now?

279
00:22:26,302 --> 00:22:29,388
What do you think?
You will be severely punished.

280
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:32,433
No, that is not what I am worried about.

281
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,228
They say whoever breaks
the yin-and-yang jade

282
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:38,064
will never have
a long-lasting relationship.

283
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,943
What am I going to do now?

284
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,987
What do you mean?

285
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:46,405
Stop talking nonsense.

286
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,283
If you break the yin-and-yang jade,

287
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,411
they say the person you love
will never love you back.

288
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:55,915
I heard all the gisaengs
at Chwiseonru saying that.

289
00:22:55,998 --> 00:22:58,501
Is that true?

290
00:22:58,584 --> 00:22:59,710
Yes.

291
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:04,173
Did you not know that, Young Lady Jin?

292
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,342
That cannot be.

293
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,513
Then what is going to happen to me?

294
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:15,893
Why are you worried

295
00:23:16,602 --> 00:23:18,354
when I was the one who broke it?

296
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:24,777
You broke the jade, did you not?

297
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,781
You made me carry it
so you could blame it on me.

298
00:23:29,657 --> 00:23:30,616
Am I right?

299
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:35,454
If you felt so wronged, you should have
said something to my mother.

300
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:38,416
Had I humiliated her daughter
in front of everyone,

301
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,377
she would not have forgiven me.

302
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:43,254
I am not scared of you,

303
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:47,466
but I am scared of your mother,
the leader of Jinyowon.

304
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:52,263
Are you that afraid of your mother?

305
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:55,766
It is true that I fear my mother,
but I hate you just as much.

306
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:57,935
I will sell you.

307
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:01,230
Like you said, my mother is a scary woman.

308
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:04,692
You will get sold
as punishment for having broken the jade.

309
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:06,485
To place far away!

310
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:49,403
Did she run away?

311
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,145
Should I try climbing over this wall?

312
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,769
How did she open the door to Jinyowon?

313
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,988
So this is Jinyowon.

314
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:21,120
If she gets locked inside, she might die.

315
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:49,065
Hey.

316
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,823
So it is you.

317
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:03,537
It has been a long time.

318
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:32,191
You cannot leave.

319
00:27:34,193 --> 00:27:35,444
It will not break.

320
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,614
Nothing will work!

321
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,994
Be quiet.

322
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,925
Could she have died since she is
incapable of practicing spells?

323
00:27:59,093 --> 00:28:00,970
If they saw her as an illusionâ€¦

324
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:06,142
Young Lady Jin.

325
00:28:07,393 --> 00:28:11,313
Every time you move, I hear a sound.

326
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,316
It soundsâ€¦

327
00:28:14,817 --> 00:28:17,069
like jade clinking against each other.

328
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,084
Mu-deok!

329
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:42,636
The hour is up. We must leave.

330
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,014
I am not going. I must find her.

331
00:28:45,097 --> 00:28:48,476
This place is too big and deep.
The three of us cannot find her here.

332
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,812
You only came in here for a tour,
so you may go ahead and leave.

333
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:55,483
How did you see an illusion of Mu-deok?

334
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,319
I do not know where it came from.

335
00:28:58,819 --> 00:29:00,029
Butâ€¦

336
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,451
I came because you kept longing for me.

337
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:06,619
That is right.

338
00:29:06,702 --> 00:29:07,870
She said that to me too.

339
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,997
That she came because I thought of her.

340
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,834
So her illusion comes to see you
if you think about her?

341
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:15,836
I guess you did not see it.

342
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,088
She visited me and Yul,

343
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:20,758
but she did not visit you
even though you are her owner.

344
00:29:20,841 --> 00:29:23,636
Why in the world
were you thinking about Mu-deok?

345
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,683
I was drinking cinnamon and ginger wine.

346
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:32,770
Were you the one who got her drunk
and made her reek of cinnamon?

347
00:29:32,853 --> 00:29:33,813
That is correct.

348
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,774
I also gave her a sachet that day.

349
00:29:36,857 --> 00:29:39,693
The smell of cinnamon
probably came from the sachet.

350
00:29:40,694 --> 00:29:41,946
Oh, you mean the sachet

351
00:29:42,738 --> 00:29:45,407
that she hung by the outhouse
to get rid of flies?

352
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,493
"By the outhouse"?

353
00:29:47,576 --> 00:29:50,871
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.
It really helped shoo away the flies.

354
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,334
Yul, what were you doing
when you saw her illusion?

355
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,338
The mirror.

356
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:03,092
-My mirror broke.
-So did the one in my room.

357
00:30:05,928 --> 00:30:07,763
Did it come from the mirror?

358
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,267
A mirror?

359
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:17,773
Could this be it?

360
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:31,161
That is not you. It is fake.

361
00:30:31,245 --> 00:30:32,454
It is an illusion.

362
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,840
So it was you.

363
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:50,723
She is trapped inside the mirror?

364
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:52,808
Yes.

365
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,978
We cannot see what is inside,
but we are sure she is in there.

366
00:30:56,645 --> 00:30:57,855
She was sucked into the Mirror of Longing.

367
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,274
"The Mirror of Longing"?

368
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:02,735
It is a relic that creates illusions.

369
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,695
It uses other mirrors

370
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:07,364
to show illusions of things
that people long for.

371
00:31:08,657 --> 00:31:11,201
She knows no spells,
so she probably got sucked inside

372
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:12,661
while she was in front of it.

373
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:16,707
We need to get Mu-deok out of the mirror.

374
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:20,252
Our spells will not work
because the energy in there is too strong.

375
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,464
Please take the Mirror of Longing
out of Jinyowon.

376
00:31:24,506 --> 00:31:25,674
That cannot be done.

377
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:28,969
That relic swallowed a human.

378
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,013
It is too dangerous to take it outside.

379
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,266
I order you as the Crown Prince.

380
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,476
Take out the Mirror of Longing.

381
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:41,732
The Unanimous Assembly has granted us
a plaque to protect Jinyowon

382
00:31:41,815 --> 00:31:43,943
from a situation like this.

383
00:31:46,862 --> 00:31:50,157
I cannot take it out
even if it is the King's orders.

384
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:54,495
Uk will not leaveâ€¦

385
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,956
without Mu-deok.

386
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,500
Then he will have to stay inside.

387
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:02,711
Once the hour is over,

388
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,672
I am going to seal this door.

389
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,717
Mother.

390
00:32:09,593 --> 00:32:11,595
I found the yin-and-yang jade.

391
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:16,976
Mu-deok must not have stolen it.

392
00:32:18,018 --> 00:32:19,561
Now that I found the jade,

393
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:22,147
please take out the Mirror of Longing
and get Mu-deok out of there.

394
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,942
Young Master Jang will die
if he gets locked inside.

395
00:32:25,734 --> 00:32:26,819
Stay out of this.

396
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:31,865
Once the agreed time is over,
I shall seal the door.

397
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:49,091
Do not waste your energy.

398
00:32:49,174 --> 00:32:51,260
You know you do not have
the power to break it.

399
00:32:51,343 --> 00:32:53,262
Shut it! You are nothing but an illusion.

400
00:32:53,345 --> 00:32:55,848
That is right. I am an illusion.

401
00:32:57,099 --> 00:32:58,934
An illusion that reflects who you are.

402
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:06,316
Humans are incapable
of seeing themselves with their own eyes.

403
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,777
The only way is
to see themselves through a mirror.

404
00:33:09,945 --> 00:33:12,448
So the perception you have about yourself

405
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,242
is nothing but an illusion.

406
00:33:18,954 --> 00:33:21,999
The same goes for how others perceive you.

407
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:26,879
They only see what they want to see
and create an illusion that suits them.

408
00:33:29,548 --> 00:33:30,883
It is all just an illusion.

409
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,926
If what you say is true,

410
00:33:34,094 --> 00:33:36,597
that means people
only see illusions and nothing else.

411
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:38,849
That is right.

412
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:42,728
I turn into what they want to see the most
and show it to them.

413
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,734
I shall do the same for you.

414
00:33:56,158 --> 00:33:57,701
Give me your energy.

415
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,827
Then I willâ€¦

416
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:02,414
turn you into
the most perfect version of yourself.

417
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,213
Butâ€¦

418
00:34:10,714 --> 00:34:13,717
you need my reflection
to create that so-called illusion.

419
00:34:14,968 --> 00:34:16,136
What?

420
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,514
If there is nothing to reflect,

421
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,934
a mirror becomes useless.

422
00:34:42,287 --> 00:34:44,832
You are nothing but a piece of glass.

423
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:48,168
That is enough babbling from you.

424
00:34:49,336 --> 00:34:50,587
Mu-deok!

425
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:53,340
Are you in there?

426
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:56,135
Mu-deok!

427
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,887
Uk.

428
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,683
Uk!

429
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,311
Uk, I am in here!

430
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:09,773
I found you.

431
00:35:17,197 --> 00:35:18,824
The time is up.

432
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:21,660
Cho-yeon, seal that door.

433
00:35:21,743 --> 00:35:22,828
Mother.

434
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:26,415
-Do it now.
-Please wait.

435
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,887
I would like to go inside.

436
00:35:41,346 --> 00:35:43,307
If the relic cannot be brought outside,

437
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:47,769
I will go in there myself
and get her out of the Mirror of Longing.

438
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:50,939
How can I trust a high-level mage
to set foot in there?

439
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,316
Trust me.

440
00:35:53,108 --> 00:35:55,694
I will not touch any other artifacts.

441
00:35:55,777 --> 00:35:57,154
I am not sure if I can.

442
00:35:57,237 --> 00:36:00,532
My trust was once broken
by a Songrim mage.

443
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:06,079
Have you ever allowed
a Songrim mage to enter Jinyowon?

444
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:10,709
If you want to save Jang Uk,

445
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:14,546
you will have to ask mages
from Jeongjingak to drag him out of there.

446
00:36:18,717 --> 00:36:19,760
My lord.

447
00:36:19,843 --> 00:36:21,011
We are running out of time.

448
00:36:24,556 --> 00:36:26,934
Yul, I want you to go in there

449
00:36:27,684 --> 00:36:29,269
and bring Uk out.

450
00:36:34,816 --> 00:36:35,943
Mu-deok.

451
00:36:37,027 --> 00:36:38,362
While you were gone,

452
00:36:39,613 --> 00:36:41,240
I thought aboutâ€¦

453
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,243
what I could do

454
00:36:45,577 --> 00:36:47,663
to keep you by my side.

455
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,834
If I become Cheonbugwan's Gwanju,

456
00:36:54,753 --> 00:36:56,421
you can be the Assistant Gwanju.

457
00:36:57,339 --> 00:36:59,007
Why would I want that?

458
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,760
You said you did not want
to stay by my side as just a maid.

459
00:37:01,843 --> 00:37:04,680
We cannot tell anyone
that you are my master.

460
00:37:04,763 --> 00:37:07,307
But you can stay
if you become the Assistant Gwanju.

461
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,519
Cheonbugwan's Gwanju
keeping a soul shifter by his side?

462
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,689
You must be mad.

463
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,278
I thought about it
after I heard about my marriage.

464
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,239
"He finally has a way out."

465
00:37:23,323 --> 00:37:25,075
"But how will I manage without him?"

466
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,745
I bet you thought that and felt lost.

467
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,336
But now that you are not here,

468
00:37:38,672 --> 00:37:39,965
I feel just as lost.

469
00:37:54,896 --> 00:37:56,064
Mu-deok.

470
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,443
I miss you.

471
00:38:33,435 --> 00:38:35,187
Feign ignorance even if I get caught.

472
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:38,857
No one here will let that thing attack me.

473
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,907
Then do me a favor, Uk.

474
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,867
Take me up there.

475
00:38:49,534 --> 00:38:50,369
Fine.

476
00:38:50,452 --> 00:38:53,914
I will take you to the top of that tree.

477
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,697
Mu-deok.

478
00:39:28,198 --> 00:39:29,199
What is happening?

479
00:39:31,493 --> 00:39:32,661
She is here!

480
00:39:32,744 --> 00:39:33,954
Who?

481
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,498
It is her, the blind girl!

482
00:39:37,332 --> 00:39:38,708
It is the ice stone!

483
00:39:43,004 --> 00:39:44,506
The mirror is going to shatter.

484
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:46,133
Step away.

485
00:40:49,863 --> 00:40:50,906
Young Master.

486
00:40:51,406 --> 00:40:52,657
Mu-deok.

487
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,076
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I am fine.

488
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,078
-Is Mu-deok all right as well?
-Of course.

489
00:41:26,316 --> 00:41:28,902
I fell while bringing out
the yin-and-yang jade.

490
00:41:30,028 --> 00:41:32,364
I think that was when the jade broke.

491
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,493
So you tried to blame a maid
for the already-broken jade.

492
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:39,579
And the Mirror of Longing?

493
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,707
It was next to me when I fell,

494
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,501
but I did not even touch it.

495
00:41:45,126 --> 00:41:48,171
Uk is not strong enough
to break the Mirror of Longing.

496
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,549
Then I must have

497
00:41:50,632 --> 00:41:53,802
harmed the mirror as I fell.

498
00:41:57,931 --> 00:41:59,266
Did you also

499
00:42:00,058 --> 00:42:02,978
lock Mu-deok inside Jinyowon?

500
00:42:03,061 --> 00:42:06,690
I did seal the door,
but she walked inside herself.

501
00:42:06,773 --> 00:42:10,527
Those who are not members
of the Jin family cannot open that door.

502
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:13,697
Are you saying Mu-deok opened it?

503
00:42:15,782 --> 00:42:17,200
Then I must have

504
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,786
opened the door.

505
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,456
I just saw her go inside
and locked her in there out of anger.

506
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,168
I apologize.

507
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,088
I will tell everyone

508
00:42:31,673 --> 00:42:34,593
to keep things quiet.

509
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:40,140
I shall also stay silent about this
to help you save face.

510
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:43,143
I am truly sorry.

511
00:42:47,063 --> 00:42:48,315
Are you all right?

512
00:42:49,065 --> 00:42:50,400
Can you still not see?

513
00:42:52,235 --> 00:42:53,153
No.

514
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,989
I saw a really bright light
when the mirror broke.

515
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,158
I cannot seem to open my eyes.

516
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,371
We should cover your eyes then.

517
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,126
Here.

518
00:43:12,547 --> 00:43:16,343
If you stare at the sun for too long,
you are not able to see for a while.

519
00:43:17,093 --> 00:43:18,303
You will recover soon.

520
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,556
I am sorry for this.

521
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,600
You did nothing wrong.

522
00:43:24,392 --> 00:43:25,977
Young Lady Jin is at fault.

523
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,490
Mu-deok, are you all right?

524
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:41,785
What are you doing here,
Young Master Park?

525
00:43:43,578 --> 00:43:44,996
I came because I was worried.

526
00:43:45,622 --> 00:43:46,998
I see you have hurt your eyes.

527
00:43:47,582 --> 00:43:49,209
Young Master Seo, you came as well?

528
00:43:53,713 --> 00:43:56,841
You should get treated at Sejukwon.
I will take you there right now.

529
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,843
The palace is near, so she can go there.

530
00:43:59,344 --> 00:44:01,596
Your Royal Highness? You are here too?

531
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,853
I will take you to the royal clinic.

532
00:44:09,479 --> 00:44:10,855
That is not necessary.

533
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:14,192
She was just blinded by the light.
She did not get hurt.

534
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:18,363
I know you did not plan any of this,
but they came here for you.

535
00:44:18,446 --> 00:44:21,157
So you should apologize and thank them.

536
00:44:24,202 --> 00:44:25,662
I apologize for troubling you.

537
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:27,831
Thank you all.

538
00:44:40,301 --> 00:44:41,428
Young Master.

539
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:44,055
Let us go home.

540
00:45:08,246 --> 00:45:10,206
After what happened today,

541
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:14,210
I do not know
if their marriage will proceed.

542
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,670
Did you hear what she said?

543
00:45:16,504 --> 00:45:19,507
She was ready to seal the door
even though Young Master was inside.

544
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:21,259
How terrifying.

545
00:45:21,342 --> 00:45:24,345
It makes me uneasy that he will live
with a mother-in-law like her.

546
00:45:24,429 --> 00:45:26,514
She made that choice to protect Jinyowon.

547
00:45:27,265 --> 00:45:29,267
When you have a lot to protect,

548
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,479
you sometimes have no choice
but to be heartless.

549
00:45:33,146 --> 00:45:34,314
Thenâ€¦

550
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,941
would you have done the same?

551
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:41,237
I would say you and I are pretty close.

552
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,741
What if I got locked inside?
Would you seal the door?

553
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:46,534
So heartlessly?

554
00:45:51,164 --> 00:45:52,290
My goodness.

555
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:54,375
It seems like you would.

556
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,879
Even if it means I might die in there?

557
00:45:57,962 --> 00:46:00,423
Do not put me in a difficult spot
over something

558
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,259
that has not even happened.

559
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,178
I am not even actually locked inside.

560
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,306
Does it hurt for you to lie and tell me

561
00:46:08,389 --> 00:46:10,600
-that you will never seal the door?
-I cannot

562
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,646
lie to you.

563
00:46:16,606 --> 00:46:17,774
Right.

564
00:46:18,816 --> 00:46:20,860
That is what someone like you must do.

565
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,450
You should say hello to Young Master Jang.

566
00:46:28,117 --> 00:46:31,913
No. I have nothing to say to him.

567
00:46:33,122 --> 00:46:35,291
I cannot lie
and act like everything is fine.

568
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:39,170
Of course. Thank you for today.

569
00:46:39,754 --> 00:46:40,588
Goodbye.

570
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,349
Maidservant Kimâ€¦

571
00:46:53,726 --> 00:46:55,311
If I ever have to seal the door,

572
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,439
it would shatter my heartâ€¦

573
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,527
to pieces.

574
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:12,954
He is inflexible and slow-witted.

575
00:47:15,164 --> 00:47:17,792
"How could I seal the door
if you are inside?"

576
00:47:19,252 --> 00:47:21,379
Could you not have said that?

577
00:47:36,686 --> 00:47:37,937
What you did was dangerous.

578
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:41,441
Entering Jinyowon

579
00:47:41,524 --> 00:47:44,110
was recklessly childish
and stubborn of you.

580
00:47:44,193 --> 00:47:45,778
Do not be so angry.

581
00:47:47,363 --> 00:47:49,365
You may think I am pathetic,

582
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,576
but that is an illusion.

583
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,454
What?

584
00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:56,706
The mirror I saw inside Jinyowon told me

585
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,167
that people only see

586
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,502
what they wish to see.

587
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,504
That it is an illusion.

588
00:48:03,588 --> 00:48:05,757
Are you saying I see you as an illusion?

589
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,924
If not,

590
00:48:08,134 --> 00:48:10,178
why do you not want me to do anything?

591
00:48:13,556 --> 00:48:15,266
All my life, I tried so hard

592
00:48:16,267 --> 00:48:18,645
to prove to everyone
that I was my father's son.

593
00:48:18,728 --> 00:48:19,687
Butâ€¦

594
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,231
you told me I was not.

595
00:48:22,315 --> 00:48:24,275
Though it hurt, it got rid of my illusion.

596
00:48:24,984 --> 00:48:26,486
But even after that,

597
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:28,738
why do you want me to stay as an illusion?

598
00:48:28,821 --> 00:48:30,323
I do not care what you stay as.

599
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,326
I only wish for one thing.

600
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:35,787
And that is for youâ€¦

601
00:48:37,288 --> 00:48:38,831
to be safe.

602
00:48:43,169 --> 00:48:46,631
The illusion I tried so hard to prove
no longer exists.

603
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,343
So from now on,

604
00:48:51,844 --> 00:48:53,346
I am going to try even harder

605
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,182
to find out who I really am

606
00:48:57,725 --> 00:48:59,227
and what I must do from now on.

607
00:49:30,591 --> 00:49:31,884
Can you see now?

608
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,762
Yes, I can see.

609
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,518
What?

610
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:42,895
I was told the mirror made illusions.

611
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:45,815
I am checking
if it is really you that I saved.

612
00:49:47,191 --> 00:49:49,610
You did not save me.
I broke it and got out myself.

613
00:49:50,486 --> 00:49:51,320
What?

614
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:53,156
When I was trapped inside the mirror,

615
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:56,075
I regained my power for a bit
just like how I did

616
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,910
in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

617
00:49:58,911 --> 00:50:01,205
I am sure I broke the mirror
with my own power.

618
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:02,874
So that was how you got out?

619
00:50:02,957 --> 00:50:05,042
I was excited thinking it was me.

620
00:50:05,126 --> 00:50:06,210
Not even close.

621
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,921
You should be grateful
that the mirror did not suck you in.

622
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:12,008
I even thought about that
because you were still inside.

623
00:50:12,091 --> 00:50:13,634
What a futile idea.

624
00:50:14,135 --> 00:50:16,053
It would not have traded you for me.

625
00:50:16,137 --> 00:50:18,473
What if it did?
Then would it not have been futile?

626
00:50:18,556 --> 00:50:19,932
Well, I would have survived.

627
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:21,350
And I would have died.

628
00:50:23,102 --> 00:50:26,105
Listen to me, my pupil.
When there is no other way,

629
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,400
the best deal is
to sacrifice yourself and save me.

630
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,818
No way.

631
00:50:32,278 --> 00:50:33,654
If I die, you should die too.

632
00:50:33,738 --> 00:50:35,406
You cannot live on your own.

633
00:50:37,074 --> 00:50:38,743
You have no other choice.

634
00:50:38,826 --> 00:50:42,038
When you put your pupil in danger,
your life should be at risk too.

635
00:50:42,955 --> 00:50:45,041
Fine. I will keep that in mind.

636
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,835
Then what will happen
to marrying the woman

637
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:50,630
who almost had your master killed?

638
00:50:51,672 --> 00:50:55,134
Marrying her will
surely guarantee my safety.

639
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,764
But you almost lost your life,

640
00:51:00,389 --> 00:51:02,183
so I should risk my life too.

641
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,566
This is a marriage of convenience.

642
00:51:11,192 --> 00:51:14,237
So let us resolve our issues
after the wedding.

643
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,864
The reason you need
a son-in-law like me is that

644
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,283
I am the eldest of the Jang family

645
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,369
and the next potential Gwanju
of Cheonbugwan.

646
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,372
Our families will come together
and become stronger.

647
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:28,376
Yes. Because this is
a marriage of convenience,

648
00:51:29,168 --> 00:51:31,629
we should be open
about our strengths and weaknesses.

649
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:34,924
Apparently, I am not the son
of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju, Jang Gang.

650
00:51:37,802 --> 00:51:39,804
I do not care about such rumors.

651
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,100
But what if that rumor

652
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:46,352
turns out to be true?

653
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,190
Think about whether or not you are willing

654
00:51:51,941 --> 00:51:54,819
to take that risk
and take me in as your son-in-law.

655
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,542
I see you still have
the binding bracelet on you.

656
00:52:12,461 --> 00:52:13,588
Yes.

657
00:52:16,549 --> 00:52:18,676
He is still impudent as ever.

658
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:31,731
Why did you decide to marry Cho-yeon off
without even discussing it with me?

659
00:52:32,857 --> 00:52:36,235
Who are you to meddle
in our family matters?

660
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,445
Ho-gyeong.

661
00:52:39,363 --> 00:52:41,073
I am also a member of the Jin family.

662
00:52:42,825 --> 00:52:47,455
The surname "Jin" is only given to those
with mothers from the Jin family.

663
00:52:48,706 --> 00:52:52,418
My mother was a fool to have given
our family surname to someone

664
00:52:53,085 --> 00:52:55,254
who my father begot out of wedlock.

665
00:52:55,963 --> 00:52:58,883
You kicked me out as soon as you became
the leader of Jinyowon.

666
00:53:00,134 --> 00:53:02,511
Do you still resent me that much?

667
00:53:02,595 --> 00:53:03,721
I do not resent you.

668
00:53:04,847 --> 00:53:06,390
I detest you.

669
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,063
I detest how treacherous you are.

670
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:19,111
The leader of Jinyowon should not
make decisions based on preference.

671
00:53:20,404 --> 00:53:22,907
Choosing Jang Uk was the wrong decision.

672
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,408
Cancel the marriage.

673
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,701
What?

674
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:30,247
I will give you
a better card than Jang Uk.

675
00:53:30,998 --> 00:53:32,375
How about the Crown Prince

676
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:34,835
as your son-in-law?

677
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:42,093
You want the Crown Prince
to marry into our family and live with us?

678
00:53:42,843 --> 00:53:44,512
Cho-yeon is the second daughter.

679
00:53:44,595 --> 00:53:47,139
Bu-yeon is the eldest
and will lead the family.

680
00:53:48,015 --> 00:53:50,226
Her future husband will
move in with the family,

681
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:51,894
so it is unnecessary for Cho-yeon.

682
00:53:53,437 --> 00:53:57,608
What are you scheming?
How dare you talk about Bu-yeon.

683
00:54:02,363 --> 00:54:05,908
I know that your husband is
still looking for Bu-yeon.

684
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:09,203
As the Assistant Gwanju of Cheonbugwan,

685
00:54:09,286 --> 00:54:12,081
I will do everything in my power
to help you find the daughter

686
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,166
you hopelessly long for.

687
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:19,922
I will make Bu-yeon the leader of Jinyowon
and make Cho-yeon become the queen.

688
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,007
So please

689
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:22,925
do not have her marry Uk.

690
00:54:25,469 --> 00:54:26,721
I, your brother,

691
00:54:27,471 --> 00:54:30,933
will become Cheonbugwan's Gwanju
and give great support to Jinyowon.

692
00:54:32,393 --> 00:54:34,478
After all, I am a member
of the Jin family.

693
00:54:49,702 --> 00:54:52,663
Yul, there is something I find quite odd.

694
00:54:53,372 --> 00:54:55,374
Why were you thinking about Mu-deok?

695
00:54:56,709 --> 00:54:58,419
I was not thinking about Mu-deok.

696
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:02,423
I also do not understand
why that illusion showed up as Mu-deok

697
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,217
-and said those things.
-What did it say?

698
00:55:05,968 --> 00:55:07,136
Hey, Yul.

699
00:55:07,219 --> 00:55:08,596
We have to go this way.

700
00:55:09,221 --> 00:55:11,974
Why do you keep wandering?
What startled you?

701
00:55:16,645 --> 00:55:18,022
I will be all right.

702
00:55:20,858 --> 00:55:22,276
Oh, dear.

703
00:55:25,529 --> 00:55:26,906
Delivery packages.

704
00:55:27,656 --> 00:55:31,911
Young Lady Jin's marriage gifts will
probably get delivered to Songrim today.

705
00:55:32,703 --> 00:55:34,580
It is best that no one sees them.

706
00:55:35,664 --> 00:55:37,124
I should keep them safe.

707
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:52,556
The bird! Catch the bird!

708
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,933
-Oh, gosh!
-Run!

709
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,976
-Darn it.
-Where did it fly to?

710
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:59,188
-Come on.
-It is over there!

711
00:56:00,272 --> 00:56:01,816
-Gosh.
-Darn it.

712
00:56:02,775 --> 00:56:04,944
-Hey.
-Over there!

713
00:56:39,103 --> 00:56:40,980
Naksu has the ability to shift souls.

714
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:47,153
If Naksu shifted souls,
she is probably still alive somewhere.

715
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,121
You were longing for
the one you met at Danhyanggok.

716
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:00,708
Continue to think about her like that.

717
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,794
Then I will come to see you.

718
00:57:05,379 --> 00:57:09,175
It is actually warmer than you think.

719
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:13,471
The snow quickly melts in the sunny spots.

720
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,896
So Mu-deokâ€¦

721
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,523
was Naksu.

722
00:58:26,877 --> 00:58:29,964
You were the one
who left this at Danhyanggok.

723
00:58:35,302 --> 00:58:37,638
So you are alive, Naksu.

724
00:59:00,077 --> 00:59:01,161
Mu-deok.

725
00:59:01,745 --> 00:59:03,414
I waited ages for you.

726
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:05,624
Did Maidservant Kim not tell you?

727
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,251
You should have come by noon.

728
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:11,964
Let us hurry. We must get
to Danhyanggok before the sun sets.

729
00:59:12,047 --> 00:59:13,382
Instead of Danhyanggok,

730
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:16,844
let us go somewhere else.

731
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,096
Where?

732
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:22,725
There is an empty temple
by the bamboo forest in the east.

733
00:59:23,225 --> 00:59:24,435
We can go there.

734
00:59:30,649 --> 00:59:32,985
Bring Jang Uk here tonight.

735
00:59:33,068 --> 00:59:34,612
Then I shall spare your life.

736
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,286
I must hand you over so I can live.

737
00:59:43,078 --> 00:59:44,288
It is what must be done.

738
00:59:47,082 --> 00:59:48,542
The marriage will not happen.

739
00:59:49,543 --> 00:59:51,545
I gave them an excuse to discard me.

740
00:59:52,504 --> 00:59:53,631
I see.

741
00:59:54,381 --> 00:59:55,424
Butâ€¦

742
00:59:58,594 --> 01:00:01,305
Maidservant Kim had already received
the yin-and-yang jade.

743
01:00:01,972 --> 01:00:03,682
So I made something out of it.

744
01:00:11,106 --> 01:00:12,858
-They are bird's eggs.
-Yes.

745
01:00:13,525 --> 01:00:14,985
Pick one. We can have one each.

746
01:00:18,947 --> 01:00:21,241
We have quite a peculiar relationship.

747
01:00:21,325 --> 01:00:24,036
A young master and a maid.
A master and a pupil.

748
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:26,830
So I figured they could act
as a token to remind us

749
01:00:27,956 --> 01:00:29,500
to stay loyal and dutiful.

750
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,463
I will choose first.

751
01:00:34,546 --> 01:00:36,382
I pick red. You can have the blue one.

752
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:44,807
Master, let us stay loyal
and dutiful to each other.

753
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,816
-Uk.
-Yes?

754
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,986
This is where we say goodbye.

755
01:01:02,366 --> 01:01:04,326
I will return to where I came from.

756
01:01:06,578 --> 01:01:09,498
-But they abandoned you.
-I met them again today.

757
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:11,625
They know who I am.

758
01:01:12,459 --> 01:01:14,211
They asked me to come back.

759
01:01:14,294 --> 01:01:17,131
-I thought they were dangerous.
-As you can see, I am alive.

760
01:01:17,756 --> 01:01:20,134
If they wanted to kill me,
they would have already.

761
01:01:20,801 --> 01:01:24,847
If I go back,
I will be able to regain my energy.

762
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:33,939
I promised to do that for youâ€¦

763
01:01:34,022 --> 01:01:36,650
I told you that
I would stand on a cliff and push you.

764
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:41,113
I admit that I overtrained you every time,

765
01:01:43,198 --> 01:01:44,366
and you did your best.

766
01:01:45,701 --> 01:01:48,120
-We can keep doing that.
-No.

767
01:01:48,203 --> 01:01:51,248
If we stay together, you will die,

768
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,584
and I will get caught.

769
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:19,067
What brings the leader of Songrim
to secretly come all the way here?

770
01:02:19,151 --> 01:02:20,611
I have something to ask you

771
01:02:21,278 --> 01:02:25,324
about a Cheonbugwan mage
named Cho Chung from 20 years ago.

772
01:02:30,746 --> 01:02:32,539
Naksu's father, Cho Chung,

773
01:02:33,457 --> 01:02:34,625
was a soul shifter.

774
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,587
When we found him,

775
01:02:39,087 --> 01:02:41,340
he had already run wild

776
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:45,344
and killed everyone in his family.

777
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:54,436
The four families had to get involved

778
01:02:55,145 --> 01:02:56,772
to stop any further killings.

779
01:03:04,112 --> 01:03:06,865
Naksu's father was also a soul shifter?

780
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,201
In the eyes of a child,

781
01:03:09,284 --> 01:03:12,788
we probably seemed like murderers
for having killed her father.

782
01:03:14,998 --> 01:03:18,085
She must have thought
her father was murdered by us.

783
01:03:18,877 --> 01:03:21,463
That is probably why she came
to Songrim as an assassin.

784
01:03:23,757 --> 01:03:26,677
What is the important matter
that you wanted to talk about?

785
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,555
Do you recall anything about Naksu?

786
01:03:33,767 --> 01:03:36,895
If we meet again, I will kill you.

787
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,861
Are you implying that

788
01:03:43,944 --> 01:03:47,239
I took in Cho Chung's daughter
and trained her to become an assassin?

789
01:03:47,322 --> 01:03:50,617
You burned her body
as soon as it was found.

790
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:53,704
Was that not because you did not want
her identity to get revealed?

791
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:59,418
I will tell you what happened 20 years ago
instead of saying what you wish to hear.

792
01:04:03,046 --> 01:04:04,965
Here, at Cheonbugwan, we record stars

793
01:04:05,048 --> 01:04:07,301
from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.,
when energy is the highest.

794
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:11,930
The Gwanju checks it at noon,
and the recorded plate gets stored here.

795
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:18,270
But one day, a constellation plate
recorded that morning disappeared.

796
01:04:20,272 --> 01:04:23,567
Fortunately, we were able
to find it again.

797
01:04:26,194 --> 01:04:28,864
What about that?

798
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:36,580
It was the day Jang Gang's wife,
Do-hwa, died and Jang Uk was born.

799
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:39,791
Cho Chung recorded the stars that day,

800
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:43,420
and I was the one
who found the missing plate.

801
01:04:57,726 --> 01:05:00,228
I have managed to sneak out
the actual plate.

802
01:05:00,312 --> 01:05:03,607
The one in Cheonbugwan is
a fake one without the King's Star.

803
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:10,781
Are you telling me

804
01:05:10,864 --> 01:05:12,908
that you know what happened

805
01:05:14,034 --> 01:05:15,994
on the day that Jang Gang's son,

806
01:05:17,871 --> 01:05:19,247
Jang Uk, was born?

807
01:05:22,834 --> 01:05:26,171
A star that could change the world
appeared in the sky.

808
01:05:31,343 --> 01:05:34,012
You knew about the King's Star?

809
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,974
Do you think things stayed quiet
thanks to Cho Chung's death?

810
01:05:38,558 --> 01:05:41,979
Who do you think turned him
into a soul shifter in the first place?

811
01:05:45,023 --> 01:05:47,776
Do not ask questions
you do not wish to hear the answers to.

812
01:05:47,859 --> 01:05:51,029
That is the only way
to protect Songrim and its people.

813
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:07,004
The Danju does not know
that you are still alive, Naksu.

814
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,382
I did not tell him.

815
01:06:11,216 --> 01:06:12,676
Bring Jang Uk.

816
01:06:12,759 --> 01:06:14,720
Then my lips will stay sealed.

817
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:21,727
I shall shift my soul into his body.

818
01:06:41,246 --> 01:06:42,581
Where is Jang Uk?

819
01:06:43,373 --> 01:06:44,750
He will be here soon.

820
01:06:51,423 --> 01:06:54,009
What brings you here at such a late hour?

821
01:06:57,471 --> 01:06:58,972
Before Uk was bornâ€¦

822
01:07:00,098 --> 01:07:02,350
About 20 years agoâ€¦

823
01:07:02,434 --> 01:07:03,727
Did Jang Gang

824
01:07:04,978 --> 01:07:07,064
master a type of sorcery?

825
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,777
Did Jang Gang

826
01:07:13,278 --> 01:07:15,113
perform the alchemy of souls?

827
01:07:30,587 --> 01:07:32,047
What is taking him so long?

828
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:37,010
It is finally raining.

829
01:07:37,969 --> 01:07:39,262
He should be here now.

830
01:07:43,558 --> 01:07:44,893
Did you fool me?

831
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,272
Why are you stalling?

832
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:53,902
Seeing that the Danju
still has not shown up,

833
01:07:53,985 --> 01:07:56,571
you really must be
the only one who knows about me.

834
01:07:58,281 --> 01:07:59,574
You littleâ€¦

835
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:25,308
Our journey stops here.

836
01:08:27,352 --> 01:08:29,563
What about the empty temple by the forest?

837
01:08:31,231 --> 01:08:33,859
Why were you going to take me there?

838
01:08:33,942 --> 01:08:36,027
I was going to hand you over
so I could live.

839
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:39,906
Now you know, so do not follow me.

840
01:08:40,657 --> 01:08:43,493
Then you should not have told me
about the temple.

841
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:46,746
How could I not follow you

842
01:08:47,539 --> 01:08:49,541
after hearing what you just said?

843
01:08:52,794 --> 01:08:54,296
I am more upset than you are.

844
01:08:54,379 --> 01:08:56,923
I gave up my chance to live
just because of a bird's egg.

845
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:59,134
I am glad I reminded you
to be loyal and dutiful.

846
01:08:59,217 --> 01:09:00,760
I could have actually died.

847
01:09:04,681 --> 01:09:06,725
Now that I have helped you escape death,

848
01:09:07,976 --> 01:09:10,103
fight like your life depends on it,
my pupil.

849
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:14,858
You make it sound like you saved my life.

850
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:19,029
If the cloudy sky blesses us with rain,

851
01:09:20,697 --> 01:09:22,741
then we both might be able to live.

852
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:33,293
You really are one lucky fellow, Uk.

853
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:35,587
It is raining cats and dogs.

854
01:09:36,504 --> 01:09:38,715
Do you not think my opponent
is a bit too strong?

855
01:09:39,966 --> 01:09:41,593
He is a Cheonbugwan mage.

856
01:09:41,676 --> 01:09:43,261
Hi. You remember me, right?

857
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:59,689
It is time. Use Tansu.

858
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:03,068
Instead of trying to flick the waterdrops
with your uncontrollable sword,

859
01:12:03,151 --> 01:12:05,445
wield the sword
so that waterdrops fall onto it.

860
01:13:03,586 --> 01:13:04,796
No.

861
01:13:08,508 --> 01:13:09,801
What is that?

862
01:13:09,884 --> 01:13:10,844
The alchemy of souls.

863
01:14:02,103 --> 01:14:04,439
Is my soulâ€¦

864
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:06,524
being shifted right now?

865
01:14:28,004 --> 01:14:29,422
Jang Uk!

866
01:14:30,757 --> 01:14:34,469
So you have shifted souls
with my pupil, Gil-ju.

867
01:14:34,552 --> 01:14:37,096
I think Uk fell victim
to the alchemy of souls.

868
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:38,097
What?

869
01:14:38,181 --> 01:14:40,683
Was the man who shifted my father's soul

870
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,894
Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan?

871
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:47,440
Why is it you again?

872
01:14:47,524 --> 01:14:50,693
Are you certain that
the ice stone was indeed destroyed?

873
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:53,655
Order all of our mages to look for Gil-ju.

874
01:14:53,738 --> 01:14:56,157
It must never be revealed
that they are soul shifters.

875
01:14:58,201 --> 01:15:03,206
