ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I imagined myself
sitting alone on top of a tall tree.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,468
I knew no one

4
00:00:00,551 --> 00:00:03,095
and I was powerless and alone.

5
00:00:05,222 --> 00:00:07,183
I had hoped
someone would come to rescue me.

6
00:00:09,727 --> 00:00:10,770
And then you came.

7
00:00:12,688 --> 00:00:13,606
What…

8
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:16,734
was that about?

9
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:20,571
That was my story.

10
00:00:22,615 --> 00:00:25,284
It was a thought that I had
during my time in that room.

11
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:28,329
I do not have
that stone with me right now.

12
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:48,349
I must be going crazy…

13
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:52,520
because of you.

14
00:00:57,817 --> 00:00:59,235
Why do you keep confusing me?

15
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:01,654
What is there to be confused about?

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,657
You hold my hand and listen to my stories

17
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,451
only to think about someone else.

18
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:13,415
If you miss her so much,
how about I help you out a little more?

19
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:15,543
Shall I hold you in my arms
and put you to bed as well?

20
00:01:15,626 --> 00:01:17,086
Shall I just do everything she did?

21
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:19,088
A tree like that actually existed.

22
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:22,883
A big, tall tree.

23
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:25,261
There was a tree that we had promised

24
00:01:26,846 --> 00:01:27,805
to climb up together.

25
00:01:28,848 --> 00:01:30,141
Is that tree in Danhyanggok?

26
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:34,603
Is it?

27
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:36,772
I wonder how I know about that place.

28
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:39,859
Maybe I went there when I was little?

29
00:01:42,027 --> 00:01:44,113
This is why I have trouble
believing that they are yours.

30
00:01:46,782 --> 00:01:48,409
It is your choice
whether to believe me or not.

31
00:01:49,285 --> 00:01:51,162
But this is my hand that you are holding,

32
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:55,332
and it will be me who holds you
and puts you to bed at night.

33
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:56,750
So…

34
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:59,920
when you are looking at me,
see me for who I am…

35
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,965
just like you did that night.

36
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:07,511
I am not dreaming.

37
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,179
Do you recognize me?

38
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,264
Yes.

39
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:12,349
You woke me up.

40
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:19,023
Someone just entered.

41
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:22,693
I can see the energy of a human

42
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:24,862
behind that tree.

43
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:31,118
I recognize that energy.
I think it is someone I know.

44
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:33,329
Someone you know?
Is it someone from Jinyowon?

45
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,914
No.

46
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,416
It is your friend.

47
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:47,217
Seo Yul?

48
00:02:47,843 --> 00:02:48,677
Jang Uk?

49
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:55,309
It really is you.

50
00:02:57,436 --> 00:02:59,480
She told me she could see your energy.

51
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:00,814
What are you doing here?

52
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:02,691
I am here looking for someone.

53
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:07,404
I know how to take out the blood parasite.

54
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:10,658
If you tell me who knows,
I will let that person live.

55
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,161
I knew it.

56
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:18,415
So there is a way to get it out.

57
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,459
Yes. Now tell me who knows.

58
00:03:21,126 --> 00:03:21,961
Tell me.

59
00:03:25,214 --> 00:03:27,549
-It is Jin Mu.
-Jin Mu?

60
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:28,467
No.

61
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,179
Park Jin of Songrim.

62
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:36,517
What?

63
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,851
Actually…

64
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:43,607
it is His Majesty the King.

65
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:54,493
I was going to grant you a painless death,

66
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,412
but you brought this on yourself.

67
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:00,958
Let us see if you will
be able to keep your mouth shut

68
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,876
even after taking
this excruciating potion.

69
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:14,471
Lady Jin.

70
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:18,684
Jang Uk wishes to meet you, my lady.

71
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:20,769
Right now? Tell him I have gone to bed.

72
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:22,438
He knows you are not in your room.

73
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:25,399
It would be troublesome
if he goes around looking for you.

74
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,413
What brings you here at this hour?

75
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:41,081
I came to ask you for a favor.

76
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:44,960
Please allow me to enter Jinyowon
for a moment.

77
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:46,378
Jinyowon?

78
00:04:46,462 --> 00:04:49,131
I thought about asking Bu-yeon
to secretly let me inside,

79
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:51,967
but that did not seem appropriate,
so I came to ask you myself.

80
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:17,242
So-i, wake up.

81
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:18,786
Do you recognize me?

82
00:05:19,828 --> 00:05:20,662
Seo Yul?

83
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:22,539
Yes.

84
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:25,209
Hold on to me.

85
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,963
She said there is a way.

86
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:35,636
There is a way to save you.

87
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:37,096
We have no time.

88
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:38,097
Let us talk outside.

89
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,101
Jin Bu-yeon?

90
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:45,062
Are you all right?
Did my mother do this to you?

91
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:50,609
You must really think you are Jin Bu-yeon.

92
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:51,985
What do you mean?

93
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,365
She helped me find you.

94
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,368
First, let us get out of here.

95
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,925
This is the fire bird.

96
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:17,511
I see it has not hatched yet.

97
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:20,305
When this fire bird
hatches out of its egg,

98
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,307
the world will suffer from severe drought.

99
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:23,809
And Jinyowon will fall

100
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:26,270
if this egg gets taken out of here?

101
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:28,105
Right.

102
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,608
I do not plan to do such a thing,
so do not worry.

103
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:35,737
Master Lee could have just asked me
to show this to him.

104
00:06:36,905 --> 00:06:39,575
I wonder why he asked you
to come and check.

105
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:41,118
Because he does not trust you.

106
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:43,745
You even unveiled the ice stone once.

107
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:47,833
It was a choice I made to save Bu-yeon
when I was pregnant with her.

108
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:52,004
The person who did not
return it after its use

109
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,173
was your father, Jang Gang.

110
00:06:55,674 --> 00:06:56,508
And in the end,

111
00:06:56,592 --> 00:06:59,761
his son ended up
with the ice stone inside his body.

112
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,724
I guess it will not be easy
for us to get along

113
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:06,018
seeing that you have
so many reasons to hate me.

114
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:08,645
That is why I want to put an end
to this relationship.

115
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,648
My daughter was doing fine
under my protection.

116
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,150
Why did you have to take her away?

117
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,318
I had no reason to

118
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,862
until I saw the darkness behind it all.

119
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,531
Hiding her in that dark room

120
00:07:19,615 --> 00:07:22,910
and sewing that thread into her back
is not what a loving mother would do.

121
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:24,995
You really think she was doing fine?

122
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:29,208
Perhaps you happen
to enjoy things like that?

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,461
Being locked up in a dark room
and getting poked by needles?

124
00:07:32,544 --> 00:07:33,712
I was protecting her.

125
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:36,006
She is the eldest daughter
of the Jin family.

126
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,091
Her duty is to protect Jinyowon

127
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:40,177
by giving birth to a daughter
and carrying on the family line.

128
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,762
Are you trying to pressure me?

129
00:07:46,308 --> 00:07:48,936
Then you could have at least
served a brood hen for dinner.

130
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:52,314
But then again,
you showed me this fire bird,

131
00:07:52,397 --> 00:07:54,024
so I will count that as encouragement.

132
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,204
The person Seo Yul was looking for
was severely hurt.

133
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,122
-Who was it?
-A woman.

134
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:12,042
Her name was So-i.

135
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,504
So-i?

136
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:30,143
I guess you received
the message I sent you,

137
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:33,647
seeing that you came to save me.

138
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:35,107
Yes, I did.

139
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:37,025
It is the truth.

140
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:39,236
Jin Ho-gyeong's real daughter

141
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:42,823
was Mu-deok from Sari Village.

142
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:45,284
Does that mean the Jin Bu-yeon
you saw earlier was fake?

143
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:52,082
That was what I initially thought
when I went there,

144
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,252
but it turns out she was real.

145
00:08:56,211 --> 00:08:58,088
-What?
-Jin Ho-gyeong

146
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:02,092
took out Mu-deok's body
from Lake Gyeongcheondaeho and saved her.

147
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,510
But the thing is,

148
00:09:03,594 --> 00:09:05,762
inside that body still lives the soul

149
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:08,307
of Naksu.

150
00:09:11,393 --> 00:09:12,311
Naksu?

151
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:13,228
Yes.

152
00:09:14,313 --> 00:09:16,523
Naksu lives inside Jin Bu-yeon's body.

153
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:19,651
Also, Jin Bu-yeon's current face

154
00:09:20,944 --> 00:09:22,321
is that of Naksu.

155
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,793
No wonder she seemed familiar
when we first met.

156
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,796
I failed to recognize her
because I never imagined

157
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:41,632
that I would meet her again.

158
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,593
There you are.

159
00:10:26,718 --> 00:10:28,053
She is alive.

160
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:30,889
Jin Bu-yeon…

161
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,725
was her all along.

162
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:44,444
Are you all right?

163
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:52,661
You look like you are about to cry.

164
00:10:55,914 --> 00:10:56,748
By any chance,

165
00:10:57,999 --> 00:10:58,959
do you feel ill?

166
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:08,593
What is the matter?

167
00:11:09,177 --> 00:11:10,303
Do you feel very ill?

168
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:13,640
My thoughts have lost their way

169
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,351
due to the confusion I feel.

170
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:18,979
Let me stay like this

171
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:22,023
just for a little while.

172
00:11:58,226 --> 00:11:59,769
I cannot leave you here like this.

173
00:12:00,395 --> 00:12:02,856
I think it is best that I tell Jang Uk.

174
00:12:07,152 --> 00:12:08,320
Do not tell him.

175
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:11,740
I do not wish for him to know.

176
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:25,086
We did nothing wrong.

177
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:29,424
Young Master Seo Yul allowed us in.

178
00:12:29,508 --> 00:12:30,342
Yul?

179
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:33,803
He is right.

180
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,601
I brought them here. Let him go.

181
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,316
What happened?

182
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,151
I heard the girl you saved is So-i.

183
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:51,154
Why would you get involved with her?

184
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,280
Did she do something to you?

185
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:53,406
Do not worry.

186
00:12:54,115 --> 00:12:55,742
I was indebted to her.

187
00:12:56,826 --> 00:13:00,247
I heard she was taken away by Lady Jin,
so I helped her to return the favor.

188
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,207
Why were you indebted to So-i?

189
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,459
She looked after me
back when I was severely injured

190
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,586
inside the barrier.

191
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,630
Young Lady Heo also knows.

192
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:11,091
I see.

193
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:14,553
I still cannot believe
you climbed over the walls of Jinyowon.

194
00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:19,307
I was able to get out
without getting caught thanks to you.

195
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,643
Gosh.

196
00:13:23,895 --> 00:13:26,690
So is there anything else
I can help you with?

197
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,569
There is something
I must handle on my own.

198
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:32,946
It is my responsibility now.

199
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:45,750
He was quick to subdue us,
so we did not see his face.

200
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,419
But it was definitely a man.

201
00:13:47,502 --> 00:13:49,004
Who could it be?

202
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:50,547
It is Jin Mu.

203
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,464
No.

204
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,051
Park Jin of Songrim.

205
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,429
It is His Majesty the King.

206
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,975
None of them must find out.

207
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:04,519
I must keep it a secret.

208
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,744
Fortunately, there are no severe injuries.

209
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,871
Apply ointment on her wounds,
and she will be fine.

210
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:25,540
Thank you.

211
00:14:37,594 --> 00:14:39,095
Young Master Seo is right.

212
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,641
So-i really did take good care of him
back when he was hurt.

213
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:45,352
I have no reason not to believe you.

214
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:49,314
She even cut herself
to share her blood with him.

215
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:50,899
She shared her blood?

216
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:52,567
It did not help much,

217
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:54,778
but that is how much she cared.

218
00:14:57,155 --> 00:14:59,240
Will you be staying at Jeongjingak?

219
00:14:59,324 --> 00:15:01,910
I will also stay here
so I can take care of So-i.

220
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,044
I thought

221
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:15,048
you and Young Master Jang would be
at Jinyowon meeting your mother.

222
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:16,174
We already went.

223
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,551
We left earlier than expected
to help a friend.

224
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:20,011
I see.

225
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:24,683
I guess Young Master Jang
cared more about helping his friend.

226
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:27,143
Your presence is of no help,
unlike Young Lady Heo's,

227
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,979
so you should go home.

228
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,271
I will escort you home.

229
00:15:30,355 --> 00:15:34,067
I was talking about my friend,
not Young Master Jang's.

230
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,654
Then are you saying
Young Master Seo is your friend?

231
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,614
Yes, I am here for a reason.

232
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:43,451
I need to talk to my friend, Seo Yul.

233
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:44,953
So I should get going now.

234
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:49,916
What do you need to talk about with Yul?

235
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,627
She claims to be friends with him.

236
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:54,629
Yes, I would like to talk to my friend.

237
00:15:54,713 --> 00:15:57,298
So are you not going to go home?

238
00:15:57,382 --> 00:15:59,467
No, I am also going to stay here.

239
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,557
Goodbye then, Young Master Jang.

240
00:16:06,224 --> 00:16:08,560
Goodbye. I will be going home now.

241
00:16:22,657 --> 00:16:23,950
Just come home with me.

242
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:29,664
All right. Fine.

243
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:30,999
Let us go.

244
00:16:49,392 --> 00:16:52,145
When did you become friends with Yul?

245
00:16:52,854 --> 00:16:54,522
We are both foolish in our own ways,

246
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:56,816
so we agreed to be friends.

247
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,279
You may be a fool, but Yul is far from it.

248
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,615
He gets lost when he is flustered.

249
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:06,910
He told you that?

250
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:10,121
Well, I found out
as we spent time together.

251
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:11,998
How much time did you spend with him?

252
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:13,583
Quite a lot.

253
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,294
We spent time at Chwiseonru
and Gaema Village.

254
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,505
I remember now.

255
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:22,592
So-i was the girl I met at Gaema Village.

256
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:23,843
You met her?

257
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:26,638
She stole something from me,
and Seo Yul helped me that day.

258
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:28,389
Really?

259
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:32,936
A lot of things happened
that I do not know about.

260
00:17:34,312 --> 00:17:36,022
You and Yul must be pretty close.

261
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,818
I thought he was the man
I was supposed to marry

262
00:17:39,901 --> 00:17:41,861
when I first met him at Chwiseonru.

263
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:46,282
If I met him a lot earlier,
I may not have thought about running away.

264
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,242
I see.

265
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,913
It must be a pity. It would have been nice
if he were your husband.

266
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,207
He is handsome and kind.

267
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,419
He would not have talked about going crazy
after holding my hand like you did.

268
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:02,006
Do you feel all right now?

269
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:13,643
You told me to see you for who you were.

270
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,187
That is what I am trying to do.

271
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,031
Jang Uk,

272
00:18:27,115 --> 00:18:28,658
try summoning fireflies.

273
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:32,495
That is not an easy thing to do, you know.

274
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:36,374
Then try setting off some fireworks.

275
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,294
Hey, do you know how much that costs?

276
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:42,505
Besides, where am I supposed
to find fireworks right now?

277
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:45,842
Do not tell anyone
that Jin Bu-yeon is Naksu.

278
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,302
Of course.

279
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:50,638
It needs to be kept a secret
for Jin Ho-gyeong to save your life.

280
00:18:51,472 --> 00:18:53,057
Jang Uk cannot find out either.

281
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:55,894
I know.

282
00:18:57,395 --> 00:18:59,147
He has gone through enough.

283
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:03,067
-It is my responsibility now.
-Your responsibility?

284
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:05,904
What responsibility do you have for Naksu?

285
00:19:05,987 --> 00:19:07,488
I also knew.

286
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:10,658
You also knew back then

287
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:13,995
that Mu-deok was Naksu?

288
00:19:17,498 --> 00:19:19,876
You knew, yet you kept it a secret? Why?

289
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,086
Your wound is not severe,
so you will recover soon.

290
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,047
I will find you a safe place to stay.

291
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,381
Leave as soon as you are ready.

292
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:36,494
Young Master Seo, are you all right?

293
00:20:37,662 --> 00:20:38,538
Does it hurt?

294
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,249
It was just another nightmare.

295
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,918
Is it her who constantly appears

296
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:46,087
in your dreams?

297
00:20:53,094 --> 00:20:57,056
I also possess an item that is dear to me,
so I know what it means.

298
00:20:58,182 --> 00:20:59,851
The fact that you still have that

299
00:21:02,312 --> 00:21:03,438
means you still care.

300
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:05,690
Then I guess I should throw it away.

301
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:10,903
If what you said is true,
it means all my pain and regrets…

302
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:17,535
derive from this.

303
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,167
By any chance,

304
00:21:25,543 --> 00:21:26,836
are you planning to kill Naksu?

305
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,256
Then you cannot receive Jinyowon's help,
and you will die.

306
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,883
I know.

307
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:33,926
How could I expect to live…

308
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:38,639
if I plan to get rid of her?

309
00:21:38,723 --> 00:21:39,724
Exactly.

310
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,435
Do not kill her if you wish to live.
And besides…

311
00:21:44,812 --> 00:21:46,105
you like her.

312
00:21:54,864 --> 00:21:55,740
Get some rest.

313
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:12,799
Young Master.

314
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:16,803
I…

315
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:20,014
am now betrothed

316
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,810
to Lord Park Jin of Songrim.

317
00:22:28,856 --> 00:22:30,399
Why are you so quiet?

318
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:33,653
Are you upset that I am getting married?

319
00:22:34,612 --> 00:22:36,364
-Should I not get married?
-No, I just…

320
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,867
I do not know what to call you now.

321
00:22:40,868 --> 00:22:41,702
Goodness.

322
00:22:43,037 --> 00:22:45,081
Just call me Maidservant Kim.

323
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:47,291
Even if I marry Lord Park,

324
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:51,671
you will always be my young master.

325
00:22:52,964 --> 00:22:54,298
No, that is not it.

326
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:58,928
I am most grateful to you,
and I care for you more than anyone.

327
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:01,931
I want to be able to say more

328
00:23:03,474 --> 00:23:04,725
than just congratulate you.

329
00:23:08,896 --> 00:23:10,606
Who cares what you call me?

330
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,861
I may treat you like my young master,

331
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:16,863
but you are

332
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:19,657
like a son to me.

333
00:23:25,663 --> 00:23:26,497
I know.

334
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:29,292
I feel the same way.

335
00:23:33,254 --> 00:23:34,172
Maidservant Kim.

336
00:23:41,512 --> 00:23:42,430
Congratulations.

337
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:48,144
Young Master.

338
00:23:57,945 --> 00:23:59,614
The reason we visited you last night

339
00:23:59,697 --> 00:24:01,324
was to urgently show these to you.

340
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:04,952
Again, congratulations on your engagement.

341
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:07,288
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

342
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:09,040
Thank you, everyone.

343
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:13,085
I will be welcoming an aunt at last.

344
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:15,880
Will I also be getting a niece or nephew?

345
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:20,760
Know when to stop.

346
00:24:21,636 --> 00:24:22,970
Why is he giving up so quickly?

347
00:24:23,054 --> 00:24:26,515
You found several of these
in dried-up wells around Daeho Fortress?

348
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,852
Yes, these boatmen here
also found some in the canal.

349
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:32,980
Someone is deliberately trying
to dry up all the water.

350
00:24:33,064 --> 00:24:36,275
I will find out where they were created.

351
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:39,528
They contain the energy of a volcano,
so that is probably where they were made.

352
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:42,990
Thoroughly examine all the items
that come in from the southern volcano.

353
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,201
Yes, my lord.

354
00:24:50,748 --> 00:24:53,167
Songrim will be inspecting
the goods on all the boats?

355
00:24:53,251 --> 00:24:54,377
Yes.

356
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,046
I can no longer let your boat pass
as an exception.

357
00:25:03,427 --> 00:25:07,014
The boat from the volcano should arrive
at Daeho Fortress any moment now.

358
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:11,894
Send a homing bird and tell them
to discard everything on the boat.

359
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:12,812
Yes, my lord.

360
00:25:32,581 --> 00:25:34,333
He wants us to get rid of everything?

361
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:37,461
Is it safe to discard something so ghastly
in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?

362
00:25:37,545 --> 00:25:40,756
What is with you?
We just need to do as we are told.

363
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,008
Just get on with it.

364
00:25:42,091 --> 00:25:43,718
My goodness.

365
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,224
I checked the fire bird within Jinyowon.

366
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:53,853
It was a lot smaller than expected,
but it was safe and sound.

367
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:54,770
Is that so?

368
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:56,856
I thought you did not
want to get involved.

369
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,443
I had to go anyway,
so I just checked while I was there.

370
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:03,321
You never do anything
you do not wish to do,

371
00:26:03,404 --> 00:26:04,697
so that is hard to believe.

372
00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:07,700
I really do not wish to get involved,

373
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:09,952
but let me tell you what I heard.

374
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:13,456
There are people
who are after the fire bird in Jinyowon.

375
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:15,374
The long-lasting drought

376
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:18,002
has dried up the wells and canals
and is causing dissent among people.

377
00:26:18,586 --> 00:26:20,588
Please allow Cheonbugwan
to gather the Unanimous Assembly

378
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:23,466
and advance the date for the lake's rite.

379
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:26,385
It is strange that all the wells
and canals have been drying up

380
00:26:27,094 --> 00:26:28,387
just because of the drought.

381
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:31,474
Fortunately, the fear of soul shifters
has died down in the capital

382
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,602
after Jang Uk managed to get rid of Naksu.

383
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:38,647
The Crown Prince shall visit Jang Uk
and reward him as always.

384
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,274
Your Majesty.

385
00:26:40,358 --> 00:26:42,818
This time, he deserves a bigger reward.

386
00:26:45,363 --> 00:26:48,324
Appoint him as the general
of the North Fortress and send him there.

387
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,659
Are you asking me

388
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:53,371
to make him leave Daeho Fortress?

389
00:26:53,954 --> 00:26:56,791
Without him, the capital
could become unstable again.

390
00:26:56,874 --> 00:26:59,919
Right now, Cheonbugwan has more mages

391
00:27:00,002 --> 00:27:01,837
than Jeongjingak has ever had.

392
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:04,507
With our mages' protection
and the leadership of the Crown Prince,

393
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,550
who was born with the energy
of the King's Star,

394
00:27:06,634 --> 00:27:08,594
no one in the capital will feel unsettled.

395
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:21,649
When the world suffered
from severe drought 200 years ago,

396
00:27:21,732 --> 00:27:23,526
the ice stone fell from the sky.

397
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,236
It looks like these people

398
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,613
are trying to do the same
by waking the fire bird.

399
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:31,158
The royal family and Cheonbugwan
are the ones behind it.

400
00:27:31,826 --> 00:27:35,287
Do you wish for me to fight against them?

401
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:37,832
A fight like that
would be considered a revolt.

402
00:27:41,502 --> 00:27:42,878
If you win the fight,

403
00:27:43,754 --> 00:27:46,340
you could even become the King.

404
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:49,135
What?

405
00:27:49,218 --> 00:27:53,347
You already know that the King's Star,
which is known to be the Crown Prince's,

406
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:55,933
is actually yours.

407
00:27:59,437 --> 00:28:02,356
That also means you know
who your real father is.

408
00:28:04,108 --> 00:28:06,318
How long do you plan
to keep me locked up in here?

409
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:07,987
Just because I wish

410
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:10,281
to keep you locked up

411
00:28:11,615 --> 00:28:12,533
does not mean I can.

412
00:28:12,616 --> 00:28:14,660
You possess the power of the ice stone.

413
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:17,663
I know you are holding back for my sake.

414
00:28:17,747 --> 00:28:18,914
Jin Mu

415
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:22,251
and the royal family were behind it all.

416
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:25,212
-I need to know what they did to her.
-And do what?

417
00:28:27,256 --> 00:28:28,924
Will you kill them all?

418
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:31,177
Like you said, it is not impossible
with the power I possess.

419
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,638
Fighting against the royal family
and Cheonbugwan is a revolt.

420
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:37,349
Are you going to use the energy of the sky
to disrupt the world?

421
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:38,476
I do not care!

422
00:28:41,228 --> 00:28:43,147
I do not care for this world.

423
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,484
The one person
I wanted to protect is dead.

424
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:47,401
And in the most…

425
00:28:49,403 --> 00:28:50,905
brutal way possible.

426
00:29:00,122 --> 00:29:01,207
Here.

427
00:29:04,335 --> 00:29:07,463
You have always wondered
if Jang Gang was your real father.

428
00:29:08,672 --> 00:29:11,509
This is the gold plaque and letter
that your real father left for you.

429
00:29:15,513 --> 00:29:17,765
Jang Gang briefly switched bodies
with your father

430
00:29:17,848 --> 00:29:19,225
using the alchemy of souls.

431
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,938
Your father's soul pursued your mother,
and she gave birth to a baby,

432
00:29:25,147 --> 00:29:25,981
which was you.

433
00:29:27,358 --> 00:29:29,944
You are the son of the late King.

434
00:29:32,947 --> 00:29:34,907
You were born
through the alchemy of souls.

435
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:37,827
If not for that,
you would not have been born.

436
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:40,830
You were not meant to exist.

437
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:41,831
Are you saying

438
00:29:43,499 --> 00:29:45,167
my birth is a sin in itself?

439
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:46,502
On the night of your birth,

440
00:29:48,128 --> 00:29:49,296
the King's Star was in the sky.

441
00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:52,883
And to conceal that,

442
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:55,219
Naksu's father, Cho Chung, died.

443
00:29:55,803 --> 00:30:00,057
Jang Gang also died to take responsibility
and to keep everything a secret.

444
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,351
And the one person you wanted to protect

445
00:30:04,144 --> 00:30:07,106
was likely used and killed
by those who wanted you dead.

446
00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:20,953
If you intend to use your power

447
00:30:21,495 --> 00:30:25,165
gained by being born under the King's Star
merely to bring chaos to the world,

448
00:30:25,249 --> 00:30:26,500
then I, too…

449
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:31,005
shall do anything to stop you,

450
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,216
even if I die by your hands.

451
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:51,567
I am guilty of existing

452
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:54,320
when I should not.

453
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:58,282
So I have decided to do nothing.

454
00:30:58,365 --> 00:30:59,199
Jang Uk.

455
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,202
"It is better to die than to do nothing."

456
00:31:04,538 --> 00:31:06,415
That is what your master
always used to tell you.

457
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,710
My master, Seo Gyeong,

458
00:31:09,793 --> 00:31:12,171
was also born
with the energy of the King's Star,

459
00:31:12,254 --> 00:31:13,505
but he did not become King.

460
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:15,799
Instead, he protected the world.

461
00:31:15,883 --> 00:31:18,427
How can I protect the world
when I could not even protect

462
00:31:19,637 --> 00:31:21,013
the one person I had sworn to keep safe?

463
00:31:22,806 --> 00:31:25,559
I guess you are not thrilled
to possess the power of the ice stone

464
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:29,104
since you gained it
by getting killed by that one person.

465
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:30,856
Why did Master Seo Gyeong

466
00:31:31,774 --> 00:31:33,442
leave behind the ice stone?

467
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:36,445
He wrote in Words of the Heart
that he left it to save his lover,

468
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:37,696
Jin Seol-ran.

469
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,156
But eventually, she died.

470
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:42,368
Why did he keep the ice stone
inside Jinyowon?

471
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:44,870
Maybe it was for you.
You were also born under the King's Star.

472
00:31:47,748 --> 00:31:48,582
I will be off.

473
00:32:09,937 --> 00:32:10,771
We found them.

474
00:32:14,942 --> 00:32:15,776
They really are here.

475
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:20,072
You are incredible.

476
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,202
I can see why people say
you remind them of Jin Seol-ran.

477
00:32:25,786 --> 00:32:27,955
It is amazing that you are able
to see that kind of energy.

478
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,750
Seeing energy is all I can do yet.

479
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:34,003
You said your divine powers will return
along with your memories.

480
00:32:34,962 --> 00:32:36,046
Then tell me.

481
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,589
Have you regained a lot of your memories?

482
00:32:39,216 --> 00:32:41,218
I have seen several past memories,

483
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:43,262
but they are not mine.

484
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:48,225
I am able to see other people's memories
by touching their items.

485
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:52,187
I guess my divine powers
are slowly starting to come back.

486
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:53,814
I see.

487
00:32:53,897 --> 00:32:55,232
I am glad to hear that.

488
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,820
If that earthenware is dangerous,

489
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:01,321
I can keep looking for them.

490
00:33:02,322 --> 00:33:03,407
Would you kindly do that for me?

491
00:33:04,074 --> 00:33:05,492
Whoever keeps you by their side

492
00:33:05,576 --> 00:33:08,495
will be able to avoid dangerous objects.

493
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,623
Some people possess energy
that should be avoided.

494
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,501
Have you ever come across such a person?

495
00:33:15,544 --> 00:33:17,713
The energy inside people
is not always constant,

496
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:21,800
but those in a frenzy carry an energy
that suffocates me when seen up close.

497
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:29,975
People say you resemble spring

498
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,394
as it is the most beautiful season
among the four.

499
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:35,189
I really do see

500
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,150
a beautiful liveliness in you.

501
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:40,736
Thank you.

502
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,742
A spiritless person like me

503
00:33:48,786 --> 00:33:50,412
is desperate for the vitality of spring.

504
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,801
I am quite fond of you.
Come and visit me often.

505
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,387
I would like to get a glimpse

506
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,599
of the spring that is soon to come.

507
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:13,685
Yes, Your Highness.

508
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:24,363
Your Royal Highness, why do you
suddenly wish to hunt somewhere far away?

509
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:26,115
It is suffocating inside the palace.

510
00:34:27,074 --> 00:34:29,159
I wish to depart now, so pack lightly.

511
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,286
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

512
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:44,967
Let me know when you see the energy.

513
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,176
We will stop the boat.

514
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,094
I will.

515
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:54,226
Wait.

516
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,145
Stop the boat.

517
00:35:06,029 --> 00:35:08,949
I remember dangling from here once.

518
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:10,284
When?

519
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:11,368
Why?

520
00:35:12,953 --> 00:35:13,829
I have no strength.

521
00:35:20,878 --> 00:35:22,754
What is the matter?

522
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:24,423
Why did you suddenly dangle from there?

523
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:26,758
I once dangled from there

524
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:29,636
only to realize that I had no strength.

525
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:33,390
Well…

526
00:35:34,183 --> 00:35:35,976
it seems like you are exhausted.

527
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:39,771
You should get some rest nearby.

528
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:47,196
This is my memory.

529
00:35:48,155 --> 00:35:49,990
I even remember my arms hurting.

530
00:35:57,998 --> 00:36:00,000
I forgot to bring home the turtle.

531
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:01,877
I almost left it here all alone.

532
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,962
I told the owner to take good care of it.

533
00:36:04,046 --> 00:36:06,965
Still, I bet it is waiting
for its owner to come.

534
00:36:14,264 --> 00:36:15,807
Go out and get some fresh air.

535
00:36:15,891 --> 00:36:17,017
Pardon?

536
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,060
Go and take a walk.

537
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:19,811
Right.

538
00:36:20,437 --> 00:36:21,438
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

539
00:36:30,864 --> 00:36:32,741
"I have no strength"?

540
00:36:34,034 --> 00:36:35,744
Does that mean I had strength before?

541
00:36:37,913 --> 00:36:39,456
It does not like that.

542
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:40,457
Eunuch.

543
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,583
You are here.

544
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:44,503
That turtle only eats meat
wrapped in lettuce.

545
00:36:44,586 --> 00:36:46,171
-Really?
-Are you dumb or what?

546
00:36:46,255 --> 00:36:48,632
It is refusing because it is you.
It never refuses when I feed it.

547
00:36:49,883 --> 00:36:50,717
Watch.

548
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,636
Turtle.

549
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,304
Here is a piece of lettuce.

550
00:36:54,388 --> 00:36:55,222
Eat up.

551
00:36:59,393 --> 00:37:00,644
You see that?

552
00:37:00,727 --> 00:37:03,188
It only cares for me.
What a clever turtle.

553
00:37:03,272 --> 00:37:04,606
Did you see how fast it moved?

554
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,025
I bet it is the fastest turtle in Daeho.

555
00:37:07,734 --> 00:37:09,236
That is one lucky turtle

556
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:10,737
seeing how loved it is.

557
00:37:12,656 --> 00:37:13,490
What is wrong?

558
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:17,202
Has your husband still not come home
because of that peacock?

559
00:37:17,286 --> 00:37:19,079
He does come home these days,

560
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:21,248
but I still sleep alone.

561
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:23,375
Why not do anything? You are a shaman.

562
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:26,336
Curse the peacock
and make her leave your husband.

563
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,839
Or feed your husband a potion
that will captivate him.

564
00:37:29,506 --> 00:37:31,425
You are too young to be so woeful.

565
00:37:31,508 --> 00:37:34,344
How would a eunuch like you
know anything about marriage?

566
00:37:35,595 --> 00:37:36,930
Or anything about sleeping alone?

567
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,350
I may not know any of that,
but I do know your situation.

568
00:37:40,976 --> 00:37:43,353
If he left home,
you could at least hope for him to return.

569
00:37:43,937 --> 00:37:45,105
But sleeping separately?

570
00:37:45,188 --> 00:37:46,106
That means it is over.

571
00:37:46,189 --> 00:37:48,233
If he never bothers to visit your room,

572
00:37:48,317 --> 00:37:49,318
you might as well move out.

573
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:50,736
You are right.

574
00:37:51,528 --> 00:37:54,156
I am done staying in that room all alone.

575
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,033
There you go. You should cheat too.

576
00:37:56,116 --> 00:37:58,327
Stop giving me unwholesome solutions.

577
00:37:59,953 --> 00:38:03,165
I will find a room of my own.

578
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:05,667
You do not even have your own room?

579
00:38:07,044 --> 00:38:10,297
I feel anxious because the room I stay in
does not feel like it is mine.

580
00:38:11,298 --> 00:38:13,008
It only ends up confusing him,

581
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,510
which is why he cannot find me.

582
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,308
I shall find a room of my own.

583
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:24,561
Thank you for your advice.
It really helped.

584
00:38:24,644 --> 00:38:25,854
It did?

585
00:38:28,023 --> 00:38:30,359
If you fail to find your own room,
you can come live with me.

586
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:31,568
My house has many rooms.

587
00:38:33,987 --> 00:38:35,322
Where were you going?

588
00:38:37,032 --> 00:38:39,868
My house has many rooms,
but none of them make me feel at home.

589
00:38:41,244 --> 00:38:43,622
You could say
I am running away to avoid something.

590
00:38:43,705 --> 00:38:46,166
You possess a very noble energy,

591
00:38:46,249 --> 00:38:49,252
but I guess you also have
a peacock that bothers you.

592
00:38:50,045 --> 00:38:50,962
Yes, I do.

593
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:54,800
There is this guy I hate
who is too good to be true.

594
00:38:55,759 --> 00:38:57,969
Have you heard of the crow
that placed peacock feathers among its own

595
00:38:58,053 --> 00:38:59,304
so it could act like a peacock?

596
00:39:00,722 --> 00:39:01,807
I am that crow.

597
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:05,811
If you feel uneasy about pretending,
then why not stop?

598
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:08,855
I have already come too far.

599
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:10,941
I am hopeless now.

600
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:13,819
You saved this turtle.

601
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,115
A man like you can never be hopeless.

602
00:39:21,118 --> 00:39:23,745
You are a bad judge of character,
but you do know how to comfort people.

603
00:39:30,377 --> 00:39:32,587
Thank you for motivating me
with improper words.

604
00:39:33,296 --> 00:39:35,090
I need to go and finish what I was doing.

605
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:36,383
Have a safe trip.

606
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:46,309
Instead of going hunting,
maybe I should visit Jang Uk

607
00:39:47,477 --> 00:39:49,187
since he even took care of you.

608
00:39:59,406 --> 00:40:01,491
I informed him of your visit.

609
00:40:01,575 --> 00:40:02,909
How dare he not show up to greet you.

610
00:40:04,077 --> 00:40:05,495
I will go and bring Jang Uk.

611
00:40:17,174 --> 00:40:21,386
THE FIRE BIRD'S EGG

612
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:26,266
THE FIRE BIRD

613
00:40:29,144 --> 00:40:30,145
The fire bird.

614
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:34,191
It looks like Jang Uk
already knows about this.

615
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,202
Are you here to reward me?

616
00:40:46,203 --> 00:40:47,120
You can leave it and go.

617
00:40:47,204 --> 00:40:48,246
His Majesty the King

618
00:40:49,164 --> 00:40:51,833
wishes to give you
a bigger reward this time.

619
00:40:52,459 --> 00:40:53,668
He will send you to North Fortress

620
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:55,712
after appointing you as a general.

621
00:40:57,005 --> 00:40:58,048
North Fortress?

622
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:00,342
-That is far.
-What will you do?

623
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:02,427
Will you go?

624
00:41:02,511 --> 00:41:06,348
Will you feel at ease
if I leave somewhere far away?

625
00:41:08,058 --> 00:41:09,309
Do not go if you do not wish to.

626
00:41:10,185 --> 00:41:11,853
It is true that you bother me,

627
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:14,523
but to Jin Mu, you will be a big obstacle.

628
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:17,651
I guess you finally feel uneasy
about holding hands with Jin Mu.

629
00:41:18,568 --> 00:41:19,736
But unfortunately,

630
00:41:20,654 --> 00:41:24,157
I do not wish to become
his obstacle for your own good.

631
00:41:28,495 --> 00:41:31,915
You must think I am trying
to use you to keep Jin Mu in check.

632
00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:33,542
I understand.

633
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:36,336
You will probably think that way
no matter what I say.

634
00:41:36,419 --> 00:41:38,838
Why are you suddenly
telling me these things?

635
00:41:38,922 --> 00:41:40,423
The turtle.

636
00:41:40,507 --> 00:41:42,342
-Why were you kind to my turtle?
-Turtle?

637
00:41:42,425 --> 00:41:44,844
If you hate me so much,
why were you nice to my turtle?

638
00:41:44,928 --> 00:41:47,430
That turtle was yours?
I thought it was Eunuch Oh's.

639
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:52,477
I see.

640
00:41:53,562 --> 00:41:54,854
I was foolishly mistaken.

641
00:41:54,938 --> 00:41:56,064
Did you think

642
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,900
I did it out of kindness?

643
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:01,653
Just because I was nice to your turtle?

644
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:02,821
It is more than just that.

645
00:42:04,364 --> 00:42:07,033
It gave me enough hope
to come and talk to you

646
00:42:07,117 --> 00:42:09,953
despite the hatred and distrust
you have toward me.

647
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:14,624
Forget it.

648
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:17,752
I guess you will not
be going to North Fortress

649
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:19,546
seeing that you have been
reading about the fire bird.

650
00:42:20,088 --> 00:42:21,256
What if I do go?

651
00:42:22,966 --> 00:42:25,802
You know how dangerous a fire bird is,
and yet you are going to leave?

652
00:42:25,885 --> 00:42:28,096
I am glad I kept this book open.

653
00:42:28,722 --> 00:42:30,890
I managed to see
that expression on your face.

654
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:34,227
If I did not hate you so much,

655
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:38,273
I might have even thought that
you were worried about the world.

656
00:42:41,234 --> 00:42:43,153
You possess a power so strong,

657
00:42:44,446 --> 00:42:46,615
yet you are
no better than me or my turtle.

658
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:49,618
That is because there is not
a single thing I wish to protect.

659
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:50,619
Listen, Jang Uk.

660
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:53,496
Do you remember what you said
when you saved everyone in the barrier?

661
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,707
You told me that
it is better to die than to do nothing,

662
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,208
just as your master has taught you.

663
00:43:00,837 --> 00:43:04,049
Back then, you were full of vigor
even though you had lost your energy.

664
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:07,510
But now you are dead
despite the power you possess.

665
00:43:08,094 --> 00:43:09,012
Fine.

666
00:43:09,095 --> 00:43:10,597
Do absolutely nothing.

667
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,683
After all, you are dead.

668
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:28,365
"Hope"?

669
00:43:44,547 --> 00:43:47,008
The tree that I remember
was not this small.

670
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:50,178
It was a lot bigger and taller.

671
00:43:53,473 --> 00:43:55,517
I was on top of that tree.

672
00:43:57,394 --> 00:43:58,687
I was there all by myself,

673
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:00,814
and that memory

674
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:03,483
is definitely mine.

675
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,497
I want to climb up that tree again.

676
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:48,111
Young Master!

677
00:44:48,194 --> 00:44:49,821
Young Master, are you all right?

678
00:44:50,363 --> 00:44:51,865
Open the door.

679
00:44:51,948 --> 00:44:53,408
Open this door!

680
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:54,826
I am all right. Just go.

681
00:44:54,909 --> 00:44:57,203
Why are you not going to Jinyowon
when you are in pain?

682
00:44:58,663 --> 00:44:59,497
Fine.

683
00:44:59,581 --> 00:45:01,374
Then I will go see Jin Ho-gyeong again.

684
00:45:07,046 --> 00:45:08,590
What are you thinking?

685
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,260
Why are you doing this to yourself?

686
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:16,473
So I can do what I can to make up

687
00:45:17,474 --> 00:45:18,725
for my ongoing regrets.

688
00:45:21,728 --> 00:45:22,770
Because that pain…

689
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:28,234
is much greater than the pain I feel now.

690
00:45:29,944 --> 00:45:32,030
You gave me a chance to do that.

691
00:45:32,822 --> 00:45:34,157
I thank you for that.

692
00:45:37,452 --> 00:45:38,870
So you do not need…

693
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:46,336
to do anything more for me.

694
00:45:48,588 --> 00:45:49,589
You have done enough.

695
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:54,844
Young Lady Heo
gave me some medicine for my pain.

696
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:57,972
I will bring it to you.

697
00:46:00,016 --> 00:46:02,185
Make sure you take it, Young Master.

698
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:15,949
The fact that they are still alive
with the blood parasite

699
00:46:16,032 --> 00:46:17,534
in the core of their energy

700
00:46:17,617 --> 00:46:20,453
shows that they have
a very high pain tolerance.

701
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:22,163
However,

702
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:26,042
if the blood parasite goes mad
after its energy surges the wrong way,

703
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:29,462
the pain will drive them crazy
and eventually kill them.

704
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,591
They will need my help
if they wish to live.

705
00:46:33,675 --> 00:46:36,928
So they will not be able
to expose Bu-yeon's secret.

706
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:40,181
But is there even a way
to get rid of the blood parasite

707
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:42,725
once it enters the core of one's energy?

708
00:46:47,981 --> 00:46:49,399
Insects are eaten…

709
00:46:51,651 --> 00:46:52,485
by birds.

710
00:46:58,908 --> 00:47:02,537
Jin Bu-yeon really seems like a priestess
with amazing divine powers.

711
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,622
She has started to regain
her divine powers?

712
00:47:04,706 --> 00:47:06,416
You told her that
once she regains her memories,

713
00:47:06,499 --> 00:47:08,209
her divine powers will come back.

714
00:47:08,293 --> 00:47:09,127
No.

715
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:11,713
If she regains her divine powers,
her memories will return.

716
00:47:12,755 --> 00:47:13,881
Is there a difference?

717
00:47:15,425 --> 00:47:16,509
Have her find the earthenware.

718
00:47:26,185 --> 00:47:28,187
Once Jin Bu-yeon regains
her divine powers,

719
00:47:29,022 --> 00:47:31,441
Naksu will also retrieve her old memories

720
00:47:31,941 --> 00:47:34,402
and will eventually
be rejected by that body.

721
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:46,998
Ta-da.

722
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:48,833
I was given the Spirit Plaque of Songrim.

723
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:51,377
They said my skills are
on par with Jeongjingak mages,

724
00:47:51,461 --> 00:47:52,503
so I am allowed to enter freely.

725
00:47:52,587 --> 00:47:54,922
It took me so much effort to earn that,

726
00:47:55,006 --> 00:47:58,009
but seeing you with it
makes it feel like it was all for nothing.

727
00:47:58,092 --> 00:47:59,385
It took you a lot of effort?

728
00:48:00,219 --> 00:48:01,137
I guess you got bad grades.

729
00:48:01,721 --> 00:48:02,889
What was your class rank when you trained?

730
00:48:02,972 --> 00:48:07,644
As soon as I opened my gate of energy,
I reached Chisu faster than anyone.

731
00:48:07,727 --> 00:48:09,270
You must have trained very hard.

732
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:10,897
That is because someone made sure

733
00:48:11,814 --> 00:48:14,484
that my life was put at risk
if I did not do my best.

734
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:15,401
Who?

735
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:17,904
My…

736
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:21,240
master.

737
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:28,956
My harsh master always
put me on the brink and pushed me.

738
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,750
Thanks to that,

739
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:32,502
I learned to climb back up again.

740
00:48:33,419 --> 00:48:35,046
My master never allowed me

741
00:48:35,672 --> 00:48:37,006
to quit and do nothing.

742
00:48:38,508 --> 00:48:40,718
It is better to die than do nothing.

743
00:48:45,932 --> 00:48:46,766
What?

744
00:48:47,934 --> 00:48:49,852
Did I confuse you again?

745
00:48:51,145 --> 00:48:54,065
Now I really have no idea
who it is that is talking.

746
00:48:57,068 --> 00:48:58,194
But it is strange.

747
00:48:58,277 --> 00:49:00,279
I have heard that too many times today.

748
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:02,115
Maybe because I thought of quitting.

749
00:49:02,198 --> 00:49:03,574
What do you mean?

750
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,743
Were you going to quit everything?

751
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:08,663
Yes.

752
00:49:10,123 --> 00:49:11,207
I figured I finally found a way

753
00:49:12,542 --> 00:49:14,711
to get rid of the burden I carry.

754
00:49:17,797 --> 00:49:18,631
Is it…

755
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:21,884
that burdensome for you?

756
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:31,602
Lord Park told me I was incredible

757
00:49:31,686 --> 00:49:33,563
as he gave me this.

758
00:49:33,646 --> 00:49:35,648
I will slowly become
more and more powerful,

759
00:49:37,024 --> 00:49:38,276
and I will use that power…

760
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:42,363
to protect you.

761
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:45,658
I am also starting to get confused

762
00:49:46,826 --> 00:49:47,744
about what it is

763
00:49:49,537 --> 00:49:50,621
that I really want from you.

764
00:49:51,998 --> 00:49:52,832
I plan

765
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,042
to find my own room.

766
00:49:57,003 --> 00:50:00,423
I will find out who I really am
and decorate my room with my own traits.

767
00:50:03,134 --> 00:50:03,968
I hope…

768
00:50:06,304 --> 00:50:07,722
that makes it easier for you to find me.

769
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,194
I will keep you warm

770
00:50:22,403 --> 00:50:23,780
and help you rest comfortably.

771
00:50:46,594 --> 00:50:48,888
I barely managed to advance
the date of the rite.

772
00:50:48,971 --> 00:50:51,474
But you threw everything into the lake?

773
00:50:52,308 --> 00:50:54,352
I had no other choice.
I could not let Songrim find out.

774
00:50:54,435 --> 00:50:58,481
I will have to put So-i
back in charge of importing goods.

775
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:01,526
Take him out of here.

776
00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:04,028
So-i has been gone
from the gambling den for days.

777
00:51:04,111 --> 00:51:05,822
She will forever be under my control

778
00:51:05,905 --> 00:51:07,782
as long as the blood parasite
lives inside her.

779
00:51:08,491 --> 00:51:10,451
Wait until she shows up
and bring her here.

780
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:11,536
Yes, Gwanju.

781
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:20,962
Show them this letter.

782
00:51:22,421 --> 00:51:23,589
Then they will take care of you.

783
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:26,759
When will you visit Jin Ho-gyeong?

784
00:51:26,843 --> 00:51:28,135
You have no time to waste.

785
00:51:28,928 --> 00:51:29,762
I know.

786
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:31,973
I hope you come back alive.

787
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,311
You will be returning to Seoho Fortress
once you are better, right?

788
00:51:42,108 --> 00:51:43,067
Have a safe trip.

789
00:52:07,049 --> 00:52:08,384
I am trying to pick

790
00:52:09,135 --> 00:52:10,761
a perfect date for our wedding.

791
00:52:11,512 --> 00:52:12,597
Let us get married quickly.

792
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,764
All right.

793
00:52:16,893 --> 00:52:18,978
I also need to pick a wedding date
for Young Master Jang.

794
00:52:20,313 --> 00:52:22,106
Let us invite every single person

795
00:52:22,189 --> 00:52:25,234
in your family
from Wol Fortress to our wedding.

796
00:52:26,152 --> 00:52:28,362
I will send over a big boat.

797
00:52:28,446 --> 00:52:29,405
Thank you.

798
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,743
Who should I invite
to Young Master Jang's wedding?

799
00:52:34,702 --> 00:52:37,413
He has no family,
but I do not want the place to feel empty.

800
00:52:39,081 --> 00:52:42,585
Maidservant Kim,
why are you peeling chestnuts?

801
00:52:42,668 --> 00:52:44,420
Young Master Jang loves chestnut rice.

802
00:52:47,089 --> 00:52:47,924
I feel sad.

803
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:50,259
It seems to you,

804
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:52,261
Uk always comes first.

805
00:52:52,345 --> 00:52:55,640
That is because he is my young master.

806
00:52:56,474 --> 00:52:58,017
I am also concerned about him.

807
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:01,604
Here.

808
00:53:01,687 --> 00:53:04,690
If Uk and I were drowning like this,

809
00:53:04,774 --> 00:53:06,484
who would you save first?

810
00:53:08,235 --> 00:53:09,862
Why would I save either of you?

811
00:53:10,446 --> 00:53:12,406
You two could easily swim out.

812
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:13,866
What if we could not?

813
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:16,827
What if we were both struggling
to get out of the water?

814
00:53:16,911 --> 00:53:20,164
Whose name would you call first?

815
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:23,209
Well…

816
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:27,254
-Ja--
-Of course,

817
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:29,799
you would call Jang Uk first.

818
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:34,470
You would only be concerned about Uk.

819
00:53:34,553 --> 00:53:35,721
You would not care

820
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:38,432
about me at all.

821
00:53:38,516 --> 00:53:39,517
Look who is talking.

822
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,602
You once said you would seal the door shut

823
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:43,229
even if I end up dying inside.

824
00:53:43,312 --> 00:53:45,147
-When did I say that?
-Unbelievable.

825
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,026
Then let me ask you one more time.

826
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:53,239
Let us say I was trapped
inside a very dangerous room,

827
00:53:53,322 --> 00:53:56,367
and you had to seal the door.

828
00:53:56,450 --> 00:54:00,955
Then would you seal that door or not?

829
00:54:03,624 --> 00:54:06,544
How urgent is the situation?

830
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:08,629
If I did not seal the door,

831
00:54:09,672 --> 00:54:11,924
would the entire world be in danger?

832
00:54:12,008 --> 00:54:13,718
Listen to yourself!

833
00:54:13,801 --> 00:54:15,553
How could you even care
about the situation

834
00:54:15,636 --> 00:54:17,638
when I would be the one in danger?

835
00:54:17,722 --> 00:54:19,557
I would die.

836
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,435
Do not speak of
such a heartbreaking situation.

837
00:54:23,602 --> 00:54:24,603
You…

838
00:54:25,271 --> 00:54:26,981
will never be in danger.

839
00:54:27,982 --> 00:54:29,734
I will always be there to protect you.

840
00:54:30,943 --> 00:54:31,777
Goodness.

841
00:54:32,361 --> 00:54:34,905
Even if you decide to seal that door,

842
00:54:35,781 --> 00:54:39,285
I know how heartbreaking
it will be for you,

843
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:41,537
so it does not upset me so much.

844
00:54:42,955 --> 00:54:46,250
So just know that even if I call
Young Master Jang's name before yours,

845
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:52,339
it is not because my love for you
is in any way smaller.

846
00:54:53,716 --> 00:54:54,884
I was a fool.

847
00:54:55,468 --> 00:54:56,469
That question

848
00:54:57,261 --> 00:55:02,266
also implied that you had to watch
the death of your beloved one.

849
00:55:05,311 --> 00:55:06,145
Both should be saved.

850
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:10,149
You should save them both
in any way possible.

851
00:55:15,196 --> 00:55:18,115
Neither of them will ever drown.

852
00:55:47,019 --> 00:55:50,022
Tear out the heart and break it to pieces.

853
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:53,275
You wish to go to Danhyanggok?

854
00:55:54,193 --> 00:55:55,111
Why?

855
00:55:55,194 --> 00:55:59,281
I heard there is a gigantic tree there,
and I wish to see it myself.

856
00:55:59,365 --> 00:56:01,367
There is a gigantic tree there.

857
00:56:02,368 --> 00:56:03,994
I went there with Uk, Yul, and…

858
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,623
We went there together.

859
00:56:07,706 --> 00:56:10,042
The tree I wish to see is mine.

860
00:56:10,126 --> 00:56:11,252
What?

861
00:56:12,461 --> 00:56:14,672
I remember a very big tree,

862
00:56:15,297 --> 00:56:16,507
and I wish to see

863
00:56:17,842 --> 00:56:18,926
if it really exists.

864
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:23,806
I am not sure if we are
talking about the same tree,

865
00:56:24,473 --> 00:56:26,934
but it is located somewhere high up,
so it will be easy to find.

866
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:30,354
I would love to take you there myself,

867
00:56:30,438 --> 00:56:31,313
but I am too busy.

868
00:56:31,397 --> 00:56:33,941
I could have someone
escort you to Danhyanggok.

869
00:56:34,024 --> 00:56:36,026
I will ask if I need someone.

870
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:37,862
Are you going to Danhyanggok?

871
00:56:39,196 --> 00:56:42,616
Yul knows his way around Danhyanggok
a lot better than I do.

872
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,201
He went there often as a kid.

873
00:56:44,285 --> 00:56:45,870
I also wanted to visit.

874
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:47,955
Shall we go together?

875
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:51,083
Great, Yul can take you there.
You should go with him.

876
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:53,043
I heard it is a dangerous place.

877
00:56:54,086 --> 00:56:55,045
Is that all right?

878
00:56:55,629 --> 00:56:56,464
Yes.

879
00:56:57,882 --> 00:56:59,133
Let us go there together.

880
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:06,724
THE FIRE BIRD

881
00:57:10,603 --> 00:57:12,730
It looks like these people

882
00:57:12,813 --> 00:57:15,191
are trying to do the same
by waking the fire bird.

883
00:57:15,274 --> 00:57:18,152
You know how dangerous a fire bird is,
and yet you are going to leave?

884
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:23,073
It is better to die than do nothing.

885
00:57:46,013 --> 00:57:48,390
I do not have
that stone with me right now.

886
00:57:48,474 --> 00:57:50,476
If she really does not have it,

887
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:54,230
it should be somewhere in the room.

888
00:58:04,156 --> 00:58:05,157
What are you doing?

889
00:58:06,242 --> 00:58:07,451
You came awfully quick.

890
00:58:09,828 --> 00:58:10,913
What is it?

891
00:58:10,996 --> 00:58:13,040
Are you having trouble sleeping?
Do you want to sleep in my arms?

892
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:14,583
How will that help me sleep?

893
00:58:14,667 --> 00:58:16,252
I am not here because of what you said.

894
00:58:16,335 --> 00:58:17,419
I am here to check

895
00:58:18,337 --> 00:58:20,839
if you really have not been
carrying that item around.

896
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:31,642
Look. I kept it in here.

897
00:58:34,353 --> 00:58:35,187
So it really was you

898
00:58:36,564 --> 00:58:37,856
who said those words?

899
00:58:39,275 --> 00:58:40,276
I find it strange too,

900
00:58:41,694 --> 00:58:43,487
which is why I plan to go
to Danhyanggok tomorrow.

901
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:44,780
Danhyanggok?

902
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,990
To see a tree.

903
00:58:46,907 --> 00:58:48,701
You told me that
the tree you mentioned really exists.

904
00:58:50,869 --> 00:58:54,582
I want to see
if the tree I remember also exists there.

905
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:57,835
That jade makes things
even more confusing.

906
00:58:58,419 --> 00:58:59,545
But one thing is for sure.

907
00:58:59,628 --> 00:59:00,671
I knew about that tree

908
00:59:01,589 --> 00:59:03,632
way before I even met you.

909
00:59:06,427 --> 00:59:09,513
Seeing that tree for myself
will help me find out who I really am.

910
00:59:11,307 --> 00:59:13,100
All right, go ahead.

911
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:14,977
-I will--
-I will be going with Yul.

912
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:19,398
-With Yul?
-He offered to go with me.

913
00:59:19,481 --> 00:59:20,608
He knows the place well.

914
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:24,069
Why would you bother him?

915
00:59:24,153 --> 00:59:25,946
He also wanted to see the tree.

916
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:27,656
He is only being nice as my friend.

917
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,366
He just feels bad about saying no.

918
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:31,910
-He is my friend too.
-No, he is my friend.

919
00:59:31,994 --> 00:59:33,329
You cannot be friends with my friend.

920
00:59:33,412 --> 00:59:35,122
-Why not?
-Yul is my friend.

921
00:59:35,205 --> 00:59:37,124
If he is your friend,
that means we are friends too.

922
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:38,083
Can we not even be friends?

923
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:40,127
How can someone who hugs me
and puts me to bed be just a friend?

924
01:00:03,817 --> 01:00:04,652
Have fun

925
01:00:06,278 --> 01:00:08,030
at Danhyanggok with your friend.

926
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:13,827
I am fine with you being Yul's friend.

927
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:30,094
I must be crazy.

928
01:00:44,441 --> 01:00:46,652
So this is Danhyanggok.

929
01:00:46,735 --> 01:00:48,070
What a wonderful view.

930
01:00:51,031 --> 01:00:53,742
Did you say you came here often as a kid?

931
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:55,661
Yes.

932
01:00:57,246 --> 01:00:58,914
This is where we first met.

933
01:00:58,997 --> 01:01:01,709
We met when we were young?

934
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:06,797
I came here to see you.

935
01:01:10,217 --> 01:01:12,219
I did not even care
that I had hurt my leg,

936
01:01:13,429 --> 01:01:15,305
and I was not afraid of getting scolded…

937
01:01:21,145 --> 01:01:22,646
because I liked you a lot.

938
01:01:24,982 --> 01:01:26,900
I could not stop feeling this way,

939
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:30,404
so I did nothing
even though I knew who you were.

940
01:01:30,487 --> 01:01:32,406
And that left me with agonizing regrets.

941
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:37,119
This time, I am glad
I recognized you first.

942
01:01:39,413 --> 01:01:41,582
I finally have a chance
to do what I need to do.

943
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:09,943
Young Master. Young Master Seo.

944
01:02:13,822 --> 01:02:16,033
You seemed to be lost in your thoughts.

945
01:02:16,116 --> 01:02:18,243
Master Heo wishes to see you.

946
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:25,417
Yun-ok told me

947
01:02:25,501 --> 01:02:27,920
that you helped hide that girl named So-i.

948
01:02:28,003 --> 01:02:29,213
She is already gone.

949
01:02:29,755 --> 01:02:31,465
I sent her far away, so do not worry.

950
01:02:32,674 --> 01:02:33,509
Why…

951
01:02:34,218 --> 01:02:36,637
have you been avoiding me?

952
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,225
Do you still resent me
for sending you to Seoho Fortress?

953
01:02:41,809 --> 01:02:43,435
You had to carry on
the Seo family's bloodline,

954
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:46,563
so I did not want you involved
in anything regarding Naksu.

955
01:02:46,647 --> 01:02:47,773
I know.

956
01:02:53,153 --> 01:02:54,905
You do not look so well.

957
01:02:54,988 --> 01:02:56,949
Let me examine you.

958
01:02:57,032 --> 01:02:59,159
-Follow me inside.
-I need to go somewhere.

959
01:02:59,785 --> 01:03:00,994
I will come by…

960
01:03:04,915 --> 01:03:05,833
once I return.

961
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:07,793
All right. Make sure you do.

962
01:03:08,836 --> 01:03:11,004
If you do not come, I will hunt you down.

963
01:03:12,214 --> 01:03:13,048
I will.

964
01:03:14,633 --> 01:03:15,801
I am sorry, Master Heo.

965
01:03:17,636 --> 01:03:18,554
I wish you good health.

966
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:31,525
Madam, what made you so concerned

967
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:33,068
that you decided to return?

968
01:03:33,151 --> 01:03:36,154
We shall leave as soon as I check
that he goes to Jinyowon.

969
01:03:36,238 --> 01:03:39,533
Why do you care so much about him?

970
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:41,869
Do you like him?

971
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:49,585
The only kind of world I ever knew

972
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:53,130
was filled with filth and darkness.

973
01:03:55,549 --> 01:03:57,759
I saw him when I was swindling people

974
01:03:59,595 --> 01:04:00,971
by pretending to be blind.

975
01:04:04,266 --> 01:04:06,018
And for the first time ever…

976
01:04:08,854 --> 01:04:10,105
the world seemed…

977
01:04:13,066 --> 01:04:14,109
clean and bright.

978
01:04:32,252 --> 01:04:33,086
That is just

979
01:04:34,421 --> 01:04:35,422
how I felt.

980
01:04:35,505 --> 01:04:37,466
All right, then. Let us go check.

981
01:04:38,967 --> 01:04:40,344
I will go buy us some noodles.

982
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:10,040
It seems like the mages of Cheonbugwan
have taken over while I was gone.

983
01:05:23,637 --> 01:05:26,515
You were trying to run away, were you not?

984
01:05:27,182 --> 01:05:30,519
It would be impossible to do that
with that blood parasite inside you.

985
01:05:31,103 --> 01:05:33,480
Did you perhaps remove it from your body?

986
01:05:46,284 --> 01:05:49,037
Tell me the truth
if you wish to spare your life.

987
01:05:49,121 --> 01:05:51,456
Did you take the blood parasite out
of your body?

988
01:05:58,797 --> 01:06:00,132
Maidservant Kim packed us lunch.

989
01:06:01,425 --> 01:06:02,926
What beautiful weather.

990
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:04,845
It is like we are going on a picnic.

991
01:06:06,763 --> 01:06:08,140
Did you say goodbye to Uk?

992
01:06:08,724 --> 01:06:09,683
Yes, I did.

993
01:06:09,766 --> 01:06:11,893
He told me to have fun with my friend.

994
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,732
How is your condition?

995
01:06:17,816 --> 01:06:19,109
Do you feel better?

996
01:06:19,192 --> 01:06:21,236
I did what you asked and did not tell Uk.

997
01:06:25,991 --> 01:06:27,034
I am sorry.

998
01:06:28,785 --> 01:06:29,953
Young Master Seo!

999
01:06:32,914 --> 01:06:34,541
What are you doing here?

1000
01:06:34,624 --> 01:06:36,209
-Did you not get on the boat?
-I…

1001
01:06:36,293 --> 01:06:38,336
Madam So-i was captured
by Cheonbugwan mages.

1002
01:06:39,588 --> 01:06:40,797
What is a blood parasite?

1003
01:06:41,506 --> 01:06:44,426
They keep beating her
saying she no longer has it.

1004
01:06:45,052 --> 01:06:46,428
Is she at the gambling den?

1005
01:06:46,511 --> 01:06:47,512
Yes.

1006
01:06:54,102 --> 01:06:55,937
Whose body holds the blood parasite?

1007
01:06:56,021 --> 01:06:57,606
Who did you give the medicine to?

1008
01:06:58,190 --> 01:07:00,942
I told you, I took the medicine!

1009
01:07:02,944 --> 01:07:04,696
I thought it would be good for me.

1010
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:08,325
Just tell me the truth.

1011
01:07:09,034 --> 01:07:11,411
If I take you to Gwanju,
he will crush you to pieces.

1012
01:07:19,795 --> 01:07:20,837
Put that down.

1013
01:07:20,921 --> 01:07:23,965
Put that back down!

1014
01:07:24,049 --> 01:07:27,135
Put that down! Put it back!

1015
01:07:28,011 --> 01:07:29,054
Put that down!

1016
01:07:29,137 --> 01:07:31,807
No! Put that down!

1017
01:07:39,648 --> 01:07:40,941
A blood parasite?

1018
01:07:41,024 --> 01:07:42,150
What is that?

1019
01:07:42,234 --> 01:07:43,777
I am not sure.

1020
01:07:44,653 --> 01:07:45,862
But that is what I heard.

1021
01:07:47,656 --> 01:07:49,866
There is something I have not told you.

1022
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:55,247
He told me not to tell you.

1023
01:08:00,669 --> 01:08:01,962
But Seo Yul is severely ill.

1024
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:07,384
I saw an unusual form
of energy inside him.

1025
01:08:08,176 --> 01:08:10,595
I think it was the blood parasite.

1026
01:08:18,645 --> 01:08:20,647
Take out all the items from Cheonbugwan
that So-i brought.

1027
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:21,731
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1028
01:08:54,931 --> 01:08:57,434
Were you the person
that So-i tried to protect?

1029
01:08:57,517 --> 01:08:58,768
I need to take her with me.

1030
01:08:58,852 --> 01:08:59,686
Move aside.

1031
01:09:01,146 --> 01:09:03,732
So-i knows too many of Gwanju's secrets.

1032
01:09:03,815 --> 01:09:05,901
If I let Songrim take her,
my life will be at stake.

1033
01:09:05,984 --> 01:09:06,902
I cannot let you do that.

1034
01:09:07,485 --> 01:09:08,862
Cheonbugwan has been looking for her.

1035
01:09:13,366 --> 01:09:14,242
I told you to move aside.

1036
01:09:14,326 --> 01:09:16,369
Why would a man like you
protect someone like her?

1037
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:17,662
I will not allow you

1038
01:09:18,496 --> 01:09:20,290
to take her to Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan.

1039
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:42,354
I must end it quickly.

1040
01:09:43,104 --> 01:09:44,731
Using too much of my energy
will put me in danger.

1041
01:09:53,573 --> 01:09:54,449
The blood parasite?

1042
01:09:57,702 --> 01:09:58,995
The blood parasite given to So-i

1043
01:10:00,205 --> 01:10:01,831
is now inside Seo Yul.

1044
01:11:07,647 --> 01:11:08,481
So-i.

1045
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,370
I am glad that before I die…

1046
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:25,749
I can see you

1047
01:11:27,834 --> 01:11:29,461
who made the world

1048
01:11:32,464 --> 01:11:33,673
seem clean and bright.

1049
01:11:38,887 --> 01:11:39,888
Please…

1050
01:11:41,973 --> 01:11:43,266
stay alive.

1051
01:12:09,042 --> 01:12:12,712
I do not know how a nobleman like you
got involved with a girl like her.

1052
01:12:13,588 --> 01:12:15,340
But now that things have come to this,

1053
01:12:15,924 --> 01:12:17,217
I cannot spare you.

1054
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,615
Yul.

1055
01:14:05,366 --> 01:14:06,409
Yul.

1056
01:14:08,411 --> 01:14:09,245
Uk.

1057
01:14:12,457 --> 01:14:13,416
I am sorry.

1058
01:14:47,617 --> 01:14:49,244
Not a single person…

1059
01:14:51,204 --> 01:14:52,830
will be able to walk out of here alive.

1060
01:15:17,647 --> 01:15:20,567
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

1061
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:23,027
Who put that thing in So-i's body?

1062
01:15:23,111 --> 01:15:24,445
Was it Jin Mu's doing?

1063
01:15:25,405 --> 01:15:27,574
Stop Jang Uk from entering Cheonbugwan!

1064
01:15:30,118 --> 01:15:31,703
If Seo Yul dies,

1065
01:15:31,786 --> 01:15:34,747
it will start a great clash
between Songrim and Cheonbugwan.

1066
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:39,002
She said she did not want to find out,
so I plan to show her.

1067
01:15:40,128 --> 01:15:41,713
Only three breaths.

1068
01:15:41,796 --> 01:15:44,507
You said you have
no recollection of who you are, right?

1069
01:15:44,591 --> 01:15:47,927
The blue marks bloomed
in her eyes like flowers.

1070
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:55,435
