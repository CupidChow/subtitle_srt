1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,709
My lady, you must stay strong.

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:03,544
You must stay awake.

3
00:00:03,627 --> 00:00:04,837
Please stay strong.

4
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,266
I SHALL MAKE DO-HWA MINE
IF SHE BEARS A CHILD, KNOW THAT IT IS MINE

5
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:19,351
Thanks to you,

6
00:00:20,102 --> 00:00:23,272
the past seven days have been wonderful.

7
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:29,695
Do-hwa will be giving birth

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,990
to my son soon.

9
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:36,535
Your Majesty.

10
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:41,040
Do you remember the divination I received
on the day of my coronation?

11
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:45,127
You said I would be granted a son

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,964
who had the energy of the King's Star.

13
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:53,219
The divination was incorrect.
That cannot be.

14
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,889
No.

15
00:00:58,432 --> 00:01:01,060
What you said has to be true.

16
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:05,189
I will have a son
thanks to your alchemy of souls.

17
00:01:06,982 --> 00:01:08,692
Remember that.

18
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:11,779
Do-hwa will bear

19
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:15,157
my son.

20
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:19,537
He will be mine.

21
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:21,640
The star at the center of the Big Dipper
that contains nature's secrets

22
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:26,353
only reveals itself when the sky is filled
with the energy of the Daeho waters.

23
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:37,197
And my son will be born
when that star appears.

24
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,961
From this moment forward,
I hereby banish Jang Uk from Songrim.

25
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:53,631
There is one more left.

26
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:55,090
As for the last one,
you should do it yourself.

27
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:12,066
Mu-deok.

28
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:16,695
Is Young Master still not talking?

29
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:21,700
No. His back was flogged,
but it seems his mouth was as well.

30
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,203
He cries in pain even when
he bumps his fingers into something.

31
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:26,956
But he is being silent
after being flogged 100 times.

32
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,123
I am truly worried.

33
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,293
He is a crybaby, so I am guessing
it is still bearable for him.

34
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:36,757
His back is not what is paining him.
It is his heart.

35
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:41,804
He was cast away by the man
he considered a father figure.

36
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:43,430
Imagine how he feels.

37
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:46,558
He must think he was abandoned.

38
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,459
You should be happy you got flogged.

39
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:16,338
They will not be able to retrieve
the torrent of energy right away.

40
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,340
You will have more time to train.

41
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:30,477
Young Master.

42
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,313
Are you all right?

43
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:54,752
Mu-deok, look at this.

44
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:57,129
I think I used my energy
to make these ripples.

45
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:03,385
The water is just rippling.

46
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:07,890
Why is it not working? I have been
practicing my breathing technique.

47
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:10,309
Is that what
you have been doing in silence?

48
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:13,604
I thought you were wallowing in sadness
for being abandoned.

49
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:16,273
-I was wrong.
-Wallowing in sadness?

50
00:05:16,356 --> 00:05:18,358
I was abandoned
from the moment I was born.

51
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:20,694
And this is not my first time
getting kicked out.

52
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,237
It does not faze me.

53
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:29,536
Just wait and see.

54
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,040
I will make them beg me
to come back to Songrim.

55
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,126
I guess being stupid
can be helpful at times.

56
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,711
I am acting with vigor.

57
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,093
By the way, why is it so hot in here?

58
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:46,595
Hot? I am cold.

59
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,141
Why did the water become so hot?

60
00:05:53,477 --> 00:05:54,978
Why are you burning up?

61
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:59,691
I feel strange.
I think my body is getting hotter.

62
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:01,110
It is the energy.

63
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,445
But this soon?

64
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:07,908
It was the flogging.

65
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:10,160
It caused the torrent of energy
to surge faster.

66
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:12,579
I am glad you got flogged.

67
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:17,251
Mu-deok, I am burning up.

68
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:20,671
You will burn up once the torrent
of energy transforms into heat.

69
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:22,881
Then you will feel chilly
when it becomes cold.

70
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,592
That energy will be yours
only if you can bear that.

71
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,555
Keep breathing slowly.

72
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,814
This is cold water.

73
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:53,620
Mu-deok.

74
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:56,039
Is Young Master still bathing?

75
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:58,083
It has been almost an hour.

76
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,880
If she finds out, she will tell Songrim.
Then we will lose the torrent of energy.

77
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:03,839
Medicinal herbs.

78
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:07,634
He is bathing in medicinal herbs.

79
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:09,928
I have dissolved some medicinal herbs

80
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,848
and let him bathe in them
to treat his wounds.

81
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:14,933
Is that so?

82
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,561
Good thinking.

83
00:07:20,647 --> 00:07:21,732
Hold on.

84
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,741
Then why is the water cold?

85
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:32,034
Sorry?

86
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:35,078
The water must have cooled down
in the past hour.

87
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:37,080
So why are you not bringing him hot water?

88
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,251
Is he running a fever?

89
00:07:43,086 --> 00:07:44,254
Young Master.

90
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,469
That is so cold.

91
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:52,763
How could you let this happen?

92
00:07:52,846 --> 00:07:54,306
What if he catches a cold?

93
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:04,066
The boiling hot water became ice-cold.

94
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:05,234
Young Master.

95
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,070
Where did he go?

96
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:09,863
Goodness.

97
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:16,286
Young Master, are you all right?

98
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:18,205
Yes.

99
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:21,542
Bathing in medicinal herbs
has made me relaxed but drowsy.

100
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,880
Come on, now. Go on and make his bed.

101
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:31,468
It is the cold. His body is freezing now.

102
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,769
I am freezing.
I think I am covered in ice.

103
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,399
It is the cold. Your energy
is surging faster than I thought.

104
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,818
Keep breathing.

105
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,970
I am freezing. I think I might faint.

106
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,266
Fight it. You must.

107
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:24,187
Jang Uk! Stay alert.

108
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:26,064
You could freeze to death
if you fall asleep now.

109
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,274
Get up.

110
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:31,069
Keep breathing.

111
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,542
Uncle, Yul and I
are the only friends Uk has.

112
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,128
He has nowhere but Songrim to call home.

113
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:51,006
Please let him return to Songrim.

114
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:52,799
He will not be able to train anyway.

115
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,968
No one will take him in

116
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,346
once they find out
he has been ousted from Songrim.

117
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,766
Stop talking about Uk.

118
00:10:00,849 --> 00:10:04,102
I want you to focus
on the soul shifter case from now on.

119
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:15,238
He has completely hardened like stone.

120
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:17,908
He has been petrified.

121
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,788
A soul shifter who has run wild

122
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:25,999
replaces their lost energy
by absorbing that of a human.

123
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:30,295
He is no different from an evil spirit.

124
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,006
I can see why you forbid this sorcery.

125
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,967
The alchemy of souls
was not a type of sorcery from the start.

126
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:38,178
You can only perform this

127
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:41,681
once you have mastered Jipsu, Ryusu,
Chisu, and ultimately, Hwansu.

128
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:43,266
Hwansu is the godlike power

129
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,770
of changing water
to fire and vice versa. Is it not?

130
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:49,064
-Humans cannot reach that level.
-Right.

131
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:51,733
But Master Seo Gyeong,
the founder of Songrim, did.

132
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,568
There was also someone else.

133
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:54,694
Who?

134
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:56,696
As if you would know his name.

135
00:10:58,156 --> 00:11:00,826
Who dared to perform the alchemy of souls

136
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:03,578
on this poor Songrim pupil?

137
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:07,374
He was meant to work at Cheonbugwan
and record the constellations.

138
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:09,709
He had been frequenting
the place for a few months.

139
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:13,213
Right. They were the ones
who caught Naksu's men

140
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:15,715
whom we had failed to catch
as if they had been waiting.

141
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:18,218
I am certain that
they have something to do

142
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,429
with this soul shifter case.

143
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:25,183
Yul and Dang-gu,
keep an eye on Cheonbugwan

144
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,102
and see if there is anything strange.

145
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:28,562
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

146
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:32,649
What is wrong with that?

147
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:35,026
It has been malfunctioning
ever since Uk broke it.

148
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:38,155
-Jang Uk…
-Do not move!

149
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,073
It will crumble.

150
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:44,828
Do not move.

151
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:47,122
Wait until the door completely shuts.

152
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,082
Jang Uk!

153
00:11:49,624 --> 00:11:52,502
I told you not to move!

154
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,337
Help me!

155
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,591
Stay still.

156
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:00,010
Jang Uk…

157
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,251
Stay down for a moment.

158
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:53,063
Sapsali.

159
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,232
Come out.

160
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,651
Come with me.

161
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:43,947
I am glad you are back.

162
00:13:47,617 --> 00:13:51,872
I will reward you with delicious treats
if you find the soul shifters.

163
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:53,456
I hope we get along.

164
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:24,779
Mu-deok.

165
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:28,366
If I freeze to death,

166
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:31,620
take the torrent of energy…

167
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,916
within me if you can.

168
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,086
If I could, I would have killed you
and done that already.

169
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,674
I am freezing to death here.

170
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:48,261
Do not say such coldhearted things.

171
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:51,765
Say something heartwarming.

172
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,434
Have you finally gone mad?

173
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:55,810
What is with you?

174
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,734
Jang Uk. Open your eyes.

175
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:06,446
Fine. I will say something heartwarming.

176
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,827
There was a huge tree
where I used to live.

177
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:17,624
And there was a bird's nest on top.

178
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,043
The egg inside it was warm.

179
00:15:21,544 --> 00:15:22,921
Did you eat it?

180
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,924
I said this would be heartwarming.

181
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:33,974
The mother bird always came by
and sat on the egg.

182
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:42,857
I am the egg
that is at the top of the tree.

183
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:47,862
I know no one…

184
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:51,658
and I am powerless.

185
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,415
You are the only one
who can take care of me.

186
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,712
My life…

187
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,840
is in your hands.

188
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:15,598
How heartwarming.

189
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,023
Keep going.

190
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,488
There was also a cave where I lived.

191
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:35,035
A bear cub was living inside…

192
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,443
You cannot even take out
your own father's sword.

193
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,278
How do you expect to learn spells?

194
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,491
No one in Daeho will be able
to go against your father

195
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:16,701
and open your gate of energy.

196
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,579
That was the fate given to you

197
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,165
by your father.

198
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,687
You are not ready yet.

199
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:53,446
To unsheathe a mage's sword,

200
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:57,158
you must master Ryusu and be able
to channel your energy outward.

201
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:01,162
You cannot do it just yet
since you cannot control your energy.

202
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:04,791
My father left this sword behind
when he abandoned me.

203
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:07,085
And I can only join Songrim
if I unsheathe it.

204
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,923
I want to unsheathe it and show them.

205
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,467
Is that an act of stupidity?

206
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,844
No, it is an act of vigor.

207
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:20,974
Stay strong, Jang Uk.

208
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:41,161
Your Royal Highness.

209
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:43,705
We have arrived at Cheonbugwan's Gwanju,
Jang Gang's house.

210
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:49,252
Young Master!

211
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,673
You have a guest.

212
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:55,300
Who is it?

213
00:18:55,383 --> 00:18:58,636
The Crown Prince has come to see you.

214
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:23,828
This is the perfect weather

215
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,081
to go fishing with Uk
by Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

216
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,961
I wonder if he has recovered
from the flogging.

217
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:35,632
I am going to see him since I am worried.

218
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:37,383
But why are you tagging along?

219
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:40,178
I need to check something.

220
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:42,388
There is something I told his maid.

221
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,306
I see.

222
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:46,017
I understand that
we are visiting him as friends.

223
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,685
But why are you here?

224
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:50,939
I just happened to run into you.

225
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:54,692
And I had something
to nitpick him about. That is why.

226
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,320
I see. You are going to nitpick.

227
00:19:57,904 --> 00:19:59,447
What is in that bundle?

228
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:04,494
It is medicine to treat his wounds.

229
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:08,831
I see. You are going to give him
some medicine before nitpicking at him.

230
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,335
I see. How incredible.

231
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,547
You are here for Naksu's sword?

232
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:18,549
The King has entrusted
Cheonbugwan with it.

233
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,303
Jin Mu, the Assistant Gwanju,
should take it since the Gwanju is absent.

234
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,310
Since you came here yourself,
I will hand it over to you.

235
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,478
You can take it.

236
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:31,938
Bring it here.

237
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:34,857
And one more thing.

238
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:37,986
There is another sword here
that you cannot unsheathe.

239
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:43,157
The late king had bestowed it
on Gwanju Jang Gang.

240
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:45,368
I would like to take that as well.

241
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:48,246
But that belongs to his father.

242
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:50,665
He has the right to keep it.

243
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:52,292
He was never entrusted with it.

244
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:55,878
I heard Songrim had kept it all this time.

245
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:58,881
You only took it
after being kicked out, did you not?

246
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:04,095
The royal palace will keep it
until a new Gwanju is instated.

247
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,056
Bring it to me.

248
00:21:14,397 --> 00:21:15,898
I cannot.

249
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:21,321
As you already know,
no one acknowledges him as my father.

250
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,616
It will not bode well for me
if I lose that sword as well.

251
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,245
I will keep it, even if it means
using it as decoration.

252
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,917
I must take it with me,

253
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:37,962
but you refuse. It cannot be helped.

254
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:41,966
Whoever wins shall take the sword.

255
00:22:00,026 --> 00:22:02,653
You are not fully trained
for a true fight.

256
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:11,704
If you can push me over this line,

257
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:13,581
I will leave.

258
00:22:28,304 --> 00:22:32,934
I am sure you expected me
to grovel in humiliation.

259
00:22:34,268 --> 00:22:37,605
Going against you would be
an act of stupidity.

260
00:22:37,688 --> 00:22:40,316
However, there is someone
who sees it as one of vigor.

261
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:41,442
So I shall try.

262
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:36,164
It is the energy.

263
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:37,540
It was the flogging.

264
00:23:37,623 --> 00:23:39,667
It caused the torrent of energy
to surge faster.

265
00:23:40,543 --> 00:23:41,544
I am glad you got flogged.

266
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,882
All right. You can hit me
as much as you want.

267
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:06,295
Step back!

268
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:08,673
Step back! This is from the chamber pots!

269
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,603
What did you just do?

270
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:24,897
Who is she?

271
00:25:26,315 --> 00:25:29,151
-I serve this young master.
-How dare a maid intervene?

272
00:25:32,863 --> 00:25:34,282
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.

273
00:25:34,365 --> 00:25:36,033
My maid was impudent.

274
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:39,537
What is this?

275
00:25:42,331 --> 00:25:44,792
That is disgusting.

276
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,877
You should return home and get changed.

277
00:25:47,378 --> 00:25:49,547
-What?
-You stepped over the line.

278
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:55,553
You may have stepped back
to avoid the filthy water,

279
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:56,804
but you still lost.

280
00:25:56,887 --> 00:26:00,266
Please keep your word
and let me have my father's sword.

281
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:02,810
As you can see,

282
00:26:02,893 --> 00:26:05,438
I am afraid I cannot see you out
since I am heavily injured.

283
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,447
What is going on?

284
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,657
All right.

285
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,576
I will keep my promise
and let you have it.

286
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:20,286
However,

287
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,913
I must punish her.

288
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:30,713
I will not forgive her
for tainting my clothes.

289
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:26,143
I unsheathed this sword…

290
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:41,909
Jang Uk!

291
00:27:41,992 --> 00:27:44,578
I thought you did not know
how to use spells,

292
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,414
but you have been deceiving us all.

293
00:27:46,997 --> 00:27:47,832
That is not…

294
00:27:48,457 --> 00:27:50,543
What?

295
00:27:57,633 --> 00:27:59,051
You!

296
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,429
How dare you point
the sword at the Crown Prince?

297
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:03,681
-No, it was not me.
-Uk! Put that down!

298
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,892
-Put it down right now!
-I want to!

299
00:28:07,476 --> 00:28:08,477
But I cannot!

300
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,002
Stop it this instant!

301
00:28:34,503 --> 00:28:36,172
I have no control!

302
00:28:48,642 --> 00:28:49,643
Jang Uk.

303
00:28:50,644 --> 00:28:51,896
Die!

304
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,823
Please stop.

305
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,292
-Stop it.
-This is weird. I cannot control my arm.

306
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,710
What?

307
00:29:16,128 --> 00:29:18,130
I did not mean to do that…

308
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,008
Goodness! Young Master!

309
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:23,552
Oh, dear!

310
00:29:28,015 --> 00:29:29,016
It is a binding bracelet.

311
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:31,769
Its weight will keep
your arm under control.

312
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,821
His energy overflowed into one arm
and made it uncontrollable.

313
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:44,615
Unbind him!

314
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:48,202
Jang Uk.

315
00:29:49,286 --> 00:29:50,412
Grab your sword.

316
00:29:52,623 --> 00:29:53,582
Your Royal Highness.

317
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,668
He is no match for you.

318
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:57,336
Did you not just witness it all?

319
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,964
He unsheathed his father's sword
and pointed it at me.

320
00:30:00,047 --> 00:30:02,591
He just failed to control his energy.

321
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,177
-As you can see, he even hit me.
-Shut it!

322
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:09,765
Your Royal Highness,
you wielded your sword at him first.

323
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:12,393
The sword you swung in anger broke.

324
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:14,895
You should abide
by the mages' customs and return home.

325
00:30:18,023 --> 00:30:20,985
How dare you stand
against the Crown Prince?

326
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:27,032
Jang, Jin, Seo, and Park.
All four of you are before me.

327
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,578
I refuse to go home defeated.

328
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:31,829
What will you do?

329
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,833
Join hands and come at me.

330
00:30:43,632 --> 00:30:45,509
This is not looking good.

331
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,596
It will look like our families
are up against the royalty.

332
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,598
This is getting pretty serious.

333
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:52,266
Cho-yeon provoked him.

334
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:54,018
What did I do?

335
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,396
Then let us just hand Uk over.

336
00:30:57,479 --> 00:30:58,564
Your Royal Highness.

337
00:30:59,273 --> 00:31:01,692
They are the four heirs of Daeho.

338
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,736
The King will be furious

339
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:05,404
if he hears of this fight.

340
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,241
Then what? Should I just leave?

341
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,536
You should have stopped me
before I started.

342
00:31:26,675 --> 00:31:27,635
Mu-deok, you…

343
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:37,770
I am terribly sorry, Your Royal Highness.

344
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:42,149
How dare a lowly brat like me
splash filthy chamber pot water

345
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:43,484
on your precious clothes?

346
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,950
I am sorry. I truly am.

347
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:52,159
Go away.

348
00:31:52,242 --> 00:31:54,536
Get lost. You reek. Go.

349
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:57,915
Please forgive us.

350
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:06,548
As a token of my apology,
I will drink the rest of this.

351
00:32:07,466 --> 00:32:09,718
So please forgive us.

352
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,646
Mu-deok!

353
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,109
Why on earth would you drink that?

354
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:28,821
Young Master!

355
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:33,617
I should be the one drinking it.

356
00:32:35,494 --> 00:32:36,829
What?

357
00:32:38,622 --> 00:32:40,207
That is not true.

358
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,126
Why would you drink this?

359
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:44,712
I am the cause of all this, so I should.

360
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:47,631
You got it all wrong.
His Royal Highness is upset at me.

361
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,758
So I ought to drink it.

362
00:32:53,387 --> 00:32:55,389
There is quite a lot.

363
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:58,892
Just give it to me. I will drink it.

364
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,102
Then should we share it?

365
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,647
Why would we share drinking
this filthy water?

366
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,065
What?

367
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,233
You can have it all.

368
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,529
Then I will drink some and hand it to you.

369
00:33:10,612 --> 00:33:13,323
Help me hold it up
since I cannot use my right arm.

370
00:33:17,327 --> 00:33:18,162
Young Master!

371
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:24,251
I will drink…

372
00:33:25,502 --> 00:33:26,462
I will drink it.

373
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:28,589
Forget it.

374
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:30,549
Why would you drink this?

375
00:33:30,632 --> 00:33:31,759
Just go.

376
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:34,094
Exactly how much is there?

377
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,804
Do you want me to help out too?

378
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,724
-Really?
-Give it to me.

379
00:33:42,394 --> 00:33:43,479
It really is chamber pot water.

380
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:48,067
Your Royal Highness.

381
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,152
How could we possibly
dare to challenge you?

382
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:52,279
Must you let them drink

383
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:54,615
that filthy water solely as an apology?

384
00:33:57,993 --> 00:33:59,369
Damn it.

385
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,707
Forget it. You are making me retch.

386
00:34:06,168 --> 00:34:07,336
Let us go.

387
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:12,466
His Royal Highness is leaving!
Bow before him!

388
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,641
By the way, why did he come here?

389
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:23,227
He came for Naksu's sword.

390
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,854
Then he suddenly picked a fight.

391
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,358
He may have left for today.
But given his temper,

392
00:34:29,858 --> 00:34:31,527
he will retaliate for sure.

393
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,366
-Are you all right?
-He hit me so many times.

394
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,993
-Goodness.
-You hit me pretty hard.

395
00:34:42,454 --> 00:34:44,164
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I think so.

396
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,499
-It hurts.
-Does it?

397
00:34:45,582 --> 00:34:46,917
-Are you all right?
-It hurts.

398
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,586
-It hurts.
-Do not touch him!

399
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,384
Your Royal Highness!

400
00:34:59,346 --> 00:35:00,639
What is that?

401
00:35:01,515 --> 00:35:04,518
You came here
for Naksu's sword, so here it is.

402
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,479
That is right.

403
00:35:08,313 --> 00:35:09,857
I had come here to retrieve that.

404
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,777
I brought it to you
so you will not have to come here again.

405
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,237
Please take it.

406
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:19,283
Are you telling me to take
what I came here for and never return?

407
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:24,580
You are truly intelligent and strong.

408
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:26,874
Are you teasing me since I lost?

409
00:35:26,957 --> 00:35:29,793
Lost? You got what you came here for.

410
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,879
And he lost it.

411
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:34,965
You are the winner here.

412
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:41,054
She is right, Your Royal Highness.
You won.

413
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,099
Congratulations, Your Royal Highness.

414
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,477
Let us say that is the case.

415
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,609
You are truly generous as well.

416
00:35:53,692 --> 00:35:56,653
There is no other man
who is as noble as you.

417
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,367
What is your name?

418
00:36:04,494 --> 00:36:06,121
It is Mu-deok, Your Royal Highness.

419
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:08,290
Mu-deok.

420
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,626
Since you threw filthy water at me,

421
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:12,336
I will call you Filthy Mu-deok
from now on.

422
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:16,965
Just like your name,
you reek of filth right now.

423
00:36:23,597 --> 00:36:25,349
You even gave me a name.

424
00:36:25,432 --> 00:36:28,894
I am truly grateful for your kindness.

425
00:36:33,315 --> 00:36:34,691
Goodbye, Your Royal Highness.

426
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,736
Let us go.

427
00:36:46,828 --> 00:36:50,332
My pupil is still too weak
to fight against you.

428
00:36:50,415 --> 00:36:54,086
Until he becomes stronger,
he should not get on your bad side.

429
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:04,012
You do not hesitate to fall in love
or brown-nose others

430
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,472
for your young master's sake.

431
00:37:05,555 --> 00:37:08,141
I could not fight him myself,
so I splashed that on him.

432
00:37:10,143 --> 00:37:13,021
I reek of filth. You should avoid me.

433
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:19,945
Wipe yourself.

434
00:37:23,573 --> 00:37:26,285
How dare I dirty
the man I am in love with?

435
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,537
No, thank you.

436
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:06,533
I sure have become Filthy Mu-deok.

437
00:38:12,497 --> 00:38:15,375
You should wash up
since you probably reek as well.

438
00:38:32,434 --> 00:38:35,520
Master, I finally did it.

439
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:05,926
Gwigu was stolen from Jinyowon.

440
00:39:07,052 --> 00:39:10,806
Only those from the Jin family
can open that door.

441
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,768
They must have summoned it out of there.

442
00:39:16,478 --> 00:39:17,896
A burglary in Jinyowon?

443
00:39:17,979 --> 00:39:21,149
You were heartbroken for years
after losing your eldest daughter.

444
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:24,611
You must have become weaker
over the years.

445
00:39:25,737 --> 00:39:27,948
What an impudent brat.

446
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,993
You may be an illegitimate son,
but you are still part of the Jin family.

447
00:39:32,077 --> 00:39:34,162
How dare you bad-mouth your half-sister?

448
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,372
How dare you?

449
00:39:35,455 --> 00:39:36,748
I am the Assistant Gwanju.

450
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,459
I would appreciate it
if you showed more respect.

451
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:50,679
My lord, please come outside.
Jang Uk is here.

452
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,119
Did I not forbid him from entering here?

453
00:40:14,202 --> 00:40:17,747
So why did you bring him with you?

454
00:40:18,665 --> 00:40:20,459
There is something you should see.

455
00:40:27,674 --> 00:40:29,551
This is my father's sword.

456
00:40:30,343 --> 00:40:33,722
When I was young, you said
you would accept me if I unsheathed this.

457
00:40:34,389 --> 00:40:35,348
Do you remember?

458
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:19,017
I thought he had just opened
his gate of energy.

459
00:41:19,726 --> 00:41:22,729
I see he has absorbed
my torrent of energy.

460
00:41:23,396 --> 00:41:25,482
Like father, like son.

461
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:27,692
He mastered Ryusu in the blink of an eye.

462
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:31,655
Please take me under your wing,

463
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:33,406
my lord.

464
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,871
What is that around your arm?

465
00:41:40,455 --> 00:41:42,707
His energy is focused on his right arm.

466
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,084
He could not control it yet,

467
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:46,127
so it has been tied down
by the binding bracelet.

468
00:41:57,722 --> 00:41:59,683
Take it off.

469
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,144
If we do, his arm will get out of control.

470
00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:06,064
He should unbind it
after receiving more training.

471
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,233
Do it.

472
00:42:34,634 --> 00:42:38,054
Let me see you hold your sword.

473
00:43:09,544 --> 00:43:11,463
Bind his arm again.

474
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:26,895
Are you all right, my lord?

475
00:43:27,937 --> 00:43:29,856
What is the point of unsheathing the sword

476
00:43:31,816 --> 00:43:33,568
when you cannot even hold it?

477
00:43:39,741 --> 00:43:41,660
He is just not able to control it for now.

478
00:43:41,743 --> 00:43:43,912
But his power is incredible.

479
00:43:43,995 --> 00:43:45,497
He even beat the Crown Prince with that.

480
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:48,917
He broke His Royal Highness' sword.

481
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,544
Despite having mastered Ryusu long ago,

482
00:43:51,628 --> 00:43:53,171
he was defeated by Uk.

483
00:43:54,714 --> 00:43:56,925
Cho-yeon, stop intervening.

484
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,469
Yes, Mother.

485
00:44:00,345 --> 00:44:05,100
Uk, did you really fight the Crown Prince?

486
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,435
He did not start it first.

487
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,396
Did you fight him?

488
00:44:11,439 --> 00:44:12,524
I did.

489
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,528
His Royal Highness wanted
to take the Gwanju's sword.

490
00:44:16,611 --> 00:44:18,488
It was a bet, my lord.

491
00:44:19,197 --> 00:44:21,157
Even the Crown Prince forgave him.

492
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:26,663
Despite his sword having broken,
Uk still threatened him with that sword!

493
00:44:26,746 --> 00:44:29,582
He put the Crown Prince's life in danger.

494
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:30,667
We were there too.

495
00:44:31,793 --> 00:44:32,877
We stopped him beforehand.

496
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:35,004
That means the four of you watched

497
00:44:35,088 --> 00:44:37,257
as His Royal Highness was ridiculed.

498
00:44:39,717 --> 00:44:42,720
This is an insult to the royal family!

499
00:44:45,723 --> 00:44:47,517
Lock him up.

500
00:44:50,395 --> 00:44:52,564
He is uncontrollable and dangerous.

501
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:53,773
Yes, my lord.

502
00:45:13,209 --> 00:45:15,170
As soon as his gate of energy was opened,

503
00:45:15,253 --> 00:45:19,174
Jang Uk immediately wielded
his sword at the Crown Prince.

504
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:25,013
Cheonbugwan will not let this slide.

505
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,867
Have you still not received treatment?
You bled a lot.

506
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,622
How is your arm?

507
00:46:36,334 --> 00:46:38,545
The binding bracelet hinders its movement.

508
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,630
But I am fine.

509
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:45,552
You managed to turn
Master Heo's torrent of energy into yours

510
00:46:45,635 --> 00:46:47,136
in a short period of time.

511
00:46:48,304 --> 00:46:49,514
I am truly impressed.

512
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:54,060
It felt like my body was on fire.

513
00:46:54,644 --> 00:46:57,105
Then it felt like I was covered in ice.

514
00:46:58,856 --> 00:47:01,109
What about the wounds from the flogging?

515
00:47:01,192 --> 00:47:02,527
Are you still in pain?

516
00:47:05,363 --> 00:47:09,409
It seems like the flogging
helped surge the energy.

517
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:13,496
The Crown Prince had landed many hits.

518
00:47:15,456 --> 00:47:18,585
Then I felt a surge within me.

519
00:47:18,668 --> 00:47:20,044
That is when I unsheathed it.

520
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,423
Right.

521
00:47:24,173 --> 00:47:28,595
You were always
a quick learner compared to others.

522
00:47:29,762 --> 00:47:33,600
You even learned to walk and run
sooner than Dang-gu did.

523
00:47:34,392 --> 00:47:36,686
You could also talk before he could.

524
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:39,272
I still remember that.

525
00:47:40,064 --> 00:47:43,526
When I did not know what it meant
to have a blocked gate of energy,

526
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,655
I thought I would become
the most powerful person.

527
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,287
Uk.

528
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:59,792
You are intelligent
and pick up things quickly.

529
00:48:02,295 --> 00:48:06,591
How about you join our trade
and learn how to do business?

530
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:11,846
Or Master Heo can take you under his wing
and teach you the art of medicine.

531
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,685
No, my lord.

532
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:23,983
I am going to train in Jeongjingak
and become a mage.

533
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:25,735
Why?

534
00:48:26,694 --> 00:48:29,405
Because that is what your father did?

535
00:48:31,324 --> 00:48:34,494
Do you desire to become
the next Gwanju of Cheonbugwan?

536
00:48:35,161 --> 00:48:37,914
Yes, my lord. And I will be.

537
00:48:38,998 --> 00:48:40,625
I will take his place

538
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:43,753
and prove it to all those scumbags
who denied that I was his son.

539
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:47,256
-I will make them speechless.
-You…

540
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:50,968
are not

541
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,304
his son.

542
00:48:56,641 --> 00:48:57,934
You are

543
00:48:58,643 --> 00:49:01,854
the result of your mother's love affair.

544
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:07,318
To show our respect to your late mother,
we let you into the Jang family.

545
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:10,196
But we cannot allow you
to lead Cheonbugwan after your father.

546
00:49:10,279 --> 00:49:13,408
So stop dreaming of becoming…

547
00:49:16,452 --> 00:49:17,412
like your father.

548
00:49:18,871 --> 00:49:22,208
Just stay a clueless Young Master

549
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:25,461
of the Jang family.

550
00:49:27,338 --> 00:49:28,464
If you do,

551
00:49:30,216 --> 00:49:32,301
we will continue to take care of you.

552
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,060
Then…

553
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:45,857
Then who is my real father?

554
00:49:48,609 --> 00:49:52,488
How would anyone know
whom your late mother…

555
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,909
had an affair with?

556
00:50:31,402 --> 00:50:35,156
Uk probably has a lot on his mind.
You should let him be.

557
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:43,748
Make sure he finishes his food.

558
00:50:53,549 --> 00:50:56,427
Maidservant Kim told me to make sure
you finished your meal.

559
00:51:00,097 --> 00:51:01,474
Did he scold you again?

560
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,354
I thought you were used to being scolded…

561
00:51:18,699 --> 00:51:19,867
It was not me.

562
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:23,246
I do not think they have fixed the door
since that incident.

563
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:26,874
Do not move.

564
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,002
Just stay there.

565
00:51:33,756 --> 00:51:35,800
It might all crumble down.

566
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:39,804
So just stay there.

567
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:55,695
Why did you not dodge his blade?

568
00:51:56,737 --> 00:51:57,780
Was it because

569
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,741
you needed another reason to kick him out?

570
00:52:01,784 --> 00:52:03,786
I deserve it.

571
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:07,456
After all, I broke his heart.

572
00:52:09,041 --> 00:52:13,337
Breaking his heart must be more painful
than getting stabbed.

573
00:52:15,172 --> 00:52:16,299
Maidservant Kim.

574
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:22,138
You said there were rumors
about how I was Uk's father, right?

575
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,599
What if I just said

576
00:52:25,266 --> 00:52:29,353
that I was indeed his father?

577
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:35,359
I will step down from my position.

578
00:52:36,986 --> 00:52:39,322
Then I will have my own little business

579
00:52:40,531 --> 00:52:42,658
and do trading with Uk.

580
00:52:43,242 --> 00:52:45,995
Songrim needs its leader.

581
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,582
Then how about I say

582
00:52:50,499 --> 00:52:52,543
that I am his mother?

583
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,545
I think it would be better

584
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:58,090
if Uk and I went to the hometown
where Lady Do-hwa and I grew up.

585
00:53:00,593 --> 00:53:03,304
That cannot happen.

586
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:09,435
Uk takes after Do-hwa. That is why

587
00:53:10,561 --> 00:53:12,855
he is so good-looking.

588
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,149
Who would believe you…

589
00:53:17,443 --> 00:53:19,028
if you said you were his mother?

590
00:53:21,238 --> 00:53:22,239
Hold on.

591
00:53:23,032 --> 00:53:26,869
Are you saying
he should be ugly if I was his mother?

592
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:30,247
In that case,
you cannot be his father either.

593
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:31,832
Of course, I can.

594
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:35,044
Jang Gang and I
have always been neck and neck…

595
00:53:39,298 --> 00:53:41,717
when it came to our looks.

596
00:53:44,845 --> 00:53:45,972
No, you lost.

597
00:53:46,555 --> 00:53:48,099
You cannot hold a candle to him.

598
00:53:48,182 --> 00:53:52,311
Do-hwa said she loved everything
about you except for your looks.

599
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,563
Do not put words in her mouth!

600
00:53:55,773 --> 00:53:57,608
You did not even flinch
when you got stabbed.

601
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,986
But I guess hearing
that you are ugly is quite painful.

602
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:01,320
The pain

603
00:54:02,863 --> 00:54:04,865
runs deep.

604
00:54:04,949 --> 00:54:06,617
Does your wound hurt?

605
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,245
Stay still.
You will break open the wound again.

606
00:54:11,288 --> 00:54:12,498
We share…

607
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,752
the same pain

608
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:20,840
of not having our feelings reciprocated

609
00:54:20,923 --> 00:54:23,426
by the ones we loved.

610
00:54:23,926 --> 00:54:25,344
So let us

611
00:54:26,595 --> 00:54:28,014
not hurt each other.

612
00:54:29,807 --> 00:54:33,394
I admit that I did not mean what I said.

613
00:54:33,477 --> 00:54:34,854
You are…

614
00:54:36,981 --> 00:54:37,982
good…

615
00:54:41,193 --> 00:54:42,278
Good…

616
00:54:43,529 --> 00:54:45,031
Good-looking.

617
00:54:47,408 --> 00:54:51,454
You are also indeed

618
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:53,956
good…

619
00:54:55,082 --> 00:54:58,294
Good-looking.

620
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:08,971
Let me tend to your wound.

621
00:55:09,638 --> 00:55:10,848
It hurts.

622
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:13,225
Goodness.

623
00:55:14,268 --> 00:55:15,936
A bit below.

624
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,563
That is right.

625
00:55:17,646 --> 00:55:20,316
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

626
00:55:29,116 --> 00:55:30,534
Jang Uk seems to be the owner

627
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:32,620
of the Spirit Plaque from Chwiseonru.

628
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:34,914
Jang Uk?

629
00:55:34,997 --> 00:55:37,792
He was flogged recently
after losing Songrim's Spirit Plaque.

630
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:41,629
And I heard
his maid frequented this place.

631
00:55:44,673 --> 00:55:47,468
That girl from Songrim is his maid.

632
00:55:48,677 --> 00:55:51,847
And she was at the inn that day.

633
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,518
Could she be

634
00:55:56,477 --> 00:55:57,478
Naksu?

635
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:04,693
Are we still far away from Cheonbugwan?

636
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:11,450
I think I will be petrified at this rate.

637
00:56:12,326 --> 00:56:14,078
We will hurry. Please stay strong.

638
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,539
You must not run wild right now.

639
00:56:17,414 --> 00:56:20,000
My lord, are you all right?

640
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,614
Let us just go back.

641
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:15,890
This arm of yours reached Ryusu

642
00:57:15,973 --> 00:57:18,392
in that short period of time.

643
00:57:19,768 --> 00:57:22,980
You sure are as bright as your father.

644
00:57:25,858 --> 00:57:27,318
Jin Mu from Cheonbugwan

645
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:31,322
only picked a fight because he realized
he will never become the next Gwanju.

646
00:57:31,405 --> 00:57:33,574
He has realized that you,

647
00:57:33,657 --> 00:57:36,702
the eldest son of the Jang family,
would become the next Gwanju.

648
00:57:45,294 --> 00:57:48,172
My uncle's wound was not that deep.

649
00:57:48,255 --> 00:57:49,715
Do not worry about him.

650
00:57:49,798 --> 00:57:53,260
I will have a word with Jin Mu.

651
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:54,386
All right?

652
00:58:00,434 --> 00:58:01,936
Take good care of him.

653
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,341
You always put Uk in danger.

654
00:58:34,009 --> 00:58:35,678
You were there when he was poisoned

655
00:58:35,761 --> 00:58:38,597
and during the confrontation
with the Crown Prince.

656
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:44,395
So do you want to separate me from him?

657
00:58:44,478 --> 00:58:45,688
I cannot do that.

658
00:58:49,024 --> 00:58:51,235
He got what he wanted every time.

659
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,654
And you risked your life to save him.

660
00:59:00,327 --> 00:59:02,204
This is his father's sword.

661
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:03,998
Take it with you.

662
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:34,486
I cannot tolerate this any longer.

663
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,238
How long will this pity party last?

664
00:59:43,203 --> 00:59:44,413
Get up.

665
00:59:56,675 --> 00:59:59,845
You received a powerful torrent of energy,
and it surged within you.

666
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:04,391
It took you merely ten days
when it would take ten years for others.

667
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:06,477
-If you keep training--
-Forget it.

668
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,978
I will not do it.

669
01:00:10,981 --> 01:00:12,691
Have Park Jin's few words dispirited you?

670
01:00:13,442 --> 01:00:15,527
So all this was just an act of stupidity.

671
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:18,489
No wonder you look so hopeless.
You are just too weak!

672
01:00:18,572 --> 01:00:21,367
Yes, I am.
So I am not going to do anything.

673
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:22,910
So just be quiet.

674
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,330
Just shut up and do not bother me.

675
01:00:34,171 --> 01:00:36,382
I do not need a pupil
who will not do anything.

676
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:42,304
Then do not be my master.

677
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:44,932
Just be my maid.

678
01:00:46,016 --> 01:00:47,935
Annoy me again, and I will sell you off.

679
01:01:27,099 --> 01:01:28,225
Young Master.

680
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:35,065
My young master is too troubled
and will not drink any water.

681
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,109
Can you please help?

682
01:01:37,192 --> 01:01:38,777
What can I do?

683
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:41,280
It is best that my uncle resolves this.

684
01:01:41,363 --> 01:01:44,616
Master Heo said he would step up.

685
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,412
Please ask him to meet with Jin Mu
and put an end to this immediately.

686
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:57,838
I came here today because I am concerned

687
01:01:57,921 --> 01:02:00,340
that you exacerbated a trivial issue.

688
01:02:00,424 --> 01:02:04,803
How could threatening
the Crown Prince be deemed trivial?

689
01:02:07,347 --> 01:02:10,517
That is why our leader locked him away.

690
01:02:11,143 --> 01:02:13,896
Songrim will give him
the punishment he deserves.

691
01:02:13,979 --> 01:02:16,815
Songrim cannot punish him
when this concerns the royal family.

692
01:02:17,524 --> 01:02:21,278
Since Cheonbugwan is in charge,
we will punish him here.

693
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:24,156
What will you do with him?

694
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:28,076
Since he threatened the Crown Prince,
he deserves to be beheaded.

695
01:02:30,287 --> 01:02:34,166
However, we cannot kill
the Gwanju's one and only son.

696
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:38,670
So we ought to cut off the arm
that threatened the Crown Prince.

697
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,256
Cut off his arm?

698
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,883
It must have hurt your pride

699
01:02:42,966 --> 01:02:45,219
that your pupil could not put up a fight

700
01:02:45,302 --> 01:02:48,013
against Uk whose gate of energy
had only been open for ten days.

701
01:02:48,096 --> 01:02:50,891
You fool, I was generous enough
to save you two's faces.

702
01:02:50,974 --> 01:02:53,227
So I was going to be nice about this.

703
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:54,937
But you have gone insane.

704
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:58,774
Let Cheonbugwan determine
if it is me who is crazy or Jang Uk.

705
01:02:58,857 --> 01:03:01,902
-You little--
-Master, please.

706
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:06,323
Their fight was consensual.

707
01:03:06,907 --> 01:03:09,284
Uk's maid witnessed it all
from the beginning.

708
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:14,039
It was a fair fight.

709
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:19,920
If you cannot believe us,
let them fight again.

710
01:03:24,174 --> 01:03:27,761
Fight again? That is a good idea.

711
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:32,266
Since you claim
he was not threatening the Crown Prince

712
01:03:32,349 --> 01:03:33,934
and that it was a fair fight,

713
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:37,771
how about we have an official duel?

714
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,691
A duel between the Crown Prince and Uk?

715
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:44,236
If you cannot do that, hand Uk over to us.

716
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:45,737
But if you accept this,

717
01:03:45,821 --> 01:03:50,242
we will not ask anyone to take
responsibility even if someone dies.

718
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:53,495
As per the Daeho mages' customs.

719
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:07,217
We had come here to resolve it,
but look what we have done.

720
01:04:07,801 --> 01:04:11,972
That sly snake got the better of me.

721
01:04:12,055 --> 01:04:15,058
Uk will die if they have an official duel.
What should we do?

722
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:16,435
Do not worry.

723
01:04:16,518 --> 01:04:18,854
The Crown Prince
will not take up the challenge.

724
01:04:19,938 --> 01:04:22,482
Ever since Master Seo Gyeong
founded Songrim,

725
01:04:22,566 --> 01:04:25,944
the royal family and the mages
have never dueled before.

726
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,529
Both sides have kept

727
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:32,492
this unspoken rule so they would not waste
their energy on each other.

728
01:04:33,076 --> 01:04:34,161
There is no way

729
01:04:34,244 --> 01:04:37,623
the Crown Prince
would break that and fight Uk.

730
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,342
Please take up the challenge.

731
01:04:49,509 --> 01:04:53,722
I do not see why I need to go against
Songrim just because of that fool.

732
01:04:53,805 --> 01:04:57,809
Thanks to them, they will not be able
to point their fingers at us.

733
01:04:57,893 --> 01:05:02,189
Show Songrim exactly how strong you are.

734
01:05:22,334 --> 01:05:24,419
They are royal guards
and Cheonbugwan's men.

735
01:05:25,003 --> 01:05:26,171
What is going on?

736
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:28,799
Darn it, Master Heo.

737
01:05:29,591 --> 01:05:31,551
He said nothing would happen.

738
01:05:31,635 --> 01:05:33,303
What is all this?

739
01:05:34,179 --> 01:05:35,722
What should we do with Uk?

740
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:41,561
I do not understand why they are here.

741
01:05:41,645 --> 01:05:45,315
I was going to talk to you about it.

742
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:47,526
But Jin Mu beat me to it.

743
01:05:48,944 --> 01:05:50,112
Jin Mu?

744
01:05:50,904 --> 01:05:53,240
Did something happen again?

745
01:05:55,158 --> 01:05:56,576
Darn it!

746
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:58,495
The Crown Prince

747
01:05:58,578 --> 01:06:01,248
has challenged Jang Uk to a duel.

748
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:07,462
The Assistant Gwanju said
we should transfer Jang Uk to Cheonbugwan

749
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:09,965
if he refused the challenge.

750
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:13,468
Jang Uk is already locked up in here.

751
01:06:15,303 --> 01:06:18,807
Transfer to Cheonbugwan?
What is this about?

752
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:20,600
Please ask Master Heo.

753
01:06:21,393 --> 01:06:24,688
I was told
they had already agreed on this.

754
01:06:33,488 --> 01:06:36,450
Uk, get up. You need to get out of here.

755
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,285
What is it?

756
01:06:38,368 --> 01:06:41,747
There is no time to explain.
If you do not go, you will lose your arm.

757
01:06:42,664 --> 01:06:44,416
No, you could even die.

758
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,293
-What?
-Young Master.

759
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:48,420
Things have gotten serious.

760
01:06:48,503 --> 01:06:51,006
Stay here,
and you will lose an arm or your life.

761
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:53,508
Will you still do nothing?

762
01:07:04,853 --> 01:07:09,399
I will go to the royal palace with Jang Uk
and meet with the Crown Prince.

763
01:07:09,983 --> 01:07:11,943
Uk will be here soon.

764
01:07:16,531 --> 01:07:17,491
Where is Uk?

765
01:07:17,574 --> 01:07:20,827
He is not in the secret room.
I think he fled.

766
01:07:21,536 --> 01:07:22,537
What?

767
01:07:29,711 --> 01:07:32,172
When you are caught
between a rock and a hard place,

768
01:07:32,255 --> 01:07:34,216
fleeing is your best bet.

769
01:07:42,182 --> 01:07:45,102
He was here all along,
and only his maid came and went.

770
01:07:45,685 --> 01:07:47,270
I do not understand how he fled.

771
01:07:49,898 --> 01:07:51,858
Where are Yul and Dang-gu?

772
01:08:00,617 --> 01:08:04,246
Our leader will take care of it.
Lie low until the dust settles.

773
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:08,333
Mu-deok, take good care of him.

774
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:12,254
By the way,
are you sure you do not need us to come?

775
01:08:12,337 --> 01:08:14,840
Yes, we are going to my former village.

776
01:08:14,923 --> 01:08:16,883
Sari Village, was it?

777
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:19,803
Stay there. We will come
to pick you up soon.

778
01:08:25,892 --> 01:08:28,103
You have put him in danger once again.

779
01:08:31,356 --> 01:08:33,733
And he will get what he wants once more.

780
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:02,345
The duel will take place

781
01:09:03,638 --> 01:09:07,434
in the middle of next month.

782
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:12,230
But if

783
01:09:13,106 --> 01:09:14,983
he does not show up on that day,

784
01:09:16,818 --> 01:09:18,820
please accept that as his defeat.

785
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:21,364
That is fleeing, not losing.

786
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:26,119
I believe a coward like that
should be punished.

787
01:09:28,705 --> 01:09:30,332
I agree with him.

788
01:09:30,957 --> 01:09:33,251
If Jang Uk does not show up,

789
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:36,129
he will be deprived of his right to become

790
01:09:37,088 --> 01:09:38,173
the next Gwanju.

791
01:09:46,097 --> 01:09:48,350
I understand, Your Majesty.

792
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:08,036
Why bring that when we are fleeing?

793
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,789
Because you need to train.

794
01:10:10,872 --> 01:10:12,082
Train?

795
01:10:12,165 --> 01:10:13,458
Are we going there to train?

796
01:10:15,043 --> 01:10:16,086
Were you behind everything?

797
01:10:16,169 --> 01:10:17,629
I just played a part.

798
01:10:18,129 --> 01:10:20,966
You finally budged
when I said you were in danger.

799
01:10:23,051 --> 01:10:24,302
What is wrong?

800
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:26,471
I do not need a pupil
who does not improve.

801
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:29,849
Just die if you are
not going to do anything.

802
01:10:29,933 --> 01:10:31,768
You have poisoned me again,

803
01:10:32,936 --> 01:10:34,646
crazy master.

804
01:10:35,313 --> 01:10:36,356
Jang Uk.

805
01:10:37,148 --> 01:10:40,527
We will go to where I used to train.
Brace yourself.

806
01:10:41,152 --> 01:10:44,614
There will be no warm baths,

807
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:49,286
cozy beds, or food
that is seasoned well to your liking.

808
01:10:51,454 --> 01:10:54,416
Is Sari Village really that scary?

809
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,877
Sari Village was where Mu-deok was from.

810
01:10:57,961 --> 01:10:59,921
Naksu's hometown

811
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:02,382
was Danhyanggok.

812
01:11:04,759 --> 01:11:06,469
That is our destination.

813
01:12:02,942 --> 01:12:04,736
Why are these things here?

814
01:12:04,819 --> 01:12:05,945
Mu-deok!

815
01:12:06,029 --> 01:12:09,032
I almost misunderstood you for trying
to kidnap and make me live with you

816
01:12:09,115 --> 01:12:10,784
on the pretense of training me.

817
01:12:10,867 --> 01:12:13,828
I will have you know
I can teach you in other ways too.

818
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:16,623
Those kinds of girls
are the most dangerous!

819
01:12:16,706 --> 01:12:18,208
I do not enjoy sweet things.

820
01:12:18,291 --> 01:12:20,502
Be my guest if you do not wish to eat.

821
01:12:20,585 --> 01:12:23,922
-Yul is cooking rice with Mu-deok!
-I told you…

822
01:12:24,005 --> 01:12:27,926
How could you teach someone else when your
pupil is standing right in front of you?

823
01:12:28,009 --> 01:12:31,096
What if we disqualify Uk
of his rights as a mage?

824
01:12:31,179 --> 01:12:34,057
No matter where he goes,
there will be no master for Uk.

825
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:37,310
A great soul has shifted into this body.

826
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:38,353
Mu-deok, run!

827
01:12:38,436 --> 01:12:39,729
I wanted to do nothing…

828
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:41,314
But one thing keeps bothering me.

829
01:12:43,316 --> 01:12:48,321
