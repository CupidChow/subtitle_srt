1
00:00:17,802 --> 00:00:20,722
Master. It is me, Yeom.

2
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:23,933
You have been meditating
for 100 days as of yesterday.

3
00:00:24,017 --> 00:00:25,310
It is time that you go outside.

4
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:32,108
Master.

5
00:00:37,697 --> 00:00:38,948
Master.

6
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:43,745
Master…

7
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:45,789
Master.

8
00:00:47,957 --> 00:00:48,875
Master!

9
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:50,794
Master…

10
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,588
Master!

11
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:02,555
-Oh, dear. Poor boy.
-Poor thing.

12
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:05,099
-Goodness gracious.
-Unbelievable.

13
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:07,811
-He must have frozen to death.
-It seems like it.

14
00:01:07,894 --> 00:01:10,647
-I feel so sorry for him.
-Poor child.

15
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,940
-Oh, gosh.
-My goodness.

16
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:13,691
What is going on? What is it?

17
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:15,944
Oh, dear! The homeless boy has died.

18
00:01:16,027 --> 00:01:18,613
He was just a young boy.
I feel so bad for him.

19
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:21,741
My goodness, that poor thing.

20
00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:46,099
Master, as you have always wished,

21
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,353
I will give you a quiet farewell.

22
00:01:57,819 --> 00:01:59,988
Goodness, I feel so bad for him.

23
00:02:00,697 --> 00:02:02,740
He seems like an orphan.

24
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:04,325
Let us hold a funeral for him.

25
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,577
-Yes.
-Let us do that.

26
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,703
Should we cremate him

27
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:08,955
and sprinkle the ashes
by Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?

28
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,415
-Oh, my goodness!
-My gosh!

29
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:11,958
Child…

30
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,001
Are you all right?

31
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:17,505
-What in the world…
-How…

32
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:20,633
-Where is he going?
-Where are you going?

33
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,351
Stop!

34
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:42,780
Child.

35
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:45,199
Did you just tell me to stop?

36
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:48,453
How foolish of you.

37
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,623
I cannot believe that
you have already burned my body.

38
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:56,169
What are you talking about?

39
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:01,591
Had I been a little late,
you would have burned my cane too.

40
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:04,260
You fool!

41
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:08,139
You fool!

42
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:11,434
You fool!

43
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:14,520
You fool.

44
00:03:21,444 --> 00:03:22,946
Master?

45
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:25,490
I only temporarily
shifted my soul out of my body

46
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,367
to test if I had reached Hwansu

47
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,827
after my 100 days of meditating.

48
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:34,207
But I noticed that my body was burning,
so I quickly entered another body.

49
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,501
But it is too late.

50
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:42,840
Are you saying
you are in this child's body?

51
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:45,134
Is it really you, Master?

52
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:46,552
That is right.

53
00:03:46,636 --> 00:03:49,639
I am Lee Cheol, your master.

54
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:51,057
My goodness…

55
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:54,560
Master.

56
00:03:55,812 --> 00:03:56,813
Master.

57
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:09,951
I am a soul shifter.

58
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:21,296
Your Majesty.

59
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:25,633
Did you not summon me today
to find the soul shifter?

60
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:27,510
I will do just that.

61
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:29,387
I can

62
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,389
recognize soul shifters.

63
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:07,884
Is there anyone else
who has seen your face?

64
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:13,347
This is an umbrella.

65
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:15,933
You can use this as a cane.

66
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:19,687
No.

67
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:23,024
No one else in the capital knows
that I am not blind.

68
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:27,236
People will think of this
as a fight between thugs.

69
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:37,747
You should have stopped searching for me.

70
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:43,586
So-i.

71
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,424
So-i, is that you?

72
00:05:48,508 --> 00:05:50,051
I am Kim from Sari Village.

73
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:52,553
You have the wrong person.

74
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:02,980
We rarely ever talked to each other.
He barely knows me.

75
00:06:03,064 --> 00:06:04,107
That man

76
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,150
must be taken care of.

77
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:19,872
There was no need to kill him.

78
00:06:19,956 --> 00:06:22,500
Once he left for Sari Village,
we would have never met again.

79
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,668
But you did meet.

80
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,671
Sari Village?

81
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,883
Is that where you used to stay?

82
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:35,179
I lived there to hide.

83
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,392
I lived there for a while
to hide from those thugs.

84
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,689
Is there anyone else from Sari Village
who might recognize you?

85
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,734
I always kept a distance
so that no one would easily recognize me.

86
00:06:49,944 --> 00:06:51,487
I was a thief there too, you see.

87
00:06:51,571 --> 00:06:53,239
-What is that?
-Money.

88
00:06:53,322 --> 00:06:56,492
It would seem peculiar
if no one took his money after he died.

89
00:06:57,952 --> 00:06:59,162
You can keep it.

90
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:16,262
I did not want to harm anyone
from Sari Village.

91
00:07:28,774 --> 00:07:30,526
Mu-deok is in the capital.

92
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,987
If I ever run into her,
will I have to kill her too?

93
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:38,201
Is Broker Kim from Sari Village here?

94
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:40,786
Yes, he just arrived.

95
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,914
He is in the last room
on the second floor.

96
00:08:13,986 --> 00:08:14,987
Young Lady Jin?

97
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,707
What brings you to a place like this?

98
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,252
It is none of your business.
You did not see me here.

99
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:31,837
Young Lady Jin, by any chance…

100
00:08:34,465 --> 00:08:35,508
Do you gamble?

101
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:37,468
What? Gamble?

102
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:41,097
What do you take me for?
Do I seem that vulgar to you?

103
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,723
No, of course not.

104
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,519
But you lied and told me
the jade was not broken when it was.

105
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:50,523
Given you are capable of lying
without feeling the least bit of guilt,

106
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:53,192
I thought you would have
a knack for gambling.

107
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,240
I came to buy tickets from a scalper.

108
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:02,326
The tickets to a magic show were sold out.

109
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,744
That is why I am here.

110
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:05,788
ADMISSION TICKET
SEOCHUN MAGICIANS

111
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:09,500
-You got two tickets.
-I am going with my mother.

112
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:11,335
Do not tell anyone you saw me here.

113
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,796
I do not wish to cause
any misunderstandings.

114
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,172
I cannot guarantee that.

115
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:17,800
I am not as good of a liar
as you are, you see.

116
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:20,428
So if someone asks,
I am not sure if I can lie.

117
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,640
But I will try my best for your sake.

118
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:31,147
Why did I have to run into her here?

119
00:09:44,327 --> 00:09:45,995
What is the leader of Songrim doing here?

120
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:53,294
I hope he is not here
to get tickets to the magic show.

121
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:58,257
If he goes, I will not be able to go
with Young Master Park.

122
00:10:39,215 --> 00:10:40,508
You must be the one

123
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:43,177
who killed him.

124
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,222
It was not me.

125
00:10:46,972 --> 00:10:48,516
Why did you kill him?

126
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:49,975
It really was not me.

127
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:52,019
He was already dead when I came here.

128
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:58,526
He was killed not too long ago.

129
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:00,361
It was done in a single stroke.

130
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,947
Whoever did this is a skilled swordsman.

131
00:11:03,614 --> 00:11:06,075
I swear it was not me.

132
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:08,869
I do not even have a sword.

133
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:31,809
I think they were killed
by the same person.

134
00:11:33,102 --> 00:11:34,395
Who are these men?

135
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:39,442
They were a group of thugs
who recently entered the capital.

136
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:41,527
Did they come with Broker Kim

137
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,573
who came from Sari Village?

138
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:46,949
No.

139
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:51,579
But I remember these thugs
picking a fight with him a few days ago.

140
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,960
They wanted to know the whereabouts
of a female swindler from Sari Village.

141
00:11:58,043 --> 00:11:59,628
A swindler from Sari Village?

142
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:01,505
Could that be Mu-deok?

143
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:05,759
Where is she?

144
00:12:10,473 --> 00:12:12,141
She was right behind me.

145
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:15,978
She ran away.

146
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:27,823
What is going on?

147
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:30,409
What were all those bodies?

148
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:35,831
They wanted to know the whereabouts
of a female swindler from Sari Village.

149
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,167
Could that really be me?

150
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:42,338
What kind of life has Mu-deok led?

151
00:12:42,922 --> 00:12:45,549
Did you meet with So-i?

152
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:47,801
I wonder what she did this time.

153
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:49,678
Do not get involved with her.

154
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:52,890
So-i…

155
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:56,101
Who is So-i?

156
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:01,148
I did not see the girl
who came to see you.

157
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:04,944
But she quarreled with the guards
and even slapped one of them.

158
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:06,946
So I am sure the guards
would remember her face.

159
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:11,033
Madam, neither of those guards
came to work today.

160
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:13,160
-They both did not come?
-No.

161
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:15,746
How strange. They never miss work.

162
00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:24,255
We are sorry.
How we acted was no way to treat a mage.

163
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:27,383
But is this really necessary?

164
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:28,884
"Mage"?

165
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:30,386
You even lied that you were a mage?

166
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:33,097
I will soon become one.

167
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:37,685
One who is far more prestigious
than the likes of you.

168
00:13:40,062 --> 00:13:43,482
How dare you talk down to me
when you are nothing but a fake?

169
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:45,985
I will continue to talk down to you

170
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:49,780
while you speak to me with respect.
That is how things will be.

171
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:58,247
Go after him.

172
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,748
That is your job.

173
00:14:06,672 --> 00:14:10,092
Is there a girl named Mu-deok
from Sari Village at Chwiseonru?

174
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,512
Yes, I know her. Was she the person
you were looking for that night?

175
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:17,641
I had to ask her for a favor
and return something to her.

176
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:19,768
Mu-deok is not at Chwiseonru.

177
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:23,022
She works as a maid for the Jang family,
the family of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju.

178
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:25,065
She is working as a maid?

179
00:14:26,358 --> 00:14:28,319
I guess she really can see now.

180
00:14:29,194 --> 00:14:31,280
She must have fooled you too.

181
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:33,032
We brought her to Chwiseonru
thinking she was blind,

182
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:35,534
but we were shocked
when she opened her eyes and ran.

183
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:39,121
But she is not a swindler like I am.

184
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:41,749
How is she able to see?

185
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:47,254
Please do not kill me.

186
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:49,381
I am sorry.

187
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:52,176
You know my face,
so I cannot let you live.

188
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:54,595
Please…

189
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:22,289
If she was always able to see,
that means she might recognize me.

190
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,585
She works as a maid for the Jang family?

191
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:29,922
I should pay her a visit.

192
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:34,301
Mu-deok committed murder?

193
00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:38,055
Several men died at the ferry inn,

194
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,808
and Mu-deok was there.

195
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:44,645
But Mu-deok is not strong enough
to kill someone.

196
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:46,605
Especially not enough to kill several men.

197
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:48,899
It was done by a skilled swordsman.

198
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:50,901
If it was not her,

199
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:53,612
she likely received help from a mage.

200
00:15:55,114 --> 00:15:56,281
Do not tell me

201
00:15:57,032 --> 00:15:58,951
that you are suspecting Young Master Jang.

202
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:01,328
I am not.

203
00:16:01,412 --> 00:16:04,873
Uk is currently at the palace
with Master Lee.

204
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:08,377
Thank goodness.

205
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,879
It could not have been Mu-deok.

206
00:16:10,963 --> 00:16:13,215
She has no reason to harm anyone.

207
00:16:13,298 --> 00:16:14,466
Maidservant Kim.

208
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,928
How much do you know about Mu-deok?

209
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:20,806
Do you know

210
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:26,020
what kind of life she led
before she started working here?

211
00:16:28,063 --> 00:16:28,939
What?

212
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:30,733
The man who died

213
00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:33,444
was someone I had met
to ask about Mu-deok's past.

214
00:16:35,154 --> 00:16:37,114
A group of thugs
who seemed to be looking for her

215
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,616
was also killed.

216
00:16:42,494 --> 00:16:45,247
It was obvious that
she was bound to get suspected,

217
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,875
but she ran away
instead of proving her innocence.

218
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,501
One thing is for sure.

219
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:54,214
Mu-deok is hiding something

220
00:16:54,298 --> 00:16:57,718
that must not be revealed.

221
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,272
The guards live over there.

222
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:12,191
But would it not be faster

223
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:15,444
to just draw a sketch of her
and find her yourself?

224
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:17,112
I do not know what she looks like.

225
00:17:17,196 --> 00:17:20,032
-I met her when I was blind.
-I thought you were never blind.

226
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:25,329
One day, you say you were blind.
The next day, you say you were not.

227
00:17:26,538 --> 00:17:29,458
I do not know your reasons
but you live such a complicated life.

228
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:35,005
So you do not know what she looks like,
but she knows you?

229
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:38,175
Then would it not be dangerous
to look for her?

230
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,969
What if she killed the broker
and those thugs?

231
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:42,554
She might try to harm you too.

232
00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:46,725
It is more dangerous to be suspected
by the leader of Songrim.

233
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:52,231
It will put you in trouble too
since you paid the broker.

234
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:53,565
What do you mean?

235
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:56,735
I do not know what you are talking about.

236
00:17:57,528 --> 00:17:58,570
Good.

237
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,740
Just keep acting like
you do not know anything.

238
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:04,326
Someone is dead!

239
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:26,014
Guard Lee and Guard Jang are both dead.

240
00:18:34,064 --> 00:18:37,568
What Hwansu entails is truly impressive.

241
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:41,864
I thought all soul shifters were monsters.

242
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,575
But in your case,
you gained youth and eternal life.

243
00:18:46,118 --> 00:18:48,162
It is no wonder that

244
00:18:48,245 --> 00:18:50,873
everyone wanted the ice stone
for the alchemy of souls.

245
00:18:51,623 --> 00:18:54,418
Everyone coveted it,
which led to endless fights.

246
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:56,295
And that is why it was banned.

247
00:18:56,378 --> 00:18:57,754
All right, Master Lee.

248
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:00,591
You say you can recognize soul shifters.

249
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,092
Take a look around.

250
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:05,512
Are there any soul shifters
in this palace?

251
00:19:19,318 --> 00:19:22,196
I cannot tell just by looking at them.

252
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:24,448
If they do not show their blue marks

253
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,450
or run wild and get petrified,

254
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,619
they look no different
from ordinary humans.

255
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:32,331
Then how do you recognize them?

256
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:35,209
The fear of getting caught.

257
00:19:37,294 --> 00:19:39,463
The horror of getting petrified.

258
00:19:43,675 --> 00:19:45,469
I must bring that out of them.

259
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:48,847
So you recognize them by instilling fear?

260
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:50,724
I apologize if I disappointed you.

261
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:52,351
Instead,

262
00:19:53,644 --> 00:19:55,812
I will give you a gift, Your Majesty.

263
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:57,940
A gift? What have you brought?

264
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:00,359
A dog.

265
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,319
A dog?

266
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:05,072
He is a very clever and gentle dog.

267
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:07,366
He should be in front
of the royal palace by now.

268
00:20:07,449 --> 00:20:09,493
May I bring him inside?

269
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:11,703
You brought him as a gift, so of course.

270
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:13,664
Bring him in.

271
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:15,457
Uk.

272
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,834
I want you to go and bring the dog.

273
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:23,340
If you successfully bring him in,
I shall give you a reward.

274
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,081
Should I just leave
and run away with Mu-deok?

275
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,710
If I do that, everyone will find out.

276
00:21:00,752 --> 00:21:04,172
And right now, I am not strong enough
to protect my master.

277
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:11,221
I wonder what Master Lee plans to do.

278
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,209
Assistant Gwanju, sir.

279
00:21:42,252 --> 00:21:43,628
What is it?

280
00:21:47,132 --> 00:21:51,678
Fluffy is the gift that
Master Lee brought for His Majesty?

281
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:55,474
Master Lee told me that
the dog will follow you inside.

282
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:57,642
But still, be careful.

283
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,730
Is it that dangerous
to take this dog into the palace?

284
00:22:02,314 --> 00:22:03,482
What is the big deal?

285
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:05,984
It is Gwigu.

286
00:22:06,777 --> 00:22:08,320
He is bringing Gwigu into the palace.

287
00:22:09,654 --> 00:22:10,947
But Gwigu is a wily beast.

288
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:13,700
How could he bring
a wily beast into the palace?

289
00:22:15,786 --> 00:22:19,206
Master Seo Gyeong,
who was my master long ago,

290
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:22,042
used Gwigu to find evil relics
that were created with sorcery

291
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,878
using the power of the ice stone.

292
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:26,671
Yes, I have heard of it.

293
00:22:26,755 --> 00:22:29,716
However, I was told that it became useless

294
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,718
after Gwigu's pottery broke.

295
00:22:31,802 --> 00:22:32,761
That is why

296
00:22:33,637 --> 00:22:37,849
I moved the spirit of Gwigu
from the pottery into a dead dog.

297
00:22:40,143 --> 00:22:41,686
The dog that will soon arrive

298
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:43,980
is Gwigu.

299
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,943
Gwigu?

300
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:53,573
What should we do?

301
00:22:55,117 --> 00:22:56,952
How many of us are in the palace?

302
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,703
There are more than ten.

303
00:22:59,287 --> 00:23:00,664
Did you report this to Cheonbugwan?

304
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:03,625
I sent someone there,
so they will be here soon.

305
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:33,822
We arranged today's meeting to make peace
between Songrim and the royal family.

306
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:37,826
The Crown Prince was kind enough
to visit you and invite you over himself.

307
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:39,452
But you wish to bring this wily beast

308
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:41,705
into the place
without His Majesty's permission?

309
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,790
He gave me permission to bring in the dog.

310
00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:45,667
And right now, Gwigu cannot go wild

311
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,461
and cause danger
since it lives inside the body of a dog.

312
00:23:48,545 --> 00:23:51,673
So it cannot harm a soul shifter
even if it sees one?

313
00:23:51,756 --> 00:23:55,260
Instead, it will let you know by barking.

314
00:23:56,553 --> 00:23:57,596
Bark.

315
00:23:58,805 --> 00:23:59,806
Bark!

316
00:24:11,568 --> 00:24:13,695
Oh, my goodness!

317
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:18,992
It is a soul shifter.

318
00:24:19,868 --> 00:24:22,954
As expected, there are
more soul shifters within the palace.

319
00:24:29,461 --> 00:24:30,587
What was that sound?

320
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:34,549
Does this mean there is a soul shifter
inside my palace?

321
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:37,385
It seems so.

322
00:24:38,094 --> 00:24:40,597
Then why are you just standing there?

323
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,433
Get out there and catch the soul shifter.

324
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:46,394
Like I told you earlier,
I brought the dog as a gift.

325
00:24:46,478 --> 00:24:49,356
I will leave it here with you.

326
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:51,650
You can use it to find
or catch the soul shifters

327
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:53,360
inside the palace, Your Majesty.

328
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:55,987
Take it away. We do not need it.

329
00:24:56,613 --> 00:24:59,199
How dare you bring a wily beast
inside the palace!

330
00:24:59,282 --> 00:25:00,909
His Majesty already suffers from anxiety.

331
00:25:00,992 --> 00:25:03,870
Are you trying to harm him
with that wily beast of yours?

332
00:25:06,248 --> 00:25:09,876
Mother, we were the ones
who invited Master Lee to the palace.

333
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,670
Stay out of this.

334
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:16,132
The mages of Cheonbugwan
are in charge of protecting the palace.

335
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:18,468
If there is anything made with sorcery
inside the palace,

336
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:20,387
they will be the ones to get rid of it.

337
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,014
I do not wish for a wily beast
living inside a dead dog

338
00:25:23,098 --> 00:25:24,891
and the people of Songrim to interfere.

339
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:28,311
It is merely an attempt to humiliate us.

340
00:25:30,355 --> 00:25:32,232
You must stop them, Your Majesty.

341
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:02,679
The son of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju
should be protecting the royal family,

342
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:04,723
but you brought in a wily beast instead.

343
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:08,685
It is Master Lee's gift for the King.

344
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,312
Please let us in.

345
00:26:10,395 --> 00:26:12,731
I was told to safely bring him inside.

346
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:19,362
Is that so?

347
00:26:19,446 --> 00:26:21,364
Then try your best to get inside.

348
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:23,825
Kill the wily beast
that has trespassed the palace.

349
00:26:26,328 --> 00:26:29,289
If you successfully bring him in,
I shall give you a reward.

350
00:26:29,873 --> 00:26:32,625
Damn it.
Is this why he picked me to do this?

351
00:27:01,071 --> 00:27:02,697
Your Majesty, it is I, Jin Mu.

352
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:05,909
I shall get rid of
these insolent men from Songrim.

353
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:09,454
His Majesty has invited us here
and we are still talking.

354
00:27:09,537 --> 00:27:11,581
Jin Mu, this is not
your place to interfere.

355
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:13,958
How dare you bring in that dog
without permission!

356
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:15,668
What kind of crazy act is this?

357
00:27:15,752 --> 00:27:16,961
Silence.

358
00:27:33,395 --> 00:27:35,688
Guards! What are you doing? Stop that man!

359
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:41,403
Father.

360
00:27:41,486 --> 00:27:43,071
You must stop both of them.

361
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:45,407
If this leads to a fight,
it will end our relationship with Songrim.

362
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,950
We must fight.

363
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:49,953
Songrim has brought
a wily beast into the royal palace.

364
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:51,621
It is Cheonbugwan's job to protect us.

365
00:27:52,372 --> 00:27:54,207
-Father!
-Your Majesty!

366
00:27:58,878 --> 00:27:59,963
I order all of you…

367
00:28:02,006 --> 00:28:03,091
to stop.

368
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,653
Stop!

369
00:28:38,334 --> 00:28:39,586
Master Lee.

370
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:42,464
I invited you over for a friendly meeting.
Did you have to shock me like this?

371
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:44,674
I am sorry if I startled you.

372
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:49,012
Your Majesty, if the ice stone
gets revealed to the world,

373
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:51,556
a greater conflict will arise.

374
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,224
The ice stone?

375
00:28:53,308 --> 00:28:54,976
Is it because of the soul shifters?

376
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:56,644
People have occasionally used

377
00:28:56,728 --> 00:28:59,731
the remaining Soul Ejectors
to shift souls after the Great Chaos.

378
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,402
Someone seems to be
making Soul Ejectors again.

379
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:09,699
The ice stone has come out into the world.

380
00:29:15,872 --> 00:29:16,915
So what are you saying?

381
00:29:16,998 --> 00:29:19,167
Where is it? In whose hands?

382
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:21,711
Probably in the hands of those

383
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:25,298
who sent Naksu here and turned
a Songrim mage into a soul shifter.

384
00:29:25,882 --> 00:29:27,550
I was told that Master Seo Gyeong

385
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:29,928
destroyed all the ice stones 200 years ago
after the Great Chaos.

386
00:29:30,011 --> 00:29:30,929
However,

387
00:29:31,012 --> 00:29:34,933
I guess not all were destroyed
and instead left in Songrim.

388
00:29:35,016 --> 00:29:38,561
It is not easy to quell human desires.

389
00:29:38,645 --> 00:29:39,687
However,

390
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:42,732
the return of the ice stone

391
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:46,069
also implies the return
of a great man like Master Seo Gyeong.

392
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,325
Master Seo Gyeong was born
with the energy of the King's Star.

393
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:55,036
However, he did not become the king.

394
00:29:56,746 --> 00:29:58,122
Are you saying there could be

395
00:29:58,915 --> 00:30:01,376
another person born with the energy
of the King's Star?

396
00:30:06,214 --> 00:30:08,633
Even if he exists,
the light he emits will be faint.

397
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:12,929
And the energy of the seven stars
surrounding him will not show yet.

398
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:16,224
A power strong enough
to defy the laws of nature

399
00:30:16,307 --> 00:30:20,186
and bring chaos to the world
has returned once again.

400
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,355
Thus, someone strong enough
to stop it should also appear.

401
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:24,315
That way,

402
00:30:25,608 --> 00:30:28,653
the world will be able
to maintain balance.

403
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:39,414
What I am trying to say is that
there is no need to feel so anxious.

404
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:44,460
I hope this helps you calm your anxiety.

405
00:30:49,716 --> 00:30:52,093
Thank you for your words of comfort.

406
00:30:52,927 --> 00:30:55,513
Then I should leave now.

407
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:58,558
As you refused to accept my gift,

408
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:01,352
I will take Gwigu back with me.

409
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:05,064
-Your Majesty.
-Do as you please.

410
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:26,544
No, wait. Stop.

411
00:31:27,378 --> 00:31:29,213
Are we leaving?

412
00:31:29,297 --> 00:31:30,840
I saw everything that I needed to see.

413
00:31:33,301 --> 00:31:36,012
Does this mean there is a soul shifter
inside my palace?

414
00:31:36,512 --> 00:31:38,139
Take it away. We do not need it.

415
00:31:38,222 --> 00:31:40,808
How dare you bring a wily beast
inside the palace!

416
00:31:42,185 --> 00:31:43,937
They revealed themselves
after I instilled fear.

417
00:31:47,607 --> 00:31:49,317
You must have been startled.

418
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,985
Are you all right?

419
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:52,862
How did you get hurt?

420
00:31:54,072 --> 00:31:57,033
The dog did not get hurt.
But thanks to you, I did.

421
00:31:58,785 --> 00:31:59,827
Did you get hurt?

422
00:32:00,495 --> 00:32:02,997
I cannot believe you got hurt
fighting those goons.

423
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:04,874
He still has a long way to go, right?

424
00:32:07,251 --> 00:32:09,045
Wait. I see blood. Are you hurt?

425
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:11,047
That is my blood.

426
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,423
He did not get hurt at all…

427
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:15,176
-Wait, blood…
-You are bleeding.

428
00:32:15,843 --> 00:32:17,762
Thank goodness.

429
00:32:23,184 --> 00:32:24,477
Does it hurt?

430
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,438
I guess it does.

431
00:32:28,064 --> 00:32:30,400
It hurts. My gosh.

432
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:42,120
That Gwigu belongs to Master Lee.

433
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,540
How much does he know about Mu-deok?

434
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:48,501
And what will Uk do

435
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:50,378
if he finds out about Naksu?

436
00:32:59,053 --> 00:33:00,096
Are you all right?

437
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:02,724
You are hurt all over.

438
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:04,559
I am fine.

439
00:33:04,642 --> 00:33:07,353
Did you find the soul shifters?
What about the ice stone?

440
00:33:08,521 --> 00:33:09,981
You have no idea.

441
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,026
My soul almost shifted
because of the chaos.

442
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:16,112
So you caused a scene
but failed to find anyone?

443
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:19,615
You should have at least
let the dog bite someone.

444
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:21,325
Uk.

445
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:23,578
Finding a soul shifter in the royal palace

446
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:25,997
is different from finding one
in Songrim or Cheonbugwan.

447
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:28,708
If things get out of hand,

448
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:31,294
it will turn into a fight
between Songrim and the royal family.

449
00:33:34,422 --> 00:33:35,381
Let us go.

450
00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:36,799
You should get treated.

451
00:33:37,508 --> 00:33:38,509
Master Lee.

452
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:44,057
Please wait here for a bit.

453
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,226
The Crown Prince has asked me
to escort you to his palace.

454
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,104
-The Crown Prince?
-It will rain soon.

455
00:33:50,188 --> 00:33:52,565
He wants you to stay until the rain stops.

456
00:33:54,817 --> 00:33:55,902
Let us go then.

457
00:34:04,744 --> 00:34:07,497
Uk, you need to take him back first.

458
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,082
Take him to Songrim.

459
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:11,417
Come here.

460
00:34:12,835 --> 00:34:13,961
Come on.

461
00:34:26,182 --> 00:34:29,811
You should have told me
before the people of Songrim arrived!

462
00:34:29,894 --> 00:34:31,062
I thought it was just

463
00:34:31,813 --> 00:34:33,523
going to be a simple meeting.

464
00:34:34,023 --> 00:34:35,066
If the Queen is put in danger,

465
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:37,527
you will also get petrified
just like Eunuch Kim.

466
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,320
You useless imbecile!

467
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:53,543
Someone born with the energy
of the King's Star

468
00:34:53,626 --> 00:34:55,920
who will follow the footsteps
of Master Seo Gyeong?

469
00:34:58,256 --> 00:35:00,842
If it is revealed that King's Star
was created by sorcery,

470
00:35:01,801 --> 00:35:03,719
it will spell the end of Songrim.

471
00:35:07,682 --> 00:35:10,977
I sent back Gwigu to Songrim.

472
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:14,105
I apologize for startling you.

473
00:35:14,188 --> 00:35:16,440
After a soul shifter was found in Songrim,

474
00:35:16,524 --> 00:35:18,901
I figured there could be one
in the palace as well.

475
00:35:19,944 --> 00:35:23,156
Last time, a soul shifter even tried
to enter the royal palace.

476
00:35:23,906 --> 00:35:26,033
I heard the person who created

477
00:35:26,117 --> 00:35:27,869
and killed the soul shifter was Naksu.

478
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,374
Naksu?

479
00:35:35,251 --> 00:35:38,087
The female assassin
who killed many skilled fighters.

480
00:35:38,754 --> 00:35:40,590
Heads fell to the ground
wherever she went,

481
00:35:40,673 --> 00:35:42,550
which is why she was called Naksu.

482
00:35:42,633 --> 00:35:46,220
There are rumors that
she shifted souls and is still alive.

483
00:35:49,432 --> 00:35:51,058
Naksu, a soul shifter?

484
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:54,395
What an interesting rumor.

485
00:36:28,638 --> 00:36:32,266
I hope Mu-deok gets caught
before Young Master Jang returns.

486
00:36:35,478 --> 00:36:36,395
Oh, my goodness!

487
00:36:39,523 --> 00:36:41,192
Mu-deok…

488
00:36:43,486 --> 00:36:44,862
Why are you shaking?

489
00:36:45,488 --> 00:36:47,823
Do you really believe
that I killed someone?

490
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:51,827
Come inside.

491
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,709
Why did you come here?

492
00:36:59,669 --> 00:37:01,003
To pack your things and run?

493
00:37:01,087 --> 00:37:03,130
I came to ask you for a favor.

494
00:37:03,714 --> 00:37:05,925
The leader of Songrim asked me
to bring you in if I ever saw you.

495
00:37:06,926 --> 00:37:08,094
Mu-deok.

496
00:37:08,177 --> 00:37:09,470
It was not you, was it?

497
00:37:10,179 --> 00:37:13,015
-It was not me.
-Then why did you run away?

498
00:37:13,683 --> 00:37:15,101
The situation made me do so.

499
00:37:16,477 --> 00:37:17,770
Mu-deok.

500
00:37:18,521 --> 00:37:19,605
Do you have

501
00:37:20,523 --> 00:37:22,400
some big secret you are hiding?

502
00:37:27,905 --> 00:37:29,240
Does Young Master Jang

503
00:37:30,324 --> 00:37:32,034
also know about your secret?

504
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,627
Mu-deok, I want you to run away.

505
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:43,296
I will give you enough money.

506
00:37:43,379 --> 00:37:44,964
Run away and never come back.

507
00:37:45,047 --> 00:37:46,173
I cannot do that.

508
00:37:47,383 --> 00:37:49,719
I cannot leave Young Master Jang.

509
00:37:49,802 --> 00:37:51,053
Why not?

510
00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:55,433
Young Master Jang will only fall
under suspicion if you stay by his side.

511
00:37:55,516 --> 00:37:56,851
If you are worried about him,

512
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:59,103
you must help me.

513
00:37:59,186 --> 00:38:02,106
You refuse to talk to Songrim's leader
or run away.

514
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,025
What do you plan to do?

515
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:07,528
I must find the real assassin.

516
00:38:08,988 --> 00:38:13,367
That assassin is going around
killing everyone that knows them.

517
00:38:18,414 --> 00:38:20,458
Is this where Cheonbugwan's Gwanju lives?

518
00:38:21,292 --> 00:38:23,169
It must be a very prestigious family.

519
00:38:25,129 --> 00:38:28,424
Does someone from the Jang family
also know you?

520
00:38:31,135 --> 00:38:34,347
Wait over there by the corner.
I will bring that person to you.

521
00:38:45,149 --> 00:38:47,318
I am going to ask someone to testify

522
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:50,988
that I was not in the room
when those people were killed at the inn.

523
00:38:52,365 --> 00:38:53,657
Who are you going to ask?

524
00:38:54,241 --> 00:38:55,618
Young Lady Jin from Jinyowon.

525
00:38:56,619 --> 00:38:58,204
I ran into her at the inn.

526
00:38:59,205 --> 00:39:01,374
That catty young lady will not
agree to see you.

527
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:03,834
Maidservant Kim.

528
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,213
I want you to take me to Jinyowon.

529
00:39:09,423 --> 00:39:10,424
Jinyowon?

530
00:39:35,032 --> 00:39:38,452
I am sorry.
Could you pick up the cane for me?

531
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:45,876
Thank you.

532
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:49,296
Can you tell me where I am right now?

533
00:39:50,047 --> 00:39:54,009
This is the house of Master Jang,
the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan.

534
00:39:55,803 --> 00:39:56,971
I see.

535
00:39:58,013 --> 00:39:59,098
Thank you.

536
00:40:12,361 --> 00:40:13,612
Mu-deok.

537
00:40:13,696 --> 00:40:14,738
Let us go.

538
00:40:22,538 --> 00:40:24,498
I guess Mu-deok really can see now.

539
00:40:25,124 --> 00:40:27,084
But she did not recognize me.

540
00:40:27,877 --> 00:40:29,545
I wonder if that is a good thing.

541
00:40:33,174 --> 00:40:34,425
Why are you alone?

542
00:40:35,217 --> 00:40:38,137
I was mistaken.
It turns out I did not know her at all.

543
00:40:39,555 --> 00:40:41,974
It is all over now.
Let us return to Cheonbugwan.

544
00:40:54,153 --> 00:40:55,696
Can I try it?

545
00:40:55,779 --> 00:40:56,655
-No.
-No.

546
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:58,866
Come on. Stop it.

547
00:40:58,949 --> 00:41:00,868
I am getting all wet.

548
00:41:00,951 --> 00:41:02,578
It is that umbrella.

549
00:41:03,204 --> 00:41:04,121
This is an umbrella.

550
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,957
You can use this as a cane.

551
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,505
Stop it. My mom will scold me.

552
00:41:12,588 --> 00:41:13,506
Stop it already!

553
00:41:14,173 --> 00:41:16,425
-No way.
-Hey, kid.

554
00:41:17,718 --> 00:41:20,721
Would you like
to switch umbrellas with me?

555
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,896
I heard Naksu shifted her soul

556
00:41:28,979 --> 00:41:32,733
into the body of
a tall, well-built young man.

557
00:41:32,816 --> 00:41:36,320
She could have shifted her soul
into the body of a short, petite woman.

558
00:41:38,405 --> 00:41:43,035
If she entered such a weak body,
there would be no need to discard her.

559
00:41:45,913 --> 00:41:47,039
No, I am telling you.

560
00:41:47,581 --> 00:41:49,792
Naksu in Blue was clearly a man.

561
00:41:50,584 --> 00:41:52,002
"Naksu in Blue."

562
00:41:52,086 --> 00:41:55,464
-I have also heard of that nickname.
-He covered himself with a blue cloth.

563
00:41:55,548 --> 00:41:59,635
It became such a trend
that everyone was wearing blue cloth.

564
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:02,096
People wore blue cloths
because they thought

565
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:05,224
Naksu in Blue would protect them
from the alchemy of souls.

566
00:42:06,934 --> 00:42:08,727
Naksu may have been an assassin,

567
00:42:10,229 --> 00:42:13,148
but she never hurt ordinary people
and was very strong.

568
00:42:18,779 --> 00:42:21,657
People can be very foolish.

569
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,325
They are not foolish.

570
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:25,452
They are frightened.

571
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:30,791
Naksu's body was burned,
and they all know that

572
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:34,461
it was done by those
with power and authority.

573
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:37,715
Calling them fools

574
00:42:38,674 --> 00:42:40,843
when they are actually scared
is negligence.

575
00:42:50,102 --> 00:42:53,731
I gathered this meeting
hoping to think of a solution,

576
00:42:53,814 --> 00:42:57,026
but you are arrogant enough
to just sit there and criticize me.

577
00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:03,991
I understand that
you two wish to disparage each other,

578
00:43:04,074 --> 00:43:07,244
but I wish for all of us
to get along amicably.

579
00:43:08,162 --> 00:43:10,414
Master Lee is also here with us.

580
00:43:10,497 --> 00:43:11,665
Let us drink our tea.

581
00:43:14,752 --> 00:43:16,045
Your Royal Highness.

582
00:43:17,046 --> 00:43:18,380
What is it?

583
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,553
Young Lady Heo wishes to come inside.

584
00:43:24,637 --> 00:43:25,638
Let her in.

585
00:43:34,146 --> 00:43:35,439
What brings you here?

586
00:43:35,522 --> 00:43:37,983
I heard someone was injured
after getting into a fight.

587
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:40,194
I came to take a look.

588
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:44,615
There is only one person who got hurt.

589
00:43:44,698 --> 00:43:47,576
-Take him out and treat his wound.
-I am all right.

590
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,161
It will not take long.

591
00:43:49,244 --> 00:43:50,454
Please come with me.

592
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:05,511
It seems like Uk will get engaged again.

593
00:44:05,594 --> 00:44:06,637
How many times is this?

594
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,722
-What do you mean?
-Did you not know?

595
00:44:08,806 --> 00:44:11,016
You really know nothing, do you?

596
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,102
Rumor has already spread in Sejukwon.

597
00:44:13,185 --> 00:44:16,897
You three are the top potential candidates
to become Heo Yeom's grandson-in-law.

598
00:44:17,481 --> 00:44:19,149
Uk is the third on his list.

599
00:44:19,233 --> 00:44:21,068
But I guess to her, he is the first.

600
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:23,987
Heo Yeom wishes to marry her off
within this year.

601
00:44:24,071 --> 00:44:26,782
There will soon be talks of engagement.
I promise you.

602
00:44:32,871 --> 00:44:36,792
The cut is not too deep.
This pill can help stop the bleeding.

603
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:39,711
Then you could have just
given it to me earlier.

604
00:44:39,795 --> 00:44:41,630
I heard you were hurt.

605
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:46,093
I wanted to see for myself
so I could feel at ease.

606
00:44:48,804 --> 00:44:49,888
Well…

607
00:44:50,556 --> 00:44:54,893
You already got hurt from the many duels,
so I was concerned.

608
00:44:56,019 --> 00:44:57,271
I am fine.

609
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,231
All right.

610
00:45:05,446 --> 00:45:09,533
Oh, right. Maidservant Kim
gave this to me as a gift.

611
00:45:09,616 --> 00:45:12,244
I have not yet been able to thank you.

612
00:45:14,037 --> 00:45:15,330
It looks exactly the same.

613
00:45:20,627 --> 00:45:21,628
What do you mean?

614
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,966
It is exactly the same
as the one I have seen for 20 years.

615
00:45:26,592 --> 00:45:28,635
Is it a valuable item?

616
00:45:33,348 --> 00:45:34,808
It looks new.

617
00:45:34,892 --> 00:45:36,894
So it probably is not ours.

618
00:45:37,686 --> 00:45:39,521
They made it look so similar.

619
00:45:40,856 --> 00:45:41,690
Goodness.

620
00:45:42,357 --> 00:45:44,318
The Crown Prince might be right.

621
00:45:45,444 --> 00:45:47,613
Uk really might get engaged soon.

622
00:45:47,696 --> 00:45:49,656
But to Master Heo,
he is the third in line.

623
00:45:51,992 --> 00:45:54,328
Then do you plan to marry her
since you are the first in line?

624
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:58,415
If you get married,
you will have to return to Seoho Fortress.

625
00:45:58,999 --> 00:46:02,002
Yul, do not get married.
I will feel lonely without you.

626
00:46:03,629 --> 00:46:05,923
I can recognize soul shifters.

627
00:46:14,515 --> 00:46:17,059
I must take them to Seoho Fortress
as soon as possible.

628
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:18,185
Who?

629
00:46:19,061 --> 00:46:19,937
Me?

630
00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:27,444
I take that back.

631
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:32,741
I feel very much at ease
after having seen how you reacted today.

632
00:46:33,325 --> 00:46:34,952
I am relieved to hear that.

633
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:37,913
What is that you wish
to ask me for in private?

634
00:46:40,082 --> 00:46:42,668
I know you took Naksu's sword,

635
00:46:42,751 --> 00:46:44,753
but would it be possible
to give that to me?

636
00:46:53,428 --> 00:46:56,640
I did watch the magic show last year.

637
00:46:57,224 --> 00:46:58,475
I even saw elephants.

638
00:46:58,976 --> 00:47:02,187
But I should act like it is my first time
when I go with Young Master Park, right?

639
00:47:02,271 --> 00:47:04,815
So you got those tickets
for you and Young Master Park.

640
00:47:04,898 --> 00:47:07,067
You startled me. What are you doing here?

641
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,695
I came to ask you for a favor.

642
00:47:09,778 --> 00:47:10,904
A favor?

643
00:47:11,947 --> 00:47:13,323
Do not bother.

644
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,493
I have no intentions of helping you.

645
00:47:16,577 --> 00:47:18,203
I am being framed for murder.

646
00:47:18,954 --> 00:47:20,080
What?

647
00:47:20,163 --> 00:47:22,416
Can you please tell the leader of Songrim

648
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:25,544
that you saw me earlier at the inn?

649
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,924
You want me to go to Songrim
and tell him that I had set foot

650
00:47:31,508 --> 00:47:32,759
at a place like that?

651
00:47:33,468 --> 00:47:35,304
I would be mad to do that.

652
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,807
You are my only hope.

653
00:47:39,474 --> 00:47:41,351
I beg of you to help.

654
00:47:44,438 --> 00:47:45,606
No.

655
00:47:45,689 --> 00:47:47,608
I told Young Master Park
that I had an extra ticket.

656
00:47:47,691 --> 00:47:49,568
I do not want to reveal
I bought them from a scalper.

657
00:47:49,651 --> 00:47:52,279
Your embarrassment will only be temporary,

658
00:47:52,362 --> 00:47:54,364
but I could really get killed for this.

659
00:47:55,365 --> 00:47:57,409
If my mother finds out, she will kill me.

660
00:47:57,492 --> 00:48:00,245
There is no way
she would kill her own daughter!

661
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:02,539
Why are you yelling?
You came to ask for a favor.

662
00:48:05,292 --> 00:48:08,587
Then I guess I have no choice
but to tell your mother what happened

663
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:10,714
and ask her to help me instead.

664
00:48:10,797 --> 00:48:12,424
You are going to ask my mother?

665
00:48:13,842 --> 00:48:15,385
There she is.

666
00:48:17,763 --> 00:48:20,807
You did not need to bring gifts
to apologize for the past.

667
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,771
The more I thought about it,
the more apologetic I felt.

668
00:48:27,189 --> 00:48:29,733
I will go and ask her myself.

669
00:48:29,816 --> 00:48:30,734
Wait.

670
00:48:30,817 --> 00:48:33,904
I will think about it. Come with me first.

671
00:48:42,746 --> 00:48:44,790
I will be right back. Stay here.

672
00:48:45,374 --> 00:48:46,833
If you do not come, I will yell.

673
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:48,418
-I will be back.
-Cho-yeon.

674
00:48:49,211 --> 00:48:50,337
Yes, Mother.

675
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:51,963
Wait here.

676
00:49:23,286 --> 00:49:24,663
She is a young girl.

677
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,165
I wonder who she is.

678
00:49:56,611 --> 00:49:58,238
Is it because of the incense stick?

679
00:50:02,242 --> 00:50:03,535
What a nice vase.

680
00:50:04,578 --> 00:50:08,540
If you put flowers in the vase,
it helps them emit a stronger scent.

681
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,710
-Really?
-Yes.

682
00:50:11,793 --> 00:50:15,005
I have been wanting to change
the vase in my daughter's room.

683
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:16,965
Thank you.

684
00:50:20,677 --> 00:50:23,722
Mother, are you going to put the vase
in Bu-yeon's room?

685
00:50:23,805 --> 00:50:25,724
It helps the flowers emit
a stronger scent.

686
00:50:25,807 --> 00:50:29,478
Your sister cannot see, so she should
at least enjoy the scent of the flowers.

687
00:51:13,772 --> 00:51:15,106
How dare you touch that!

688
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:17,025
What are you doing in my daughter's room?

689
00:51:21,905 --> 00:51:23,323
She came with me.

690
00:51:23,406 --> 00:51:24,866
She must have gotten lost.

691
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:27,702
Mu-deok, what were you doing here?

692
00:51:29,996 --> 00:51:31,164
I am sorry.

693
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:35,126
Please help me, just this once.

694
00:51:36,461 --> 00:51:38,046
Please leave.

695
00:51:38,129 --> 00:51:39,965
You are not allowed in here.

696
00:51:40,048 --> 00:51:41,758
All right. Let us leave.

697
00:51:45,345 --> 00:51:47,180
I promise I will go.

698
00:51:49,641 --> 00:51:50,725
Cho-yeon.

699
00:51:51,393 --> 00:51:54,980
Tell the servants
to clean Bu-yeon's room again.

700
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:57,524
Yes, Mother.

701
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,261
So-i.

702
00:52:27,262 --> 00:52:29,055
This man will be your father.

703
00:52:30,015 --> 00:52:31,141
My father?

704
00:52:32,058 --> 00:52:34,477
A father is willing to take in
a fake daughter?

705
00:52:37,856 --> 00:52:41,484
I am not the father of Jin Bu-yeon.

706
00:52:42,986 --> 00:52:46,031
Jin Bu-yeon's biological father
is someone else.

707
00:52:58,668 --> 00:53:01,379
To be acknowledged
as the daughter of the Jin family,

708
00:53:01,463 --> 00:53:03,340
you must open the door to Jinyowon.

709
00:53:03,423 --> 00:53:06,843
And to do that, the blood
of the Jin family needs to run inside you.

710
00:53:10,722 --> 00:53:12,057
What is that?

711
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:15,477
A worm that sucked the blood
of a female member of the Jin family.

712
00:53:37,457 --> 00:53:39,376
That is the blood of Cho-yeon,

713
00:53:40,377 --> 00:53:41,920
my beloved daughter.

714
00:53:43,797 --> 00:53:45,966
What do you plan to do with that?

715
00:53:46,049 --> 00:53:47,467
Give me your hand.

716
00:53:49,636 --> 00:53:51,221
I said, give me your hand.

717
00:54:34,681 --> 00:54:37,851
You now have the blood of the Jin family
running inside you.

718
00:54:38,935 --> 00:54:41,354
If I do not use sorcery to keep it alive,

719
00:54:41,438 --> 00:54:44,315
that worm will start eating you
from the inside.

720
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,235
If you try to run from me,

721
00:54:48,069 --> 00:54:50,363
that worm will eat you alive.

722
00:54:57,454 --> 00:55:00,123
That room belonged to her daughter
who died ten years ago.

723
00:55:01,291 --> 00:55:02,876
She apparently drowned and died,

724
00:55:03,626 --> 00:55:06,171
but Lady Jin still thinks
she might come back.

725
00:55:07,756 --> 00:55:08,965
She is a pitiful woman,

726
00:55:09,924 --> 00:55:11,593
so forgive her for slapping you.

727
00:55:14,721 --> 00:55:17,766
By any chance, was that daughter blind?

728
00:55:18,683 --> 00:55:20,977
Yes, she was.

729
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:24,481
The owner of this body
used to be blind as well.

730
00:55:25,273 --> 00:55:27,609
Could that be why
I suddenly felt something earlier?

731
00:55:45,085 --> 00:55:48,213
Master Lee wanted to talk
to the Crown Prince in private.

732
00:55:48,838 --> 00:55:49,839
I see.

733
00:55:55,011 --> 00:55:57,972
The leader has asked us
to escort you to Songrim.

734
00:55:58,556 --> 00:56:00,558
Just me? Why?

735
00:56:00,642 --> 00:56:01,643
Come with us.

736
00:56:12,153 --> 00:56:13,738
Am I getting locked in here again?

737
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:16,074
-What is going on?
-It is--

738
00:56:16,783 --> 00:56:18,118
We were told to stay silent.

739
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:20,120
Wait here until he comes.

740
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:33,091
Mu-deok was found near the bodies,
so I get why she was taken away.

741
00:56:33,174 --> 00:56:35,677
But why Young Master Jang?
He was at the palace.

742
00:56:37,053 --> 00:56:39,597
What is the leader of Songrim thinking?

743
00:56:39,681 --> 00:56:40,682
I do not know either.

744
00:56:43,309 --> 00:56:44,352
Yul.

745
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:46,563
Mu-deok would never kill anyone.

746
00:56:47,188 --> 00:56:48,273
Right?

747
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,528
May I take a look at the bodies?

748
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:08,293
It was done by a skilled swordsman.

749
00:57:08,918 --> 00:57:10,545
It could not have been Mu-deok.

750
00:57:12,172 --> 00:57:13,756
But she is the assassin, Naksu.

751
00:57:14,716 --> 00:57:16,468
She could have killed those men.

752
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:24,559
I have a good reason for doing this,

753
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:26,060
so just go on your way.

754
00:57:29,647 --> 00:57:32,484
-They are those thugs.
-Do you know them?

755
00:57:34,777 --> 00:57:37,030
I got into a fight with them
some time ago.

756
00:57:42,285 --> 00:57:44,829
Can I take their bodies now
and hold a funeral for them?

757
00:57:51,377 --> 00:57:53,505
What brings the owner of Chwiseonru here?

758
00:57:53,588 --> 00:57:55,089
Did someone die?

759
00:57:55,173 --> 00:57:57,634
Our guards got killed.

760
00:58:10,939 --> 00:58:12,315
Young Master Park.

761
00:58:12,398 --> 00:58:14,317
Maidservant Kim told me what happened.

762
00:58:16,236 --> 00:58:17,612
Young Lady Jin.

763
00:58:18,613 --> 00:58:20,240
Please help Mu-deok.

764
00:58:28,122 --> 00:58:30,875
I went to the inn
to buy tickets from scalpers.

765
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,587
And I saw Mu-deok there.

766
00:58:36,673 --> 00:58:37,715
But of course,

767
00:58:37,799 --> 00:58:41,594
it was my first time
going to such a place.

768
00:58:42,178 --> 00:58:43,263
I know.

769
00:58:44,097 --> 00:58:47,850
We talked for a bit,
and right after Mu-deok went inside,

770
00:58:47,934 --> 00:58:49,894
I saw you coming in, my lord.

771
00:58:50,812 --> 00:58:55,275
And of course,
I never thought I would meet you there.

772
00:58:56,943 --> 00:58:58,111
I know.

773
00:59:01,573 --> 00:59:02,991
Judging by the circumstances,

774
00:59:04,033 --> 00:59:08,121
there is no way Mu-deok had enough time
to kill all those men.

775
00:59:09,163 --> 00:59:12,375
A girl recently came
to Chwiseonru and looked for Mu-deok,

776
00:59:12,458 --> 00:59:13,918
pretending to be a mage.

777
00:59:14,002 --> 00:59:15,503
The owner of Chwiseonru thinks

778
00:59:15,587 --> 00:59:19,549
it might have been So-i,
the girl that the broker warned her about.

779
00:59:19,632 --> 00:59:22,010
I once saw a girl
arguing with those thugs.

780
00:59:23,344 --> 00:59:24,596
The dead broker,

781
00:59:24,679 --> 00:59:25,972
thugs, and guards.

782
00:59:26,848 --> 00:59:29,100
They all had something to do
with that girl, So-i.

783
00:59:29,183 --> 00:59:31,019
That swindler, So-i, seems suspicious.

784
00:59:31,894 --> 00:59:34,147
In any case, it means Mu-deok is innocent.

785
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:36,733
All right.

786
00:59:37,734 --> 00:59:42,322
I also did not think that
Mu-deok would have committed murder.

787
00:59:42,405 --> 00:59:46,534
I knew it. You knew that Mu-deok would
never do such a thing, right?

788
00:59:46,618 --> 00:59:50,163
Then can you release Uk and Mu-deok now?

789
00:59:50,246 --> 00:59:52,498
The reason I locked both of them up

790
00:59:53,374 --> 00:59:55,335
was to ask them about something else.

791
00:59:56,377 --> 00:59:57,879
I will take care of it from here.

792
00:59:57,962 --> 00:59:59,088
You may all leave.

793
00:59:59,172 --> 01:00:00,340
All right.

794
01:00:19,275 --> 01:00:20,526
My lord.

795
01:00:21,277 --> 01:00:23,905
What is this?
At least tell me what is going on.

796
01:00:24,697 --> 01:00:27,158
Mu-deok committed murder.

797
01:00:30,286 --> 01:00:31,287
What--

798
01:00:31,371 --> 01:00:34,457
She killed those who knew about her past.

799
01:00:37,627 --> 01:00:41,673
Tell me what it is that you and Mu-deok
are hiding from me.

800
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,301
If your statement
does not match Mu-deok's,

801
01:00:45,885 --> 01:00:48,221
you will not be able
to leave this Secret Room.

802
01:00:49,055 --> 01:00:50,807
And Mu-deok will die.

803
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,663
My lord, hear me out--

804
01:01:13,746 --> 01:01:15,081
This is not about the murders.

805
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:19,001
Uk has told me your secret.

806
01:01:20,294 --> 01:01:21,546
He told me everything.

807
01:01:25,133 --> 01:01:29,053
If you also tell me the truth,
I shall spare your life.

808
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:31,347
However,

809
01:01:31,431 --> 01:01:34,517
if anything that you say
differs from what he said,

810
01:01:36,436 --> 01:01:37,895
you will die.

811
01:01:46,821 --> 01:01:48,698
If he found out she was a soul shifter,

812
01:01:48,781 --> 01:01:50,742
he would not waste time like this.

813
01:01:50,825 --> 01:01:53,411
He is trying to test us
by interrogating us separately.

814
01:01:54,245 --> 01:01:56,581
We have to say the same thing.

815
01:01:58,374 --> 01:02:01,627
What would Uk have said
to the same question?

816
01:02:01,711 --> 01:02:05,548
A secret that ensures
that we say the same thing.

817
01:02:05,631 --> 01:02:10,219
A secret that is private
but will not get me killed if revealed.

818
01:02:13,306 --> 01:02:14,766
I will tell you the truth.

819
01:02:14,849 --> 01:02:16,225
I will tell you my secret.

820
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,359
What happened?

821
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,321
Both Mu-deok and Uk

822
01:02:29,197 --> 01:02:30,323
can be set free.

823
01:02:30,823 --> 01:02:33,868
What did they say?
Did they say the same thing?

824
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:40,082
They both did say the same thing.

825
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:12,448
-You got out.
-So did you.

826
01:03:13,032 --> 01:03:15,910
-I am relieved that you are all right.
-Yes, me too.

827
01:03:15,993 --> 01:03:17,829
Thank goodness we said the same thing.

828
01:03:19,372 --> 01:03:20,873
What did you say?

829
01:03:20,957 --> 01:03:22,667
The fact that we both got out…

830
01:03:24,043 --> 01:03:26,045
means you said
the same thing as what I said.

831
01:03:31,008 --> 01:03:34,470
You separately locked them up
to find out what they were hiding.

832
01:03:34,554 --> 01:03:36,472
I guess you got something out of them.

833
01:03:36,556 --> 01:03:37,390
Tell me.

834
01:03:37,473 --> 01:03:39,851
What was the secret they were hiding?

835
01:03:40,768 --> 01:03:42,186
The two of them…

836
01:03:43,271 --> 01:03:46,732
told me a secret
that completely shut me up.

837
01:03:49,569 --> 01:03:52,196
They both showed me the same thing.

838
01:03:54,115 --> 01:03:55,491
I will tell you the truth.

839
01:03:56,409 --> 01:03:58,035
I tried not to let it show.

840
01:03:59,287 --> 01:04:01,080
This is what I kept inside.

841
01:04:18,723 --> 01:04:20,224
You see, I…

842
01:04:20,725 --> 01:04:23,102
I actually…

843
01:04:30,067 --> 01:04:31,694
I like Mu-deok a lot.

844
01:04:35,531 --> 01:04:37,366
I like Young Master Jang very much.

845
01:04:43,748 --> 01:04:46,208
I figured it would ensure
that we said the same thing.

846
01:04:48,044 --> 01:04:50,421
It was not crucial enough
to get me killed.

847
01:04:50,504 --> 01:04:54,258
Right. Songrim's Book of Regulations
does not state anything about

848
01:04:54,342 --> 01:04:56,719
punishing young men and women
for falling in love.

849
01:04:59,889 --> 01:05:00,723
Exactly.

850
01:05:00,806 --> 01:05:04,852
They would not kill a maid
for loving her owner to death.

851
01:05:06,938 --> 01:05:10,232
You said that?
You told him that you loved me to death?

852
01:05:11,984 --> 01:05:13,110
Well…

853
01:05:13,819 --> 01:05:17,031
I just exaggerated
because I had to convince him.

854
01:05:20,284 --> 01:05:21,827
I had no choice but to say it.

855
01:05:23,204 --> 01:05:26,707
You had no choice but to admit
that you loved me to death.

856
01:05:27,917 --> 01:05:29,627
Gosh, I feel so bad.

857
01:05:30,336 --> 01:05:32,713
I was not as passionate
when I expressed my feelings.

858
01:05:33,255 --> 01:05:34,548
I guess I should try harder.

859
01:05:34,632 --> 01:05:35,800
Forget it.

860
01:05:37,593 --> 01:05:41,597
Do not put everything on the line
for something as fickle as love.

861
01:05:42,932 --> 01:05:44,850
If something like this ever happens again,

862
01:05:45,601 --> 01:05:47,895
and you find yourself
in a life or death situation,

863
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,231
give up on love…

864
01:05:51,524 --> 01:05:52,733
and choose your life.

865
01:05:55,111 --> 01:05:56,737
Do that if you do not wish to die.

866
01:05:57,655 --> 01:05:59,198
That is an order from your master.

867
01:06:04,245 --> 01:06:05,371
Master.

868
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,623
What if I do not mind dying?

869
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:10,835
Then can I hold onto it
and keep loving you?

870
01:06:13,295 --> 01:06:15,423
I told you that
I am willing to risk it all

871
01:06:16,382 --> 01:06:18,175
and that we are in this together.

872
01:06:19,552 --> 01:06:21,178
I will keep going no matter what.

873
01:06:21,721 --> 01:06:26,183
So you should do the same
and stick to your confession.

874
01:06:27,727 --> 01:06:29,311
Keep loving me to death.

875
01:07:08,809 --> 01:07:12,730
If Uk falls in love
with a woman he should not,

876
01:07:12,813 --> 01:07:14,231
what would you do?

877
01:07:14,315 --> 01:07:18,277
If I am to stay in love with you,
I need to be certain you are mine.

878
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,237
How dare you disgrace Jinyowon?

879
01:07:20,988 --> 01:07:22,031
-This is too salty!
-They are perfect for each other.

880
01:07:22,114 --> 01:07:23,407
Why call off the wedding?

881
01:07:23,491 --> 01:07:25,242
I am looking for Shaman Choi.

882
01:07:25,326 --> 01:07:28,162
If Shaman Choi was hunted by
the mages of Cheonbugwan,

883
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:31,082
are you seeking her because
she bears a grudge against your father?
