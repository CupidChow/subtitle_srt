00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,390
 Nam Ji Hyun

00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,720
 Chae Jong Hyup

 Ha Do Kwon

 The Witch's Diner

6
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,080
Did you really have to go that far?

7
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,260
It's not something for you to be involved in.

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,880
You know that it could be risky, right?

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,730
It looks like it's about to be fun.

10
00:00:52,730 --> 00:01:00,160
But CEO Oh... This isn't the first time I had someone die, is it?

11
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:12,620
 Witch's Diner Ep. 2: Comfort Food Tomato Soup

12
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,730
For starters, the parents of the students who witnessed the assault are filing a petition.

13
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,230
Yours and Yeong Jae's statements are the most important.

14
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,530
Because the Committee for Counter-Measures Against School Violence has been convened...

15
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,850
Even before this incident, were there conflicts between you all?

16
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,640
Homeroom reassignment is also possible.

17
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,280
 Student Choi Yeong Jae will have to do school community service for two days.

18
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,620
 Student Lee Gil Yong, whose degree of violence was established... is prohibited from participating in extracurricular activities.

19
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,690
 He will be disciplined with four hours of counseling.

20
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:51,990

21
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,360
 Mom!

22
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,380
 Don't worry. I'll protect you.

23
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,070
 Who are you?

24
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,900
 Me? I'm a witch.

25
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,890
 If you eat this steak, your wish will certainly come true.

26
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,210
 But there is a cost.

27
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,510
No way.

28
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,880
It must've been a dream.

29
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,070
Wow, a sudden cardiac arrest? Exactly.

30
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,780
I thought she made all that money to take with her to the grave.

31
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,630
She was such a miser that whole time.

32
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,170
You never know what will happen with these people, right?

33
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,470
 As there is power in words, there's strength in thoughts too.

34
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:00,470
 Think about the person you want to exact vengeance on as you chew it to tiny pieces.

35
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,850
 When will my wish become fulfilled?

36
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,990
 Some time or other. It will for sure.

37
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,080
No way.

38
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,330
That doesn't make sense.

39
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,440
It must be a coincidence.

40
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,760
- Business owner! 
 - Geez! Fuck. You surprised me.

41
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,270
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,420
Oh, Business Owner, I'm sorry for causing you trouble each time.

43
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,540
Go put it there. The owner said he'd pick it up later.

44
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,660
The rental fee is ten thousand won (~$10).

45
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,630
Oh, t-ten thousand?

46
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,320
What's wrong? As if this is the first time you've done this.

47
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,990
It's only because I'm okay with it that I have pity on your circumstances,

48
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,290
and I let you borrow the customers' clothes.

49
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,350
That's why you should just buy a suit!

50
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,480
You look so petty like this!

51
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,600
Go carefully on your way.

52
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,370
They say it's difficult to get a job these days, but that was the umpteenth interview already.

53
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,620
Would he be able to feed himself properly at this rate?

54
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,180
So pathetic, really. It's even making me worry about him.

55
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,960
 Inferior Study Dorms 3–4 F / Office 2nd F

56
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,520
Room 404 once again isn't here.

57
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,810
He's so behind on payments.

58
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:40,230
I dare him to come in. I'll be sure to terminate him today.

59
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,380
Hey, Jae Su! It's been a long time...

60
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,420
Hey, your pizza place is doing well, right? Do you have money?

61
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,370
I... my interview... ah...

62
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,620
I got it. I'll talk to—

63
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,800
 No, what I'm trying to say is...

64
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,860
 It's because I've suffered for a bit. I'm definitely in my 20s.

65
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,130
 No, you see I already hired a part-timer.

66
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,750
 - Hello. 
 - Oh.

67
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,910
 You came, Gil Yong?

68
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,560
 - Well then... 
 - Yeah.

69
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,560
What are you doing? Aren't you getting ready for business?

70
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,020
U-Um well...

71
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,060
Ajumma Kyeong Hee is dead.

72
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:37,200
Is it... is it really your doing?

73
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,480
No. You did it.

74
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,370
 Revenge. I want revenge.

75
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,330
 Revenge.

76
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,760
You clearly said you wanted revenge.

77
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,710
No...

78
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,630
That's not what I meant.

79
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,590
I... I...

80
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,770
I just wanted her to realize what she did wrong.

81
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,680
What does the word "revenge" mean?

82
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,650
Since when was revenge such a soft and gentle wish?

83
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,080
No matter what, I didn't ask you to kill people!

84
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,070
You're being a hypocrite right now.

85
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:40,900
Revenge means to take what you want.

86
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:51,950
If your wish for revenge was granted, then you should bear the burden that remains.

87
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,630
 Park Gyeong Hui

88
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,710
This wasn't what I wished for.

89
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,210
I was wrong.

90
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,500
I'm sorry.

91
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,170
Please forgive me!

92
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,430
 Counselor's Office

93
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,110
You...

94
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,500
Ah... Mental health counseling?

95
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:11,000
You receive that nowadays as part of school discipline.

96
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,760
Yes.

97
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,750
I wanted to protect my friend.

98
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,300
Since my friend is okay, I don't regret it.

99
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,120
Still, it's unfair to you.

100
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,490
I know, right? It's actually pretty unfair, isn't it?

101
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:32,190
I mean, I didn't do anything wrong.

102
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,900
You're seriously smiling right now?

103
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,440
Thank you for taking my side.

104
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:44,020
I was told when I was young I caught a terminal illness.

105
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,890
But now I don't even remember what it was like.

106
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,610
People say time heals.

107
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,140
I won't remember this either as time goes by.

108
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,580
Therefore, right now, I will face up to reality.

109
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,550
Only reality.

110
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,950
Aren't you... scared?

111
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,790
Who in this world has no fear?

112
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,610
What if I can't grant my mom's wish?

113
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,580
What if I can't attend the competition?

114
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,140
I'm scared of all of these.

115
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,770
Still, you never know until it really happens.

116
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,520
It might not be that big a deal.

117
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,440
 That's right. What's the point in worrying all the time?

118
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,690
You're pretty awesome.

119
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,590
Now that I think of it, you seem more like an adult than me.

120
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,290
♬  Sometimes it’s heavy feel so lonely  ♬

121
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,090
I'm leaving.

122
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,990
♬  Why do I feel this way  ♬

123
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,880
Noona!

124
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,880
♬  It’s just another day  ♬

125
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,550
See you again next time.

126
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,620
What's going on?

127
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,390
Who is it?

128
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,320
Go out to the hallway.

129
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,920
You know you'll get 0 points if you use a smartphone.

130
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,570
Get out!

131
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,410
Quiet!

132
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,060
Continue with your test.

133
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,220
Get out!

134
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,590
  Classroom 3-6

135
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,550
The test is over!

136
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,720
What should Yeong Jae do if he messes up this mid-term exam?

137
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,880
He'll have no chance to go to college.

138
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,710
Isn't this yours? It was on the ground there.

139
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,640
 Call Log 
 Yeong Jae. Dad. Dad. Dad.

140
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,040
Yeong Jae.

141
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,170
Yeong Jae, are you running away because you got 0 points?

142
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,960
Goodbye!

143
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,190
Hey, Yeong Jae.

144
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:41,140
The parts you received surgery on last year have been affected again.

145
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,260
You can't do any intense exercises for around four weeks.

146
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,610
Keep that in mind.

147
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,980
Then what about the competition?

148
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,630
We'll have to continue observing the situation,

149
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,150
but it may be hard for you to attend the next competition.

150
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,720
 If you do choose your own life, then...

151
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,890
A witch. A witch. A witch?

152
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,420
Stop repeating "witch" over and over again.

153
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,290
Drink it all straight and go home to sleep.

154
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,860
Hiring hell, shell-shock poverty, and it's hellish Korea, right?

155
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,070
I'm no longer surprised no matter what sort of nonsense happens.

156
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,320
A witch? How is that possible?

157
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,120
Yoon Mi, do you know this?

158
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,800
We take our words and thoughts for granted.

159
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,690
But she said there's actually power in them.

160
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,840
So what I'm saying is, it's a hugely terrifying thing.

161
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,560
If you keep thinking of bad things,

162
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:51,530
they can actually happen in real life, okay?

163
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,500
Do you understand? Hey! Are you listening to me?

164
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,070
He's so handsome.

165
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,650
For someone as handsome as you love must be easy.

166
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,070
I don't even have anyone to love to begin with.

167
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,830
- That person appears a lot on shows recently. 
 - He's really popular right now.

168
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,480
He's handsome, has good manners, and is successful.

169
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,440
He's out of this world. He's every woman's dream.

170
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,700
Let's try harder at life.

171
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,740
I don't know how you reached this conclusion, but let's try harder at life.

172
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,160
That's right, Jeong Jin.

173
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,180
That's right. Witches aren't a big deal.

174
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,450
It's not like she's going to kill me. What can she do?

175
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,820
So what if we have a contract?

176
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,960
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

177
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,300
Let's clarify the terms of our contract.

178
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,940
I'm someone who got completely stabbed in the back because I didn't pay attention to the contract, you know?

179
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,180
It's not everything to just say, "This store is now mine."

180
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,800
What are you talking about? Didn't I say I would pay the monthly rent as well?

181
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,580
Rent isn't the only expense.

182
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,140
Loan interest. Electricity bills.

183
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,040
Water bills. Material cost. But is that all?

184
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,260
What about me? What about my labor cost?

185
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,790
We need to calculate exactly how we're going to split the profits.

186
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,870
That's what a real contract is like.

187
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,760
- Let's split 50-50. 
 - Agreed.

188
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,820
There'd better be customers.

189
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,980
Goodbye.

190
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,380
That thing has a temper when she's drunk.

191
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,260
 I heard in the faculty office that Yeong Jae attempted suicide.

192
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,210
 Did he attempt suicide because of Lee Gil Yong?

193
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,100
 - Aren't they close friends? 
 - But they fought recently.

194
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,540
 Because of that school disciplinary action.

195
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,500
 Wow, he's really shameless.

196
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,590
 So he called him on purpose during the exam?

197
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,580
You came.

198
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,960
Go ahead inside.

199
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,710
He won't say anything when I try to talk to him.

200
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,170
Um... Have you eaten?

201
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,650
I'll leave now.

202
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,550
I just wanted to see your face.

203
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,720
Get some rest.

204
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,720
Those bastards...

205
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,240
What should I do with my life now?

206
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,980
To get into college, I stopped exercising and studied so hard.

207
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,400
I felt like everything was over.

208
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:14,220
So I tried to jump off the top of the school building.

209
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,350
But...

210
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,060
My legs were shaking so badly.

211
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,030
I guess a worthless punk like me wanted to live.

212
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,450
It's not over for you.

213
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,310
That's even scarier.

214
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,390
To think I have to live like this for decades to come...

215
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,880
That's even scarier.

216
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,610
 Das🌎ltour

217
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,580
I think you're overstepping.

218
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,060
We're beings that live within narrow boundaries.

219
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,980
We observe the life of humans.

220
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,140
We grant the wishes of people with high aspirations, and

221
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,200
we collect the price for those wishes.

222
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,880
If we break those boundaries, we're not qualified to be witches.

223
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,010
You're so old-fashioned.

224
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:47,100
Are we CCTVs? We just watch them?

225
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:52,820
The cost for these wishes can never be returned.

226
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,730
Who said I was going to return it?

227
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,320
I'm just saying let's have some fun.

228
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,000
Ah. Transfer the processing fees to Director Oh.

229
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,220
There's a lot to do.

230
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,900
Have you sobered up?

231
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,310
You have quite a temper when you're drunk.

232
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,540
I didn't drink much.

233
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,590
- I was just clearing my thoughts. 
 - Okay.

234
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,930
First, since it's my diner—

235
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,610
No, it's not. It's my diner now.

236
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,800
- Why is it your diner— 
 - Call me "boss."

237
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,690
And since you made a contract with me, it's mine.

238
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,330
 Gap: - Jo Hee Ra
 Eul: Jeong Jin
 (Gap and Eul are two parties but Gap means greater power and Eul lesser)

239
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,030
This is nonsense. You signed this without asking me?

240
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,310
Since we're going to work together, let's set some ground rules.

241
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,810
One, don't question my words.

242
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,680
Two, don't eat anything I make without permission, not even the leftovers.

243
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,910
- Three, I decide the opening and closing hours. 
 - What?

244
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,850
- What does that mean? 
 - Don't ask questions. I don't like that.

245
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,510
And the most important fourth rule...

246
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:17,400
I'll do everything else as I please.

247
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,300
Who in the world gave you that kind of authority?

248
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,960
I'm gap. You're eul. Okay?

249
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,980
And to start with,

250
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:35,400
let's fix this rotten interior design.

251
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,480
Wait—

252
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,140
I talked to Director Oh. It's going to get done today.

253
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,370
Who's Director Oh?

254
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,740
Gil Yong.

255
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,000
What are you still doing here?

256
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:05,890
The coach said you won't be able to attend the competition.

257
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:11,970
You won't drop out of school because of that, will you?

258
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,330
My dad...

259
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:16,600
Sir, you can't park here.

260
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,570
I'm sorry. I'll move my car immediately.

261
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,210
Sorry.

262
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:26,160
 He always says his wish is for me to graduate from high school.

263
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,620
 But that's actually a lie.

264
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,820
 I know his real wish is the same as my mom's.

265
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,530
He wishes I can get into college by competing in track and field,

266
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,060
 but suddenly, I'm scared.

267
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:11,040
 I wish everything had a right answer.

268
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,010
 But I've lost the answer to things now.

269
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:22,570
Everything is over now. Competition. And college.

270
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:30,560
 That understanding ...How much did I really understand?

271
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,320
 I'm fine. I'm fine.

272
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,460
 When Mom said she was fine,

273
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:46,170
 how much did I really understand her?

274
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,540
 Since my friend is okay, I don't regret it.

275
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:58,790
 I might be hiding behind the words, "I'm fine."

276
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:04,960
 Just like Mom wasn't fine when she said, "I'm fine."

277
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:14,440
 You don't even know how to fight and you have an upcoming race.

278
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,770
 Your entry into the competition has been canceled, boy!

279
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:22,100
 It'll be hard for you to become an athlete.

280
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,630
 It's all a mess. Everything is over.

281
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,330
 Incoming call: Yeong Jae

282
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,500
Hyung, I...

283
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,040
I'm not going to lose to those bastards.

284
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,410
Okay.

285
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,560
Let's not lose to them.

286
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,270
You made a good choice.

287
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,040
Hyung, what are you doing?

288
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,190
 Did something happen?

289
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,760
No. Nothing's happened.

290
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,900
It's annoyingly beautiful.

291
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,320
 The Witch's Diner

292
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,650
 Introduction

293
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,810
 Price: insanely expensive so not everyone can eat here

294
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:27,010
 However, all wishes are possible. The result is guaranteed.

295
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:30,070
Wait. What's all this?

296
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:33,970
It's not like we're a tarot shop...

297
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,670
Is it to your liking?

298
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,260
Huh?

299
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,320
 Who's this person?

300
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,910
With you?

301
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:50,710
No, the interior design. I decorated this place based on the madam witch's order.

302
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,200
Then you're Director Oh?

303
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,760
Yes.

304
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:04,250
Both you and the madam witch are weird.

305
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,770
- What's your true identity anyway? 
 - Hm...

306
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,830
I ... just think of me as a shadow.

307
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:16,140
It's best to think of me as a supporter who gives help without being noticed.

308
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,880
Ah...

309
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,100
You can leave if you're done.

310
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,670
Can I at least get a cup of tea?

311
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,980
It's the opening of your new location after all.

312
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,840
This is a present for your opening.

313
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,600
Wh-What is this?

314
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,520
It's a mandrake. It's a pretty noisy fellow, so be careful.

315
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,210
And there's also this.

316
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:46,110
No way. Do you actually ride this because you're a witch?

317
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,570
- No. It's just for cleaning. 
 - Oh.

318
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,480
How many hours has it been?

319
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,330
Let's start closing up. It's not like there are any customers.

320
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:12,860
Customers? They'll come soon.

321
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,500
I was about to leave anyway.

322
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,210
Why didn't he leave earlier?

323
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,890
What's up with that guy?

324
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,340
You'll get to know him over time.

325
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,150
Now that I think of it, I haven't eaten anything.

326
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,760
 The Witch's Diner

327
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,950
What's that place?

328
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,060
Welcome—

329
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:11,080
 If coincidences keep happening, people think it's fate.

330
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,850
 Just as I did.

331
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:20,560
You're the person from the police station?

332
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,120
How come you're here?

333
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:28,480
Well, I was hungry, so I ended up here.

334
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,770
I was lost. I didn't know you would be here.

335
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,980
What are you talking about?

336
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,760
If you're a customer, please take a seat.

337
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,190
No, he's not a customer.

338
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,410
I met him at a police station before.

339
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,710
What's your name?

340
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,480
My name is Lee Gil Yong.

341
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,330
Got it. Police station guy.

342
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:53,950
Anyway, he's not a customer. He's just a student I know.

343
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,770
If he came to our diner, then he's our customer.

344
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,050
Move.

345
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,850
Sit here.

346
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,320
- Why don't you order something? 
 - Wait a moment, Witch—

347
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,370
- I mean, Boss. 
 - If a customer comes,

348
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:17,170
we take their order, listen to their wishes, and receive our payment.

349
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,220
That's the rule of this diner.

350
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,670
Wishes?

351
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,950
Police station guy. I need to have a few words with you.

352
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,480
Now we've gathered everyone.

353
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,490
So...

354
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:51,800
You probably won't believe me, but the witch here ...

355
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,320
I mean the boss... She can really grant your wishes.

356
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,110
I've experienced it myself.

357
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:01,040
The price you pay differs, but your wish definitely comes true.

358
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,060
It's like...

359
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,370
Karma. Do you know what I mean?

360
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,800
I believe you.

361
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,600
I mean...

362
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,960
I believe it since you're the one who said it.

363
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,970
There's this thing about wishes.

364
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:24,860
They can end up making somebody unfortunate.

365
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:30,630
There's no guarantee you'll be happy if your wishes come true.

366
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,870
Something really bad happened to someone

367
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:37,140
just because I made a random wish.

368
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:42,590
 Now that I think of it, you're more like an adult than me.

369
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,610
 That's why you were going through a hard time.

370
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:53,410
So it's like getting justice against bad people?

371
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:56,230
This world needs that too.

372
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,650
If somebody did something bad and they never get punished for it,

373
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,930
that's too unfair.

374
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:08,320
What I mean is you'll have to pay for even the smallest wishes.

375
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,780
You're responsible for bearing the burden of that price, so be careful.

376
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,640
I'll be careful.

377
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:22,180
But what if I make a wish to help someone?

378
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,530
Wouldn't that be okay?

379
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,200
Is it going to take forever?

380
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,620
If you're going to order a wish, do it. Otherwise, just leave!

381
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,600
Noona, my name is Gil Yong.

382
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,260
Lee Gil Yong.

383
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:46,080
Wait a moment.

384
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,020
Yeah, Yoon Mi.

385
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,580
Is that really your wish? You're not going to regret it?

386
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,910
No. I won't regret it.

387
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:05,710
You're a low-key wacko, aren't you?

388
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,580
Sorry?

389
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,750
Once your wish order is received it cannot be undone.

390
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,220
- Have you made up your mind? 
 - Excuse me, but...

391
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,880
Can you keep my wish a secret?

392
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,070
Each person's wish belongs only to him.

393
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:52,160
- Excuse me— 
 - Go to the basement and get me some herbs.

394
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,610
What type of herbs should I bring?

395
00:36:55,610 --> 00:37:00,170
Bring me dried mugwort, thyme, and pluck off one mandrake leaf for me. Oh and...

396
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,550
You can also bring a few herbs you like.

397
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,570
That hurts dang it!

398
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,260
It-it...

399
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,870
- It just talked, right? 
 - This thing just...

400
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,850
Boss! Boss!

401
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,850
- What? 
 - Did you— Did you just hear that?

402
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:31,380
It... it talked!

403
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,480
Of course. What type of mandrake doesn't talk?

404
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,450
You should've given me a spoiler warning or something.

405
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,510
- It suddenly just started talking! 
 - Shut up.

406
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,840
Stop your nagging and go get me the herbs from the basement.

407
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,650
 From Hermoine Granger: "Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative. It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state."

408
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,330
 Hermoine:  "The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it." (Harry Potter series)

409
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,780
Mugwort...

410
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,410
 It's pretty.

411
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,420
 Don't stare into it like that so soon.

412
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:22,550
 There are dangerous things that can take your soul in a blink.

413
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,490
That was close.

414
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,960
Oh right.

415
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,050
This.

416
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:56,430
 People say God made mothers since he couldn't be everywhere at the same time.

417
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:02,400
 The mothers stopped children from crying and granted their wishes.

418
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,090
 But the world isn't so simple,

419
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:09,490
 and that wasn't enough to make happy endings for everyone.

420
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,820
 That's why witches like us are needed.

421
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:17,550
We're a sort of fair trade where people can trade things for wishes.

422
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,750
It looks delicious.

423
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,170
I'm the one who made it after all.

424
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,080
Wait. Will you really be alright?

425
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,830
Yes. I'll be fine.

426
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,600
It tasted really great.

427
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,770
Take this.

428
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,910
 I can grant all your wishes. 
 The Witch

429
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,350
I'm leaving now.

430
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,050
Thank you for today.

431
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,520
Wait—

432
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:24,310
Why did you give Gil Yong your business card?

433
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:27,570
It's my business card, and I can do as I please.

434
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,600
I'm home.

435
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,920
You're late. Did you eat?

436
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,680
I ate already.

437
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,900
Are you already packing?

438
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,100
The coach called.

439
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,290
It's nothing big, right?

440
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,920
Yeah. Nothing big.

441
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,820
It's a nightmare again.

442
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,740
Let's do this. I have to get through today as well.

443
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,110
I'll need to get better.

444
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,350
Working part-time?

445
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:19,320
He's still a student.

446
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,570
I can do as I please.

447
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,240
Madam Witch, where do you think you're going?

448
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:31,260
I can go wherever I want to.

449
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:35,540
Why do you have so many questions? How tiring.

450
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,850
Madam Witch!

451
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:12,750
 Even though some things are destined to happen, you still make your own choices along the way.

452
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:16,070
 The selfish choices are what makes it interesting.

453
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:20,140
 Things will happen and they don't wait for you.

454
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,940
Seriously, what was that?

455
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,950
I had a nightmare today as well.

456
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,420
- Welcome. 
 - Welcome.

457
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:34,550
Put your hands up and don't move!

458
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:40,710
Noona!

459
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,200
What's up with all the noise?

460
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,520
♫  Oh oh  ♫

461
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,580
♫  Very delicious  ♫

462
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,970
♫  How does it taste?  ♫

463
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,940
♫  Very delicious  ♫

464
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:15,570
♫  Make your wish  ♫

465
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:20,570
♫  It's my favorite dish  ♫

466
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:24,510
♫  Favorite dish  ♫

467
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,570
♫  Don't you want another dish?  ♫

468
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:32,110
♫  It's my favorite dish  ♫

469
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:35,300
 The Witch's Diner

470
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,370
 Why am I the only one who is so unhappy?

471
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:39,850
 Why am I the only person who doesn't have a place in this world?

472
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:43,350
 I didn't even achieve my dreams, and the fact that I might not even be able to fulfill love either...

473
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,930
 Wish! What's your wish?

474
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,810
 You have to think about it carefully.

475
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:50,850
 We don't even know how big the consequences might be.

476
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,530
 This is the wish being fulfilled?

477
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:55,520
 Is this really the wish being fulfilled?

478
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,820
 Did something happen when I was young?

479
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,890
 Huh? That person's memory?

480
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:02,220
 What's that?

481
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,510
 Do you know anything about the things that are happening to me right now?

482
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:10,670
 It's probably something you can't escape since it's started now.

483
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:14,000
♫  Wish. Take a...  ♫
