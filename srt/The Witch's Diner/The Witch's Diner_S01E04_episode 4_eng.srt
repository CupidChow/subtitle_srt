Do you also want your love to return?

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,790
 I couldn't answer her.

10
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:01,480
 If I could bring back a love that has already ended, could I be happy?

11
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,040
 I already knew how he felt.

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,900
 Let's not avoid it. It's not that we're comfortable with each other, but that our love has grown cold.

13
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,370
 I already knew the answer.

14
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,130
 It just makes me a little sad to answer that.

15
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,130
Right now, I'm just...

16
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,710
No matter what anyone does, I'm the most important person.

17
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,560
Every day, I'm going to think only of myself and focus only on myself.

18
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,570
 What's going on? How did she know we broke up?

20
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,420
Wow, you look handsome.

21
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,690
Thank you.

22
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,720
Bravo!

23
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,740
- That was great! 
 - Thank you for your hard work for four months.

24
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,930
- Finally, tomorrow's the show, so hurry home and get plenty of rest. 
 - Okay.

25
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,550
- Let's do a cheer for tomorrow! 
 - Fighting!

26
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,850
But is this stage fright? I'm already feeling nauseous.

27
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,520
Don't worry too much. There's a real professional in this club: actress Jin Seon Mi.

28
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,090
I'm no professional. It's just a hobby while I'm working.

29
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,670
I worked so hard to get Assistant Manager Jin to join our club.

30
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,830
Oh, there's one more thing to celebrate.

31
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,660
I heard our lead actress is getting married.

32
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,940
Assistant Manager Jin, congratulations!

33
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,480
But I haven't received the proposal yet, so I'll accept the congratulations later.

34
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,360
I heard Assistant Manager Jin's groom passed the Civil Service Examination this time.

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,040
Seon Mi, I'm really jealous.

36
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,040
- Just up to the second round. 
 - If he passed the second round, then he's basically done. I'm so jealous!

37
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,390
Seon Mi, I think you've been getting calls since a while ago.

38
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,750
I'm sorry, excuse me for a minute.

39
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,660
- Your boyfriend? 
 - Oh, yes.

40
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,630
After seven years of dating, is it still that good?

41
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,250
Come on, don't be late for tomorrow's show.

42
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,320
Choi Yeong Jae is here.

43
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,150
I'm glad you're here.

44
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,520
Yeah.

45
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,840
The notes from when you weren't here.

46
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,450
Thank you.

47
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,530
- Hey, Choi Yeong Jae! 
 - Hey, Yeong Jae!

48
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,880
It's been a while since you came to school, but you should have reported to us.

49
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,020
Hey, you want to die? I thought I was going to die of boredom.

50
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,560
Look at this crazy bastard.

51
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,950
You fucking sicken me.

52
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,730
What's with the staring? Are you crazy?

53
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,750
Go Hyeon Wu, I'm not afraid of you anymore.

54
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,750
Say that again.

55
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,560
That's enough. Aren't you tired of it?

56
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,050
What's this pair?

57
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,290
Do you want me to get you expelled this time?

58
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,290
Do you think adults will believe you?

59
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,390
Or do you think they'll believe me?

60
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,320
It doesn't matter who believes what.

61
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,790
Does that change the fact that you bully kids?

62
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,830
Hey, hey, the teacher's coming.

63
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,090
What's going on? Why are you guys standing?

64
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,360
Our class president, Hyeon Wu, and Su Jeong won the last school debate.

65
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,530
So they've been invited to the generation special of "You Quiz on the Block."

66
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:22,560
When you two are on the air, remember your school's reputation is on the line, so do your best, okay?

67
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,070
- You've been waiting a long time, haven't you? 
 - No, I just got here too. What do you want to eat?

68
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,710
I made a reservation in advance. Excuse me.

69
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,360
It's been a while since I've been on stage, so I'm nervous.

70
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,530
Even though it's a small performance, if you're the lead character, it takes a lot of energy when practicing.

71
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,750
- You must be having a hard time. 
 - Not at all.

72
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,630
How is the food? Does it suit your taste?

73
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,780
It's really good. I love the ambiance here too.

74
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,190
How did you find out about this place?

75
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,870
- Seon Mi. 
 - Hm?

76
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,120
 What is this mood?

77
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,660
 Perhaps... Is he proposing?

78
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,360
You've been taking care of me this whole time.

79
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,000
You've been through a lot.

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,050
Seong Ho, how can you say that?

81
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,850
It was all for the two of us.

82
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,290
You know, about us...

83
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,730
 - I'm so nervous!  
 - Yes?

84
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,890
 Let's calm down, stay calm. Jin Seon Mi, calm down.

85
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,470
We...

86
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,790
- Let's stop seeing each other. 
 - Okay. I...

87
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:24,900
I've been thinking a lot about what to say, but thank you for taking it so well.

88
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,890
You bought this expensive gift for me,

89
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:35,270
but I'll give it back to you. If I take this too, I'll feel like a shameless bastard.

90
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,690
Anyway, I wanted to buy you a nice meal one last time.

91
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,200
Seong Ho, you're just joking around, right? This is—

92
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,360
- I'm going to leave now. 
 - Seong Ho—

93
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,530
Seong Ho, wait a minute!

94
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,060
Wait a minute, Seong Ho.

95
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,200
- Seong Ho. 
 - What?

96
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,000
Seong Ho, we dated for seven years.

97
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,960
We even promised to get married.

98
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,120
That's why I've been hesitant about this until now.

99
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,260
Who gets married these days because they've been dating for a long time?

100
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,800
Sure, we could get married,

101
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,690
but I don't want to be held down.

102
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,530
Things only just started to work out for you, right?

103
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,360
Seong Ho, we can't break up like this.

104
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,530
I can't break up with you.

105
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:37,330
Then we... Should we have some time apart?

106
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,530
After this show's over, we—

107
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:44,930
Seon Mi, I wasn't going to say this,

108
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,070
but it was hard for me to hear you talk about your show.

109
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,590
What the hell is that? It's pathetic.

110
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,230
I'll give you some advice as a friend.

111
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,160
You're old; you have no chance; you should just quit.

112
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,270
A friend? Now you're a friend?

113
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,290
- You shouldn't say things like that to me. 
 - For God's sake!

114
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,160
So why are you even listening to this? You should have been cool breaking up earlier.

115
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,660
Seong Ho, I... I didn't show my frustration once

116
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,530
so as to raise your self-esteem while you were studying at this age.

117
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,730
Yes, that's a good thing you said it. You were feeling frustrated too.

118
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,140
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

119
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,630
The more you do this, the worse I become.

120
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:37,520
Do you really need to make me into trash like this to feel better?

121
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,490
 Massage Parlor, VIP Touch Me

122
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,240
What in the world is all this?

123
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,630
- Mom.... 
 - Yes, it's your mom. This girl... can't you clean up after yourself every now and then?

124
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,070
Mom, when did you get here? You didn't call.

125
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,590
I just came by because I was afraid you'd be like this.

126
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:05,360
By the way, Mom. When I was a child around 5 or 6 years old.

127
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,030
- Huh? 
 - Did something happen?

128
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,170
Why are you suddenly talking about the past?

129
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:18,480
I had a dream, and I was walking hand in hand with some woman,

130
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,860
but that was so vivid.

131
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,500
I don't know if it's a dream or a memory.

132
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,760
I mean, what kind of nonsense are you talking about?

133
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,430
What do you mean "did something happen?"

134
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,430
Hey. Who in the world remembers everything from the past?

135
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,200
Maybe you got lost for a moment and someone brought you back.

136
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,260
Right?

137
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,820
You know how they say if there's a beginning, there must be an ending?

138
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,530
But ...

139
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,440
Sometimes there are beginnings that only exist for the ending.

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,530
♫  With so much happiness  ♫

143
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,950
♫  she was with him.  ♫

♫  Each toward the other  ♫

145

147
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,500
♫  he was looking at her.  ♫

  For god's sake!

00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,140
♫   The girl who was so happy ♫

157
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,900

♫  An eternal love does not exist. ♫

162

168
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,170
- Assistant Manager Jin. 
 - Yes?

169
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,380
Someone told me to deliver this to you.

170
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,350
 JTN ART HALL

171
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,970
Taxi.

172
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,680
Darling, how are you?

173
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,030
I'm almost there too. I'll have a cigarette and go in.

174
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:42,360
You know I really love you, right?

175
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,580
Even though I saw you earlier, I miss you already.

176
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,790
Good night! Me too!

177
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,670
Welcome.

178
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:41,250
Uh ... I saw the sign at the entrance and came in.

179
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,090
It says, "Any wish is possible."

180
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,900
Oh, yes. That's right.

181
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,120
This is a restaurant that serves wishes.

182
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,580
Come in and have a seat.  This way.

183
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,870
Get some tissue and water.

184
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,260
Are you all right?

185
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,130
Oh, yes.

186
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,870
I'm sorry.  I'm sort of out of it.

187
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,710
Have some water here.

188
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,600
Thank you.

189
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,400
He is a kind person.

190
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,330
He has a strong sense of responsibility.

191
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,370
I wanted to meet someone like that ever since I was a child.

192
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:52,080
 It's really sweet. I think it's sweeter because you bought it.

193
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,330
 - Darling. 
 - Huh?

194
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,190
 I think it’d be better for me to find a job than spend time preparing for the civil service exam.

195
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,320
 It's already been five years,

196
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,610
 and I don't want you to struggle anymore.

197
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,500
 Darling, what are you talking about?

198
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,790
 You've gone through so much up to now.

199
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:16,460
 That's how the world is nowadays.

200
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,110
 It's not just about chasing a dream.

201
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:25,080
 Even so, because you have a dream, there is hope.

202
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,540
 What kind of hope is this? This is false hope.

203
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,930
 For the sake of the path which is more realistically possible,

204
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,960
 isn't it right that I give up the remaining path?

205
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,140
 If it were this man,

206
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,240
 I would put my dream somewhere in the back pocket of my life.

207
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,400
 That's how I thought.

208
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,650
 Seon Ho, I will do something about it somehow.

209
00:18:53,650 --> 00:19:00,440
 Darling, don't think about that and think about passing the exam.

210
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,430
You ...

211
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,790
Did you really give up your dreams for that person?

212
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,990
You didn't have solid dreams,

213
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:18,470
so you picked a dream that was probably more attainable. Isn't that it?

214
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,680
What do you know anyway to speak so lightly of this?

215
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,770
That was the best choice for us.

216
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,720
Was it really the best?

217
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,520
Seon Mi, you weren't happy.

218
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,920
You gave up on yourself so how can you be happy?

219
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,440
It's because none of you have experienced true love before.

220
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,570
Part-timer!

221
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,560
Yes?

222
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,140
Go get cacao beans from the basement.

223
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,180
- A lot! 
 - Okay.

224
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,230
So... what type of revenge can I get for you?

225
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,280
I can make him blind.

226
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,300
Or I can give him a lifetime of pain.

227
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,130
Or... should I kill him for you?

228
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,300
What are you saying?

229
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,000
I don't want revenge.

230
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,430
Just... I wish for him to come back.

231
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,500
I don't wish for anything else.

232
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,680
You need to think about this carefully.

233
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,330
If you say your wish, it'll really come true.

234
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,630
I can't think of anything right now.

235
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:55,020
Rather than your dreams, are you looking for the person who abandoned you?

236
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,040
Think about it carefully before you answer.

237
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,770
A wish isn't something you ask for while drowning in your emotions.

238
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,080
Yes...

239
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,360
Please make Seong Ho love me again.

240
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:15,580
Good. You know you have to pay a price for the wish, right?

241
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,270
What do I give you?

242
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,960
You can't pay with money.

243
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,620
Then... what do you want?

244
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,590
Your voice is quite pretty.

245
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,610
My voice?

246
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,400
Yes, your voice.

247
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,040
I'll take your voice as payment.

248
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,340
Are you sure? You can stop now.

249
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,900
- It doesn't matter. 
 - It's your dream!

250
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,120
Isn't it your dream to sing with that voice in front of people?

251
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,800
I spent my twenties with that person.

252
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,070
I couldn't realize my dreams, but

253
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,080
if I can't be successful in love as well...

254
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,420
that scares me so much.

255
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,620
Stir counterclockwise.

256
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,510
Counterclockwise... the color should be bright like the clear sky

257
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,350
and stir until it becomes translucent.

258
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,210
I don't intend to learn how to cook.

259
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,740
Did you perhaps forget? I think I told you—

260
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,690
Don't stop. Keep stirring.

261
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,970
Just like that... Just like that.

262
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,980
Lift the spoon and step back a moment.

263
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:17,360
Keep stirring. Counterclockwise.

264
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,570
When you are eating it, don't forget to keep your wish in mind.

265
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,560
It's absolutely delicious.

266
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,220
Seon Mi, are you okay?

267
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,300
Seon Mi, try to stay awake! Seon Mi!

268
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,000
- Are you okay? 
 - Your love must have been quite deep.

269
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,010
If your love is deep, then the pain must be just as severe.

270
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,560
Make sure to remember

271
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,110
the suffering you feel now and the pain of love too.

272
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:20,340
It would be tragic if you were to forget that agony and fall in love again.

273
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,490
- You may leave now.
 - Yes.

274
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,540
Then... what should I do now?

275
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,840
Now you just have to wait

276
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,010
since it already started the moment you ate the food.

277
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,660
 The Witch's Diner

278
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,870
Isn't your house in the opposite direction?

279
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:25,640
- That's right. 
 - Then?

280
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,540
I just wanted to walk.

281
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,020
Kids should not be roaming around at night.

282
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,300
- I'm not a kid. 
 - If you're younger than me, then you're a kid.

283
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,330
And it's not just because I wanted to walk, either.

284
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:43,180
I'm also escorting you home right now.

285
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,350
What do you take me for?

286
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,070
I'd be fine if I went alone too.

287
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:52,060
You might be fine with it, but I'm not okay if you go back alone.

288
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,600
Okay, if that's what you want.

289
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:04,030
Earlier, that noona even gave up her dream for the person she loves.

290
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,850
I thought it was pretty cool.

291
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,160
What would a little thing like you know?

292
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,790
Oh? I'm bigger than you though.

293
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:14,790
By this much.

294
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:27,590
Okay. Good for you that you're tall.

295
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,870
But you know, that was a bit sad for me.

296
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:40,520
How could the most important thing in her life be just love?

297
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:45,410
When life is this complicated.

298
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,820
That noona must be okay, right?

299
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,780
Since her wish will come true.

300
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,830
We should hope for that.

301
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,920
Ah, right! How is school going for you?

302
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:04,710
I'm thinking about it. Other than athletics, what else could I do?

303
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,440
That's right. Whatever that road is, don't think of it as important.

304
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,820
Your mindset, while you're on that path, is more important.

305
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,390
♬  Sometimes it’s heavy  ♬

306
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,310
♬  feel so lonely  ♬

307
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,840
I... 
♬  Why do I feel this way  ♬

308
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,880
there is a movie I want to see. 
♬  It’s just another day  ♬

309
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,300
Movie?

310
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:28,480
Now that I think about it, I think it has been a million years since I've seen one too.

311
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,080
Oh! Then do you want to go watch a movie with me?

312
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,090
This Sunday?

313
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,010
Okay. I don't have anything else to do.

314
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:42,170
But nothing with monsters. I absolutely hate those.

315
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,450
I'm having nightmares often these days, so I dislike it more.

316
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:54,110
- You must've just moved here. 
 - Ah, yes.

317
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:58,300
This building's grandma landlord is a bit strict, so you might find it hard.

318
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,250
Oh my, why are you insulting people first thing in the morning?

319
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,370
Oh, look at this.  That... that... that.

320
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:08,330
That is all money. How can you just leave it there?

321
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:12,160
In this neighborhood, they collect recycled waste on Wednesdays and Fridays.

322
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,730
- Make sure to leave it out according to the proper day, okay? 
 - I understand.

323
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,860
Also, make sure you clean that plastic bowl well before leaving it there.

324
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,020
Aigoo, it's his first day. First day.  I'll help you. Come on, let's go up.

325
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,320
Yes, thank you.

326
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,250
- Since it's your first day, I'll let you go. 
 - Okay.

327
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,690
- You can leave it here. 
 - Thank you.

328
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,780
Oh, it looks like you have organized a bit already.

329
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,810
Like you said, the old landlady is quite strict.

330
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:39,050
Aigoo, that elder. She doesn't go easy on me even though I'm her son.

331
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,240
During the day, she picks on me as a tenant. At night, she picks on me for being single.

332
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,160
Ah, the nagging.

333
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,260
Oh, she's your mother. I'm sorry.

334
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,990
What are you sorry for? I know better than anyone how strict she is.

335
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,170
Is that a family portrait?

336
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:57,870
Yes. My wife and I have split, so it's just me and my son now.

337
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,890
Just a moment.

338
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,290
- Hello? 
-  Have you finished moving everything?

339
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,850
- Yes, I finished everything. 
  - I should have helped you out.

340
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:11,250
What are you saying? I can do this much by myself.

341
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,360
- After school, you're going to your part-time job, right? 
  - Yes.

342
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,050
Don't come home too late and make sure you eat.

343
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,720
Okay.

344
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,360
There's not much to parenting.

345
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,360
One way or another, they only think about their kids.

346
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,970
I'm also someone who keeps nagging.

347
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,970
Sorry, wait a little bit. It's recycling collection day today, but I forgot yesterday.

348
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:41,790
The store's landlady is really strict. Really sorry.

349
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,650
Huh? What's wrong with this?

350
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,360
Why didn't I recycle?

351
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,180
Ah, that's right. I have to clean that up first.

352
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,090
When am I going to get all of this done?

353
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:17,110
It's completely dried and stuck to the pot.

354
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,550
 It's absolutely delicious.

355
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:24,030
 Don't recklessly eat the food I make,

356
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,600
 even if there are leftovers.

357
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,840
 It might become an irreversible poison.

358
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,910
 The Witch's Diner

359
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,850
Are you okay?

360
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,710
- Oh! What's that? 
 - What?

361
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,960
It's Tom Kim! I want to get his autograph.

362
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,840
Hey! W-Wait!

363
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,430
It's crowded. Let's go.

364
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,150
- I'm a big fan. 
 - Thank you.

365
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,950
How's this one?

366
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,040
Huh? I-It's pretty.

367
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,030
And this? How's this?

368
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,510
- It's cute, right? 
 - Y-Yeah. It's pretty.

369
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,570
What's up with you? You're not even looking at it properly.

370
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,570
Let's go somewhere else.

371
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,830
Is my Jin too tired and just pushing herself?

372
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,610
That's not it.

373
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:39,000
I'm just out of it during the daytime. Weird things keep happening to me lately too.

374
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,630
You have to beat it! This unni will buy you a delicious meal.

375
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:46,970
- What are we eating? 
 - Order what you want. I'm going to run to the restroom.

376
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,350
Head up first!

377
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,910
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

378
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,930
 It was sweet.

379
00:34:54,930 --> 00:35:00,360
 It reminded me of a taste of chocolate cut by a  knife.

380
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,860
 Was it my decision to eat that chocolate?

381
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,010
 Or was it my fate?

382
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,840
I'll leave first.

383
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,580
See you.

384
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,480
Seon Mi!

385
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,800
I'm sorry, Seon Mi.

386
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,440
 Did my wish really come true?

387
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,760
I must have gone crazy for a second. How could I do that to you?

388
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,800
I was wrong.

389
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:54,800
I was wrong for saying we should break up and for all of the things that I said that hurt you.

390
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,380
All of that was my fault.

391
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:03,790
So... Can you give me one more chance?

392
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,180
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

393
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,550
I'm sorry.

394
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,720
Seon Mi, since your last performance was so good,

395
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,010
you know I picked out a performance that would make you stand out more, right?

396
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,130
Thank you. I'll work even harder this time.

397
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,490
Thank you. I'll work even harder this time.

398
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:02,230
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

399
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,790
What's wrong? Did you catch a cold?

400
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:08,760
No, I guess it was dry in my bedroom last night.

401
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,810
  Jin Seon Mi, come in to the diagnosis room.

402
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:17,140
Are you Jin Seon Mi by any chance?

403
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:22,030
I was thinking it could be you when I saw the chart, but it's really you!

404
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,430
It is so cool to meet you like this.

405
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,620
I'm sorry. Who are you?

406
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,730
I'm Nam Gook's friend.

407
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,710
I've been a big fan of yours since your musical days.

408
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,110
I've seen all of your performances.

409
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:39,010
I was really excited to hear that you're performing again.

410
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:42,530
I went to the rehearsal space to say hi to you several times,

411
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:46,070
but I didn't have the guts to do it.

412
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,740
Did you get the bouquet?

413
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,400
Excuse me?

414
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,990
♫ she was with him.  ♫

415
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:04,450
I fell for you when I heard your voice that day.

416
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,450
So I joined the club right away.

417
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,810
I'm definitely going to attend the next practice.

418
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:12,700
I'm sorry. I've been talking too much, right?

419
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,920
It's just because it's so nice to meet you.

420
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,040
You said that you're uncomfortable?

421
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,560
Could you say ah for me?

422
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:26,620
Your tonsils are a little swollen.

423
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:31,400
But compared to your voice, your throat isn't that bad.

424
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,690
It could also be due to psychological factors,

425
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,980
so I think you should be fine after some medicine and rest.

426
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,550
Sure.

427
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:48,180
 If it's not too much trouble, could I contact you for personal reasons?

428
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:59,190
  Hi, this is Seon Mi's number, right?

429
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,170
  Are you free this weekend?

430
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,610
  Let's go eat something good.

431
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,050
Hey. Hey. Hey. Not there! Two o'clock! Two o'clock!

432
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

433
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,060
Yes! Yes! Yes! Pow! Pow! Pow!

434
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:20,060
Good job!

435
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,010
Yes!

436
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,990
  You want me to return all of the bags and clothes you bought me? You idiot!

437
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:43,370
 It's the first time I've ever seen a loser like you fail the interview for the 5th level civil servant exam.

438
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:47,720
 You went around saying you passed the second round of interviews. What nonsense.

439
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,170
You're here?

440
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,180
 I'll kill you if you ever contact me again.

441
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,790
So you didn't come back.

442
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,770
You just had nowhere to go?

443
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,740
What are you talking about?

444
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,590
Ugh. You just...

445
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,740
How did the third interview go?

446
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:15,110
The test... well, it just turned out that way.

447
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,220
What did you say?

448
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,890
Seong Ho.

449
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:26,410
What have you done during the seven years we've been together?

450
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:31,960
I... I really thought you did something amazing.

451
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,060
I really thought I would die if I didn't have you!

452
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,200
Did I fail the test because I wanted to fail?!

453
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,140
Seriously, why are you being so annoying?

454
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,340
And why are you looking at someone's phone without permission?

455
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,660
  Make Seong Ho love me again.

456
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,410
  You'll have to pay with your voice.

457
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,330
 Seon Mi, this is your dream, right?

458
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:57,640
  Wasn't singing in front of the man you love the most precious thing to you?

459
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:03,350
  I fell for you when I heard you sing again.

460
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:08,230
  Where did the wrong decisions start?

461
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:12,150
 The moment that I wanted to be loved by someone?

462
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:18,380
 Or was it the moment I gave myself up for that?

463
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,320
The weather is nice today. Should we have some chicken with beer?

464
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,920
I have to leave soon. I have an appointment.

465
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,300
An appointment?

466
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,160
You have an appointment I don't know about? Jeong Jin who only has me as a friend?

467
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,780
You're the only one who has me as a friend.

468
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,820
Who are you meeting?

469
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,420
I won't let you go unless you're meeting a guy. I'm bored, play with me—

470
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,160
I am meeting a guy, actually.

471
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,400
What? A guy? Which guy?

472
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,930
Just. I'm just going to a movie with the part-time worker at our diner.

473
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:48,800
No way.

474
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,630
A part-timer makes me think of a warm-hearted toy boy.

475
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,530
Hey, hey. What do you mean by toy boy?

476
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,100
He doesn't look bad though.

477
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,000
It's Tom Kim.

478
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,220
 Your emotions truly are ...

479
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:06,360
 You flatter me.

480
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:15,110
 You must have a special view of love or an ideal partner type.

481
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:18,390
 People who are destined to fall in love will do so without making plans.

482
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:22,730
 I need to return the fountain pen.

483
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:27,270
 Is there a reason you became a writer?

484
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:30,310
 People keep their thoughts to themselves even though they have a lot to say.

485
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:32,910
 Can I borrow your phone please?

486
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:37,160
 I think I lost my phone. Thank you.

487
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,700
 I used to do that as well.

488
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,800
Why? Who is it?

489
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:46,710
What is it? Who is it?

490
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,290
 Hello?

491
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,170
 Ah, yes. I'm Tom Kim.

492
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:02,990
 We met in the elevator recently. Do you remember me?

493
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:09,220
Ah, yes. I have your fountain pen.

494
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,250
Oh. Thanks so much.

495
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:16,660
That fountain pen is really precious to me, so I called even though it may be rude.

496
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,200
Ah... I see.

497
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:23,690
 I'd like to treat you to a meal for returning my fountain pen.

498
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,870
A meal?

499
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,770
 Do you have time today?

500
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,940
 I think I did this in the past too.

501
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:37,880
 I should have held on to it tighter,

502
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,040
 but I let go

503
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,300
 on the day I decided to become a witch.

504
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,380
 Don't blame yourself too much.

505
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:51,330
 The more you hold on, the harder it becomes to leave.

506
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:55,230
 I probably wouldn't have been able to leave.

507
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,870
 Since it's only just begun.

508
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:04,260
 What if you can predict everything that's going to happen?

509
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,900
 Aren't people all like that?

510
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,580
Everything in life really depends on what you make of it.

511
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:17,550
 But if you can stop loving someone as you wish.

512
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:23,530
 If you can manage love as you wish, does that place you in heaven?

513
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,780
 Or hell?

514
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,730
♬  This crazy love  ♬

515
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:34,650
♬  Feels like I’m the only one  ♬

516
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:38,830
♬  Like a lie  ♬

517
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:43,310

518
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:47,070
♬  Even if you toss and turn  ♬

519
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:51,620
♬  On sleepless nights as tomorrow comes  ♬

520
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:57,760
♬  Everything is gonna be alright  ♬

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,760

522
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,700

♬  my whole life for love  ♬

523
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,980
 She can't avoid it because it's destined to happen.

524
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,960
 I'm merely checking it. What exactly it was I saw.

525
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,960
 You said I have an ability, right?

526
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,390
 Because I have made a wish, what do I need to give?

527
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:20,850
 I am so sorry. It's my fault, Mom.

528
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,520
 Doctor, please help me. Doctor!

529
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,560
 Isn't the payment too much?!

530
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,090
 Everything is flowing as it logically should.

531
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:30,540
 It's been over one week that Nuna Jin hasn't come.

532
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,230
 I shouldn't have met you from the start.

533
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,800
 Let's go back to the past, to our ordinary lives.

534
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,620
 An epilogue is next.

535
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:45,430
 Epilogue

536
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:58,900
 By chance, are you Bae Yun Gi?

537
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:09,230
 You're Bae Yun Gi, right?

538
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:24,110
