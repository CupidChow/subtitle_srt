 The Witch's

7
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,150
Since when was this diner here?

8
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,500
Is it closed?

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,590
The lights are off.

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,950
 The Witch's: Guide - Operating hours: sunset to sunrise. Menu: differs depending on the request. Price: insanely expensive so not everyone can eat here

11
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,810
It seems like this place failed.

12
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,590
What the?

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:00,950

14
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:11,180
 However, all wishes are possible. The result is guaranteed.

15
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,140
I... really...

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,580
lived diligently so that I could raise my two kids by myself

17
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,140
without them ever being jealous of others.

18
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,970
But

19
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,600
the business I'm running right now failed

20
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,690
and I wonder what to do with my kids.

21
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,530
A hyung I know told me about a good investment,

22
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,560
so I invested all my assets.

23
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,100
The pushover got taken. I was deceived.

24
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,150
I was betrayed.

25
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,340
I even withdrew our house deposit and invested it.

26
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,830
I'm about to be living on the streets.

27
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,370
I don't have anywhere to go either.

28
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,610
If I win the lottery... I can buy the foods my kids want

29
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,660
and buy them the things they want.

30
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,010
I can live like other people, hear that I'm a good father,

31
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,980
and live like a human being.

32
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,000
So the conclusion is

33
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,350
being the grand prize winner of the lottery.

34
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,760
This is foie gras.

35
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,720
Made from the ambition of humans.

36
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,570
Of course, there will be a cost that follows.

37
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,480
A cost?

38
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,930
That look in your eyes...

39
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,050
I like it.

40
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,340
If I eat this,

41
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,030
I really will win the lottery, right?

42
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,000
This is my first time having such delicious food.

43
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,180
 Yes, 37.

44
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,610
 The lucky fifth number is 37.

45
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,060
 I will draw the final number that you all are looking forward to.

46
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,030
 1, 6, 15, 36, 37...

47
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,680
 Yes, the final lucky number is 38.

48
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,570
 Congratulations!

49
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,230
I won!

50
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,480
I really won.

51
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,500
Ji Ah, I have an urgent matter to take care of. I'll be back. Watch your sister while I'm gone.

52
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,120
- Dad.
 - Dad.

53
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,520
I'll buy something delicious on my way back.

54
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,180
Hyung, tell that bastard who took my money to come to the house right away.

55
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,780
Yes! I'm going to have a go at him!

56
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,930
It's the lottery, you bastards. You're all done for.

57
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:29,760
I'll get the principal amount back and also take everything from the bastard who took my money.

58
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,830
What the—

59
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,330
What's happening?

60
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,190
 I like that look in your eyes.

61
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,150
My eyes. What's happening?

62
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,760
My eyes! My eyes!

63
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,390
 So is it the end for this diner?

64
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,570
Since he was the final customer?

65
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,580
You're going to go to that child now, right?

66
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,700
Will you be okay?

67
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,290
What will you do if I'm not okay?

68
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,690
  However, all wishes are possible.  The result is guaranteed.

69
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,370
Iced Americano...?

70
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,070
No, a hot one. Give me a hot one, please.

71
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,400
 We are forced to make choices at every moment.

72
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,780
Ah, this, this.

73
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,850
I told them to give this to me on the exact days.

74

 From the smallest things to the important ones.

76
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:30,750
 The choices that make us feel helpless... look at us and say, 
  Shoe Repairs and Polishing

77
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,690
 "Choose, right now."

78
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,620
 Because it's so natural, we don't pay attention to the fact

79
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,230
 that our lives are filled with constant insignificant or big choices.

80
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,590
- It is 1,700 won (~$1.70). 
 - Thank you.

81
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,050
Thank you, please come again.

83
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:01,980
 But as we live, some of the choices will shake up our lives.

84
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:11,860
 We couldn't know until those moments found us.

85
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,050
 For every choice in this world, there is a cost that follows.

86
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,690
 Until you meet that woman.

 The Witch's Diner 
Ep. 1 The Blood Red Steak of Revenge

88
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,930
But Miss Jin, what time is it right now?

89
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,310
You're late every day. Don't you ever get tired of being late?

90
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,210
That is ... I got off work at 4 AM yester—

91
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,090
Excuses! Excuses! I hate the people who make excuses the most.

92
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,950
Also, is it the first time you got off work at dawn?

93
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,080
Yesterday, I requested half the day off—

94
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,400
If everyone took off work when that happened, who'd work then?

95
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,880
Surely not me?

96
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,260
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,390
The saying that women are good at work is nonsense.

98
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,010
And what is this? Coffee?

99
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,710
These kinds of kids always pack their own food. Shrewd and meticulous.

100
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,710
 This is how it always is. Even if there are unions, even if there is a limit of working 52 hours a week,

101
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,550
 the immutable law never changes.

102
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,790
 I worked as an office worker for five years. I can't even take days off as I wish.

103
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,770
 I am forever the loser who is struggling to survive, just to receive a salary.

104
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,470
Cheers. Now, now, everyone have a drink.

105
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,360
Eat up.

106
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,630
In difficult times like these, there aren't many companies

107
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,270
that think of their employees' health and buy them meat.

108
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,190
Now, cheers!

109
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,190
Cheers!

110
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,750
I'm happy. Drink up!

111
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,630
 Bastard, just let us get off work.

112
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,420
 Why are we having a company dinner all of a sudden? I have to go pick up my kid.

113
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,730
Miss Jin, pass a round of so-maek. (T/N: A blend of soju and beer.)

114
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,790
Do it as if this were your family.

115
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,230
 One cannot get used to this social life no matter how hard one tries.

116
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,920
 Today, again, the loser still gets the so-maek ready wordlessly.

117
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,170
Cheers!

118
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,830
 That's right, let's hold it in. I worked tirelessly to get this job.

119
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,600
 Let's just let it go for once. Good luck to me!

120
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,130
♪ I don't know, I don't know, I don't know ♪

121
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,620
♪ I don't know, I don't know, I don't know ♪

122
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,650
Ah, that...

123
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,740
There...

124
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,550
Is it you this time, you bitch?!

125
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,390
Who is she doing it to?

126
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,810
Miss Jin, please try to understand.

127
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,040
I know you did not know this because you joined recently,

128
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,540
but this is an annual event with the president's wife.

129
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,670
I have no idea why she thinks anyone would be interested in her husband.

130
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,790
Exactly.

131
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,120
Have a drink and forget about this.

132
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,870
- Miss Jin, this is soju— 
 - Oh my god!

133
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,860
If you drink this, you are...

134
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,330
You are really going to die— Miss Jin, Miss Jin!

135
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,380
Well, not bad.

136
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,560
 Is my wish still far off?

137
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,400
Mom, where are you?

138
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,200
Mom is here!

139
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,010
You are late again?

140
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,710
Argh! This alcohol smell! You drank again!

141
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,970
Mom, I... I brought this to give to you.

142
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,090
This, this... for you.

143
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,580
Here, there are apples too.

144
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,300
What is all this?

145
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,760
This is not all.

146
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,000
Look here.

147
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,760
There is lettuce here.

148
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,070
A leaf of lettuce.

149
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,690
Here, please take this.

150
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:04,340
And this extra is for free.

151
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,600
Why did you drink so much?

152
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,310
You are not a person but an alcohol bottle.

153
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,250
This is what social life is about.

154
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,430
Drink and forget.

155
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,430
And once you are sober, you go back to work.

156
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,530
Isn't it so?

157
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,350
My gosh.

158
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,880
Are you sure something's not up?

159
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,350
What are you talking about?

160
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,360
This is all because you gave birth to an amazing daughter.

161
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,980
You should have made me less amazing.

162
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,120
You cannot find another character like me on earth.

163
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,980
I'm one of a kind. One of a kind.

164
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,990
Are you aware, Ms. Ae Sook?

165
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,460
My mom...

166
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,390
Attention, everyone. Take your seats.

167
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,020
Shall we greet everyone?

168
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,320
We have a new student in our class.

169
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,920
Hello, I am Lee Gil Yong. Hope to get along with you all.

170
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,370
He excels in sports. He is getting ready for a competition.

171
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,590
You can sit there.

172
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,610
Hey Yeong Je, it's been a long time.

173
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,360
Yeah.

174
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,280
I am super jealous. He can go to university even if he does not study.

175
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,040
What? I... I... Why me?

176
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,230
If I don't fire you, I am going to get kicked out of my home.

177
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,370
What can I do about it?

178
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,180
But, when it comes to work, I have done nothing wrong.

179
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,490
- What? 
 - Well, isn't the situation like that?

180
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:06,910
Your wife is the one at fault! Why am I—I the one getting fired?!

181
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,910
Then shall I fire my wife?

182
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,670
And you, I have been too lax— Argh! It's hot!

183
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,780
Are you going up against me?

184
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,970
So what if I am? You are going to fire me anyway!

185
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,110
Then you are not my boss anymore!

186
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,550
I may just report him to the labor union! Seriously.

187
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,960
There is a limit to unfair exercise of your power!

188
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,140
This gets more absurd as I think about it.

189
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,000
Right.

190
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,640
- Jin... 
 - Yeah?

191
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,690
I gave it a lot of thought...

192
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,040
What? Thought? What kind of thought?

193
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,440
Let's break up.

194
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,580
Why all of a sudden?

195
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,030
Let's not avoid it.

196
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,240
It's not that we're comfortable with each other, but that our love has grown cold.

197
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,660
You are also aware that dating someone for five years is a long time.

198
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,900
What am I supposed to know?

199
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,410
I am sorry. I am going to leave first.

200
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,760
♫  Why do these things  ♫

201
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,530
♫  like a lie  ♫

202
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,020
 My relationship ended.

203
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,720
 It did not even take five minutes for my five-year relationship to end.

204
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,350
 Everything happened all at once, just like in a dream.

205
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:38,180
 People say that it's not over until the fat lady sings,

206
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,960
 but sometimes she sings early.

207
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,030
Sensation. Condensation.

208
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,430
What are you doing?

209
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:07,450
Huh? Oh. The butterfly is stuck in a spiderweb.

210
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,180
It's done.

211
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,500
Then what should the spider eat to survive?

212
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,820
Huh?

213
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,900
Oh.

214
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,760
But, do you know me?

215
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,840
You're famous, aren't you?

216
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,380
You were one of the runners in last year's race that people were looking forward to.

217
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,130
Gil Yong, fix your pace!

218
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,900
Pace! Pace!

219
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,020
The newspaper said that you quit running because you got hurt during a race.

220
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,040
Did you come back to school because the coach said so?

221
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,500
But, Is your leg okay now?

222
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,200
What should we go eat?

223
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,670
- I'm leaving. 
 - Huh? O-okay.

224
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,000
That jerk really gets on my nerves.

225
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,010
Hey! Did you really just let him off the hook?

226
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,140
I mean... What should I do then?

227
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,700
He wanted to break up. He said we're done. Should I have held onto him then?

228
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,220
Fine! Then forget that son of a bitch and start fresh.

229
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,240
Look. Tomorrow's fortune.

230
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,490
Your temper really.

231
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,540
- Hey, Yoon Mi. 
 - Hm?

232
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,620
"Stay out of harm's way."

233
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,810
"Be steady.  A hopeful tomorrow is starting."

234
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,100
I was fired, my love life is over, I'm destined to be an unemployed homebody.

235
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,310
It's a good fortune, so think of it in a positive way.

236
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,670
"Surrounded by enemies on all sides."

237
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:51,530
"Meddling in little things could result in great wrath..." Oh my.

238
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,000
Should I skip work tomorrow?

239
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,560
You must be full.

240
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,340
Is that what you should be saying in front of someone who is unemployed? As a teacher with a lifetime pension?

241
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,240
Jin, you don't know how scary kids these days are, right?

242
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,760
Kids think teachers are pieces of shit!

243
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,570
Mister, we'll have one more serving of chicken feet!

244
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,180
- Let's drink. 
 - Drink.

245
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,810
Yeong Jae.

246
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,100
Wait... your face. Who did this to you?

247
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,460
Hyung.

248
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,780
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

249
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,580
It'll only be trouble for you if you pretended to understand.

250
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,770
You put in a lot of effort for your comeback.

251
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,870
Welcome.

252
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,090
That'll be ₩1,000 (~$1).

253
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,290
Here.

254
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,880
- Sorry. 
 - Excuse me.

255
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,420
Excuse me. Your card. Your card!

256
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,450
Your card.

257
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,900
What card?

258
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,220
Are you okay?

259
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,790
I'm okay.

260
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,430
You don't look okay though.

261
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,600
It worries me more because you said you're okay.

262
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,550
I'm late again.

263
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,160
Need to hurry to work.

264
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,740
Jin! Stand right there.

265
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,990
Wh-Why?

266
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,970
So what have you been doing every day?

267
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:38,440
Well... I've been going to the library or the cafe.

268
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,480
But Mom, how did you know?

269
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,090
Hey, my drunkard daughter suddenly comes home on time. How could I not know?

270
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:52,270
Don't worry too much. I'll find a job immediately. Yeah.

271
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:57,120
Take your time. And don't get harassed working for a weird company again.

272
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,090
Mom...

273
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,440
I'll take care of you.

274
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,020
Let's take this opportunity to open up a restaurant.

275
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,020
You know Aunt Gyeong Hui, right?

276
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,710
The owner of the fermented bean paste soup restaurant that I worked at.

277
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:13,940
She's planning on stopping and suggested I take over.

278
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,170
She'll leave this place to us?

279
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,720
She's going to leave the chef and the equipment so

280
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,920
if we take out a loan and use our savings and your severance package, it should be enough.

281
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,090
Including our savings? Mom, you said that's our emergency fund.

282
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,360
It's an emergency now.

283
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,620
Let's go in.

284
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,230
 CJS Broadcast 7 o'clock My Hometown Episode 327 Real Foodie Restaurant

285
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,520
You must've waited a long time.

286
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,460
- Please have some water. 
 - Oh dear.

287
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,520
Jin is all grown up.

288
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,270
You just need to get married now.

289
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,340
Unni, you talked about handing over your restaurant before.

290
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,440
That's right. Have you thought about it?

291
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,610
I want to try doing it before it's too late.

292
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,980
I'm not sure I can do well though.

293
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:13,050
You came to the right decision. And nobody manages a restaurant when they're born.

294
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:17,670
You got a nice deal at ₩ 300 million for the deposit.

295
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,710
As for the deposit, when you want to pass on the restaurant later,

296
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,830
it's just money you'll get back. You know that, right?

297
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,130
We don't need to waste the commission fee between us, there's nothing to put in.

298
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:34,090
You can just give the money on this day.

299
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:37,510
Oh my, Jin just lucked into becoming a boss too.

300
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,130
 Commercial Building Lease Agreement

301
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,850
Gi Yong, this is really your last chance.

302
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,450
Got it.

303
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,690
Okay, let's go!

304
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,220
Ready!

305
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,200
Go!

306
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,730
You're here? Have you had dinner?

307
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,170
Yes. I ate it already.

308
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,990
Did you explain everything to your coach?

309
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:45,360
He told me to participate in the next national competition.

310
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,500
Good job.

311
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,950
Oh right, I found a house.

312
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,800
We can move next week.

313
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,700
Ah, that's a relief.

314
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,680
You don't have to worry about me anymore.

315
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,920
Mom's wish... I'll definitely go to college.

316
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,570
Enjoy your meal.

317
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,500
- Excuse me! 
 - Yes?

318
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,320
Two soups, please.

319
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,970
Mom, two soups.

320
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,680
Excuse me?

321
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,670
Give us two more side dishes.

322
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,620
I'll pay!

323
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,580
Two soups for ₩16,000.

324
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,520
I'll pay for coffee.

325
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,660
Please sit inside.

326
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,200
Welcome!

327
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,270
- Excuse me,  boss. 
 - Yes?

328
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,220
Can I take a few days off?

329
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,120
I have some things to take care of at home.

330
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,810
Oh dear...

331
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:01,880
If it's urgent, what can you do? You should go.

332
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,800
I'm sorry.

333
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,720
Good work today.

334
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,830
Kids, your midterms are next week.

335
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,070
Let's work hard.

336
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,440
Okay!

337
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,430
Ah, I'm getting stressed.

338
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,600
Is there anything interesting?

339
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:44,640
You said you don't eat breakfast. Your friends are worried and brought this, so eat.

340
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,810
I'm fine though.

341
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,640
- "I'm fine." 
 - Eat!

342
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,610
"I'm fine though."

343
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,930
Ah, fuck. Hey.

344
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,460
Hey.

345
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:06,540
A song that is older than 1,300 years and still exists now...

346
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,940
what do you think that means?

347
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:14,040
It must mean that it has been in the hearts of people for that long as well.

348
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,250
Jeongeupsa is the only Baekje song that remains to this day.

349
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,490
It's the oldest song ever written in our language—

350
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,560
Hey, Choi Yeong Jae, where do you think you're going during class?

351
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,820
Just a bit—

352
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,210
Teacher! Yeong Jae says he needs to go to the restroom.

353
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,020
Yeong Jae, what's wrong? Are you sick?

354
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,720
I just need to go to the restroom—

355
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,900
Hey dumbass, it's class now. Go back.

356
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,380
So gross!

357
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,510
Yeong Jae, just go to the restroom; I'll clean it up.

358
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,890
Hey.

359
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,500
Wear this.

360
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,710
Hurry.

361
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,560
You're not doing track and field anymore?

362
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,410
It was fun when we competed together in middle school.

363
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:45,580
Only talented people like you can do sports.

364
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,260
I'm not good enough to go to college with sports.

365
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,490
That's why I stopped in my third year of middle school.

366
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,040
I'm home.

367
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,890
Come in.

368
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,190
Yeong Jae, are you home?

369
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,680
Hello.

370
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,920
Oh, aren't you Gil Yong?

371
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,070
It's been a long time.

372
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,220
Let me get you some food.

373
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,520
No, it's okay!

374
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,350
Don't worry. I'll take care of dinner myself.

375
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,510
Mom, go and rest.

376
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,670
Did you take your medicine?

377
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,210
 Mom! What's wrong, Mom?

378
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,450
 Excuse me! Please call a doctor!

379
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,100
 Excuse me! Mom!

380
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,430
 Mom. Mom. Mom.

381
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,180
I told you to turn on the heat.

382
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,880
Eat.

383
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,480
Okay.

384
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,880
Your mom must be really sick.

385
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,120
Actually, my mom also—

386
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,680
Hyung... my mom only has a cold.

387
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,250
What?

388
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,470
Hurry and eat.

389
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,460
Oh, your mom was coughing quite a lot for a cold.

390
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,090
Is the ramen good?

391
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,280
Yeah, but you put in too much water.

392
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,660
That's why I added more soup base.

393
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,300
Not just anyone can earn money.

394
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,960
It's so tiring because of all the customers.

395
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,770
Exactly.

396
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:45,710
By the way, if the chef is on break, what should we do in the meantime?

397
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:49,800
If you don't have teeth, then use your gums. I've learned everything from time to time.

398
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,910
At the worst, it'll only be a couple of weeks. It should be fine, right?

399
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,810
Should be.

400
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,150
Hello?

401
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:04,050
I'm Jung Han Yeong's wife.

402
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,980
A nursing home?

403
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:22,030
What would happen if I made one more wish?

404
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:25,850
You'd probably disappear without a trace.

405
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,200
Since that's part of the deal.

406
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,350
Thank you.

407
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,700
Please come again!

408
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,820
Please come again.

409
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,620
Thank you!

410
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:57,110
Wow, how can the customers stop coming as soon as the chef goes on vacation?

411
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:01,380
Can they only live off of cheonggukjang? They'll come when it's time.

412
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,090
Is it not good?

413
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,080
I think it's fine.

414
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,000
It's fine.

415
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,260
They'll come, right?

416
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,500
I think mine tastes better.

417
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:28,120
 People are full of wishes.

418
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,780
 There are a lot of people who wish for revenge too.

419
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:40,720
 I can't give you both. Red or blue.

420
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,860
 You pick.

421
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,470
 Jin!

422
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,510
 Jin!

423
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,840
 Jin!

424
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:01,790
What to do? What should we do?

425
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,220
  (Former) Jinmi Restaurant New Location Open 
 Chammat Restaurant

426
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,860
Wait, what is this? 
   (Former) Jinmi Restaurant New Location Open 
 Chammat Restaurant

427
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,600
Jin!

428
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,420
Jin.

429
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,270
Unni, what are you doing here?

430
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,180
What's up with the sign outside?!

431
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,770
We have guests. Why are you disrespectfully talking so loudly?

432
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:35,620
Hey lady, you took ₩300 million from us to leave us your restaurant.

433
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,230
How can you open the exact same one right in front of us?

434
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,520
Did you not check when you signed the contract?

435
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,920
You didn't specify that I couldn't start the same kind of business again.

436
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,070
That's because my mom trusted you—

437
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:52,140
Look at this kid. Did I ever beg on my knees for you to trust me?

438
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,230
Boss, can I use the restroom—

439
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,600
You stole the chef too.

440
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,620
Mister! You said you were going on vacation!

441
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,700
My stomach...

442
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,640
Unni, what... what is all of this?

443
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,380
Unni, how can you treat me like this?

444
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,800
Ae Suk, this store is under my younger sister.

445
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,050
Can you leave so you're not in the way of someone else's business?

446
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,130
You're the dumb one for trusting a stranger.

447
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,010
- Unni. 
 - Let go! 
 - Mom!

448
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,610
Call the police to come get rid of these people!

449
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:30,390
- "Call the police?" Ajumma, is this all you have to say?! 
 - Please leave.

450
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,350
They really have no decency, those insects.

451
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,110
Jin!

452
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,150
Hey, wait!

453
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,650
 To be honest, it was hard so I got a little carried away.

454
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,530
 I thought my mom and I finally got lucky.

455
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,290
 And that it would be fine if we just hung on a bit more.

456
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:50,120
 But there's no way the world would go easy on us.

457
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,390
 Hyung, help me. It's urgent.

458
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,830
 I'll wait for you at Jeil Junkyard.

459
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,560
Yeong Jae!

460
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,800
 The customer cannot answer the phone so your call will be sent to voicemail.

461
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,160
Hello? Yeong Jae, where are you?

462
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,250
He really is your best friend. He came so fast.

463
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,040
Let's go.

464
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,190
Hey. You two fight it out.

465
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,890
Then I'll acknowledge your fighting spirit.

466
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,920
Let's go.

467
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,740
 Gil Yong, this is really your last chance.

468
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,970
 Don't get in trouble and take care of your body.

469
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,520
Is this fun for you guys?

470
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,490
Ah, shit. Hey!

471
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:38,060
Do it properly. You're really getting on my nerves, you little shit.

472
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,400
Is this fun?! Huh?

473
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,200
Yeah. It's freaking fun.

474
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,480
It's the cops. Let's go!

475
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,040
Hey, students! Get them!

476
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,500
Disturbing the business?

477
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,000
I told you they wronged us first.

478
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,910
We are the victims of a scam!

479
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,640
You can resolve that through civil court.

480
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,800
That lady lied to us and we lost all our assets now!

481
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,740
Excuse me, miss. Under the current law, if you make a fuss like that in someone's place of business...

482
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,590
A fuss? A fuss?

483
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:37,060
Mister, do you know how I feel right now?!

484
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,790
Okay, I understand, so your name.

485
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,790
- Officer Jang. 
 - My name is Jeong Jin.

486
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,820
Wait a minute.

487
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,930
Aren't you going to say anything?

488
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,560
They were going to fight and we were trying to stop them.

489
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,190
Is that right?

490
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,310
That's correct.

491
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,030
The IDs have come through.

492
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,380
We got word from the top to let these three go.

493
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:23,520
You two and you, go first.

494
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,760
Why did you fight?

495
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,910
As expected, if you look at kids who get into fights, their parents...

496
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:50,220
their family environment is always like this.

497
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,170
Mister!

498
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,820
Hey, Miss...

499
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:57,700
Why are you talking about their family environment for no reason?

500
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,060
Isn't that discrimination?

501
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,460
Miss, it's none of your business so—

502
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,780
You are making it my business now.

503
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,750
You can tell from their scratched up faces

504
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:10,370
that these two are the victims and the ones who left are the perpetrators.

505
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,340
 I'm fine.

506
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,540
You two, is it true you fought?

507
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:28,410
If we fought due to a misunderstanding, we can make up and leave, right?

508
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:32,320
If you come to an agreement, we can do that for now.

509
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,200
Yeong Jae, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

510
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,700
Miss, we are not done with your case yet.

511
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:51,510
  Inju Police Station

512
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,510
Oh, Ex-excuse me!

513
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,240
Thank you for helping us.

514
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,950
Is he your friend?

515
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,860
Yeah.

516
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,160
It's because of him, right?

517
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,890
Adults always say this, don't they? "Grow up nice. Be a nice person."

518
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,010
But don't live as a nice person.

519
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:26,400
It'll be hard, and you'll be the fool.

520
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,060
The world is a cruel place.

521
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,110
Even if you make sacrifices for others,

522
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,680
you'll only get crap for it in return.

523
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:39,940
But still... you know how to stand up for your friend.

524
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:45,320
You did a good job today.

525
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,390
You should know how to be considerate for your friend at this age.

526
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:50,250
You're nice.

527
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:54,740
But you just told me not to be nice.

528
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,940
Oh yeah, that's right.

529
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,720
Don't be nice, or you'll be stabbed in the back.

530
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,300
I'm leaving.

531
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,420
 Law Office

532
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:24,430
Yoon Mi, I met with the lawyer,

533
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:28,620
but he has no solutions. I have to settle for a civil lawsuit.

534
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,530
But that takes time.

535
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:33,700
And I don't know how long the lawsuit will take.

536
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:37,840
He's also said a win is not guaranteed.

537
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,960
 And the retainer fees are no joke.

538
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:53,060
 For Rent. Call: 010-0569-5467

539
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,000
Ah, the skin is completely scraped off.

540
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:13,110
Hi, Mom.

541
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,810
 The nursing home called again.

542
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:19,310
 They said your dad is really sick. I think I have to go.

543
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:21,230
But why do you have to go there?

544
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,220
There's nothing worth seeing there.

545
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,450
But it's your dad. How can I not go?

546
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,580
 He had a stroke and has dementia.

547
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:33,450
I'll be back quickly. Don't worry.

548
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:36,880
By the way, what should we do with the restaurant?

549
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,370
I'll take care of it.

550
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:43,300
Okay, got it.

551
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,710
W-Wait.

552
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,880
You startled me!

553
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:05,480
But we've closed for the day.

554
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,400
I know. This place went under, right?

555
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,880
You're putting it up for sale, right?

556
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,150
Are you not leaving this restaurant?

557
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,910
Who are you?

558
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,610
But it's okay, I guess.

559
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,870
I'll take over for you.

560
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,400
You must have come to see the shop, right?

561
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,860
Take a seat.

562
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,750
The premium is a little high though.

563
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:32,380
It's hard to even pay rent right now, isn't it?

564
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:37,550
If you leave this place to me, the rent won't be a problem.

565
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:41,860
In return, I'll grant you a wish.

566
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:46,290
What? A wish?

567
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,200
Who are you?

568
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,190
Me? A witch.

569
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,300
 I will grant you any wish.

570
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,340
A w-witch?

571
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,720
Like the one in The Little Mermaid and Frozen?

572
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:12,820
Here in Korea in 2021? Ugh. My head.

573
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,000
Excuse me. Please leave now.

574
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,300
Wh-What is this?

575
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,370
There are things that you can't see but still exist in this world.

576
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:34,120
There are also things that can be seen but are thought to be non-existent.

577
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,890
This... How did you do th-this?

578
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:41,140
What you're seeing isn't reality. It's information.

579
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,190
Information that your eyes send to your brain.

580
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:57,910
We exist in that gap between.

581
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:02,250
The place where you look but can't see.

582
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:12,330
People can't hear the sound of your heart beating, right? It's like that.

583
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:19,530
I make magical dishes that can grant wishes.

584
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:21,360
The method is simple.

585
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,160
If you eat the food I make, your wishes come true. Simple, isn't it?

586
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:33,220
So you're saying that if I eat the food you make, my wish comes true?

587
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:38,740
Exactly. You've lived an upright life so far, right?

588
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,500
I'm giving you an opportunity.

589
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:50,920
An opportunity to realize that you weren't good but pathetically weak all along.

590
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:56,630
A chance to unleash what you've been holding back this whole time.

591
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:02,380
What are you talking about?

592
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,710
I'll grant you a wish. You have nothing to lose, right?

593
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:09,000
If your wish comes true, leave me this restaurant.

594
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,730
If it doesn't...

595
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,470
Just like you're already doing, you can keep this bankrupt restaurant.

596
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:19,250
Forever.

597
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,840
If you're not interested, I'll leave.

598
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,740
Wait!

599
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:42,400
Will you grant any wish?

600
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:47,700
Sure. Any wish you want.

601
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,870
I...

602
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:52,070
  Didn't you check the contract before you signed it?

603
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:54,780
 You didn't specify that I couldn't set up the same business somewhere else!

604
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,960
 - Unni. 
 - Let go!

605
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,160
 - Mom! 
 - Call the police to come get rid of these people!

606
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,260
 They really have no sense of decency. Those insects.

607
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:10,380
I want... revenge.

608
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:13,070
Revenge.

609
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,730
I'll grant it.

610
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,740
That wish.

611
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,900
Now, do we have an agreement?

612
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,970
  Party 1: Jo Hui Ra 
 Party 2: Jeong Jin

613
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:36,280
I thought you'd wish for something like winning the lottery.

614
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,450
What is this?

615
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:42,270
If you eat this steak, your wish will definitely come true.

616
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:48,160
But... there will be a cost.

617
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,310
Since nothing comes for free in the world.

618
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:31,210
Wait.

619
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,200
Just as words have power, so do thoughts.

620
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:42,320
Think of the person you want to exact vengeance on while you chew it to tiny pieces.

621
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,590
Since you can't go back after you have finished eating.

624
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,580
What was that?
