 We'll chase away your nightmares.

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,080
 As long as it doesn't have monsters.

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,460
 I'm having nightmares often these days, so I absolutely hate those even more.

♬  Spoke when it was honest  ♬

11
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,610
How much is this, ma'am?

12
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,420
♬  Then broken the same  ♬

13
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,050
Hi, Noona.

14
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,470
Did you already go out?

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,820
- No, not yet. 
 - That's good.

16
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,520
Some urgent work came up,

17
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,100
 so how about we watch the movie next time?

18
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,900
Oh really?  It's okay, Noona. Work comes first.

19
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,500
Okay. I'll buy you a tasty meal next time. I'm really sorry.

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,300
No, it's really okay. Okay.

21
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,120
 That fountain pen is actually very important to me so...

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,660
 Today I—

23
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,980
 Right, I will just confirm

24
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,610
if what I saw was real.

 EP. 05 Yeonbunmali noodles that tie bonds. 
 (TN: Yeonbunmali – year-end festive noodle dish.)

26
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,090
Here's your food.

27
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,760
Bon Appetit.

28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,640
This isn't even your open time, but you opened the shop for us. Thank you very much.

29
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,710
Of course I should, considering the person who asked me.

30
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,750
A gift for Min Ju.

31
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,370
Thanks, and why do you give her something every time you come?

32
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,420
I'm envious.

33
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,470
You can also just get married.

34
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,130
This guy suddenly desperately asked me a favor.

35
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,950
I wondered why he was doing that.

36
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,440
I think I did well by opening up early.

37
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,070
Bon Appetit.

38
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,800
- Thank you for the food, Hyung. 
 - Sure thing.

39
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,880
Eat up.

40
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,050
- Yes. Thank you for the food. 
 - Of course.

41
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,210
Are you uncomfortable?

42
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,440
What? Oh, no.

43
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,000
No, I'm alright.

44
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,330
Shall we take a break before continuing?

45
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,180
Sure.

46
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,330
Here.

47
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,290
Thank you.

48
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,420
Ah, right. We met so that I could return the fountain pen, but I almost forgot about it.

49
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,600
Thank you.

50
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,610
You were uncomfortable because I asked to meet out of the blue, right?

51
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,140
No. I had to return this to you anyway. Returning it soon is better.

52
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,950
Here.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,860
This might seem unusual, but I always carry this pen wherever I go.

54
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,120
Like a talisman.

55
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,630
Oh. Yes.

56
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,120
Since you're a writer, a pen might be precious.

57
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,590
I didn't think it was unusual.

58
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,100
Rather than that,

59
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,730
- my mother gave it to me as a gift. 
 - Oh.

60
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,250
My mother raised me alone with great difficulty.

61
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,750
I couldn't even dream of being a writer.

62
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,210
There wasn't a job I wouldn't do to make money.

63
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,240
One day, my mother gifted me this pen.

64
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,360
She told me to do what I wanted to.

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,340
 You can get a job slowly. I'll be responsible for you.

66
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,550
So I poured my life into this work.

67
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,570
I wanted to be filial to her once I was doing well.

68
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,380
But she didn't wait for me.

69
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,430
Oh, sorry. I talked too much about myself.

70
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,790
Your mother would be proud of you.

71
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,100
Because you have become such a famous writer.

72
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:33,400
I actually gathered up my courage.

73
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,050
What?

74
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,400
I wanted to see you, Jin

75
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,210
It might seem like an excuse but I think that your taking this pen

76
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,190
felt like destiny to me.

77
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,610
 If you are fated to meet, even if you don't force it,

78
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,780
 you will meet.

79
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,420
Here is my house.

80
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,550
I had fun today. Thank you.

81
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,980
Yes, thank you too.

82
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,580
- I'll call you. 
 - Sure.

83
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,220
 It is inevitable,

84
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,010
 because it is a pre-determined sequence of events.

85
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,900
There could be a solution that's good for everyone—

86
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,970
There is no such solution that's good for everyone.

87
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,370
Hello.

88
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,980
Today is a day off.

89
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,440
I just came.

90
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,920
Noona Jin didn't come, right?

91
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,150
Hi, part-timer student.

92
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,820
Could you talk to me for a moment?

93
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,250
You should have a drink too.

94
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,440
I'm still a student.

95
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,580
You are twenty years old.

96
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,760
I actually made plans to watch a movie with Noona Jin.

97
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,850
So you got stood up.

98
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,520
You can't get used to it no matter how many times it happens.

99
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,000
You will need practice.

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,150
Practice getting hurt and practice being numb to it.

101
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:41,500
All I hoped for was to eat together and watch movies. That was all.

102
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,940
Don't be too greedy.

103
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,400
The more you desire her, the harder it gets.

104
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,890
It's as dark as midnight here.

105
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,960
Aigoo, you rotten, lazy boy!

106
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,030
Get up. Get up! Oh my goodness.

107
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,100
You are fifty years old now, but

108
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,880
you still can't take off your socks properly.

109
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,080
What now? What happened this time to make you so foul-tempered?

110
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,020
Have I ever nagged you to get married or make food for me?

111
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,990
All I want you to do is live like a human being. Is that too greedy?

112
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,800
Oh my goodness, my mother's vocal cords are healthy.

113
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,960
Where are you going when your mother is talking?

114
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,350
I'm so frustrated.

115
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,190
Father.

116
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,080
Do you think you will be unhappy if I don't go to college?

117
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:00,090
I would just worry.

118
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,800
"What if he has it as hard as me?"

119
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,180
I would want you to be happy just as others are.

120
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,200
Did you drop out of track and field?

121
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,780
Sorry. I was going to tell you.

122
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:27,350
I got confused if I was doing it because I liked it or because that was all I could do.

123
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,990
If you were the one who decided it, then I'm okay.

124
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,850
There is no answer to life.

125
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,130
You don't have to live up to our expectations.

126
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,790
I think that your decision is the most important.

127
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,510
Let's eat quickly.

128
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,150
Yes.

129
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,450
 I actually gathered up my courage.

130
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,610
 I wanted to see you, Jin.

131
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,090
- Hi, Yun Mi. 
 - So what did you guys do when you met?

132
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,680
 Just... What's there to talk about?

133
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,330
What? You're making me more curious.

134
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:28,200
Tom Kim... our lifestyle is quite different from his, no?

135
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,940
That's right. He's half celebrity and he's older too.

136
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,750
But... I think we're quite similar too.

137
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,590
He's surprisingly average and modest.

138
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,460
Eh? What are you saying?

139
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,190
Is he the same or is he different?

140
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,760
He was raised by a single mother and suffered a lot too.

141
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,680
But he talks about it as if it were nothing.

142
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,330
 What's this, Jeong Jin? You've already fallen for him?

143
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,370
Hey! Hey, I'll call you later, okay?

144
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,510
Hello.

145
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,000
 Did you sleep well? What are you doing today?

146
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,150
I'm just going to work today.

147
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,120
Hyung, did you hand in a resignation letter?

148
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,310
Yes.

149
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,960
Honestly, it was hard to keep up with class while doing sports.

150
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,000
Slowly, slowly, I'm going to start again from the basics.

151
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,850
Call me.

152
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,960
That's right.

153
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,770
Okay.

154
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,750
Don't work too hard.

155
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,490
What did you say?

156
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,250
You act tough in front of the kids because you feel uneasy, right?

157
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,610
I find you a bit pitiful.

158
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:09,630
Right now, even though you're doing great, it still feels like you are being chased.

159
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,190
Oh, and stop eating that candy.

160
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,270
Your teeth will rot.

161
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,580
Lee Gil Yong.

162
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,410
Huh?

163
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,700
I heard. You're running away?

164
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,250
As if! I'm about to challenge myself.

165
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,790
In the past, because people had expectations,

166
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,800
because it was my parents' wish, I did run away.

167
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,190
But now, I want to prove it to myself and become a better person.

168
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,450
I will take the GED exam and go to college too.

169
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,780
In this world, there is not only one correct answer.

170
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,890
Why?

171
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,350
Oh, it's just...

172
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,630
You're irritating.

173
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,410
I'll call you.

174
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,280
 GED Exam

175
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,540
Oh, Gil Yong! Are these yours? GED?

176
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,610
Yes, I quit school.

177
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,530
What? Really?

178
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,070
Are you okay?

179
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,410
I'm okay.

180
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:39,160
From now, I'll think about the type of adult I want to become.

181
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,520
Oh, that's right. I'm really sorry about suddenly canceling our movie plans.

182
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,950
We can just watch one next time.

183
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,960
You're going to bring that out, right? I'll do it.

184
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,830
No, it's fine.

185
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,420
No. I'll do it.

186
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,390
Did something good happen? She's in a good mood.

187
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,360
Ah, when do I give her the gift?

188
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,580
You must be idle these days. We meet quite often.

189
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:23,170
Moments when you can feel the time flow, it's very new.

190
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,500
How does it feel to watch?

191
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,630
I think it was logical.

192
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,080
It is going to go away anyway.

193
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,910
So that logic dragged me to this point then?

194
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,200
I'm sick and tired of it.

195
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,830
That's why... you should start following reason now.

196
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,600
The end result is obvious.

197
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,940
Must I... must I watch you die?

198
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,070
If I die, are you going to leave me a flower or what?

199
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,960
Sorry, but I'll decline in advance.

200
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,730
 The Witch's Diner

201
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,680
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

202
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,260
Is the owner inside?

203
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,580
I steamed this and brought it right away for you all.

204
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,570
It will be really delicious.

205
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,800
- Thank you. 
 - Yes.

206
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,290
- How does it taste? 
 - Yum!

207
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,380
It's really good and smells nice too!

208
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,360
It's all thanks to my son.

209
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,400
These days, my son... what's that... cli-cli...

210
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,610
That thing, you know? Where you climb the wall.

211
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,050
- Ah, climbing? 
- Yeah, that!

212
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,220
Right, that. He's been into that recently.

213
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,660
He goes every day and picks up all the good things around the world.

214
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,840
However, how old are you this year, young lady?

215
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,040
I'm 28 years.

216
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,680
Ah, what a good time.

217
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,990
It's the perfect age to get married.

218
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,190
But are you seeing anyone now?

219
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,880
Why?

220
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,880
My son is still a bachelor.

221
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,750
Really a bachelor!

222
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,200
I wish my son would get married soon.

223
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,090
Here, take a look.

224
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:42,350
My son's visuals resemble me, so he's very handsome.

225
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,870
In the past, he would be considered a real looker.

226
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,850
Welcome.

227
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,530
As a shop owner, he's kind and so well-behaved,

228
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,980
just like a presidential commendation type.

229
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,750
On top of that, he's unbelievably good at organizing.

230
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,710
Imagine how well he will treat his wife when he gets married.

231
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:11,670
But my son has only one flaw.

232
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,370
He's 50 years old.

233
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,850
However age doesn't matter these days, right?

234
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,220
Am I right?

235
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:26,230
But... I'm seeing someone.

236
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,530
Oh really? I see.

237
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,780
Aigoo, then I spoke a lot of nonsense.

238
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,420
When you become this old, you have no sense. None at all.

239
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,410
It's about time I leave now.

240
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,900
No, no, no, no need to see me out.

241
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,310
- Go back safety. 
 - Bye.

242
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,970
Goodbye.

243
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,730
She reminds me of my grandmother who passed away.

244
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,850
- By the way, Noona... 
 - Yeah?

245
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:02,530
- Are you see— 
 - What are you doing over there?

246
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,830
The old landlady stopped by briefly.

247
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,940
 Notice

248
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,630
Grandma, did you come to make a wish?

249
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:29,000
 Any wish is possible.  The effect is certain.

250
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,590
That grandma earlier was interested in Noona.

251
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,520
Would her son's marriage be her wish?

252
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,560
But still, that's...

253
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,430
But there is nothing wrong with it either.

254
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,730
Still, that ahjussi and Noona are not right for each other. Their age difference is too much.

255
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,030
What does love have to do with the age difference?

256
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,260
That's right. It doesn't matter.

257
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:02,520
But Noona said she is seeing someone else.

258
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,010
So that's where the problem lies.

259
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,550
Witch, try these rice cakes out.

260
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,120
That grandma brought it.

261
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,850
Rice-cake? I don't really like those.

262
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,550
They were handmade so I found them very tasty. Just try them.

263
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,350
Before, my mother...

264
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,290
Never mind, I won't eat it.

265
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,900
You also had a mother?

266
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,870
Who in the world doesn't have a mother?

267
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,860
Madam Witch, then was your mother a witch too?

268
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,030
I heard that superpowers and things like that can be inherited too.

269
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,140
Well, it's not exactly that.

270
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:45,370
Then, how did you know you have a witch's blood in you?

271
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,840
There is a moment when you realize it.

272
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,320
Misfortune that could not have been a coincidence comes to find you.

273
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,740
 Revenge! I want it.

274
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,750
 Revenge.

275
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,280
 Every night, Ahjumma Gyeong Hui comes in my dreams.

276
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,820
 A few days ago,

277
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,260
 I saw the future of a girl who was just passing by.

278
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,080
 That day when Yun Gi came,

279
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,920
 I saw his memories.

280
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,030
 Did you perhaps  do something to me?

281
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:32,340
 That is your ability, not something I did.

282
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,130
Um... Madam Witch?

283
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,260
Yes?

284
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:47,000
You told me before that I have an ability, right?

285
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,600
That's right.

286
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:58,090
Then, is it related to what you said just now?

287
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:06,320
So... it's not like I've become a witch or anything, right?

288
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,560
You don't become a witch because you were ordered to become one.

289
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,720
It's something you have to choose.

290
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,310
Then, what if I don't choose to do it?

291
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,610
So what you're saying is, it's something I have to decide on, right?

292
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,550
That's right. Regardless of your abilities,

293
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:30,870
it is all up to you to choose how far you'll go.

294
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,770
 It depends on my decision?

295
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,650
Hello?

296
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:58,180
I just finished recording. Where are you?

297
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,750
I am on my way home.

298
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,420
 Did you have dinner?

299
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,510
 Shall I go pick you up?

300
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,720
Instead of dinner,

301
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,390
I have somewhere that I want to go to.

302
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,200
Thanks to you, I found a nice place.

303
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,190
♬  This crazy love  ♬

304
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,600
But why did you suddenly want to come here?

305
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,350
I feel like my mind clears up when I come here,

306
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,120
so I visited on occasion.

307
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,150
Did something happen?

308
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,470
♬  Oh won’t you hold my hand  ♬

309
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:40,000
I think... I was a bit naive in the past.

310
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,010
But nowadays, I don't know.

311
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,830
Every day, I'm suffocating and anxious.

312
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,920
You don't know where you are and what you are doing?

313
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,270
♬  I’ve been waiting  ♬

314
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:00,990
Are there times like that for you too?

315
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,910
Why? Did you think I wouldn't?

316
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,880
No. It's not like that.

317
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,290
♬  Sometimes it’s heavy  ♬

318
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,950
At times like these, you just have to trust yourself.

319
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,960
Because your anxiety won't leave you

320
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,020
even if you say you did your best for this decision.

321
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,390
♬  It's just another day  ♬

322
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,550
If something like today happens again,

323
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,970
call me then. It will be better than being alone.

324
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,140
♬  Someone tell me  ♬

325
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,210
You too.

326
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:46,010
♬  I’m holding on holding on for you  ♬

327
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,990
Your hair.

328
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,860
Can you just slap me once?

329
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,040
I'm getting married.

330
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,300
How could such a miracle happen to me?

331
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:25,570
Your appearing in front of me that day was also a miracle for me.

332
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,790
There was a price for my wish at that restaurant.

333
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,360
Restaurant wish?

334
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,830
Hey, look at me. What did you say just now?

335
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,680
Witch's Diner.

336
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:52,720
Is it the place with a handsome student and a young owner?

337
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,150
Right, it is that place.

338
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,260
 My wish was to get a job. I was desperate.

339
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,800
 Are you Bae Yoon Gi?

340
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,490
 Nice to meet you. I am Bae Yoon Gi.

341
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,910
 I'm finally meeting you.

342
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:12,350
 You have no idea how much our Ga Young searched for you.

343
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,320
 I also met Ga Young and got a job.

344
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,490
I now believe in the miracle of that magic.

345
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:54,030
 That's right. What's there to do when you're dead but sleep as a rotting body?

346
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:58,590
I'm so frustrated. I'm so frustrated.

347
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,980
What did he say? "I can't marry someone whom I don't love."

348
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,950
What's he doing now that he couldn't do when he was young? Huh?

349
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,790
Now what can he do?

350
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:17,240
He will only get it together if his mother dies.

351
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,390
So you have decided and come?

352
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,720
Yes.

353
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:28,670
Didn't you say the food is very expensive here?

354
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:33,040
Don't worry about money. I can just take something else in return.

355
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,520
Is that so?

356
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,560
What could an old woman like me give?

357
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:47,670
All right. If my son can meet a match made in heaven and live a good life,

358
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,870
I would even give my liver.

359
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:52,060
Your liver? I don't need it.

360
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,040
It's very old so I can't use it.

361
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,200
Is that so?

362
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:03,950
Then, what should I give you?

363
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,810
You find the recipe.

364
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,440
What? I should?

365
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,800
You are different from me, right? You even worry about the grandmother.

366
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,700
So find something that is suitable for her.

367
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,560
How would I know what recipe to find?

368
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,740
The mindset we have when cooking is the most important part.

369
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,140
Actually,

370
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,750
I'm a bit scared.

371
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:58,510
You do grant wishes, but I am afraid someone might be made unhappy again.

372
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:04,090
Don't carelessly judge someone else's happiness.

373
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:08,850
Only they know whether it is happiness or misfortune.

374
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,850
And,

375
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:15,240
cooking is something which is always done while hoping for someone's happiness.

376
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,130
Not for someone to become unhappy.

377
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:58,380
Trust your instincts.

378
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,110
You will definitely see it.

379
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,780
Noodles.

380
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,260
It's janchi guksu (banquet noodles served at weddings and events).

381
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,420
Grandmother, have this cup of tea.

382
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,390
Okay, thank you.

383
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,780
Eat it, Grandmother.

384
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,810
You have to desperately make your wish while eating it.

385
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,500
I don't know if I will ever

386
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:56,630
be able to eat such delicious noodles again in my lifetime.

387
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:00,830
Don't be silly, Grandma. You can just have it again at your son's wedding.

388
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:05,760
Yes, you're right about that.

389
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:12,410
Now that I made a wish, I can look forward to it, right?

390
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,410
 The Witch's Diner

391
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,400
Grandma, are you sure you're okay?

392
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,180
I'm okay.

393
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,150
Oh, I'm okay. Don't worry.

394
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:38,580
This old lady finally gets to see

395
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,400
what I've wanted my whole life. How could I not be okay?

396
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:48,350
Oh yes, you know.

397
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:54,000
Can you do me one favor?

398
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,040
A favor?

399
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,610
- Hey, Noona. 
 - Huh?

400
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,840
Oh, we're already here. You should go now, Gil Yong.

401
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,200
I live around here, too. It's been a few days since I moved in.

402
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,700
That commercial building.

403
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,070
Oh, I see.

404
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,720
Yes.

405
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,030
- By the way, Noona. 
 - Yes?

406
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:29,040
I'm trying to buy a present for my father with my part-time job,

407
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,600
but I don't know what to buy.

408
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,050
You thought of getting him a gift? I'm proud of you.

409
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:40,760
If you have time this week, could you help me buy a gift?

410
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,360
Me?

411
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,100
Okay. I'll help you.

412
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,110
Really?

413
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,030
Then do you have time tomorrow?

414
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,220
Oh, tomorrow?

415
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,130
Sure, let's do that.

416
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:57,790
Then I'll think about it tonight. You should think about it, too.

417
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:00,090
Okay. I will.

418
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,910
Thank you.

419
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,270
Gil Yong.

420
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,890
Yes, Noona.

421
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,230
Have you thought about what present to buy?

422
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,420
Not yet.

423
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,260
- Let's go first. 
 - Okay.

424
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,940
 The Witch's Diner

425
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,210
What kind of style does he usually have?

426
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,370
I'm not sure. I think he likes everything.

427
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,870
I don't really know.

428
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,180
Maybe this hat? Let's go over there.

429
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,900
Okay.

430
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,460
How about this?

431
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,510
It looks comfortable. I think this is okay.

432
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,700
Yes, I think it's good.

433
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,840
I'm worried if he'll like it or not.

434
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,180
Thank you, Noona.

435
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,060
It's not a big deal.

436
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,630
Since you came out here for me today, I will buy you a meal.

437
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,920
Okay. Then I will be a freeloader for once.

438
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,850
Yes, Writer.

439
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,830
I had something I needed to do, so I'm out.

440
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,130
Did something happen?

441
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,240
Thank you for coming.

442
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:34,660
I bought some porridge. For now, eat this first.

443
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:44,470
I'm sick and you were the only one I could think of.

444
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:10,070
 Noona, thank you for today.

445
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,620
 Noona, I got a present for you...

446
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,530
 Noona, good job.

447
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:29,090
 You too.  Good Job.

448
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,510
Are you feeling a little better?

449
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,570
I'll clean this up.

450
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,890
No, I will do it for you.

451
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:08,400
I feel relieved because there's someone who's worried about me.

452
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,100
I don't think I'm sick anymore.

453
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,260
 Love, as if you've never been hurt.

454
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,370
Noona.

455
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,290
Oh, Gil Yong.

456
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,370
Did you give your father the gift?

457
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,210
Yes.

458
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,730
Did he like it?

459
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:11,210
Yes, he liked it.

460
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,850
All right, that's a relief.

461
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,850
But is that him?

462
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,010
The person you're dating?

463
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,610
Did you see him?

464
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:24,530
He doesn't seem that great. You deserve better.

465
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,460
Grandma.

466
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,930
Grandma, what are you doing here?

467
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:44,170
Grandma? No, I'm not a grandma.

468
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:49,600
How come my mother isn't here?

469
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,930
She said she'd give me mugwort, so I picked these pine needles.

470
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,020
How could my mom not come?

471
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,480
 The epilogue will follow shortly.

472
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,770
 Epilogue 
 But the price of that wish or whatever...

473
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,440
What do you want?

474
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,920
Traces of your life.

475
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,100
Sadness, joy,

476
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,980
pain, happiness, anger.

477
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,280
All the experiences and emotions that humans go through in their lives.

478
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:03,460
Give me the memories that contain all these traces of life.

479
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,670
Is that all you need, memories?

480
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,650
Okay, let's do that.

481
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:24,220
This old woman's been through a lot all her life.

482
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:30,140
It's better this way. The past of this old woman.

483
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:36,700
The memory of this old woman. What can't I give you?

484
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:53,530
♬  Don't let me be away from your heart  ♬

485
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:59,550
♬  Let me in, so I can be with you  ♬

486
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:05,660
♬  Even if it's a dream that can't come true  ♬

487
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,260
