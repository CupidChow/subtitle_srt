24
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,920
 I want revenge.

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,800
 There's a cost for the wish.

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,410
 The cost is for you to be a witch.

27
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,190
 I don't care if it's a witch or whatever.

28
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:01,750
 My wish is for the man's child

29
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,530
 to be as unhappy as I am.

30
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,490
 I hope they get hurt like me, in a miserable way.

31
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:15,820
 So I hope that man is in agony.

 1st Birthday

34
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,820
Noona.

35
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,300
 But is that him? The person you're dating?

36
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,160
 He doesn't seem that great. You deserve better.

37
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,990
Let's go.

38
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,160
 I'm sorry. Can I borrow your phone please?

39
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,060
 I missed you.

40
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,200
 I have an urgent film shoot tomorrow, so I don't think I will be able to come.

41
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,890
 I think I'll have to prepare for a recording next week.

42
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:34,000
 How could you not notice all those excuses, like an idiot?

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,980
 Everything was a lie.

44
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,500
Gil Yong.

45
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,530
I'm so

46
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,080
sorry about today. I shouldn't have bothered you.

47
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm fine now. You should go.

48
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,570
You're not okay.

49
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,500
Why do you always say you're okay?

50
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,320
Yeah.

51
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,230
I'm not okay.

52
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:38,100
But I don't know what to say

53
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,850
or what to think.

54
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,190
I don't know anything right now.

55
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,680
Don't think about anything and go in and rest well today.

56
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,180
Okay. Be careful going home.

57
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,340
Noona!

58
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,710
I want you to be happy.

59
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,540
They say it's good to cry when you're sad.

60
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,440
If you're having a hard time, don't hold it in today.

61
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,880
Okay.

62
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,620
Thanks.

 Someone said that

77
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,830
 the reason why people are fooled by lies is simple.

78
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:28,560
 The belief that the other person won't lie to me now.

79
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,580
 Because of that belief,

80
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,690
 I'm not lying to the other person.

Can I get you a blanket? Wait here. I'll be right back.

85
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,130
It's been a while.

86
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,620
Are you here because of Jin?

87
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,930
Yes. I came because of her.

88
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,720
Are you going to do something to my Jin—

89
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,390
Jin has been cursed.

90
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,270
Cursed?

91
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,420
She will become unhappy.

92
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,040
No. No. Not my Jin.

93
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,460
I'll take the curse.

94
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,080
Sorry.

95
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,600
She is the  person who must receive the curse.

96
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,800
What are you doing now? Get out immediately.

97
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,360
Why aren't you picking up my calls?

98
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,530
Go. I have nothing to say to you anymore, and I don't want to see you either.

99
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,230
Let's talk.

100
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,060
Let go. Let go of me!

101
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,990
You are married and even have a child. You hid all of that from me.

102
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,820
How could you think of coming here shamelessly?

103
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,310
Married man? What are you saying? I think there is a misunderstanding.

104
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,970
We locked eyes at the ceremonial hall today.

105
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,330
So that was what you were talking about.

106
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,940
I didn't see you though. Did you see me in the Dol (child's first birthday celebration)?

107
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,670
How long will you continue to lie to me?

108
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,930
I couldn't help but take the role of the dad today instead of my friend because he requested that of me.

109
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,340
I should have told you in advance.

110
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,100
Why are we doing this now?

111
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,510
Friend's request?

112
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,520
Did you think I would believe that? Get out!

113
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,040
I'm telling you it is a misunderstanding!

114
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,180
Why don't you believe me?

115
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,670
I have no intention of breaking up with you or letting you go.

116
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,540
So just know that.

117
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,830
Crazy b*stard.

118
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,300
Okay. Let's say I made a mistake,

119
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,580
so I came here immediately to apologize and comfort you.

120
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,170
Comfort me?

121
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,830
I don't need that, so get lost from my sight immediately.

122
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,660
You speak very harshly.

123
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,490
I didn't know you were like this.

124
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,280
I thought you were kind.

125
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,520
So you weren't sincere with me.

126
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,940
Yes. There is no way you would do this if you were sincere with me.

127
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,820
You... You have gone crazy.

128
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:14,210
I came here and lied to you to comfort you and apologize!

129
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,770
Is this possible if I don't love you?

130
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,140
I'm working this hard. What are you?

131
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,300
Who are you to make me a bad guy?!

132
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,360
I told you I love you.

133
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,010
What are you!?

134
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,600
Crazy b*stard!

135
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,210
Jerk!

136
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,360
What are you?! Don't you dare lay your hands on her!

137
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,470
Crazy jerk. Move. Get off me!

138
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,070
Police, please help us! Please help us.

139
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,530
Please save us.

140
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,700
Tell us your name and your ID number.

141
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,190
It isn't a big deal.

142
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,660
I was just arguing with my girlfriend.

143
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,460
But that guy came in suddenly and there was a misunderstanding.

144
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,050
I'm not his girlfriend.

145
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,420
I saw him assaulting her.

146
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,580
You can check the CCTV to see that he entered her home forcefully.

147
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,240
We ended up fighting because he was hitting her.

148
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,860
What is your relationship?

149
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,620
I'm her guardian.

150
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,540
Guardian.

151
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,800
- Don't joke. 
 - He is my guardian.

152
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,870
He is my guardian, and you were the one who assaulted me.

153
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,080
 I told you it's a misunderstanding!

154
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,510
 Why don't you believe me?

155
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,910
 I am trying so hard.

156
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:19,460
 What are you? Who are you to make me a bad guy?

157
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,450
There is no need to hear any more.

158
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,980
You have evidence and an eyewitness. Legal action can be taken.

159
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,630
Would you like to file a complaint right away?

160
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,000
Yes, Hyung.

161
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,610
I have a problem, so help me out.

162
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,670
Yes, this is Kangbu Police Station.

163
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,570
Yes, thank you.

164
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,530
I would like to call my lawyer here.

165
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,020
You can call your lawyer,

166
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,910
because they also have.

167
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,170
From now on, please talk to me about all law-related problems.

168
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,640
You think you won just because you have a recording?

169
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:25,710
Now that I think of it, did you target me from the beginning because I am a public figure?

170
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,350
I won't stay quiet if you spread this matter to the media or the internet.

171
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,870
Just go if you really don't want to make the issue bigger.

172
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,280
If you have anything else to say, please say it through your lawyer.

173
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,370
You guys have messed with the wrong person.

174
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,010
I will decide whether we end it or not.

175
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,680
That trash-like b*stard.

176
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,350
Yes, PD. How have you been?

177
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,480
Are you really not going to sue him, Noona?

178
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,300
It is because I need some time to think.

179
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,480
If we leave him out, what if he does something to you?

180
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,510
He won't be able to move impulsively.

181
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:22,580
He said it himself. He's a public figure.

182
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,680
You aren't doing this because you are worried about him, right?

183
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,310
No.

184
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,970
It's because I want to confirm what is happening to me.

185
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,510
- Noona—  
 - Jin.

186
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,140
Would you have a word with me?

187
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,110
You must be  shocked. Drink this first.

188
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,630
Uh...

189
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:07,420
I ate the leftover chocolate before, without realizing it.

190
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,390
The witch told me never eat it.

191
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,390
 It might become an irreversible poison.

192
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,670
Is it because of that?

193
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,090
Because of that chocolate?

194
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,600
Do you really think that?

195
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:35,580
If there's a cost, then there is also a side effect.

196
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:42,690
I was wondering if I were cursed.

197
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,310
It's possible.

198
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,910
But

199
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,150
didn't you ever think that

200
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:57,390
you might not be able to see the real problem because you think it's the chocolate?

201
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,790
- Excuse me? 
 - Think about it again.

202
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,430
There may be an answer in your memory,

203
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:10,500
from the question that you avoided the most.

204
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,100
 Seoul to Gangreung

205
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,470
 Jin, your dad recovered a lot and was discharged from the hospital.

206
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:31,080
 Do you remember the house we lived in when you were young? I guess he was still living there.

207
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,100
 Do you want to come over here?

208
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,810
 I didn't keep up with reality.

209
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,900
 The truth that what I suppressed to avoid is like Pandora's box.

210
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,100
 I've never tried to look at it properly.

211
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,710
Mom!

212
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,610
Oh! My daughter, you're early.

213
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,560
I came quickly because I miss you.

214
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,230
But did you stay up all night? What's wrong with your face?

215
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:37,000
No, I didn't. I'm just a little tired.

216
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,770
Your dad's still asleep.

217
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,240
Oh, don't wake him. I'll greet him later.

218
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,640
- Mom. 
 - Yes?

219
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,280
Your daughter is also a little sleepy.

220
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,630
Oh, okay. Let's go. Let's go.

221
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:52,790
Let's go in. Let's go in.

222
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,780
I've prepared all the ingredients you mentioned.

223
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,930
This time, what kind of guest is this food for?

224
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,870
Take a seat here.

225
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,980
You've been through a lot.

226
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,060
You don't have to come anymore starting tomorrow.

227
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:25,410
- Excuse me? 
 - This restaurant is going to close now.

228
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:31,380
Is there something wrong? Then what about Noona Jin?

229
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,140
I'll talk to Jin separately.

230
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,150
Miss Witch, what the hell is going on with Noona?

231
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,450
I made a wish that I wanted to be by her side, but

232
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:52,480
even beside her, I couldn't help her.

233
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,220
What

234
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:06,060
would you do if you could make a wish again?

235
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,540
If I could make the wish again,

236
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,580
I'd protect her rather than be by her side,

237
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,090
or change it to make her happy.

238
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,990
How long did I sleep?

239
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,370
Oh, did you wake up?

240
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,310
I was very accurate.

241
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,960
I thought my daughter was going to sleep for another 20 hours and was just getting ready.

242
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,670
Oh, wow, I'm amazing.

243
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,050
Yes, my mom is really amazing.

244
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,070
You must have been really tired.

245
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,930
Yes, a little.

246
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:08,150
- Kimchi bean sprout porridge? 
 - Yes.

247
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,180
You looked for this every time you were sick.

248
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,680
After you finished one bowl, you got better in no time.

249
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,610
 My Jin.

250
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,990
 I made your favorite, kimchi bean sprout porridge. Try to eat a little.

251
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:48,370
 - There you go. Are you not sick anymore? 
 - No!

252
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,570
 Did you get sick because you wanted to eat this?

253
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,650
When I was young, I used to fake it whenever I wanted to eat this.

254
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,500
But I'm not sick.

255
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,580
Are you only sick when your body is sick? Heartbreaks are pain too.

256
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,540
I hope you get all better after eating a bowl of this.

257
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,530
- What are you thinking about? 
 - Huh?

258
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,170
Eat before it gets cold.

259
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,470
Thank you for the meal.

260
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,240
It's really good.

261
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:02,380
- Hey, Mom. 
 - What?

262
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:06,510
Don't you hate Dad?

263
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,980
I hate him. I hate him, so that's why I'm here harassing him.

264
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,350
It's so much fun to scold your dad.

265
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,480
But Jin, I don't know if it's because my brain is bad,

266
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,610
but as time goes by, the hatred is erased bit by bit.

267
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,280
Oh, but I shouldn't keep forgetting.

268
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,030
Mom.

269
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,460
I...

270
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,030
I remember everything.

271
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:53,330
She keeps... Why are you setting this mood?

272
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,690
What? What did you remember?

273
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:03,530
What happened when I lost you when I was young.

274
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,990
That it wasn't a dream.

275
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,390
Actually,

276
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,960
I know everything.

277
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:27,160
That Dad brought me from outside (adopted her).

278
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,600
When I was five years old, I heard you and Aunt talking.

279
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,820
 Did Brother-in-law drink and make a fuss again?

280
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,000
 And you're still going to live with her?

281
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,860
 Why would you suffer like that?

282
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,800
 You need to live too.

283
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,500
 Quickly divorce him, and just leave the kid at the orphanage.

284
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,390
 Watch what you say. Jin will hear you.

285
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:57,360
 You know, the kid Brother-in-law brought from outside...

286
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,570
 What makes her so pretty that you would go through all this trouble?

287
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,060
 You can't keep your mouth shut?

288
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,500
Why didn't you tell me?

289
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,260
 Did you not tell me because you were afraid you'd hurt me?

290
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:16,930
Jin, no matter what anyone says, you're my one and only daughter.

291
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,050
I know.

292
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,720
Of course, I know.

293
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,230
So... thank you so much

294
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,380
for letting me live as your daughter.

295
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,090
Don't mention it.

296
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,310
That is why I

297
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:51,450
can't forgive Dad.

298
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,940
He hurt you.

299
00:27:54,940 --> 00:28:01,020
I only... wished that you wouldn't get hurt.

300
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,700
But Jin,

301
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,290
if we are alive, we can't live without getting hurt.

302
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,520
There are no wounds that don't heal.

303
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:23,550
I was still extremely happy because of you.

304
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:32,020
Where else would I get such a pretty daughter?

305
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,710
Thanks a lot.

306
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,710
It's been a while.

307
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,320
Jin,

308
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,630
you hate me a lot, right?

309
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,000
I have made mistakes all my life.

310
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:26,400
I regret it every time, but I still made the wrong decisions.

311
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,980
I only thought of running away.

312
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,200
I was selfish.

313
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:38,330
Back then, I couldn't see anything except myself.

314
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:47,030
I know I can't get forgiveness

315
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,390
from anyone.

316
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,750
But...

317
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:57,550
I at least wanted to apologize.

318
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,400
I am really,

319
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,290
really sorry, Jin.

320
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,070
But...

321
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,570
I thought

322
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:24,120
I should give this to you myself.

323
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,780
 Go if you aren't interested.

324
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,120
 Excuse me.

325
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,910
 About that contract... Let's make it clear.

326
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,450
 It's not everything to just say, "This store is now mine."

327
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,100
 There's loan interest, electricity bills, water bills, cost of materials.

328
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,930
 You have a drinking habit.

329
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,650
 Whether it's big or small, that's for him to bear. It is not like you are going to live for his sake.

330
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,560
 - I mean, it's because I'm not going to live for him that I'm—

331
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,880
 That is why I should be more serious.

332
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,400
 Witch. Witch.

333
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:27,580
But at least the last of my life has been fun with her.

334
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,750
 If you were to make a wish again...

335
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,610
 You would disappear without leaving a trace.

336
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,780
 That order has brought me up to here.

337
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,480
 The results are obvious.

338
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,430
 Do I have to see you dying?

339
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,540
 Therefore, right now, I will face up to reality..

340
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,390
 Only the reality.

341
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,680
 The Witch's Diner

342
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,360
I met my dad and came.

343
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,590
So you must have heard anything. It is something that can be forgotten.

344
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:25,200
Erase it.

345
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,370
The preparations are all done.

346
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:33,650
You can curse him so that he won't be able to mess

347
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,950
with you ever again if you just eat this.

348
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:41,480
How big of a price must I pay...

349
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,120
for that curse?

350
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,300
You don't need to know.

351
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,360
I'm going to eat it anyway.

352
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,460
Stop. Stop it.

353
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:18,950
If it's revenge that has a price, then I will do it myself.

354
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,160
 Now I know...

355
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,420
 I can't give you both.

356
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,920
 Red or blue?

357
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,860
 You choose.

358
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,630
 Ahjumma, you choose first.

359
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:48,860
 Who the woman who gave me that candy was.

360
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,190
 Mom.

361
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:07,180
 My mom will worry, so I have to go now.

362
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,520
 Let's go to your mom.

363
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:28,390
 If you fall again later, I will hold your hands then too.

364
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,340
Who the woman who gave me the candy was.

365
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,110
You have been by my side always, right?

366
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,160
Mom.

367
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:58,900
♬  Even after giving everything  ♬

368
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:05,720
♬  A person who feels sorry  ♬

369
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:14,090
♬  I live because of you  ♬

370
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:20,210
♬  A person who said it was a fine day  ♬

371
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:29,300
♬  Suddenly, you’ve grown so small as you’re leaving  ♬

372
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,870
♬  Why am I feeling so endlessly sad?  ♬

373
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,240
 The Witch's Diner

374
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,860
 Epilogue

375
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,100
I wanted to say goodbye.

376
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:53,620
It's a shame, but we can't do anything about it.

377
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:20,040
