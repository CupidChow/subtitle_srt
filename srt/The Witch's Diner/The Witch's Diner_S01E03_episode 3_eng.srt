 Our Yun Gi, what do you dream of becoming later on?

8
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,580
 A doctor!

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,410
 I will become a doctor to heal your illness, earn lots of money,

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,060
 listen to Mom and Dad, and grow up well.

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,860
 You really are one of a kind!

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,640
 Our son is the best!

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,060
 A doctor.

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,500
Hello, I am Bae Yun Gi, a man who wants to become a true employee of this generation.

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,230
At a young age, I wanted to become an archaeologist to find hidden treasures, so I joined the Department of History.

16
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:18,580
I want to join Daesan Investment in their journey to find unknown treasures to invest in.

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,840
Last, I'd like to request that you tell us your appeal which would make us hire you.

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,360
While I studied at Harvard, I only thought of one thing: the Korean society.

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,520
Let us become the talent which Korea needs to stand tall.

20
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,950
And now, I will work hard to become the person that Daesan needs.

21
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,350
If you hire me, you will not regret it.

22
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,760
 (In Russian)  Global investment strategy, understanding the world!

23
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,290
 (In Chinese)  Furthermore, for the future we have to face

24
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,550
 (In Japanese)  I am ready.

25
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,100
Candidate 515, what about you?

26
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,300
Yes... well, I'm ready to do anything, even die for you.

27
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,730
What do you mean? Times have changed.

28
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,390
That's right... so...

29
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,480
Okay, what about you, candidate 516?

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,010
I, too, will work hard in order to not disappoint you.

31
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,710
Ah... their qualifications are really all...

32
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,150
I could have done better,

33
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,650
but suddenly my stomach...

34
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,390
Candidate 516 is the boss's son, right?

35
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,920
Yes, it's his second child.

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,040
Hey, you know, they look really similar.

37
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,430
What's the point of studying so hard and developing qualifications?

38
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,360
Some are born with a gold spoon.

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,740
Well, that's how life is.

40

 The Witch's Diner 
 Ep.3 Chicken and rice soup for the youth

41
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,570
This...

42
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,220
 Ouch! That hurts, dang it!

43
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,120
Yesterday, when Gil Yong was here, it spoke.

44
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,440
 Of course. What type of mandrake doesn't talk?

45
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,700
It spoke because it's a mandrake?

46
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,860
I'm in the middle of taking a nap, so don't bother me.

47
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,980
Wow, it spoke again! It spoke again!

48
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,930
- What are you doing? 
 - What?

49
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,780
Stop procrastinating and come over here.

50
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,230
Here. Clean this.

51
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,850
Yes.

52
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,500

54
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,000
What is all this?

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,690
You can see that?

56
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,530
Yes.

57
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,780
Are all of these things the prices of the wishes?

58
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:25,460
Someone's price can become the ingredient for someone else's wish.

59
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,300
Hey, what was Gil Yong's wish yesterday?

60
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,820
Are you interested in him?

61
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,980
What? As if! What nonsense are you saying?

62
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,490
Hey Yun Gi, come have a cup of coffee.

63
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,830
Thank you.

64
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,490
- Cigarette? 
 -  Oh, um...

65
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,160
No... no thank you, I don't smoke.

66
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,950
- It's very hard, right? 
 - No, it's okay.

67
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,410
I hear it's very hard to find a job these days.

68
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,220
Shouldn't you at least take the civil servant's exam?

69
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,280
I still have student loans, so I can't dream of it.

70
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,190
There are school fees and textbook fees. No way...

71
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,220
It must be difficult. Drink, Drink!

72
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,430
Ah, it must be very tiring.

Hey, did you see unit 404 come in?

75
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,370
No, I really didn't.

76
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,360
Really, this bastard...

77
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,660
 What did this punk lock it with? The spare key won't even work.

78
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,350
Wait a minute!

79
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,090
Don't tell me this guy is inside!

80
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,750
Hey! Bae Yun Gi! You're inside, right?!

81
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,460
Hey!

82
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,990
Hey!

83
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,570
  - Our son is the best. 
 - A doctor!

84
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,330
Ah, this bastard, really...

85
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,020
I'm so sorry.

Seriously, what was that?

104
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,170
I had a nightmare today as well.

105
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,530
- Welcome. 
 - Welcome.

106
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,930
Put your hands in the air and don't move!

107
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,960
Give me everything you have!

108
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,200
The... th-the... cash, card! Um...

109
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,570
Give me everything! And uh... and give me all of your food too!

110
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,240
- What? F-Food? 
 - Yeah.

111
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,710
Wh-Whatever you have.

112
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,190
Here, here, here... put it all in here.

113
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,960
 The most unexpected events are usually inevitable.

114
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,160
 Only the outcome depends on the choices that you make.

115
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,600
 Oh, Mom... I'll get a job soon.

116
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,200
 What will you do if you get sicker? I said don't worry!

117
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,970
 What is this? Is it this guy's memories?

118
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,000
- Noona, are you okay? 
 - A-Are you okay?

119
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,250
Gosh, hurry and put it in!

120
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,320
What are you doing? Are you planning something fishy?  Don't move!

121
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,340
- Can't you see she's hurt? 
 - So hurry up and put it in the bag!

122
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,940
Alright! We don't have money, and...

123
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,440
There... That's all I have in my wallet.

124
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,720
What's all this noise?

125
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,220
What are you doing at my store?

126
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,270
Are you the boss here? No, you! You! You wench!

127
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,300
You! You too. Give me everything you have!

128
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,310
The card in your wallet... and give me the card password too!

129
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,510
- "You wench"?
 - Yes! Or do you want to die?

130
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,200
I'll stab her now!

131
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,130
What if I don't want to?

132
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,310
Don't come! Don't come near me!

133
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,780
I said don't come! Why do you keep walking?

134
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,620
- Don't come!
 - Hey!

135
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,460
Hey! Why are you hitting me? I'll just—

136
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,290
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,700
My mom needs money for her surgery.

138
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,460
I've been starving for days, so I lost perspective.

139
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,880
I'm very sorry.

140
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,280
But still, you have to work to make money. How could you resort to robbery?

141
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,260
I did try my best by submitting dozens of resumes every day, but...

142
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:47,560
If I lower my standards, other overqualified applicants lower their standards with me.

143
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,570
So I can't compete.

144
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:55,800
I couldn't even dream of language training or improving my specs because I was paying tuition.

145
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,210
It is rather hard to get a job these days, isn't it?

146
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,790
Even with vacancies, they only hire people with experience.

147
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,650
But if you're a recent graduate, of course, you have none.

148
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,310
The student loan alone is 40 million won (~40k USD).

149
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,920
I couldn't handle the fees for the civil service exam on top of my daily expenses. I can't get employed either.

150
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,110
It goes without saying that life in the world isn't easy.

151
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,520
Why should I be the only one who's so unhappy?

152
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,890
Why am I the only one who has no place in this world?

153
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,200
- Only you?
 - I'm sorry.

154
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,670
I don't dare ask you to be fair to me. I'm really sorry.

155
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,190
Stop complaining and give me your order.

156
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,100
Okay... What?

157
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,160
This is a witch's restaurant that makes wishes come true.

158
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,980
M-Make an order, you say?

159
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,400
Wish. What's your wish?

160
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,640
I-I want a job. It may as well be in a decent place too.

161
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,690
When I wake up in the morning, I want there to always be a place for me to go to, for once.

162
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,370
It's not even a big deal.

163
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,450
- Wait a second, Ms. Witch. 
 - What?

164
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,580
It won't take long.

165
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,790
- You said you were Bae Yun Gi, right? 
 - Yes.

166
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,590
I want you to think about it one more time.

167
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,640
You can't take your wish back.

168
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,920
So you shouldn't have any regrets about this.

169
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,390
You don't even know how great the cost will be.

170
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,320
Whether it's big or small, that's for him to bear.

171
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,720
It's not like you're going to live for his sake.

172
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,030
- I mean, it's because I'm not going to live for him that I'm— 
 - Shut up.

173
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm sorry, but what are you talking about?

174
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,130
Did I misunderstand you, or was I not supposed to understand you, or what—?

175
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,220
Is it okay for you if I can explain it to you a little?

176
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,720
As someone who experienced this.

177
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,410
 Notice

178
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,020
So it's...

179
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:54,180
You're saying the witch is the business concept of this store, right? Oh.

180
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,020
Wow, your boss is really brilliant.

181
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,360
If you make a wish, it will surely come true.

182
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,960
But you do need to pay the price for it.

183
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:07,220
- The wish... will come true? 
 - Yes.

184
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,230
The price... Ah...

185
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,310
Just report me to the police already. Don't make fun of me like that.

186
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,170
I'll take the punishment quietly.

187
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,400
But I'm not making fun of you.

188
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,210
As long as my boss accepts you as a customer, she probably won't report you.

189
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,050
A-Are you sure?

190
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,990
But aren't you a student? What are you doing here at this time?

191
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,060
Yes, I'm a student.

192
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,160
As for school... I'm worried about it.

193
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,530
I don't have an answer either.

194
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:49,890
Honestly, I'm thinking about quitting.

195
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,150
It is indeed hard to go to school.

196
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,600
The teachers are crappy and so are the students.

197
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,950
But the most worthless of all

198
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:08,620
It's me. I can't change anything about myself.

199
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,130
But that's not you.

200
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,830
The courage to take responsibility for your own future

201
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:23,500
and the determination to put it into practice. I think this is important.

202
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,790
Wow, that speech was really good.

203
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,830
I was just pretending to be an old man.

204
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:36,020
But I'm just a loser.

205
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,460
A loser in this damn society.

206
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,060
Not at all. That's not true.

207
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:46,390
Because you're here at our restaurant, I'm sure your wish will come true.

208
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,260
Why does it have so many ingredients?

209
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,730
It's done. Put it back in its place.

210
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,970
You should be more careful.

211
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,260
Oh, I've been having a bit of a headache since earlier.

212
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:40,820
But what do you want in return for the wish?

213
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,230
- An arm? 
 - What? What did you just say?

214
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,300
- An... An arm? 
 - Yeah.

215
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,250
An arm.

216
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,930
You shouldn't say that so easily. You told me before,

217
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,250
"Thoughts and words have power, so there's no turning back."

218
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,690
But I'm not saying this easily.

219
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,700
I mean... what makes this wish so difficult and great?

220
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,490
He just wants a job and a normal life like everyone else—

221
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,520
Your life or your arm. Which one would you choose?

222
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:17,130
Your arm is stuck between the rocks of despair. There's no one to save you.

223
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,350
You have to cut off one arm to live. So what are you going to do?

224
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:30,720
Even so, you're the one making that decision right now.

225
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,190
Not the person with their arm stuck.

226
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,490
He's someone who has been working hard this whole time.

227
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,360
It could have a lifelong impact on his successful employment

228
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,520
and his future career.

229
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,290
It's silky chicken soup.

230
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,360
If you eat this, your wish will come true.

231
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,160
But it isn't for free.

232
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,360
As you know, I am dirt poor, so I have nothing.

233
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,160
Use your body to pay.

234
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,420
B-By my body, you mean...?

235
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,100
Just two of those will do.

236
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,850
These two?

237
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,760
- If you don't like the offer, then don't eat. 
 - Oh, no. Wait a moment.

238
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,150
 Studying while working hard, stacking up specs, what's the point?

239
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,590
 The starting point is different.

240
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,590
 Your mother was so worthless. That's why you're having a hard time.

241
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,060
 I am sorry.

242
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,030
 How can you talk like that?

243
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,760
 You work hard all the time because of me.

244
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,630
 I'll get a job soon so don't worry.

245
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,060
 What will you do if you get sicker? Don't you need surgery?

246
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,330
I only have to give... two fingers, right?

247
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,250
 Ju-just a minute. Hey, don't be like this, Gil Yong. Why are you doing this?

248
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,290
 Just a moment. Just a moment. Let me think for a moment. Just a... Just a moment.

249
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,800
 Oh my God. An... an axe! No! Wait.

250
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,830
 What if you cut off all my five fingers with that? You said you're going to cut only two.

251
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,100
 Just a moment. Please, please. Ah!

252
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,970
Are you going to do it here, right now?

253
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,010
What do you take me for?

254
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,160
I'll take it when I want, so you just focus on eating.

255
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,620
This was a hefty price to pay for your boring wish.

256
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:47,500
Especially that chicken. That thing was a precious gem that fed on hundred-year-old centipedes.

257
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,010
What a waste really. It laid golden eggs too.

258
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,270
Why are you just staring?

259
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,780
No, no. Th-Thank you for the food.

260
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,060
Thank you. That was really delicious.

261
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,900
I just troubled you. But thank you so much.

262
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,050
Now, what do I need to do?

263
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,360
What could you possibly do with this thing?

264
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,430
Madam witch's cooking is amazing, right?

265
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,620
Yeah.

266
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:49,850
This was the first time in my life for me to...

267
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,530
to have such delicious chicken soup.

268
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,680
Um... don't give up.

269
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:02,350
Ah... but I guess you've heard that way too many times by now.

270
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,330
Not at all. I think I understand now.

271
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:11,410
That just telling someone else about your worries gives you strength.

272
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,030
Ah...

273
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,060
You don't need to try so hard.

274
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,820
You don't need the recognition of other people to prove yourself.

275
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,840
 Don't live as a nice person. It'll be hard, and you'll be the fool.

276
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,730
 Even if you make sacrifices for others, you'll only get crap for it in return.

277
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,980
Someone told me this once,

278
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,420
if I live only thinking about other people, I can't change a damn thing.

279
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,230
But I hope you do.

280
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:45,100
Just live as yourself, courageously.

281
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,240
You're not weak.

282
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,910
A person who is sure of the path he follows cannot be weak.

283
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,460
It was just bad luck.

284
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,880
Right.

285
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,760
Then shall I try living like that?

286
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,740
It's quite easy.

287
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,400
Thanks.

288
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,650
Thank you. Stay well.

289
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,710
 I came to know for the first time.

290
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:42,160
 Just listening to someone's worries can give them strength.

291
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,860
Where did you learn such cool words from?

292
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,870
It wasn't anything I saw. It came straight from here.

293
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,180
The sun will come out in a bit.

294
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:23,580
That's right. Let's worry about tomorrow when tomorrow comes.

295
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,110
And not try so hard.

296
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,450
  - ...the phone! 
 - Argh!

297
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,670
 Why don't you pick up the phone?

298
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,100
 Why don't you pick up the phone?!

299
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,190
Who... who is there?

300
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,590
What is going on?

301
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,870
Save me!

302
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,860
Be quiet.

303
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,130
Don't get into this and just be on your way.

304
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,850
Please... please help me!

305
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,010
 What do I do? What do I do?

306
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,700
 Hyung, you live like yourself, with courage.

307
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,320
 A person who is sure of the path he follows cannot be weak.

308
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,700
Please help me!

309
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,430
Excuse me ma'am, are you alright? Is he someone you know?

310
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,320
You little shit! Didn't you hear me?

311
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,030
Leave if you don't want to die.

312
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:12,430
Well... I can't pretend to ignore you... when the lady clearly doesn't like what you're doing!

313
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,260
- You cannot force her like this. 
 - Damn it.

314
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,790
Hey. I told you to ignore us.

315
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,800
Huh? Do you want to die? Do you?

316
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,210
I will report it for now. Don't worry.

317
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:34,530
  It does not matter if your choice is based on fear or hope.

318
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:39,470
  Every choice has its price.

319
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,640
  I cannot keep it up. My hand hurts too much.

320
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,080
  If I give up now and let go, will I die?

321
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:57,880
  Bae Yun Gi, even if you die, let's not die in this shit hole!

322
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,360
  The price you pay is like two sides of a coin.

323
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,950
  There is both light and dark.

324
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:36,480
  But people only attempt to see the bright side.

325
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,640
  Because that makes it easier for you to come to a decision.

326
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,460
Look at Hyeon Wu's Instagram rating.

327
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,840
Ah, he's a star. He's super good-looking. Look at his face.

328
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,810
Ah fuck. Get your hands off me.

329
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:20,180
You want to die? Where do you think you are touching?

330
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,430
Just because I hung out with you till now, do you think we are friends or something?

331
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,820
This bastard.

332
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,520
Why? Are you going to get involved again?

333
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,300
Why can't you keep to yourself? It rubs me the wrong way.

334
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,810
Does he know about this?

335
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,290
Your grandfather, the principal.

336
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:50,410
If he knew, wow... he would be so proud.

337
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,770
Ah, that little freaking...!

338
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,900
Are you alright?

339
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:16,250
Ah. He says he's alright. Yeong Jae is a brave kid.

340
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,030
I am talking about you, not Yeong Jae.

341
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,710
Yes, I am alright.

342
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:26,030
That's a relief. I was worried.

343
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,680
You two look quite chummy. Right?

344
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,140
It looks like you are very close.

345
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,260
Do you want to know something?

346
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,080
There is a price for everything you do.

347
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,920
Everyone is getting off work...

348
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,340
- Director Oh? 
 - Ah.

349
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,440
Ms. Jin.

350
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,180
- What are you doing with all this? 
 - Hm...

351
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,700
Seeing how she is trying to make chocolate,

352
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,880
it looks like our next customer has quite a sweet and strong wish.

353
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,050
Chocolate?

354
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,210
Leave it there.

355
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,730
If you need anything, call me anytime.

356
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,970
I don't need anything.

357
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,820
I already found a part-timer.

358
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,490
And... I have that person too.

359
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,070
Would there be time to be bored?

360
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,820
Take it slowly.

361
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,890
Don't rush too much.

362
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,680
Then.

363
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,760
Goodbye.

364
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,500
What are you going to do with all of this?

365
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,000
Customers will come tomorrow.

366
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,950
- Customers? 
 - They will come.

367
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,870
From seven years ago.

368
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,210

- You're already here? 
 - Yes, come in.

375
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,670
Why are you practicing so hard? It's not even your number.

376
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:18,190
It's just that I like the number so much that I'm planning to sing it at my next audition.

377
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,800
You definitely are a natural-born singer.

378
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,860
You better do good, you brat.

379
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,430
- Did I really sound good, Sunbae-nim? 
 - Yes.

380
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,820
- Get ready for rehearsal. 
 - Okay.

381
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:33,110
 Everyone has a moment in their life when they feel like they're undefeatable.

382
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,290
 Honey Poo♡

383
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,220
 When it seems like they have succeeded in their dreams and their love.

384
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,300
Sunbae-nim, I'm going to the bathroom for a sec.

385
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,590
Seong Ho!

386
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,450
I'm sorry, I interrupted you during practice, right?

387
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,280
Oh, not at all.

388
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,610
But what's the bouquet for this time?

389
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,510
You have to practice being a star too.

390
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,860
- So that you can act naturally when receiving things like this. 
 - Oh.

391
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,140
Really?

392
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,820
Here.

393
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,010
Thank you!

394
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:05,290
Oh! How did the test results go?

395
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,140
They'll come out soon.

396
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,930
If I pass, let's really get married.

397

♬  In the shape of what I once was  ♬

398
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,470
 So you believe that any choice is possible.

399
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:28,000
 - So you believe you have the right to all of those choices.   
 - Are you sure?

400
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,250
- Of course. 
  - The woman living such a happy life.

401
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,880
♬  Pulled from me  ♬

402
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,840
We won't open today.

403
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,790
What? Why? But I'm already at work now.

404
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:44,370
That's your problem.

405
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,990
No, no. It's not about whose problem it is.

406
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,880
It is a matter of how to manage the business!

407
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,080
It's my decision.

408
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,390
 This is why I have a headache.

409
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,550
 Opening hours: Sunset to Sunrise 
 Menu: Depends on what is in the order.

410
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:10,130
 Price: So expensive that no one can eat it. 
 However, any wish is possible and the results are guaranteed.

411
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,850
- Oh? Noona! 
 - Oh!

412
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,110
- Gil Yong! We're not opening today. I'm also on my way out after just getting here. 
 - Ah.

413
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:36,020
Noona, look at this.

414
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:40,030
 There was a citizen who saved a woman from assault yesterday morning.

415
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:45,360
 While confronting the assailant, he lost two fingers.

416
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,230
 Correspondent Choi Jae Hyeong reporting.

417
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,990
 If I acted like I didn't see anything,  
 - Huh?

418
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,710
- It's Yun Gi!  
 - Right?! 
   - as the person who could help...

419
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,520
 - I couldn't do that... 
 - Police officers have been

420
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,130
  calling him "The Brave Citizen"

421
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,010
  and have said they will reward him.  
 - Wow...

422
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:05,010
Even though I saw it, I don't believe it.

423
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,270
So Yun Gi's wish has come true now too, right?

424
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,110
Getting employed?

425
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:17,540
It's not like he wished for anything that grand.

426
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,320
Two fingers.

427
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,590
And I'm a little scared.

428
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:29,120
How about your wish? Has it come true?

429
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:34,270
I think so.

430
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:45,000
 Chammat Restaurant 
 Police. Don't cross

431
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,200
 Did you get home safely, honey?

432
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,930
 You know I really love you, right?

433
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:37,030
 Even though I just saw you, I already can't wait to see you again.

434
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,070
 Yun Gi.

435
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,710
 Is this my wish coming true?

436
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,990
 I asked you if this is what my wish coming true means?

437
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:05,040
♬  Don't let me me be away from your heart  ♬

 The Witch's Diner

445
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:39,330
Any wish is possible. You can get revenge on those who have tormented you. 
  Epilogue

446
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:43,780
Anything you want can come true.

447
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:49,350
My wish is to stay by Noona Jin's side.

448
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:52,770
If possible, for a long time.

449
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:56,460
Revenge won't change my life anyway.

450
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,990
What I want is to succeed through my own efforts.

451
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,470
There is significance to that.

452
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,030
Not because I made a wish.

453
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,540
You can make it easier on yourself.

454
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:14,290
You can make her fall in love with you right now.

455
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,940
But that wouldn't be real.

456
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,570
I have to win her over honestly. It's her heart after all.

457
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,770
Jin has to make up her own mind.

458
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,140
So... what should I give you as the price?

459
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,090
Hmm...

460
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,580
As payment...

461
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,040
You.

462
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,770
What? Me?

463
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:50,030
Yes. You.

464
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:53,970
- What do you mean—
 - I'm going to hire you as a part-timer.

465
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,610
I need an extra pair of hands anyway.

466
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:03,010
But... why Jin, of all people?

467
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,530
 I'm okay.

468
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:14,220
Because it looks like she's always having a hard time.

469
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,620
So much that she doesn't even realize how much she is struggling.

470
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,990
But...

471
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:24,630
  You did well today!

472
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:31,400
Jin looks pretty when she smiles.

473
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,830
I would like it if she was somebody who smiled often instead of rarely.

474
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,310
And I want to see that for a long time.

475
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,970
Is that really your wish?

476
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,700
Won't you regret it?

477
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:48,390
No. I won't regret it.

478
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:55,910
