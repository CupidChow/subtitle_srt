1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:07,930

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,290
 Song Ji Hyo

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,550
 Nam Ji Hyun

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,970
 Chae Jong Hyeop

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,020
 Ha Do Kwon

00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,360
 The Witch's Diner

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,870
Mom, what is all this?

8
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,040
You should have at least opened the window before you started.

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,580
The room's filled with the smell of oil.

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,750
What are you saying?

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,290
It's your dad's death anniversary and he will only come if he at least smells this.

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,550
Did you forget your dad's death anniversary?

13
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,500
You can forget anything, but how could you forget your dad's death anniversary?

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,610
What are you saying? Dad's death anniversary is in winter.

15
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,840
Taste this.

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,350
Never mind.

17
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,860
Then just go wash up and come help me.

18
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,970
- Mom, what's wrong with you? 
 - Hey hey!

19
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,870
I heard you joined a hiking club at school.

20
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,120
Is there a pretty girl?

21
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,540
 The Witch's Diner 
 EP. 06 Ssuk Song Pyeon that has vanished with someone's memories. (artemisa/mugwort rice cake)

22
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,380
Mom! Mom!

23
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,380
Why are you here like this?

24
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,400
Father.

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,710
I'm sorry. She isn't like this usually.

26
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,250
No, no. It's okay.

27
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,850
Mom, get up.

28
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,080
I'll help you.

29
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,020
Thank you.

30
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,000
Here.

31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,680
And get me a  cup of tea.

32
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,380
Ah, sure.

33
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,490
I think that grandmother is slowly losing her memories.

34
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,940
Is that so?

35
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,170
Miss Witch!

36
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,980
You said feelings are the most important for cooking.

37
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,370
It is.

38
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,090
I never had such feelings.

39
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,380
I definitely prayed for just her bad memories to be erased, but she can't recognize her son?

40
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,020
What kind of happiness is that?

41
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,290
I told you not to judge happiness carelessly.

42
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,790
Not being able to recognize your own son—

43
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,630
That is the price you have to pay.

44
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:13,420
Then, that price is too unfair!

45
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,730
Nothing will change just because you are angry.

46
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,370
Everything simply follows its order.

47
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,600
Order?

48
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,080
Yes. If this is all in order,

49
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,180
I'd like to quit.

50
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,950
I'll follow her.

51
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,820
Noona.

52
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,740
I'll go first.

53
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,080
I need some time to think alone today.

54
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,590
Noona, just a moment.

55
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,870
What is this?

56
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,240
It catches all nightmares.

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,110
You said you are having nightmares these days.

58
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,710
Thank you.

59
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,940
If you need someone, feel free to tell me anytime.

60
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,410
Okay, I'll do so.

61
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,480
I'll go first.

62
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,710
 Can you see it?

63
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:02,220
 A newborn's first cry. A terminal patient's last day.

64
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,010
 What dish requires so many ingredients?

65
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,950
 You can't become a witch because someone orders you to.

66
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,430
 You should decide it on your own.

67
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,860
 Yes, she said I could decide.

68
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,760
 I will never make anyone unhappy again.

69
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,910
 Let's go back to the past when I was normal.

70
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,830
It's a severe case of dementia, Hyeong.

71
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,740
She should have had some preceding symptoms.

72
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,150
For example a steady erosion of daily life.

73
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,710
Until recently, she was so healthy.

74
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,420
This can be treated, right?

75
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,960
We can slow it down, but it's hard to cure.

76
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,880
She has to take medicines on time.

77
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,500
 Tom Kim: Sorry.  I have an urgent film shoot tomorrow, so I don't think I will be able to come.

78
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,300
 Understood. Hope the filming goes well.

79
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,130
Mom.

80
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,380
 Jin.

81
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,240
Mom, when will you come here?

82
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,850
I will come back after a few days when your dad is in more stable condition.

83
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,630
It's time to give your dad his medicine. I must have gone crazy.

84
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,170
I'll call you later.

85
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,950
I called you because I missed you.

86
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,220
I didn't even get to say I miss you.

87
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,800
Honey. Honey, what's wrong?

88
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,450
Are you okay? Honey!

89
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,380
Honey, come to your senses. Honey!

90
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,510
Doctor. Doctor!

91
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,780
Help us. Here!

92
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,090
Patient. Patient, does it hurt somewhere?

93
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,820
Can you raise your arm?

94
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,790
Patient.

95
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,710
How are you, Patient?

96
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,630
Open your eyes.

97
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:12,130
It's my first time seeing a person coming to a bookstore to buy a book when they are frustrated.

98
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:18,290
Okay, so you studied Korean literature, used to be a film producer, and like reading.

99
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,450
I got to know a lot today.

100
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,550
There, your book is also there. 
   "Love" written by the love columnist Tom Kim.

101
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,580
Isn't that Tom Kim?

102
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,140
Thank you for bringing me here today.

103
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,430
Ah, no problem. Thank you for coming along with me.

104
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,130
Just a moment.

105
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,750
Sure.

106
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,320
What should I do?

107
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,550
I think I'll have to prepare for a recording next week.

108
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,690
Yes, it's okay.

109
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,870
I'll drop you off.

110
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,510
Ah, it's okay. I'll walk home.

111
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,720
Then I will feel uncomfortable.

112
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,050
No, it's really okay.

113
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,990
It's because I want to walk alone.

114
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,840
The fact that you wanted to was enough.

115
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,800
Then, I'll contact you as soon as I'm done with my work.

116
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,850
Go quickly.

117
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,070
 I looked into it as you said.

118
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,580
If I insert myself into this child's life, will I be able to change it?

119
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,950
"Don't doubt the flow of things."

120
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,330
You know this well, don't you?

121
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,510
Fate is quite sly.

122
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,110
Her temperament seems to be the same as yours.

123
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,750
- Same as mine? 
 - You're stubborn, aren't you?

124
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,980
You always have to accomplish the things you want.

125
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,220
Don't worry, because I will be watching her attentively.

126
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,750
Showing up suddenly like this is very irritating.

127
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,720
Let's have a talk.

128
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,110
What did you want to talk to me about?

129
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,340
When did we ever talk?

130
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,550
Don't interfere in that child's life anymore.

131
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,800
Taking the trouble to come here and give me that advice directly,

132
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,070
were we that close?

133
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,950
We are not gods.

134
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:55,580
You cannot take your curse upon yourself.

135
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,020
- Hui Ra— 
 - Stop acting like my mother!

136
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:10,920
Go back. I am not going to sit and watch stuff happen like you would.

137
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,090
Sleeping?

138
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,910
You are sleeping.

139
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,860
You sigh like it's the end of the world, you brat.

140
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,610
Why is a youngster making faces like his life is over?

141
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:42,300
Well... I am frustrated and have nowhere to vent. It bothers me.

142
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,570
I know another brat like you.

143
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,510
You're here?

144
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,770
Part-timer, you haven't gone home yet?

145
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,980
It's hard, isn't it?

146
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,870
It's going to be hard. I know also from experience.

147
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,980
Before I decided that I wanted to be a supporter, I also had the opportunity to choose.

148
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,010
Whether to live my life normally or

149
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,670
to become someone's shadow forever.

150
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,590
Please let Hui Ra come back.

151
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,890
She does not have to like me. Just let me watch over her.

152
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,100
In the end, you chose the harder path.

153
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,780
Everyone has it hard, don't they?

154
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,860
If I am going to have a hard time anyway,

155
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,080
If we stayed by each other, knowing each other's struggles,

156
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,450
I thought it would make it a little less difficult for us.

157
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,030
If Noona really ends up a witch, what do I do?

158
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:54,470
I am not sure. That is for you to decide.

159
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,820
Take your time thinking about it.

160
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,320
 It's so obvious that she's having a hard time.

161
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,140
 But not being able to do anything about it makes me frustrated.

162
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:11,560
 It's enough if you just stay by her side and slowly comfort her.

163
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,920
 You just have to maintain your pace like a pacemaker.

164
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:22,550
♬  There's nothing else I care as much as you  ♬

00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,550
♬  as much you  ♬ 
  Gil Yong

166
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,190
♬  If I walked this empty road a thousand miles  ♬

167
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,700
♬  with you I'll never be alone  ♬

168
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,490
 Noona where did you reach? Are you not coming today either? Did you eat your meals properly? You don't have anything going on, right?

169
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,500
 It's empty without you here at the restaurant. Grandma said that she's going to a senior care center.

170
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,080
 Noona, they say you have to eat better when you are having a hard time.

171
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,950
 with you I'll never be alone  ♬

172
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,620
Here's your food.

173
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,300
Boss.

174
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,490
I will quickly get that for you.

175
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,930
I am sorry.

176
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,330
I am sorry.

177
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,490
Mom, are you okay?

178
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,320
 You have to get your mind ready.

179
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,500
 Her sleeping time and lifestyle pattern will also differ from before.

180
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,320
 You have to look after her 24/7.

181
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,790
 It's not going to be easy.

182
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:01,650
 When it comes to dementia, the issue does not lie with the patient or the caregiver.

183
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:07,490
 If you have a really hard time, you can turn to professional facilities too.

184
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,570
 Himchan Hospital 
 Signature for consent: Choi Hyo Sik

185
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,220
Here.

186
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,030
Yes.

187
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,220
She is all ready to be admitted.

188
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,050
Yes.

189
00:15:54,890 --> 00:16:01,490
Father, why did you bring this nice school bag?

190
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,320
If Hyo Sik sees this, he is going to have a fit.

191
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,980
Mom.

192
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:16,650
It'll be exactly five nights.

193
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:22,280
You just have to stay here for five nights and listen to the doctor well

194
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,530
and eat properly.

195
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,070
I am going to return after five nights.

196
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,850
Father.

197
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:05,560
♬  Like a silent star  ♬

198
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,930
Grandma, it's alright.

199
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:12,740
Then, let's just wipe our hands. You got something on them before.

200
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,120
♬  All of the things that I can’t hide  ♬

201
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:24,750
♬  Are only headed toward one place  ♬

202
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:33,690
♬  Why don't you know? The more the longer and longer nights pile up  ♬

203
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:39,360
♬  The deeper my feeling becomes  ♬

204
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:47,370
♬  It’s so overwhelming. Sometimes the moments of you   ♬

205
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:53,020
♬  feel like a lie  ♬

206
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:59,990
♬  Don't let me be away from your heart  ♬

207
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:06,100
♬  Let me in, so I can be with you  ♬

208
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:13,660
♬  Even if it's a dream that can't come true, it's all right  ♬

209
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:23,200
♬  So please now don't go far away, Baby, Baby.  ♬

210
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,840
♬  I hope you can look back at least once  ♬

211
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:34,440
♬  at me who am here one step behind you  ♬

212
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,400
 Sorry, I don't think I'll be able to see you today. The meeting got extended.

213
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,380
♬  Believe it or not but  ♬

214
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,860
♬  You are the only one that I can love  ♬

215
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,490
♬  Don't let me  ♬

216
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,160
 A request?

217
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,950
 I wrote a letter for the first time

218
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,030
 to my son.

219
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,810
 I was too embarrassed to give it to him.

220
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:08,160
 If wishes do come true,

221
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,720
 keep it with you

222
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,020
 and deliver it in my place.

223
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:21,500
♬  Don't ever go far away, Baby, Baby  ♬

224
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,590
It's been more than a week since Noona Jin stopped coming here.

225
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,880
She will come when she's ready.

226
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,130
You are also worried about her, aren't you?

227
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,320
 I should not have crossed paths with you to begin with.

228
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:46,080
 I should not have asked you to grant that kind of wish to begin with.

229
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:10,460
If I took care of her at home, both my mom and I would feel like we could die.

230
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,230
I took her over to a nursing home with the excuse that they'd take better care of her.

231
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,180
Now,

232
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,600
I am scared to even go back and look for her.

233
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,320
My mom was the kind of person who wouldn't accidentally buy...

234
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,390
even a single head of cabbage at the market by mistake.

235
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,410
But...

236
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,270
She has changed so much.

237
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:50,510
Is she doing this just so to give me trouble?

238
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:59,110
Dementia isn't an easy disease, you know.

239
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,600
Because it was hard for me,

240
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,650
I abandoned her at the hospital.

241
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,630
If I can't see her,

242
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:13,100
I can pretend that my mother, whom I've seen for 50 years,

243
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:18,020
was on vacation somewhere.

244
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,630
At least, instead of being with this bastardly son,

245
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,180
it must be better for her to be at the hospital right?

246
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,140
Right?

247
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,580
Last year, I let my wife go

248
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,870
and started raising my son alone.

249
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,200
I've thought about it.

250
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:00,020
If I was in the same situation, I would feel more at ease at the hospital

251
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,470
because I would hate becoming baggage for my son.

252
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,840
But

253
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,410
I think I would miss my son.

254
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:27,360
I'm really... a child who deserves death.

255
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,680
I realize that in a person's life

256
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,500
there is some kind of price to pay for everything.

257
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,110
Whether that is time, money, or health.

258
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:10,820
But... this at another level.

259
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,750
It's the same story.

260
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,020
How is it the same?

261
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,720
If Grandma had to go that far to get her wish, would Mr. Hyo Shik be any happier?

262
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,260
When his mother ended up like that?

263
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:29,940
Is there really no way to cancel her wish or to restore at least part of her memories?

264
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,860
Once a wish is made, it can never be taken back.

265
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:38,920
And she is still alive, right? That's what is important.

266
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:44,150
What do you mean by that?

267
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,360
I mean that it's not over.

268
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,110
We have to continue watching.

269
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,820
Don't judge a whole life just based on one chapter of it.

270
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,680
You have to watch it until the end

271
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,600
to know if someone will be happy or not.

272
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,930
If there are bad things, there are also good ones.

273
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,700
If you lose something, you gain something else.

274
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,520
Later, you might say,

275
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,810
"Ah! If that hadn't happened, then I wouldn't be happy today."

276
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,040
or something like it.

277
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:23,490
Life is a long path to travel. Watch it with patience.

278
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,300
The patient's condition keeps getting worse.

279
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,280
We give her stabilizers on a regular basis, but since she won't allow anyone to touch her body...

280
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,350
It is difficult to even wash her properly.

281
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,770
Even when she was young, she was the kind of person who never wanted to bother anyone.

282
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,850
You must have known that your son was here. Your face looks brighter already.

283
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,420
Mom, let's go home. I'm sorry.

284
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,820
I was wrong.

285
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:53,430
Mom, I'll be better to you.

286
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,970
Yes. We're almost there.

287
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,220
Just wait a little longer.

288
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:25,180
Oh, you're...

289
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,950
Oh! Oppa Hyo Shik?

290
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,180
You're Yeon Ok, right? Climbing team 17.

291
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,330
Ah, yes.

292
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:38,060
But do you live here?

293
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:46,240
No way. Are you the one coming for the caregiver interview today?

294
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,220
Yes, I am.

295
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,540
Oh! Pretty, pretty!

296
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,150
I'll give you something.

297
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:01,770
Don't share it with anyone else.

298
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,350
Thank you.

299
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:14,690
Come to think of it, it's been almost 30 years, right?

300
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,990
It's been 27.

301
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,200
Actually, it has been 27 years

302
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,830
and 6 months.

303
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,690
You remember very precisely.

304
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:34,770
So do you remember that time too?

305
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,190
When we want to Mount Jiri.

306
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,700
Of course, we went on a trip for 4 days and 3 nights.

307
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,670
We suffered a lot because it rained on the second day.

308
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:47,370
I said you could go down if it was too hard, but you insisted and finished it.

309
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:53,000
I was struggling so much back then and you never held my hand.

310
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,570
You didn't say anything back then.

311
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,890
Of course I wanted to hold on to you.

312
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,860
What should I do?

313
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,060
If you can't use it, then you can't use it.

314
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,980
 Don't judge a whole life just based on one chapter of it.

315
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:20,120
  You have to watch it until the end to know if someone will be happy or not.

316
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,150
  Life is a long path to travel.

317
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,990
  Watch it with patience.

318
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,790
  Noona, Grandma Bok Nan went back home.

319
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,830
Who?

320
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,130
Mmm. Delicious!

321
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,510
Thank you, Mother.

322
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,430
I'm really happy that you are enjoying eating.

323
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,640
It's really delicious.

324
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,250
Here's some tea.

325
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,510
Thank you.

326
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:22,150
She looks so comfortable nowadays.

327
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,330
This is my first time seeing her smile like this.

328
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,160
My mom was also someone who knew how to smile.

329
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,430
But she was so busy living that she forgot how to smile.

330
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:38,140
But why did you come to my house today?

331
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,220
Can I...

332
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,870
talk to your mother for a bit?

333
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,550
Grandmother,

334
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,180
I'm sorry.

335
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,590
Because of me.

336
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:05,280
I was... going to do whatever it took.

337
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:13,850
There is nothing I can do except apologize.

338
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,280
I am really,

339
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,910
really sorry.

340
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:27,190
It seems  I lost my memories?

341
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,990
Grandma.

342
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,610
Really?

343
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:48,390
Then that means my wish has come true.

344
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,590
Isn't it so?

345
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:58,600
I am the happiest now.

346
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,140
My Hyo Sik isn't alone.

347
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:08,650
So you don't have to feel sorry.

348
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:15,050
I am really grateful to you.

349
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:18,870
Even if I lose my memories again,

350
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,780
don't worry about anything.

351
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:29,130
♬  A person who will feel sorry for everything  ♬

352
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,390
I'm sorry. 
 ♬  Even after dying  ♬

353
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:41,170
♬  I live because of you  ♬

354
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,160
 Grandmother asked me to give this letter to you.

355
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,270
♬  A person who said it was a fine day  ♬

356
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,040
 Look at this, Hyo Sik.

357
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,350
 In my lifetime, everything else has aged,

358
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,110
 Wake up, wake up!

359
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:08,510
 but you still look young in my eyes

360
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:13,050
 and I can only think of you as a baby.

361
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,650
 I'm so frustrated.

362
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:20,170
 With no place to lean on,

363
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:26,260
 I'm afraid you'll be the only one left alone in this tough world.

364
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,500
 That was a big worry.

365
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:36,700
 If you are reading this letter, my wish has come true and

366
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,090
 your wife will be by your side.

367
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:44,730
 Now I'm relieved.

368
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,780
 Thanks to you,

369
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:53,120
 I was so happy every day.

370
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,840
  Thank you.

371
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,840
 Be good to your wife, too.

372
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,720
 Have a beautiful grandchild.

373
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,730
 Live happily ever after.

374
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:11,270
 This mother has nothing more to ask for.

375
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:17,980
 Thanks to you, I lived a good life.

376
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,710
Miss Witch, Noona is here!

377
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,680
Excuse me. I thought about it and—

378
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,580
Prepare the ingredients for tomorrow.

379
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,220
I'm sorry?

380
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,050
Okay.  Then, I—

381
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,620
I'll move this.

382
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,800
There must be a lot of ingredients.

383
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,420
I'll prepare them quickly.

384
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,300
I need to clean up.

385
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,170
Take this out and put it over there.

386
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,150
It's really fascinating, right?

387
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,130
Should I call it fate?

388
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:31,400
- So they are getting married next week. 
 - I see...

389
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,850
So fascinating...

390
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,840
I think it all happened for good.

391
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,660
Now I feel much better.

392
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:47,620
About... about the wedding.

393
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:52,380
If you have time, will you go with me?

394
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,390
Sure, I'll go with you.

395
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,640
What? Really?

396
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:01,270
Yes. What's so difficult about it?

397
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:11,690
 Someone receiving a bouquet. Prep team.

398
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,470
 Tom Kim: I've arrived home safely.

399
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,760
 Did you get back safely?

400
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,370
 I already miss you.

401
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:24,030
 I got back safely. Thank you.

402
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,000
 What were you doing?

403
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,700
♬  Time will leave you starving  ♬

404
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,760
 One month later

405
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,990
 Incoming call: Writer Tom Kim

406
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,300
Is he already here?

407
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,840
Are you already here?

408
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,700
Oh, I'm almost ready.

409
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:57,090
 Jin, I'm sorry. I don't think I can go because I have some urgent work.

410
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,600
 I'm really sorry. They urgently asked me to edit the manuscript.

411
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,830
That can't be helped.

412
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,690
Yes.

413
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,080
There are more people than I thought, right?

414
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,950
There he is.

415
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,400
Ahjussi.

416
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,430
- You're here? 
- Congratulations!

417
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,330
Thank you.

418
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:27,180
Mom, Jin and Gil Yong have come.

419
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,360
Jin and Gil Yong have come.

420
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,100
Congratulations!

421
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,150
Thank you.

422
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,640
Ahjussi, you look cool.

423
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,200
You both look good together. Congratulations.

424
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,020
Thank you.

425
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,990
Grandmother, congratulations.

426
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,620
You look very beautiful.

427
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,920
Let's take a picture together.

428
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,360
Okay. I will take the picture now.

429
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,430
One more.

430
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:07,270
Grandma Bok Nan's wish finally came true.

431
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:10,630
I was worried, but it's good that they look happy.

432
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,090
I have to go to the restroom.

433
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:17,160
Since it's Yeong Chun's daughter's first birthday, I asked if we'd see any celebrities that are on TV.

434
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,010
There isn't even one.

435
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,770
How can he call a celebrity?

436
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:23,290
It's a secret he got married. He even changed his name on purpose.

437
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:27,180
I guess that's why he wanted to take care of his daughter's first birthday.

438
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,820
He said he couldn't come.

439
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,720
How did he know to come here?

440
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,350
Hyung, this way.

441
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,900
You're here, Honey.

442
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,310
Da Eun is really pretty, right?

443
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,890
- Oh my, our Da Eun didn't cry today? 
 - It's your dad.

444
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:23,330
She has something on her. What's there to prepare?

445
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,980
We have to go in now.

446
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,710
 Now, in five minutes, Kim Yeong Chun and

447
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,880
 Park Seo Yeong's pretty princess,

448
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,820
 Kim Da Eun's first birthday party will begin.

449
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:40,770
 Guests outside, please come into the hall and sit down.

450
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,410
 1st birthday

451
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,500
♬  Nothing matters but who I have close to me, oh yeah  ♬

452
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:33,370

453
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:38,400
♬  If I walk this empty road a thousand miles  ♬

454
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,830
♬  with you I'll never be alone  ♬

455
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,110
 The Witch's Diner

456
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,410
 What is happening to you?

457
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:56,040
 Jin has been cursed.

458
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,470
 What do you mean by cursed?

459
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:00,430
 It isn't a coincidence that we met?

460
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,730
 She will become unhappy.

461
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,380
 No, not my Jin.

462
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,250
 I have no intention of breaking up with you. I will decide whether to end it or not.

463
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,710
 Who do you think you're touching, you bastard?!

464
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,250
 You messed with the wrong person.

465
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,060
 If it's hard, don't hold back.

466
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,630
 What if you can make a wish once more?

467
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:21,130
 I will take my revenge.

468
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,890
 Epilogue coming up

469
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:28,180
 Epilogue

470
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,860
Has it been twenty-three years?

471
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:35,280
I gave you my business card for you to come to me if something is wrong.

472
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,960
You didn't contact me.

473
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:45,230
Did you come because of Jin?

474
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,750
Yes. I came because of that child.
