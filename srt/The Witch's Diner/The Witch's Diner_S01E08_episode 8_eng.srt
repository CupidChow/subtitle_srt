 28 Years Ago

8
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,120
 There was a woman who dreamed of a normal life.

9
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,720
♬  I think I'm the only one saying this  ♬

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,730
♬  Like a lie  ♬

11
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:57,280
♬  Oh won’t you hold my hand  ♬

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,120
♬  Both on a sleepless night  ♬

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,360
♬  and when you toss and turn tomorrow comes  ♬

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,470
♬  Everything is gonna be alright  ♬

15
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,530
♬  I’ve been waiting  ♬

16
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,620
♬  my whole life for love  ♬

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:29,360
♬  Nothing is easy  ♬

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,970
♬  Sometimes it’s heavy  ♬

19
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,930
♬  feel so lonely  ♬

20
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,650
♬  Why do I feel this way  ♬

21
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:45,580
♬  It’s just another day  ♬

22
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:52,250
♬  Someone tell me  ♬

23
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,630
♬  I’m holding on holding on for you  ♬

24
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:05,080
 That woman fell in love with a man.

25
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,380
 Let's be together forever.

26
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,430
 I love you.

27
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:15,600
 And they lived happily.

28
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,030
 That's how... it normally ends.

29
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,170
 Song Han Yang 
 Seo Ae Suk

30
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,670
 Who are you?

31
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,660
 It wasn't love to begin with.

32
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,680
 So that woman decided to throw everything away.

33
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,560
 Even herself.

34
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,080
 The Witch's Diner

35
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,730
 That is why I made a curse. A curse that I never should have made.

36
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,800
 I want revenge.

37
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:48,390
 My wish is for the man's child to be as unhappy as I am.

38
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,410
 I don't care whether I become a witch or anything if I can have my revenge.

39
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:59,160
But after that, she couldn't forgive herself.

40
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,390
As much as she couldn't receive love from others,

41
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:07,050
she couldn't love herself either.

42
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,540
 And after a while, that woman

43
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,500
 realized she had a new life in her womb.

44
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,300
 The child of her lover.

45
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,210
 Please. Please.

46
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,520
 Please do something. I beg of you.

47
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,650
 I'll do anything you want so, please! Please!

48
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:41,680
 Once a wish is released, no one can retrieve it, Hui Ra.

49
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,480
 Mom, I'll do anything you want.

50
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,980
 I'll accept any punishment, Mom.

51
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,050
 Just this child, Mom. Just this child...

52
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,690
 Don't let her be like me, Mom.

53
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,050
 Abandon the child.

54
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,790
 If that child is with you, it will be more unhappy.

55
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:21,380
 Just like I did with you.

56
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,920
 If that child is with you, it will be more unhappy.

57
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,830
 Just like I did with you.

58
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,790
 Why my mother of all people?

59
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,570
How could you send me to my mom so cruelly?

60
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,430
The safest person.

61
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,630
That was your mother. That was the best decision  I could make.

62
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,980
If I couldn't block that curse,

63
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:57,230
I wanted to rectify my mistake no matter what.

64
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,780
What about me?  I thought I was born by mistake.

65
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,860
Do you know how much I hated and resented myself?

66
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,830
I thought Dad left my mom because of me and

67
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,140
my mother was hurt for life.

68
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,790
That isn't your fault. It's my fault.

69
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:30,790
But I don't regret letting you go even to this second.

70
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,600
Because the moment you were born

71
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,660
was magic to me.

72
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:59,550
I will get revenge. That is my job.

73
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,330
No.

74
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,860
I will

75
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,120
take my revenge.

76
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,170
With my hands.

77
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,620
 The Witch's Diner
 Episode 8 The Last Feast

78
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,320
 It is different from last time. The witch's powers inside you have started showing already.

79
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,470
 If you make a wish again, you will become a witch.

80
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,450
It's okay this time.

81
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,520
It will be different from the revenge I wished for last time.

82
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,520
 What are you?!

83
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,860
Roasting the heart of a calf for that man.

84
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,100
 My mother is suffering from dementia.

85
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,740
 My daughter suffers from a rare incurable disease.

86
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,150
 Strawberry whipped cream cake for his family.

87
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:14,750
 And coffee that awakens the guilt that humans have.

88
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:21,370
 This is the revenge that I have decided for myself.

89
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,300
Shall I eat this?

90
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,120
Honey!

91
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,750
Jin.

92
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,930
 One month later 
 2021 Second Round 
 Middle School and GED Certificate Examination Center

93
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,580
- Hey. Don't get nervous.
 - Don't worry.

94
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,290
Just don't rush when solving the problems. Just think of that, okay?

95
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,300
- I got it. 
 - Okay.

96
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,630
Gil Yong! Take this.

97
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,480
Eat it when you are hungry. 
 Taste of Passing

98
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,600
It's rice yeot. I like pumpkin yeot (taffy that's sticky to make knowledge stick).

99
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,100
Next time, when I take the college entrance exam, please buy me pumpkin yeot.

100
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,650
Oh, okay. Huh?

101
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:45,230
- SAT? 
 - I have to go to college too.

102
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,560
- I'll be back. 
 - Okay.

103
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,820
This guy isn't even nervous because he grew up.

104
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,420
I am all nervous.

105
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,610
- Here, Hyung. 
 - Yeah.

106
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,050
Did the exam results come out?

107
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,500
No. Not yet.

108
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,730
How have you been?

109
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,290
I'm getting ready for the regular admissions.

110
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,100
Soo Jung helped me a lot, so school is also bearable.

111
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,550
That's good.

112
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,180
There's no one who bullies you now?

113
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,860
No.

114
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,450
Ah, Hyun Woo will stop coming to school soon.

115
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,880
Suddenly? Why?

116
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:59,590
He appeared on a TV show, signed a contract with an entertainment company, and also got a fan café.

117
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,330
Do you remember Do Hyun who was along with Hyeon Woo?

118
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,020
 Ah! F*ck.

119
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,490
 He must have been bullied a lot by Hyeon Woo since middle school.

120
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,440
 He sent a video to Hyeon Wu's company and a reporter.

121
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,420
 People came to the school and it was a big mess.

122
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,280
 So as far as I know, he is going abroad to study.

123
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,200
That must be the price.

124
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,120
What?

125
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:36,100
Ah, he has been bad to his friends so that must be his punishment.

126
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:41,850
It would be nice if he learns something this time.

127
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,310
Gil Yong, did you wait for a long time?

128
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,850
No, I just came.

129
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,900
I'm coming to the theater after such a long time.

130
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,520
I already got the tickets.

131
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,750
Oh, you are sensible.

132
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,910
- Let's go. 
 - Yeah.

133
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,590
 I thought I lost my path when I went to the restaurant the first time.

134
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,810
 But now I think I know.

135
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:46,280
 Paths aren't lost. We just have to  find new ones.

136
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,480
 Every meeting between people is magic.

137
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,990
Hey, Gil Yong.

138
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:05,760
I couldn't tell you all this time, but thanks a lot.

139
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,530
I think I was able to gather my courage

140
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,630
because you were always by my side whenever I had a hard time.

141
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,530
I did nothing.

142
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,360
You must have also had a hard time after stopping track and field.

143
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,020
I learned a lot from you. You seem more like an adult than me.

144
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,730
Oh.

145
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:33,850
When I was in track and field, all I could see was the finish line in front of me,

146
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,260
but now I can see much more.

147
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:43,920
I understood after coming to The Witch's Diner that there is a path in life for everyone.

148
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,420
You have grown up, Gil Yong.

149
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:55,990
But, Noona, what curse did you wish for?

150
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,430
Ah. That?

151
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:06,070
I'll tell you next time. I made it so that he can't live properly.

152
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,550
Can't live properly?

153
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,270
- Are you leaving? 
 - Yes.

154
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:25,760
It's today. The day we decided to prepare a special dinner.

155
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,390
You look different today.

156
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,260
It's my mood.

157
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,760
You look very different.

158
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,770
- CEO Oh. 
 - Yes?

159
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,400
- Put this in the oven. 
 - Five minutes.  (Korean for oven and five minutes are homonyms.)

160
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,520
- Oven. 
 - Oven.

161
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,950
- Fifteen minutes in the oven. 
 - Fifteen minutes in the oven.

162
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,930
- Hello. 
 - Welcome.

163
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,450
Welcome.

164
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,360
Sit down.

165
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:32,010
I did hear from Jin...

166
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,210
Can we eat this?

167
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,150
Do we have to make a wish?

168
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:43,040
Exactly? Does this have any meaning?

169
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,140
It has no meaning. I made this just to eat.

170
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,250
Have wine too.

171
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,710

Congratulations on passing the 2nd GED in 2021. You can check your personal grades on the website of the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education.

172
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,730
I passed the exam, Noona.

173
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,530
Gil Yong passed the GED.

174
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,550
- Congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

175
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:20,770
Then shall we have a toast to congratulate Gil Yong?

176
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,830
Gil Yong, congratulations.

177
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,470
Congratulations.

178
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,410
Thank you.

179
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,850
I only did sports before.

180
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,940
High school.

181
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,590
Gil Yong, have this.

182
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,850
Must be tasty.

183
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,990
It's very tasty.

184
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,190
It's delicious.

185
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,570
- Clean it properly. 
 - Yes.

186
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,010
It's almost done.

187
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,540
Give it to me, Noona. I'll do it.

188
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,630
I don't want to say I'm sorry.

189
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:30,370
I'd rather say thank you.

190
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:39,390
During this long life of mine, I was so thankful to you every day that I can't express it through words.

191
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:46,020
Thanks to you, I also could live.

192
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,490
I wanted to have a child.

193
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,200
I prayed every day, but God didn't give me one.

194
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,610
I thought it wouldn't happen in my life.

195
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,390
The day I first held Jin,

196
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:17,000
 looking at her holding my finger, I knew.

197
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,570
It was all because I was meant to meet her.

198
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,420
I thought a lot.

199
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:36,020
Jin was just Jin.

200
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,240
Whoever gave birth to her or whoever raised her.

201
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,780
She is just our pretty and precious daughter no matter what.

202
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,190
You still have the chance to make a wish.

203
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,520
You already fulfilled my wish.

204
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,920
Meeting Jin was a miracle and magic to me.

205
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:39,420
You asked me what curse I wished for him, right?

206
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,990
I didn't wish for a curse.

207
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:50,960
What I wished for wasn't a curse but a wish.

208
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,710
 Roasting a calf heart to restore the conscience he had lost.

209
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:01,680
 I ate a strawberry cake for the happiness of that family.

210
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,390
I can't understand.

211
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:07,710
People like him shouldn't get forgiveness.

212
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:16,110
Not me, but he will punish himself.

213
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,100
Honey.

214
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,160
Are you okay?

215
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,800
Are you really okay?

216
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:36,990
I thought something happened to you and was very scared.

217
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:41,760
 Honestly, I didn't wish for only happiness.

218
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,570
 He has publicized his family and is now known as an icon of a family man.

219
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:50,600
 He will lose everything because of his mistake.

220
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,430
 He will be scared.

221
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:57,810
 The past can't be erased, and the world will be watching him.

222
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:01,880
But guilt would be less.

223
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:08,180
In fact, the combination of that roasted heart and coffee has side effects.

224
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,070
Side effect?

225
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,600
Someday, he will experience worse than hell when he

226
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,810
does something that will make him guilty.

227
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,890
 The Witch's Diner

228
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,620
Are you leaving?

229
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,420
Where are you going? What about this restaurant?

230
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,850
You are here.

231
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,030
What will I do? How can a Witch's Diner exist without the witch?

232
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:49,120
Did you forget that you are also a witch?

233
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,350
My house now is also all yours.

234
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:57,790
I am curious as to how different a witch you will become.

235
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:02,280
Then, will you never come back?

236
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,320
I'm just going away for a while.

237
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,370
Take care of the place till then.

238
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,630
The car is ready outside.

239
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,030
Then, when will you be back?

240
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,070
Even I don't know.

241
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:27,390
I started loving my job thanks to you.

242
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,110
I don't plan on retiring either.

243
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:42,700
 I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of witch Jin will become

244
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,910
 I thought of my old self too. It was fun back then.

245
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,760
 Fun? I was having a hard time covering up your mess.

246
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,710
 Just drive if you are going to nag.

247
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,690
Why in the world does she smoke these?

248
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,330
 I think I know now

249
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:24,370
 that by just telling someone how we feel, we can cheer up.

250
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,100
 That was the best decision for us.

251
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:42,190
 You gave it up yourself. How can you expect happiness?

252
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,650
 I'm the happiest right now.

253
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:56,140
 My Hyo Sik isn't alone either.

254
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:07,570
 In retrospect, meaningless moments  did not exist.

255
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:10,510
 All the time that passed by me,

256
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:14,390
 all the people, all the moments,

257
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,230
 were leading me and reaching out to me.

258
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,920
Gil Yong.

259
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:47,050
 Being a supporter isn't that easy.

260
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:52,960
 You're going to have to study law. You're going to have to learn tax accounting.

261
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,170
 Will life be a 180-degree difference if I become a witch or the supporter?

262
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,970
 It depends on your feelings.

263
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,110
 The path Noona is going on

264
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,830
 must be very lonely.

265
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,510
 It's a lonely path

266
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,930
 because it's a special path.

267
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:21,230
 Witches have existed for the sake of the powerless for a long time

268
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:26,670
 to hold the hands of the powerless in the world when they reach out.

269
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:32,210
 Just like witches do what they can for the people of the world,

270
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:38,820
 supporters do everything they can for such witches.

271
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,780
♬  much as you  ♬

272
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,370
♬  Nothing matters but  ♬

273
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,270
 Fighting!  
♬  who I have close to me  ♬

274
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,340
♬  Oh yeah  ♬

275
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,510
 Lee Gil Yong

276
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:06,990
♬  If I walk this empty road  ♬

277
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:10,690
From now on, I'm your shadow.

278
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,210
You've heard of the supporter, haven't you?

279
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,100
Are you sure you'll be okay?

280
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,240
Of course.

281
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,210
Are you sure you won't regret it?

282
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,650
- It's a difficult road. 
 - I know.

283
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,290
Why are you trying to go down that difficult road without me? Where do you have someone like me?

284
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,400
I look forward to working together.

285
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:36,350
♬  If I walk this empty road a thousand miles  ♬

286
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:40,750
♬  with you I'll never be alone  ♬

287
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,460
 The Witch's Diner

288
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:55,160
I really wanted to write well.

289
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,620
I dreamed of being a novelist since I was young.

290
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:04,250
For years, I have been really only eating ramen and writing.

291
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:10,130
Finally, I had an opportunity to meet an editor and be published.

292
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:16,280
What I'm writing right now is a thriller.

293
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,070
Murder crime or something like that.

294
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,840
The editor said,

295
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,760
"You're not bad at writing, but I don't think it's an item."

296
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,100
So we decided to have a meeting with a new novel,

297
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:38,970
but it's been a week and I can't think of anything.

298
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,850
I wish it was written out like magic.

299
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:49,760
So in conclusion you want to finish a new novel?

300
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,240
It's an apple pie.

301
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,620
If you eat this, your wish will come true.

302
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,110
Though, there will be a cost.

303
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,630
A cost?

304
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,350
You have

305
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,370
a beautiful wrist.

306
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,220
My wrist?

307
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:37,090
Should I call this a joint?

308
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:43,420
Your bone joints must hurt a little.

309
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,350
Bone joint...

310
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,020
I don't mind, as long as this novel is well written.

311
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,250
It's so delicious.

312
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,790
I've never had such a delicious pie before.

313
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,570
 Even in the moments we thought were the end and in the moments we struggled alone,

314
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,350
 we are not alone.

315
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,580
 Restaurant Fantasy

316
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,000
No.

317
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,570
I made a wish, but why isn't it being written?

318
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,370
Forget it!

319
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,880
 Witch ng t dya t

320
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:01,090
 The Witch's Diner

321
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,210
 There is a restaurant here. In some alleyway that is neither flashy nor quiet, it looks so ordinary that you pass by it without noticing it.

322
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,140
Wow, it feels stiff.

323
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,120
 Roopretelcham. Everything will work out.

324
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,750
 the way I thought it would.

325
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,880
Hm. A good university? 
  Kim Su Jeong, 19 years old.

326
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,510
But I'm not sure what I want to do yet.

327
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,740
Of course, it's a job. 
  Kim Su Yeob, 27 years old.

328

329
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,860
I want to be financially independent.

330
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,070
Dating? Marriage? 
  Lee Yun Mi, 28 years old.

331
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:37,070
I really want to find my destined partner.

332
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,130
Traveling around the world with a backpack. 
  Ji Yong Ho, 31 years old.

333
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,310
I don't need anything else. 
  Jang Yeon Ju, 46 years old.

334
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:43,030
I hope my children grow up healthy and well.

335
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,930
I'd like to challenge myself to do what I really want to someday. 
  Kim Na Gyeong, 29 years old.

336
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:53,490
Traveling with my wife, whom I haven't been able to take care of. 
  Im Jong Chan, 53 years old.

337
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,640
And live comfortably?

338
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,690
I wish I could be ten years younger. 
  Hwang Myeong Sun

339
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,440
I still have a lot of things I want to do.

340
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,330
Stocks to hit the jackpot. 
  Jo Hwi Gyeong, 27 years old.

341
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,080
A promotion. 
  Han Jong Eun, 41 years old.

342
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,160
I hope my son 
  Ok Ju Ri, 57 years old.

343
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,110
can go to the university he wants...

344
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,520
For my ability to live a second life  
  Yu Hyo Jong, 71 years old.

345
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,420
with all its challenges to be recognized.

346
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:13,260
I hope my father is not sick and lives a healthy life 
  Park Gyeong Hu, 45 years old.

347
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,440
smiling. There's nothing more I can ask for.

348
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,540
 The more you believe in yourself, the more you believe it, the more magical it is.

349
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,330
 Such magic certainly exists.

350
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,400
 Your life is also no exception.

351
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,840
 So if you happen to find the Witch's Diner on the street,

352
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,080
 please come in without any hesitation.

353
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,950
Are you ready?

354
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,890
Yes.

355
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,390
- You too? 
 - Yes.

356

 The Witch's Diner

366
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:48,150
I have a handsome and wonderful son like this. 
  Epilogue

367
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,180
I'm going to die soon, but my child worries a lot about me.

368
00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:00,950
I'm worried about my child's wounds after I leave.

369
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,620
I... I want my son

370
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:12,510
to be unwaveringly strong and happy without me.

371
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:15,090
That's my wish.

372
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,780
Everyone else made a wish for themselves.

373
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,140
I'm a mother.

374
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:30,120
My happiness is that my child lives happily.

375
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,760
I'll grant you that wish.

376
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,250
Your child will be happy.

377
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,430
But I will make the cost be a test.

378
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,120
A test without any suffering.

379
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,810
No one can realize the happiness they have, right?

380
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:03,990
