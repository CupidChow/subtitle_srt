1
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:09,926
Mo-mi, you ready?

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,886
Thank you!

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,307
-Wow, wasn't it an awesome performance?
-Yes!

4
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,978
Next is a solo performance
by Miss Kim Mo-mi of Love Kindergarten.

5
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,730
Let's give it up for Miss Mo-mi.

6
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,665
My name is Kim Mo-mi.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,919
When I was young,
I dreamed of becoming a famous performer.

8
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:51,301
Nothing made me as happy
as dancing on the stage.

9
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,153
1989 DAESAN-SI JOINT TALENT SHOW

10
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,994
Hearing people clap and cheer
made me so happy.

11
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:28,546
But my looks became a far cry
from those of a celebrity.

12
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,384
What are you doing?

13
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,352
You want to be a singer
with a face like that?

14
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,562
Maybe in your dreams.

15
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,569
I always wondered

16
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,199
why my mom was pretty, but I wasn't.

17
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:05,291
SUJEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL TRIP
TALENT SHOW

18
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,378
I entered middle school,
but nothing changed.

19
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,422
No, things got worse.

20
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,966
Wow, you're ugly!

21
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,763
Next is a dance squad performance
by Grade Eight, Class Five!

22
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,348
Let's give it up!

23
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:24,644
You're pretty!

24
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:41,077
THE EIGHTH SCHOOL FESTIVAL
JEONGMIN GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

25
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,500
Hey. I can't see.

26
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,335
Scooch down a bit.

27
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:52,922
More.

28
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,300
Good.

29
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,388
As time passed,

30
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,557
my dream faded away.

31
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,189
Now I'm 27 years old.

32
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,526
Despite wanting to live
a life different from others,

33
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,113
I ended up living like everyone else.

34
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:49,771
But I still love
the cheers and applause people give me.

35
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,214
Everyone, I'm starting the live stream.

KIM MO-MI

52
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,557
Hey, Kim Mo-mi.

53
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,100
Hi, Sang-sun.

54
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,482
Why do you look so tired?

55
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,484
Do I?

56
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,068
Your skin looks so dry.

57
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,613
You've looked like that a lot lately.

58
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,616
Have you been doing something
after work?

59
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,326
No, nothing.

60
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,161
Yeah?

61
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,998
Have some coffee, Mr. Oh.

62
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,211
Mr. Kim.

63
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,921
Have some coffee.

64
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,010
I love the coffee
you make the most, Ms. Lee.

65
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,513
Oh, it's just an instant coffee mix.

66
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,473
Nah, it's not. It's different.

67
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,434
Coffee tastes different
depending on who makes it.

68
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,064
It totally does.

69
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,442
Yes, of course. It does.

70
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,447
Those pigs are pissing me off,
and it's only morning.

71
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,657
I know, right?

72
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,577
They don't realize it's sexual harassment.
I'm gonna report them to HR one day.

73
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,454
Those jerks need a taste
of their own medicine.

74
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,666
Why is that bitch A-reum serving coffee
first thing in the morning?

75
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,460
She's making
all female employees look bad.

76
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,963
She got her eyes done
and probably her nose too.

77
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,882
You plastic surgery scanner!

78
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,676
She put pads in her bras too.

79
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,469
I bet she's smaller than a 75A.

80
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,012
God, I hate that bitch.

81
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,474
She just transferred here,
and she's already flirting with men.

82
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,767
So full of shit!

83
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,061
Oh, hi. Good morning.

84
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,354
Hey, Park's here.

85
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,481
Hi.

86
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,667
-Mr. Park.
-Yes?

87
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,961
-Have some coffee.
-Oh, I'm all right.

88
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,007
Well, anyway, thank you.

89
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,051
And by the way, Ms. Lee,

90
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,846
no need to do this from now on.

91
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,765
You didn't come to work to make coffee.

92
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,018
Yes, I understand.

93
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,104
He is the best, as always.

94
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,567
He's different from other men.

95
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,277
A MONTH AGO

96
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,031
When we compare our net profits
in 2007 and 2008 with other competitors

97
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,409
who belatedly entered
the smart mobile system business…

98
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,162
You know how they say

99
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,497
a new universe opens up
when you fall in love?

100
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,877
It feels as though the world
l knew yesterday was disappearing.

101
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,339
It's safe to say we've established
an unrivaled position in the industry

102
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,675
due to our continuous system development
since the early 2000s…

103
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,513
He's taller than the average model.

104
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,557
Looks perfect in a suit.

105
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,894
He has broad shoulders.

106
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,980
A face that exudes intelligence.

107
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,941
He comes off as cold…

108
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,652
Hi.

109
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,945
…but is sweet once you get to know him.

110
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,449
And he's so capable
that he shot up the career ladder.

111
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,536
He's perfect in every way,
but there is just one flaw.

112
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,456
He's married.

113
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,587
I know I shouldn't be doing this,

114
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,924
but when I see him focused on his work,

115
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,926
I can't take my eyes off him.

116
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,865
Is this clinic for real?

117
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,910
They did such a great job.

142
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,791
Do I look pretty?

143
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,708
YOU LOOK GOOD IN ANYTHING

144
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,626
Pretty?

145
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,878
SO PRETTY! IT'S PRETTY! YOU'RE THE BEST
BUT WHY DON'T YOU EVER TAKE OFF YOUR MASK?

146
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,171
Do you wanna know what I look like?

147
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,548

I don't let that stuff hurt me.

152
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:33,187
But you all know
that these girls are real, right?

153
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,022
HOW ARE THEY REAL?
SO SELF-CONFIDENT!

154
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,608
I'm so happy that I have all of you.

155
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,070
I love you, everyone!

156

157

This is the worst. The worst!

158
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,702
Ms. Kim Mo-mi.
Didn't you learn accounting?

159
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:53,415
What am I supposed to do if you get
the most basic accounting wrong?

160
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,001
I'm sorry, sir.

161
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,809
What are you doing?

162
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:20,442
Hey, he took it way too far,
embarrassing you in front of people.

163
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:26,240
There isn't a single bastard who thinks
he's fantastic and is kind to others.

164
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,784
That's oppressive behavior
in the workplace!

165
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,205
Have you checked Park's social media?

166
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,207
I'm not friends with him on there.

167
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,293
Park has a disease, you know.

168
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:38,878
What?

169
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,629
He's a stage four douchebag.

170
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:45,634
I mean, why does he upload pictures
of his abs on there? It's disgusting.

171
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,262
Picture of his abs?

172
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,432
Can you show me?

173
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,894
You're also in stage four, huh?

174
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,647
How come I'm the only normal one
in this company?

175
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,816
Hey, where are you going?

176
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,235
Come on, show me his abs!

177
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,571
You know, Winnie-the-Pooh?

178
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,488
Yes.

179
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,617
Know what he's called when he fights?

180
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,996
Winnie-Slap? Punch-Pooh? Fight…

181
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,372
-Fight…
-Kung Pooh.

182
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,500
-Kung?
-Kung Pooh? Oh, like Kung fu!

183
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,460
Kung Pooh!

184
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,339
-That was a good one.
-Your glass is empty.

185
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,633
Mr. Park! Let me pour you a drink.

186
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,676
No, it's all right. I'll pour my own.

187
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,386
Come on, boss!

188
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,098
Pretty Ms. Lee is offering,
so you should take it.

189
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,016
It's fine.

190
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,018
-Pour me a drink, then?
-Sure.

191
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,231
Mr. Oh.

192
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,193
Telling women to pour drinks
is blatant sexual harassment.

193
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,945
How so?

194
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,657
I'm simply getting a drink
from my junior employee.

195
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,075
How's this sexual harassment?

196
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,785
-You know.
-That's not what I'm saying.

197
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:56,747
Mr. Park feels uncomfortable
when female employees pour him drinks.

198
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,209
-Regardless of sex, they're all the same.
-Oh, okay.

199
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,794
Don't be ridiculous.

200
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,714
Is a man touching a woman's chest the same
as a woman touching a man's?

201
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,717
Ms. Yoo, did I ask her
to let me touch her chest?

202
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,928
I only asked for a drink. Is this a chest?

203
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:11,887
Okay.

204
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,431
-I'm just saying.
-That's enough.

205
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,975
You know what, boss?

206
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,437
Have you ever seen this?

207
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,855
What is this?

208
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,650
Kids are out of control these days.

209
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,985
If they do this,

210
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,404
people donate Heart Pangs left and right.

211
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,030
It gets really crazy.

212
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,865
What are Heart Pangs?

213
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,993
It's all money, of course.

214
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,579
Tons of kids are trying
to make money this way now.

215
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,206
Wow!

216
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,584
Jeez. Young people are
just out of their minds.

217
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,671
The hottest one here is this one.

218
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,964
Mask Girl.

219
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,137
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, it's all right.

220
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,221
What happened?

221
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,597
I'm so sorry.

222
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,559
Gosh, Mr. Kim. Seriously?
Watching stuff like that?

223
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,102
I'm so disappointed.

224
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,271
What do you mean, "stuff like that"?

225
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,649
It's all to keep up
with the current trends.

226
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,026
The current trends!

227
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,237
Trends, my fucking ass.

228
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,574
He watches those obscene live streams
every day and jerks himself off.

229
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,785
They aren't that obscene,
those live streams.

230
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,703
What?

231
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,038
Huh?

232
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,249
I saw it in an article somewhere,

233
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,210
and they called it new media.

234
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,880
Apparently, that's how people interact
these days.

235
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,424
Hey. What new media?

236
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,176
All right.

237
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,345
If you're up for a second round,
go for it.

238
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:36,930
I'm heading home.

239
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:40,267
What are you talking about?
You need to come with us!

240
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,314
I want to,
but my wife wasn't feeling well today.

241
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,400
Oh, I see. Then you should go.

242
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,485
-Goodbye, sir.
-Bye.

243
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,861
Wait a second. My phone.

244
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,697
Oh, you left something on the table?

245
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,785
Well, how about we go
for a second round, then? Good?

246
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,411
I'm down! Sounds great.

247
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,454
I'm sorry.

248
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,790
I think I need to go home too.

249
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,376
My mom said she was coming over.

250
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,339
Hey, you said you cut ties with your mom
a long time ago.

251
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,717
What are you saying? Why would I do that?

252
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,720
Sure, you should go
since your mother is visiting you.

253
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,888
So, go ahead.

254
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,681
-Ms. Lee.
-Yes?

255
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,308
You're coming, right?

256
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,560
Of course!

257
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,313
-Okay!
-Okay!

258
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,316
What about you, Ms. Yoo? Nothing pressing?

259
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,734
None.

260
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,946
What the heck?
Nothing is going on at home, Ms. Yoo?

261
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,447
Mr. Oh.

262
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,366
Mr. Oh!

263
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,283
Yes, sir.

264
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,411
Even if you're disappointed,
you can't say that outright!

265
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,788
Oh, I'm sorry.

266
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:43,831
Mr. Kim!

267
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,250
All right. I'll be off, then.

268
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,293
-Yes, sir.
-Don't drink too much!

269
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,462
-Goodbye, sir!
-Good night, sir.

270
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,588
-Goodbye.
-Taxi!

271
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,091
Mr. Park.

272
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,053
If you're heading toward
the Cheonpo-gu Office,

273
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,472
could you drop me off on the way?

274
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,015
What?

275
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,059
I moved near Osan Pass, so…

276
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,186
Oh, you did?

277
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:07,896
Sure, get in.

278
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,864
Thank you.

279
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,950
No problem. It's on the way anyway.

280
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,086
Oh. Hello? Yeah.

281
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,047
Yeah, I'm on my way now.

282
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:34,965
Yes.

283
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,593
No. I didn't drink that much. Yeah.

284
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,846
I think I'll be home in about 30 minutes.

285
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:42,806
Yeah. Right now?

286
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,396
I'm by myself.

287
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,858
The rest of the team is still drinking.

288
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,198
Okay. Yeah. I'll see you soon.

289
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,074
Bye.

290
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,665
Oh, that was my wife.

291
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,792
Oh, right.

292
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,805
Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.

293
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,265
Sure. See you.

294
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,658
Why did Mr. Park say he was alone?

295
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,662
Why did he hide the fact
that he was with me?

296
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,582
Was he conscious of me?

297
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,417
Why?

298
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,170
Wait, no way.

299
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,426
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU!

300
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,928
HI!
LET'S GET STARTED!

301
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,056
I have a question.

302
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,891
Can I ask you guys?

303
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:08,892
WHAT IS IT?
ASK AWAY!

304
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,771
I got into a taxi with my boss today.
He's married.

305
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,358
No, it was totally coincidental.

306
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,152
My place is on the way to his, that's why.

307
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,195
Anyway.

308
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,282
On the way, his wife called him, right?

309
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,285
But even though he was
in the taxi with me,

310
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,871
he lied to his wife,
saying that he was alone.

311
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,710
Why did he do that?

312
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,503
HE JUST COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO EXPLAIN

313
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,629
Well, then.

314
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:41,008
He could've said he was with a coworker
whose place was on the way.

315
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,217
I THINK HE HAS THE HOTS FOR YOU

316
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,261
Right? You think so too, right?

317
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,096
MASK GIRL, YOU'RE SO DELUSIONAL

318
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,683
BRAD PIT HAS BEEN KICKED FROM THE CHAT

319
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,226
How about this?

320
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,148
A while back, I told him,
"Oh, your cologne smells really nice."

321
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,359
Then he started to only wear that cologne.

322
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,694
ISN'T THAT JUST A COINCIDENCE?

323
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:06,992
But as I'm sure you already know,
I have no feelings whatsoever for him.

324
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,203
HANDSOME MONK: BE CAREFUL OF MARRIED MEN!
HE'LL GIVE UP IF YOU DRAW A CLEAR LINE

325
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,163
You're right.

326
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,540
I should set clear boundaries.

327
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,751
IF YOU DATE THAT MAN, I'LL KILL MYSELF

328
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,127
DATE ME!
I'M AGAINST YOU DATING!

329
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,171
I'm so touched!

330
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,298
I'm always yours.

331
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,425
You all know that, right?

332
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,177
I will never leave you!

333
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,219
200
HOT HIGHSCHOOLER

334
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,554
1,000
MADAM FANTASY

335
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,722
I love you, everyone!

336
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,856
Why does he look so serious today?

337
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,090
Breaking news. Park updated his socials.

338
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,095
PARK GI-HUN'S PAGE

339
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,262
THINKING…

340
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,642
God, someone needs to check him
into the hospital.

341
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,145
This is severe. Too severe.

342
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,523
Come on. How many times is this now?

343
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,733
I'm sorry.

344
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,443
Do it over.

345
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,253
What's gotten into him?
Getting mad at that flirty fox?

346
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,005
Work is work. If you make a mistake,
you get reprimanded.

347
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,175
As you know, Mr. Park never
mixes business with pleasure.

348
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,866
Do you still have a lot to do?

349
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,493
Oh, no. I'm almost done too.

350
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,661
I see.

351
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,959
Don't feel too bad
about how Mr. Park yelled at you today.

352
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:25,088
You see, Mr. Park is a gentleman,
but he can get intense

353
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,507
when it comes to work.

354
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,218
Oh, I see.

355
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,179
I'll be off, then.

356
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,638
-Goodbye.
-Keep it up.

357
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,830
Come on, don't be angry.

358
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:45,835
I did that just in case people talk about
how I'm playing favorites with you, babe.

359
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,504
But still, you were too mean.

360
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,923
I don't like it when you do that
in front of people.

361
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,802
Okay. You're prettier when you're angry.

362
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,144
MASK GIRL! YOU'LL GET SUSPENDED

363
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,188
THOSE ARE REAL BOOBS

364
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,523
SHIT, I'M LATE. SHARE THE VIDEO

365
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,566
COULD'VE SEEN HER FACE
IF SHE WENT ON A BIT

366
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,026
BUT THE MASK STAYS ON

367
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,319
A REAL-TIME NUDE SHOW, CRAZY

368
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,821
ALL NUDE, FUCKING CRAZY

369
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,907
CHAT SERVICES WILL BE LIMITED
DURING SUSPENSION

370
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,579
THIS STREAMER HAS BEEN SUSPENDED

371
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,416
DUE TO A VIOLATION OF RULES AND CONDUCT
DURING LIVE STREAMING

372
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,218
A REAL-TIME NUDE SHOW, CRAZY
ALL NUDE, FUCKING CRAZY

373
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,136
Die.

374
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,430
Die, Kim Mo-mi.

375
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,183
Die. You need to die.

376
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,727
Damn it.

377
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:36,483
This is all because
of that temptress bitch, Lee A-reum.

378
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,818
If only that bitch wasn't around.

379
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,320
Hey, over here! Mo-mi.

380
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,739
Hurry up, girl.

381
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,074
-You know what time it is? I'm hungry.
-Sorry.

382
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,786
-You're always late.
-Hey, what the heck is this?

383
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,870
-An iPhone?
-What?

384
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:52,040
We all joined the company at the same time
and meet up regularly.

385
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,541
I went stress shopping.

386
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,919
If something becomes
the subject of gossip to them,

387
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,088
it will spread like wildfire.

388
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,173
She's rich.

389
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,675
You know,

390
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:07,138
I saw something strange recently.

391
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,932
Something strange? Like what?

392
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,684
Well…

393
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:15,772
Never mind.

394
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,274
Hey…

395
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,568
You know I hate stuff like this.
I hate it.

396
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,196
-I'm so annoyed.
-Why stop in the middle?

397
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,906
-Seriously. Come on.
-What the heck?

398
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,574
This is a secret though.

399
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,452
You can't tell anyone.

400
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,163
Of course! Don't you trust us?

401
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,084
-Really? Oh my gosh.
-No way!

402
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,418
-Oh my gosh!
-Really?

403
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,046
-Wow, I just got chills.
-I'm not that surprised.

404
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,549
-Park even has a kid.
-You're right.

405
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,633
Good morning.

406
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,426
-Oh, hello.
-Good morning.

407
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,096
Hi. Coffee in the morning, of course.

408
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,685
A-reum's cute though.

409
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,147
Park is such a bastard.

410
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,984
The ones who have it all
are the worst. Damn it.

411
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,111
I mean,

412
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,863
how could they do that?

413
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:05,989
Exactly.

414
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,867
Doesn't she feel bad
for Mr. Park's wife at all?

415
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,579
She thinks she can live a happy life
when she's ruined someone else's.

416
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,383
Wow.

417
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:29,721
I heard that A-reum's pregnant.
She comes to work with a huge belly.

418
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:30,930
-No way!
-I know.

419
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,141
No. She's already had the baby.

420
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,101
Park's been living two lives for a while.

421
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,644
-Oh my gosh.
-Isn't it wild?

422
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,645
Really?

423
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,106
That's not true!

424
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,609
What do you mean, "two lives"?

425
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,570
"Had a baby"? Don't be ridiculous.

426
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,497
Park and Lee got called to HR.

427
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,666
Really? Why?

428
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,336
What do you mean, "why"?
Their affair has been exposed.

429
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,503
Oh no.

430
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,839
What do you mean?
You're the one who told us.

431
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,190
Excuse me.

432
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:23,900
Yes?

433
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,114
No, it's nothing.

434
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,689
Sorry about that.

435
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,903
Taxi!

436
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,947
Damn it!

437
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,658
Do you hate me too?

438
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,243
Just go!

439
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,163
My head.

440
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,340
Mr. Park.

441
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,138
What is this?

442
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,267
A telephone pole is talking.

443
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,602
Hold on.

444
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,940
Mr. Park, are you okay?

445
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,406
Screw this.

446
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,533
Oh, Mr. Park, you're very drunk.

447
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,410
What are you doing? Let go.

448
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,747
Come on, let go.

449
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,460
I'm gonna die!

450
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,420
-What are you doing?
-I'm gonna die.

451
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,547
Stop it, please.

452
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,632
I actually almost died.

453
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,385
Hey! Taxi!

454
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,262
I might as well die.

455
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,932
They're all mean to me.

456
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,295
Gosh, Mr. Park.

457
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,424
Pull yourself together. Please?

458
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,053
We're in front of the Cheonpo-gu Office.

459
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,598
Which way is your house?

460
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,141
Mr. Park!

461
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,025
I can't believe this.

462
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,864
Winnie-the-Pooh is…

463
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,951
MOTEL

464
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,796
His clothes are all wet.

465
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,063
Mr. Park.

466
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,360
Don't you think

467
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,614
we shouldn't be doing this?

468
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:56,232
I see. So, now that Mr. Park's gone,
you're gonna be shamelessly late?

469
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,818
Well? Was there a subway jam again?

470
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,112
I guess the subway could get traffic jams.

471
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,829
Park quit.

472
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,622
Lee A-reum got transferred.

473
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,046
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

474
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,799
You didn't send me
the organized sales data yesterday.

475
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,551
Right away, sir.

476
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,187
FROM: UNKNOWN
SUBJECT: I ♡♡♡♡ YOU

477
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,399
I KNOW YOU
MASK GIRL

478
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,235
What? What's going on?

479
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,529
Nothing.

480
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,631
I KNOW YOU
MASK GIRL

481
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,606
OMG A NUDE SHOW LOL

482
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,150
A REAL-TIME NUDE SHOW

483
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,860
ALL NUDE, FUCKING CRAZY

484
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,320
THX FOR THE GOOD SHOW

485
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,780
EVERYONE, SCREEN CAPPING THIS?

486
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,198
SOMEONE SHARE THEM WITH ME, PLEASE

487
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,366
SCREEN GRABBED

488
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,700
FUCK, HAHA, IS SHE CRAZY?

489
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,701
BUT THE MASK STAYS ON

490
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,119
STRIP AND GO FOR THE SUSPENSION!

491
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,615
NEW MESSAGE
TO: OFFICE MANAGER PARK GI-HUN

492
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,704
MR. PARK, I'D LIKE TO MEET WITH YOU

493
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,339
Excuse me.

494
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,134
What are you doing?

495
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,219
Pardon?

496
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,304
Why did you touch me?

497
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,515
I touched what?

498
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,393
You just touched my butt!

499
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:38,811
I did?

500
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,439
Were you dreaming?

501
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,607
Why would I touch your butt?

502
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,444
You literally just touched my butt.

503
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,452
-Get off.
-What? Why should I get off?

504
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,871
-I'm telling you to get off!
-Why would I do that?

505
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,122
Get off now!

506
00:40:58,706 --> 00:40:59,582
-Shit!
-Damn it!

507
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,128
He really touched you, right?

508
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,131
Why would I lie about something like this?

509
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,800
Do you even have proof that I did?

510
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,095
Don't accuse an innocent man.

511
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,306
Look in the mirror.

512
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,933
Why would I touch the butt
of someone like you?

513
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,102
Hey, mister. Don't say stuff like that.

514
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,937
You little tiny-ass bastard!

515
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,023
-Damn it! Hey!
-The hell you didn't!

516
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,232
-You prick!
-Please.

517
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,150
Stop!

518
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,359
Let go! She is crazy!

519
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,112
You sent the email too! Didn't you?

520
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,447
Don't fight, please!

521
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,698
Stop!

522
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,617
So, you're saying

523
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,036
he sent some weird email,

524
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,747
followed you, and molested you? Yes?

525
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,502
So I'm trying to tell you

526
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,631
that it's highly likely
that may be the case.

527
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,091
All right, well,

528
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,552
why don't we wrap it up for now?

529
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,930
You both have jobs.

530
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:59,850
I'm sure it'd be better to settle this now
than to blow things up.

531
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,560
How can I settle like this?

532
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,396
This bastard really touched me.

533
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,233
-No, I won't settle.
-Miss.

534
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,861
You committed assault too.

535
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,373

00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,167
What a fucking shitty day!
