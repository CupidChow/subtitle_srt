1
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:58,386
MASK GIRL

2
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,474
KIM MO-MI

3
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,228
Next person, come in.

4
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,608
Open your mouth.

5
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,072
Next person, come in.

6
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,551
Open your mouth.

7
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,681
Tilt your head up.

8
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,060
Lift your tongue.

9
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,525
Turn around, spread your legs,
and bend over.

10
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,324
Bend over.

11
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,379
Oh jeez!

12
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,923
So, you're the Mask Girl, the one on TV?

13
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,592
You look way better in person.

14
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,806
Gosh, it's not that obvious
that you've had plastic surgery.

15
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,058
People said you were a Frankendoll,

16
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,768
but you don't look like one.

17
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,770
So, how much did it cost?

18
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,818
Thirty million won.

19
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,361
Thirty million?

20
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,280
She said 30 million!

21
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,786
Eyes and nose are given.

22
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,538
Cheekbones?

23
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,206
Forehead?

24
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,792
Jaw contouring too?

25
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,130
Wow. What else?
Did you get a boob job too?

26
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,467
These are all mine.

27
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,677
She got everything done except her boobs!

28
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,684
Honestly though.

29
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,978
If surgery would make me pretty,
I wanna try it.

30
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,648
Did she really get plastic surgery?
Wow, it looks so natural.

31
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,318
Get a neck lift for your sagging skin.

32
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,905
And get the under-eye fat removed.
You'll look much younger.

33
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,910
A little nose job would help too.

34
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,870
So, basically, get a whole new face?

35
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,749
What a pro!

36
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:18,753
Hook me up if you know a good doctor.
I gotta get my face remodeled.

37
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,839
Jeez, get everything done?
And what, milk another man dry?

38
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:26,636
So, you're gonna sink your teeth
into a man and live an easy life?

39
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,389
You're all such a shit show.

40
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,057
All fucking insane, jeez.

41
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,854
Oh my. It's cold. Let's go.

42
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,858
Move aside.

43
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,488
Girl, don't stare!

44
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,328
Who is that woman?

45
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,747
That's An Eun-suk.

46
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,333
An Eun-suk?

47
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:03,005
That woman's the queen here.
She even has the warden under her thumb.

48
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,718
She's connected
with politicians and conglomerates.

49
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,805
She can get you released
and a high-ranking job.

50
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:11,764
Really?

51
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,558
Yeah. Look away! Don't stare!

52
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,189
Listen, she gets skincare here
and even brings in shamans to do rituals.

53
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,232
It's cold.

54
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,484
How did she end up in here anyway?

55
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,282
Solicitation of murder.

56
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:33,995
She hired a guy to chop her husband
and his mistress into pieces. It's crazy.

57
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,414
Oh, right. You did it too.

58
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,377
Hey, An is calling you.

59
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,444
Something wrong with your legs?

60
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,154
Excuse me?

61
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,780
You took your time to get here.

62
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,250
So, you're Mask Girl?

63
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:22,919
Yes.

64
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,138
You look fucking similar.

65
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,809
Too fucking similar to the bitch
who seduced my husband.

66
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,648
So stay out of my sight

67
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,275
if you don't wanna die.

68
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,595
Please.

69
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,942
Why not give her any food?

70
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,653
She's here for adultery.

71
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,447
An Eun-suk made a rule

72
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,033
that adulteresses must starve
for three days.

73
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,174
Hey. What are you doing?

74
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,259
She must be starving.

75
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,471
You're setting yourself up for trouble.

76
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,687
It's fine.

77
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,650
I doubt that would be the case.

78
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,695
Enjoy your meal.

79
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,691
My face is like an apple

80
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,527
So shiny and so pretty

81
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,988
Got my eyes done, got my nose done

82
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:01,911
Got my entire face done

83
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,169
You freaking…

84
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,296
What are you staring at?

85
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,382
Hey.

86
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:16,842
Hey, you!

87
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,805
Seriously, you fucking bitch!

88
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,141
Should I shove you in the washer
and wash you clean too?

89
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:35,528
Don't get nosy. And mind your own
damn business if you don't want to die.

90
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,200
What?

91
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,204
Should I make your face
all crooked again? Is that it?

92
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,504
What?

93
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,716
Keep your fucking eyes down.

94
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,758
I am.

95
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,010
You fucking bitch!

96
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,307
Do something!

97
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,060
Let go of me!

98
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,645
Let go!

99
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,148
Oh shit!

100
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,065
Goddamn it.

101
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,483
You tramp!

102
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:20,239
Hey, let go of her! You bitch!

103
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,658
Let go! Get off of me!

104
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,810
Why am I the only one locked up?

105
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,645
Because you hit her first.

106
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,814
They picked a fight with me first.

107
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,276
Don't you know?

108
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,321
You can't mess with An Eun-suk's posse.

109
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,248
Inmate 1047. Your punishment is over.

110
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,931
I told you,

111
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,100
you were setting yourself up for trouble.

112
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,063
The best thing to do here
is to stay as quiet as a mouse

113
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,900
and then get parole
for good behavior and get out.

114
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,112
A nail that sticks out
is bound to get hammered in.

115
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,449
My gosh.

116
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,335
Hey!

117
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,839
You fucking bitch!

118
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:01,882
Hey, grab her!

119
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,133
You nasty bitch!

120
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,055
You crazy bitch! Hey, stop it! Hey!

121
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,057
You bitch!

122
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,559
You fucking bitch!

123
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,066
Inmate 1047 to spend 15 days
in the Punishment Room.

124
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,002
You fucking bitch!

125
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,206
Oh fuck!

126
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,834
Fucking bitch!

127
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,711
Hey, come help us!

128
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,132
Help me!

129
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,052
Guard! Someone stop her!

130
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,348
EDIFICATION ACCORDING TO LAW AND PRINCIPLE

131
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,392
I'm so exhausted,
all thanks to that Kim Mo-mi.

132
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:40,564
Can't you just keep her locked up
in the hole?

133
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,485
We already locked her up
for far longer than the rule permits.

134
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,779
We're gonna get audited soon.

135
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,282
I hope things don't get out of hand.

136
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,828
If the auditor catches wind of this,
you can also get roped into this.

137
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,375
Well, anyway.
Isn't my face more wrinkly now?

138
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,584
Let me see.

139
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,629
Come closer.

140
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,006
Oh, you're right.

141
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,592
You need a couple of filler shots.

142
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,052
Filler?

143
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,889
One shot will smooth your skin.
You want me to look into it?

144
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,183
That would be perfect.

145
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,605
Inmate 1047, your punishment is over.

146
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,953
-Oh, I'm full.
-Me too. I ate too much.

147
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,162
I know.

148
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,207
I think I need to go on a diet.
It's getting really tough.

149
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,084
Bullshit, you look fantastic.

150
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,086
Shit. That crazy bitch is back again.

151
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,506
-Why is that bitch already out?
-Yeah, why? Shit.

152
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,763
Where are you going? Hey!

153
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,601
Damn it.

154
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,778
Hey, what are you doing?

155
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,493
Move.

156
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,373
Take me! Come on! Take me with you!

157
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,001
Oh, wait a second.

158
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,046
I'm sorry. Don't hit me. I'm sorry.

159
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,130
Stop it!

160
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,973
Let's leave each other alone.

161
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,564
Yeah?

162
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,912
-Hey! Are you okay?
-You okay?

163
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,121
Oh fuck.

164
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,964
Jeez, that is one crazy bitch.

165
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,830
Notifying all inmates.

166
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:48,210
A meeting with the new warden
will be held in the auditorium.

167
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,879
All inmates,
please come to the auditorium.

168
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,344
Left face.

169
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:00,889
Move forward.

170
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:16,572
I don't care about
what crimes you have committed.

171
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,489
A FRESH START WITH LOVE

172
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,909
Because we are all sinners
in the eyes of God.

173
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,996
My biggest duty

174
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,834
is to help you truly repent
and live a new life.

175
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:30,919
My dear ladies,

176
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,630
free yourself from your inner prison

177
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,840
and seek salvation.

178
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:39,678
Then this place will feel like heaven.

179
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,888
Do you understand?

180
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,514
Yes, ma'am.

181
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,561
From now on, we don't answer with a "yes."

182
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:51,940
We always answer with "I love you."
Understand?

183
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,028
Now repeat after me.

184
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,530
I love you.

185
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,199
I love you.

186
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,909
Very good. Louder!

187
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,119
I love you.

188
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,205
Very nice. One more time!

189
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,164
I love you.

190
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,918
Good! Look in the eyes of the person
next to you and tell them.

191
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,586
-What do you say?
-I love you.

192
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,589
She's acting like a cult leader,
not a prison warden.

193
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,716
What's with her?

194
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,344
I love you, everyone!

195
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,179
I love you.

196
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,513
I love you.

197
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,224
She's new. Came here today.

198
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,059
Oh, you just got here today?

199
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,479
Inmate 2058, you're quite young.

200
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,897
How did you end up here?

201
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,108
I cut a man's dick off.

202
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,578
A person's body was created by God.

203
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:51,792
We should not intentionally destroy
such creations.

204
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,628
Can I go?

205
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,047
Certainly.

206
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,424
I love you.

207
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,844
She's Mask Girl.

208
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,012
Oh, Mask Girl.

209
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,265
I heard a lot about you,

210
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,351
that you are showing
exemplary conduct here.

211
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,356
To me,

212
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,026
it doesn't matter what you did out there.

213
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,320
Here, we are all equal,

214
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,155
all God's children.

215
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,283
Right?

216
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,745
Very good. I love you!

217
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,999
A FRESH START WITH LOVE
HUISEONG PENITENTIARY

218
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,170
I got a caramel macchiato, your favorite.

219
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,215
Oh my goodness. You're the best.

220
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,759
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

221
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,308
I heard a lot about you
from the previous warden.

222
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,851
I'm in your hands, Eun-suk.

223
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,104
Oh, no. I should be the one
asking you that.

224
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,606
Cheers!

225
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,899
Cheers.

226
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,656
Gosh, the cherry blossoms are so pretty.

227
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,581
Hey.

228
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,334
Are you really Mask Girl?

229
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,795
Yeah, she is.

230
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,757
Oh fuck, that's sick.

231
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,885
What an honor to meet Mask Girl here.

232
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,304
You know what?

233
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,973
You're my hero.

234
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,934
All my friends admire you too.

235
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:33,894
"Admire"?

236
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,523
You chopped those bastards into pieces.

237
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,651
I wimped out
and only cut a guy's dick off.

238
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,364
Fuck, I'm gonna brag to everyone
when I get out.

239
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:52,162
That girl from earlier.
Doesn't she seem a bit fucked up?

240
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:54,831
It feels like

241
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,126
more and more kids go bananas these days.

242
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,673
Inmate 1047. You've got a letter.

243
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,633
A letter?

244
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,805
Oh! Isn't it the first letter
you've gotten since you came here?

245
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,722
Who's it from?

246
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,183
It says "Love MG" right here.

247
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,101
"Love MG"?

248
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:18,355
Whoa! You really do have fans out there.

249
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,689
FROM LOVE MG
TO KIM MO-MI 1047

250
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,527
Gosh, it's been so many years,
and someone's still thinking about you.

251
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,869
What is this?

252
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,540
It isn't a letter.
It looks like a news article.

253
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,629
"Is violence genetic?" What is this?

254
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,052
SOCIAL EDUCATION NECESSARY

255
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,971
TO SUPPRESS MANIFESTATION
OF GENETIC VIOLENCE

256
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,479
And what is this?

257
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,651
"Now see how it feels
when your kid is broken, bitch."

258
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,113
Gosh, who sent something like this?

259
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,589
IS VIOLENCE GENETIC?

260
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,632
Are you reading that article again?

261
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:32,762
Constantly looking at it changes nothing.
It only torments you.

262
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:41,855
Anyway, you have a kid and never said
a word all this time? I'm hurt.

263
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:49,196
But still, how could they say that
about the kid? It's not the kid's fault.

264
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,280
For God’s sake!

265
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,365
Hey.

266
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:53,867
Yeah?

267
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:56,995
What's up?

268
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,250
I need to get out of here.

269
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,002
What?

270
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:06,880
For real?

271
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,049
Oh my goodness, you mean it!

272
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,511
Do what you want.

273
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,390
You can't just get up and leave
when you feel like it.

274
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,602
I didn't hear a thing. Not a word.

275
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,642
Do you just work on these all at once?

276
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,646
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,190
It's easier for me to work this way.

278
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,278
This slows things down.

279
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,445
Do one at a time.

280
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,324
Pick up your speed!

281
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,498
What is it?

282
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,250
Bathroom, please?

283
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,170
Be quick.

284
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,182
-Where are you going?
-To the bathroom.

285
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,142
You may pass.

286
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:33,860
Go on.

287
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,856
What you're planting right now
are strawberries.

288
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,568
Strawberries like cool climates,
so they thrive in cold weather.

289
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,237
But in the central region,

290
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,905
if not covered well,

291
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:22,158
their leaves or flowers in full bloom
could be damaged by frost.

292
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,787
Yes. Red lettuce over there,
green lettuce here.

293
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:33,878
Ouch!

294
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,339
-Something bit me!
-What is it?

295
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,842
It's a bug! Gosh, where did it go?

296
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,886
Gosh. It's there!

297
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,348
We're running low on seedlings here.

298
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,142
Bring some from the storage.

299
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,518
-Is it gone?
-It's gone.

300
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,521
It's not here? Is it gone?

301
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,648
Gosh, it hurt. My goodness.

302
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,150
That could've been bad.

303
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,876
Hey, stop! Get down right now!

304
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:55,794
Get down!

305
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,880
Hey! Get down! Get down right now!

306
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,308
I…

307
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,311
I was so good to them.

308
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,606
How dare she try
to break out of my prison?

309
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,901
Out of my prison!

310
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,950
What were you doing in the control room?

311
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:28,785
I'm sorry, ma'am.

312
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,626
Lock that Mask Girl bitch in the hole
as long as possible. A month, minimum.

313
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:40,839
Actually, the maximum stay
in solitary confinement is two weeks.

314
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:47,303
Right, two weeks.
You're right about the two weeks.

315
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,596
Two weeks.

316
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,142
Find some excuse and keep extending it!

317
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,895
Extend it under excuses
like making a scene

318
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,355
or threatening guards--

319
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,985
Do I really need to spell this out
one by one for you?

320
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,863
No, ma'am. I apologize, ma'am.

321
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,116
Get out.

322
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,577
Get the hell out!

323
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,052
Inmate 1047.

324
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,812
HOLY BIBLE

325
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,073
What is this?

326
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,743
It's a Bible. Can't you tell?

327
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,205
What is this for?

328
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,834
The warden says you did what you did
because Satan tempted you.

329
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,039
-You can go.
-Ma'am.

330
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:43,586
I think you may want to see Inmate 1047
in the punishment building right now.

331
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:45,755
Who's that?

332
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,091
Mask Girl…

333
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,094
What about her? Caused trouble again?

334
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,595
No, but…

335
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,812
How long has she been in the hole again?

336
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,356
A little over a month, ma'am.

337
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:04,691
A month?

338
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,110
-Already?
-Yes, ma'am.

339
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,488
Here, ma'am.

340
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,009
What is she doing?

341
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,219
She's praying.

342
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,638
She does that all day long.

343
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,449
Oh my goodness.

344
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:55,950
Are you okay?

345
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,619
Oh, your lips are all split.

346
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,872
Oh, these bitches…

347
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,542
Locking someone up in the hole
for over a month?

348
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,879
Isn't this illegal?
Should I just report them?

349
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,258
It's okay.

350
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,511
It was a meaningful time for me.

351
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,807
You seem a little different.

352
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:22,769
Yeah?

353
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:24,937
Yeah.

354
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,522
Maybe it's

355
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,859
because I became a child of God.

356
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,071
What? What are you saying?

357
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,450
The Lord spoke to me directly…

358
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,621
that he will save me.

359
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:48,795
I never thought I would be saved.

360
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,423
Nevertheless,

361
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,928
the Lord still found me.

362
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,139
Once I began walking with the Lord…

363
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,520
everything changed.

364
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,896
Amen!

365
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:11,526
FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT
INMATE'S TESTIMONY OF FAITH

366
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:21,619
Mo-mi.

367
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,916
Pretending to believe in Jesus
to get on the warden's good side, right?

368
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,836
Plotting something again?

369
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,839
If you are, take me with you.

370
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,056
Off-duty time is over.

371
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,726
All inmates move quickly
to your respective cell block.

372
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,270
I repeat.

373
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:50,606
But honestly,

374
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,817
I don't buy it either.

375
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,986
Are you for real?

376
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,120
-What's with her?
-It's her daughter.

377
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:05,788
Daughter?

378
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,790
Her daughter needs a new kidney,

379
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,459
but she can't give her kidney.

380
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:15,131
I didn't think
she had a single tear in her.

381
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,510
But then again,
a child is every parent's weakness.

382
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,475
Eun-suk.

383
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,687
Get lost.

384
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,109
Eun-suk.

385
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,739
I said, "Get lost"
if you don't want to die.

386
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,617
What's your daughter's blood type?

387
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,286
If it's possible,

388
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,706
I'd like to give your daughter my kidney.

389
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,717
What?

390
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,303
So, what's her blood type?

391
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,890
Type AB.

392
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,561
Thank goodness. My blood type is AB too.

393
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,065
Really?

394
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,502
Mo-mi!

395
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,133
The third round of results is in.

396
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:45,346
You can give my daughter your kidney!

397
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,390
-Really?
-Yes.

398
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,016
It's truly a miracle.

399
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,353
Thank you so much.
How will I ever repay you?

400
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,939
There's no need. I'm glad it worked out.

401
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,190
I really am.

402
00:37:56,274 --> 00:38:00,403
Thank you. Thank you so much.

403
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,365
Today, we'll be having

404
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,994
character education training
with volunteers from outside.

405
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:12,999
These ladies will listen to your words
and study the bible with you.

406
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,084
So feel free to ask questions,

407
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:18,296
and take your time to say
what you want to say.

408
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,426
I've led a sinful life,
committing a lot of crimes.

409
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,765
And I was never happy,
not even for a single day.

410
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,102
But now, truly,

411
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:34,979
somewhat,

412
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,150
I have found peace in my heart.

413
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,361
I have asked

414
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,531
the Lord for forgiveness, you see.

415
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,366
That's right.

416
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:52,038
Our Lord grants us salvation
if we ask for forgiveness and repent,

417
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,041
despite the gravity of our sins.

418
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:59,295
I know you will also be saved,
Sister Mo-mi.

419
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,759
-I'll pray for you. Very nice meeting you.
-Yes, thank you.

420
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:07,970
We meet again.

421
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,816
It's me.

422
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,444
Ju Oh-nam's mom.

423
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,701
You got my letter, right?

424
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:35,206
You never replied,
so I was very disappointed.

425
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,918
I guess you weren't even curious

426
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,171
how I managed to save myself.

427
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:05,546
That day,

428
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,674
I felt as if I was reborn.

429
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:11,969
The Lord had given me

430
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,847
another life to live.

431
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,684
So I could punish that evil bitch.

432
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,564
The police are investigating a body

433
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,984
found in a car discovered
at the bottom of the reservoir.

434
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,486
Around 4:00 p.m. yesterday,

435
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:33,073
a resident found a compact vehicle
floating in a reservoir in Cheolhyeon-gun

436
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,451
and reported it to the police.

437
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,287
The police are trying to identify the body

438
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:42,249
as well as track down the owner
of the discovered compact vehicle.

439
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,550
To find that bitch
and dodge the police's prying eyes,

440
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:56,138
I also had to change my face as she did.

441
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:15,074
CHEONHA LAUNDROMAT

442
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:19,912
Whoa!

443
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,498
Are you the same lady as before?

444
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,209
You look totally different!

445
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,505
Oh, okay.

446
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,510
IDENTIFICATION CARD
NAM OH-JU

447
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,013
-Thank you.
-Sure.

448
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,435
I had to get a new place to live as well.

449
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,941
No one has lived here before.

450
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,987
It was a factory making pastes,
salted seafood, and whatnot.

451
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,618
Interesting, isn't it?

452
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,789
Salted seafood was stored there.

453
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,542
You can check it out if you want.

454
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,089
Okay.

455
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:17,303
I looked in every corner of the country,
trying to find that bitch.

456
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,680
But she was

457
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,558
nowhere to be found.

458
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:29,815
Mask Girl, the notorious serial killer,
has finally revealed herself.

459
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:34,570
Amid rumors of plastic surgery addiction,
she's now entering the police station.

460
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,614
Why did you kill them?

461
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,782
Do you regret it?

462
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,242
Were they premeditated?

463
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,827
Please give us a comment!

464
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:46,832
Is this truly

465
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,835
your will, Lord?

466
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:54,590
Father.

467
00:43:58,844 --> 00:43:59,678
At first…

468
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:00,596
Hi, Mi-mo!

469
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:03,223
…I thought this was all the Lord's will,

470
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,684
so I tried to forget about it.

471
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,019
Let's go.

472
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:11,357
But no matter how much time passed,
I couldn't do it.

473
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,360
When I saw the little girl,

474
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:18,614
I saw that bitch's face.

475
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,702
-Thank you.
-Sure. Bye-bye.

476
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,872
Hey, kiddo.

477
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,415
Come over here.

478
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,501
It's okay, come. Good.

479
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,003
Here.

480
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,340
Have some of this.

481
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,676
I don't have any money.

482
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:42,513
It's fine. I'm giving it to you for free.
You can just eat it.

483
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:47,518
My grandma said I shouldn't eat anything
people give to me for free.

484
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,603
Wow. You've been taught well.

485
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,146
Goodbye.

486
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:59,113
You must be hungry. Here, eat up.

487
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,657
It's fine. Eat up. Go ahead.

488
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,587
Wow, it's so good.

489
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:20,509
Is that right? Eat up.
I'll give you more if you want.

490
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,053
Here. Have this too.

491
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:27,850
KOREAN FAITH CHURCH

492
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,061
Granny!

493
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,231
Oh my! It's you, Mi-mo!

494
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,359
Oh.

495
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:41,739
Grandma, this granny owns
that tteokbokki truck.

496
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,157
Hello.

497
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,116
Hello.

498
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,536
Oh, do you attend this church?

499
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,748
I moved to this area recently,
so I began coming here.

500
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,085
-Oh, Ms. Shin. Hello.
-Hello.

501
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,920
-Oh, hi.
-Hello.

502
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,715
-Well, see you next time.
-Of course.

503
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,008
Bye-bye, Granny.

504
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,720
Come by again for tteokbokki!

505
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:05,888
-I will!
-Okay.

506
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,184
When I saw that bitch's mom again,

507
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:14,146
I felt this rage boiling inside of me.

508
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:17,524
Here, I'll give you a lot. Enjoy.

509
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,817
Thank you.

510
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,947
Gosh, I don't know if it's true,
but there was a rumor going around.

511
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,365
What is it?

512
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:29,244
That Mask Girl's daughter
goes to this school.

513
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,621
Mask Girl?

514
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:35,292
Yeah, the masked woman who murdered people
and chopped up their bodies.

515
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,085
She went to prison for it.

516
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,462
I know about Mask Girl.

517
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,923
-She murdered, like, two people.
-Three.

518
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,549
-Three?
-Yeah.

519
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,676
And her daughter attends this school?

520
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,387
I heard she was in first grade.

521
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,224
She had quite a strange name.

522
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:54,770
What was it, Kim Mi-mo?

523
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,605
-"Mi-mo"?
-"Mi-mo"?

524
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,941
-Isn't she in our kids' class?
-No! What do we do?

525
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,401
It's the monster's daughter!

526
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,406
Granny.

527
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,118
Kiddo, what's wrong? Why are you crying?

528
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,038
Kids keep making fun of me.

529
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,294
Listen to me carefully.

530
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,840
From now on,
if someone is being mean to you,

531
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:26,009
you must punish them even more
by all means possible.

532
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,928
What? How?

533
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,765
You must make sure
they never do that to you again.

534
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,070
You're moving?

535
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,406
Oh dear, I'm so sad to see you go.

536
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,326
I will come to see you often.

537
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:52,786
Really?

538
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,331
Write down your new address for me
before you go, okay?

539
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,041
You have to come, okay?

540
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,710
Of course.

541
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,133
Yes. Is this a magazine publisher?

542
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,386
I want to give you a tip-off.

543
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:14,975
It's about Mask Girl's daughter.

544
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,980
Hey! Do you know who Mi-mo's mom is?

545
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,733
Is that bitch a rich heiress or something?

546
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,865
Wanna know who Mi-mo's mom is?

547
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,074
What about her?

548
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:35,829
No, forget it.

549
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,539
Frick, are you kidding me?

550
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,124
Shit!

551
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:40,459
You!

552
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,003
You're dead when I catch you!

553
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,969
Kiddo, are you all right?

554
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,389
You go to the middle school over here?

555
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,433
Yes, I do. So?

556
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:01,063
Does a kid named Kim Mi-mo go there?

557
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,066
-How could you?
-Hold on.

558
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,734
Mi-mo, why are you doing this?

559
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,611
No, stop it!

560
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,696
And you lied to me! You bitch!

561
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,533
Wait, Mi-mo. Listen to me.
I didn't spread the rumor about you.

562
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:14,952
Shut up, you backstabber!

563
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,915
Oh my gosh! Mi-mo!

564
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,041
What happened?

565
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,542
Granny.

566
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,127
Come in quickly. Come on.

567
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,839
Oh my! You came all the way here alone.
My goodness!

568
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,688
You evil bitch.

569
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,358
You need to feel what I'm feeling.

570
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,485
That heartbreak

571
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,154
when your baby disappears.

572
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,456
I'll keep you in my prayers.

573
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,632
-Wait a second.
-Oh my gosh!

574
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,009
Oh gosh!

575
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,510
-1047, step away!
-Move.

576
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,345
-Out of my way!
-Don't move.

577
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,722
-Stop her!
-Grab her!

578
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:17,639
-Stop!
-Let go!

579
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:20,100
-I've gotta stop her!
-She's mistaken me for someone else.

580
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,811
-1047!
-She said she was gonna kill someone!

581
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:23,979
Oh my goodness.

582
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,814
-Get off me!
-Stay still!

583
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,608
Let go of me! I have to stop her!

584
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:32,446
That woman is Ju Oh-nam's mother.
I have to stop her.

585
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,032
Let go! Let go of me!

586
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:39,202
You have to stop her!
She's going to kill someone!

587
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,372
Let go of me!
