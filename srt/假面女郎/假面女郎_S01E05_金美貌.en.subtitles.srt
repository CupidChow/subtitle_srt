1
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:14,097
Mask Girl, the notorious serial killer,
has finally revealed herself.

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,643
Amid rumors of plastic surgery addiction,
she's now entering the police station.

3
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,311
Kim, known as Mask Girl,

4
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,606
has been undergoing interrogation
by the prosecutor since this morning.

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,652
According to an insider, Kim has
admitted to all murder charges.

6
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,653
He's here.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,615
-Is that Mask Girl's lunch?
-Is it her lunch?

8
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,202
-Look over here, please.
-Tell us what she ordered!

9
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,038
-What's on the menu?
-Look over here!

10
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,372
It's beef bone soup.

11
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,875
-What kind?
-How big of a portion?

12
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,169
-Did she add extra rice?
-Tell us!

13
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:51,342
It looks like her eyes, nose, cheekbones,
and chin have all been done.

14
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,472
Basically, she got herself
a whole new face.

15
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:59,100
Clothes worn by Mask Girl,
who caused a big stir recently,

16
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,227
are currently selling out rapidly.

17
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,481
It's pretty, and a lot of people wear it.

18
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:08,401
As Mask Girl's trial begins this morning,

19
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,654
many citizens are rallying
and denouncing her.

20
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:16,284
The defendant has been persecuted
since childhood because of her appearance.

21
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,870
The victim, Mr. Lee Jun-mo,

22
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,915
attacked her verbally,
insulting her looks,

23
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,085
and attempted to sexually assault her.

24
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,380
What he wrote on social media

25
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:33,343
proves what the victim,
Mr. Lee Jun-mo, had intended

26
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,678
when he met with the defendant.

27
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,516
The victim's posts show
his sole interest in Mask Girl

28
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,683
was sexual--

29
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,935
Shut up!

30
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,773
She killed my son!
And you're saying this nonsense?

31
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,108
Let go of me!

32
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,820
If you kill someone
just for calling you ugly,

33
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,738
no one will survive in Korea!

34
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,407
Order! Another outburst,
and you will be removed.

35
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,076
Let go! You fucking bitch!

36
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,079
-Remove her from this courtroom.
-You evil bitch!

37
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:07,085
This crime is considered to be
the most heinous crime.

38
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,338
The defendant's crime against humanity,
perpetrated grotesquely,

39
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,924
brought shock and horror to society.

40
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:17,387
Even from the balance of punishment
and the preventive viewpoint of crime,

41
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,558
a sentence permanently separating
the defendant from society is inevitable.

42
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,687
Thus, the defendant
is sentenced to life in prison.

43
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:18,800
MASK GIRL

44
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:24,180
KIM MI-MO

45
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,648
My name is Kim Mi-mo.

46
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,067
A name given by my mom.

47
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,237
Please! I'll come back for her soon.

48
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:44,659
I absolutely cannot raise this child.

49
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,703
Who mentioned raising her?

50
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,414
I'm asking you to keep her for a bit.
Can't you?

51
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,456
I can't.

52
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,166
Wait!

53
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,836
I'm leaving the country,

54
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,298
so I need lots of stuff,
including a fake passport.

55
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,717
I can't take care of that
with the baby around.

56
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,720
I'll be back for her as soon as I'm done.

57
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,306
Please? I'm begging you.

58
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,685
Years went by,

59
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,687
but Mom never came back.

60
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,654
The very existence of a mom
slowly faded away from my life.

61
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,496
When I was young,
I liked to doll myself up.

62
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,000
What's going on?

63
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,796
My goodness.
You really are your mother's daughter.

64
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,798
Goodness gracious.

65
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,429
Grandma always said I took after my mom

66
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,640
but never told me anything about her.

67
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,854
Put your elbows down.

68
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,154
Eat quietly.

69
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,533
I didn't like the taste of the food
Grandma made me.

70
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,536
My favorite food was

71
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,123
tteokbokki from a food truck
by the school.

72
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,958
Wow, it's so delicious!

73
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,127
Then, one day,

74
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,422
I learned about my mom
through an incident.

75
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,341
-The tteokbokki over there is yummy.
-Okay!

76
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,425
-Mom?
-Let's go.

77
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,719
Why? I'm gonna eat tteokbokki with Mi-mo.

78
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,763
-Don't play with her anymore.
-Why not?

79
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,473
Her mom is Mask Girl.

80
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,142
-What's Mask Girl?
-You don't need to know.

81
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,313
MASK GIRL

82
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,984
MASK GIRL TURNS HERSELF IN

83
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,111
WHO IS MASK GIRL?

84
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,445
WHY DID SHE BECOME A KILLER?

85
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,243
MASK GIRL SURRENDERS HERSELF
"PERFECT BODY"

86
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,335
Murderer!

87
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,256
Murderer's daughter!

88
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,844
Die! Die, Mask Girl. Die!

89
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,518
Hello.

90
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,270
I'm Kim Mi-mo, a reporter.

91
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,733
Mask Girl, why did you kill people?

92
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:10,281
Hello, everyone! So many of you came!

93
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,119
You can take pictures now.

94
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,955
Everyone, I'm Mask Girl! That's me!

95
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,044
Are you out of your mind?

96
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,423
-Grandma, I'm sorry.
-Get out!

97
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,841
-Grandma.
-Get out!

98
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,384
Grandma!

99
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:34,805
-I'm sorry, Grandma.
-I don't think I can raise you. Leave!

100
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:39,268
Grandma, please.
It was a mistake, Grandma!

101
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,394
Grandma.

102
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:18,933
Grandma.

103
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,982
What was my mom like?

104
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,401
Why do you ask that?

105
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,779
I'm just wondering. That's all.

106
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,823
She was

107
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,118
messed up from the beginning.

108
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,875
The rumors about my mom spread quickly.

109
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,836
It's the monster's daughter!

110
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:54,885
The rumor was started by my best friend.

111
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,939
-You told everyone, didn't you?
-What?

112
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:22,371
There have been a lot of complaints
from the parents, you see.

113
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:30,254
We were going to move anyway.

114
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,429
You know, I'm moving.

115
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,848
I can't come here anymore.

116
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:45,269
But the rumor followed me around
everywhere I went.

117
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,480
WHAT'S THIS?
KIM MI-MO IN SECOND GRADE

118
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,481
IS SHE CRAZY?

119
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,149
HITTING KIDS WHO CALL HER MG'S KID?

120
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,151
YOU GUYS SEE THIS?
SHE IS HELLA SCARY

121
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,944
SHE'S CRAZY
TRULY A MURDERER'S DAUGHTER

122
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,571
LIKE MOTHER, LIKE DAUGHTER

123
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,073
JIYA INVITED KIM MI-MO TO A CHAT

124
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,574
HEY, IS YOUR MOM REALLY MASK GIRL?

125
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,159
TRANSFERRED 'CUZ YOU BEAT A KID?

126
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,410
A REAL THUG AT SCHOOL

127
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,287
FKIN EVIL BITCH'S GONNA BEAT US UP TOO?

128
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,914
GET THE HELL OUT OF OUR SCHOOL

129
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,885
If you cause trouble again,
no one will be able to help you now.

130
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,972
I barely kept you
out of the juvenile hall last time.

131
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,899
You don't wanna be like your mom, do you?

132
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,534
Don't ever call that bitch my mom again.

133
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,495
It's horrifying.

134
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,458
Gosh.

135
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,254
Introduce yourself.

136
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,047
I'm Kim Mi-mo.

137
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,175
-Kim Mi-mo?
-What kind of name is that?

138
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,510
Class, quiet.

139
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,889
You can sit over there,
right next to Jin-hong.

140
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,976
I don't wanna sit next to a boy.

141
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,645
Please let me sit next to a girl.

142
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,605
-What is she saying?
-Damn!

143
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,816
What the heck? So freaking weird.

144
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,444
Then, how about
next to Ye-chun over there?

145
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,196
Ma'am.

146
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,825
I don't want to. I prefer to sit alone.

147
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,493
This isn't a time for joking.

148
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,328
Go ahead. Have a seat.

149
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,583
You all know finals are coming up, right?

150
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,919
Stay focused during class, okay?

151
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,713
-Yes, ma'am.
-Good!

152
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,343
-They're like two peas in a freaking pod.
-I know.

153
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,430
What the heck? I want to sit with a boy.

154
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,765
I know, right?

155
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,058
-Our class's first official couple!
-Hilarious.

156
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,447
Hey, guys.

157
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,367
What's with lunch today?
Just three meatballs?

158
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,912
See M Countdown yesterday?

159
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:11,165
Oh, my heart was gonna burst
because of the NCT members!

160
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,374
So handsome, right?

161
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,461
Hey! That seat's taken.

162
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,424
Anyone can sit anywhere they want.

163
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,219
Hey. Get lost.

164
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:26,931
That's my seat.

165
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,355
Freaking ridiculous.

166
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,653
Are you eating alone?

167
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,404
I'll eat with you.

168
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,578
Hey.

169
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,205
Hey, you.

170
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,625
Come here.

171
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:56,710
Get closer!

172
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,382
Did you know you're being ostracized?

173
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,425
What?

174
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,344
I'll be your friend.

175
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,304
No, thanks.

176
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,389
What?

177
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,474
I don't need a friend.

178
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,604
Hey!

179
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,190
Hey!

180
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,651
Hey!

181
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,403
Wait, hold up.

182
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,282
By the way,

183
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,826
which boy band do you like?

184
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,537
Any interest in buying these?

185
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,456
I waited for hours
to get these autographed.

186
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,624
-These are--
-Look!

187
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,252
Get lost, will you?

188
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,260
What a freaking bitch!

189
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,596
You should run. Aren't you late?

190
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,891
GIRL GROUP LOVEME'S SUA

A FRANKENDOLL ACTING LIKE SHE'S HOT?
SO RIDICULOUS

193
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,988
LOOKS SO DIFFERENT FROM HER SCHOOL PHOTO
NOT THAT PRETTY

194
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,656
A NEW MESSAGE

195
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,868
TTEOKBOKKI GRANNY
ARE YOU DOING WELL AT THE NEW PLACE?

196
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,912
CALL ME WHENEVER YOU HAVE WORRIES

197
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:19,877
I'M DOING WELL! HEHE

198
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,381
Be on time tomorrow. Those of you
on cleaning duty do a thorough job.

199
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,050
Yes, ma'am!

200
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,093
-Okay, that'll be all.
-Thank you!

201
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,141
CLEANING DUTY
MI-MO, YE-CHUN

202
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,325
Hey, where are you going?

203
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,496
That freaking…

204
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,054
Oh, hey!

205
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,765
So, what would you like to buy?

206
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,976
I have so many. Do you want to look?

207
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,939
Hey, can we look as well?

208
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,732
Wow, I'm so freaking curious.

209
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,401
Hey, that's mine!

210
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,362
Hey, give it back. Come on!

211
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,655
Give me that!

212
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,074
-Come on.
-Get it if you can.

213
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,742
I said it's mine!

214
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,952
-It's mine!
-Let go!

215
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,245
Come on. It's mine--

216
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:40,916
What the hell?

217
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,011
She forged these celebrity autographs.

218
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,345
I didn't!

219
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,431
I got these autographed myself.

220
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,724
Bullshit, you bitch!

221
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,728
This bitch lies all the time.

222
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,649
Hey!

223
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,235
Hey, you!

224
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,612
Get lost, now!

225
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,412
Hey, did you not hear me?

226
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,423
Idiots.

227
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,340
What?

228
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,468
What did you just say?

229
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,219
I said, "Idiots."

230
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,348
-What the hell? What a crazy bitch!
-You're dead, fucking bitch!

231
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,563
Try me. I'll kill you.

232
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,946
Hey, guys. Let's go.

233
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,491
Shit! She's fucking crazy!

234
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,367
What the hell?

235
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,535
Hey, are you okay?

236
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,248
You can't just pick up
a glass shard like that!

237
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,375
Give me your hand.

238
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,681
Are these self-harm scars?

239
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,604
I cleaned up everything,
so you go finish tidying up.

240
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,272
Okay!

241
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,009
I can't do it.

242
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,668
Hey. Wake up.

243
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,591
What is this?

244
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,635
I'm a bit like you now, right?

245
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,345
Whatever.

246
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,349
Where are you going?

247
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,684
To the bathroom.

248
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,394
Wait for me.

249
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,771
Hey! Wait for me.

250
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,530
What are you doing?

251
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,202
It's fine. We're friends.

252
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,204
What are you, seven?

253
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,418
What the hell? You some kind of perv?

254
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,295
Right, I'm a pervert.

255
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,343
Thank you.

256
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,802
Goodbye.

257
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,015
So? It's superb, right?

258
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,266
Well, so-so.

259
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,186
The tteokbokki I had
where I used to live was better.

260
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,154
You know,

261
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,698
I have a secret.

262
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,699
Can I tell you?

263
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,617
What is it?

264
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,746
Honestly, I want to kill my mom.

265
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,040
What? Why?

266
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,628
I saved a stray cat a few days ago, right?

267
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,922
It was in freaking danger.

268
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,425
But she wouldn't let me keep it
and told me to put it back.

269
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,179
It's probably dead now.

270
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,767
Honestly, she pretty much killed that cat.

271
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,978
That's it?

272
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,440
What do you mean, "That's it"?

273
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,111
Forget it. I'm leaving.

274
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,613
Hey!

275
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,241
Hey! Where are you going?

276
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,243
Hey, wait. Hey!

277
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,250
What is it? What's gotten into you?

278
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,168
Friends can talk about anything.

279
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,714
I don't need friends.
I'm gonna lay low until I graduate.

280
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,382
What are you so mad about?

281
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,592
You never say anything about yourself.

282
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,682
You wanna hear my story?

283
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:52,978
Yeah.

284
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,774
Forget it.

285
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,985
You wouldn't understand.

286
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,572
Hey!

287
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,825
I wouldn't understand?

288
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,870
You know what I'm really sick of?

289
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,998
When my drunk dad beats me and my mom.

290
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,460
So I almost stabbed my dad once.
Did you know that?

291
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,963
You think you're the only tragic heroine?

292
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,467
You cut yourself a bit,
and that makes you a tragic heroine, huh?

293
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,682
Huh? It's raining.

294
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,976
Hey, run! Come on, run!

295
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,793
Does your dad drink often?

296
00:22:59,086 --> 00:22:59,920
Yeah.

297
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,715
I wish my dad would just die.

298
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,259
And my mom too.

299
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,138
She's actually not my real mom.

300
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,016
She's my stepmom.

301
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,107
You have it better than me.

302
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,234
What?

303
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,243
You won't tell anyone this, will you?

304
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,370
No.

305
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,465
The truth is,

306
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,301
I don't know who my dad is,

307
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,471
and my mom's in prison.

308
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,223
Prison?

309
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,643
My mom has never called me…

310
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,189
or wondered about how I'm doing.

311
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,401
Then who do you live with?

312
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,112
My grandma.

313
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,366
Your grandma's never told you
about your mom?

314
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,830
My grandma also really hates
talking about my mom.

315
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,458
It's probably because of me.

316
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,598
I think you're really special.

317
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,063
You sound so corny!

318
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,075
Say, "Ah."

319
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,203
There you go. Good, that's it.

320
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,040
You're home.

321
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,918
Why so late? It's barbecue day, remember?

322
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,127
Go wash your hands.

323
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:05,754
I'm not eating.

324
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,965
Hey, you asked for a barbecue.

325
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,550
I said I'm not eating!

326
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,011
Oh, come on! I bought so much meat.

327
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,388
Hey, is something wrong?

328
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,473
Nothing's wrong!

329
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,601
Goodness gracious.

330
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,020
What's wrong with her this time?

331
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,689
MI-MO♥
I FREAKING HATE BEING HOME

332
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,234
She's going through puberty. Let her be.

333
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,611
Ye-chun, if you're not eating,
I'm eating it all!

334
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,695
Yes, we are!

335
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,239
MY DAD'S DRUNK AND VIOLENT AGAIN

336
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,448
REALLY? OH NO!

337
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:37,327
WHATEVER
I'M JUST HIDING IN MY ROOM RIGHT NOW

338
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:44,376
BUT I'M GLAD I HAVE YOU

339
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:48,713
I CAN TALK ABOUT STUFF LIKE THIS WITH YOU

340
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,423
HAHA, ME TOO

341
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,476
You're quite the soulmates.
A match made in heaven.

342
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,727
Hi, Ms. Peepee.

343
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,229
What?

344
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,146
Let's go.

345
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,356
That fucking bitch!

346
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:11,778
She was an outcast in elementary school
because she peed in class.

347
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,614
So everyone teased her,
calling her Ms. Peepee.

348
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,657
-Really?
-Yeah.

349
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:20,245
But then she shortened her skirt,
wore makeup in middle school,

350
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,581
and followed around the delinquents.

351
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,916
That's how she stopped being an outcast.

352
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,043
But she bullies you the most.

353
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:31,131
-I know. Isn't it so freaking ridiculous?
-Yeah, freaking hypocrite.

354
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,389
Now, Seowons were private institutions

355
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,767
where scholars performed ancestral rites
honoring past Confucian scholars

356
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,021
and studied together
during the Joseon Dynasty.

357
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,696
Hey, you two in the back.
Go out to the hallway.

358
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,373
They educated talented students
to carry on their scholarly faction…

359
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,876
Hey, aren't those two such eyesores?

360
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,086
-I heard it from them.
-Really?

361
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,467
That's so freaking crazy. Are you serious?

362
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,347
You're really freaking ugly.

363
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,434
Funny. You're even freaking uglier!

364
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,811
Nope. You're so much freaking uglier.

365
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,398
Bullshit! You're the ugliest
in the whole wide world.

366
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:56,841
By the way,

367
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,886
why did your mom go to prison?

368
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,764
Why do you ask?

369
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,725
No particular reason.

370
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,108
She killed someone.

371
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:14,818
What?

372
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,405
Why?

373
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,783
Do you see me as a monster now?

374
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,286
No.

375
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,170
My dad went on a rampage again yesterday.

376
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,048
He broke everything, dishes and all.

377
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,133
Really?

378
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,554
My mom ran away from home again, crying.

379
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,723
It's a whole mess, honestly.

380
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,146
Do you wanna run away from home?

381
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,064
Run away?

382
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,399
Yeah.

383
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,110
That's a good idea.

384
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:00,905
Then let's look for a place
to live together. What do you say?

385
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,783
Don't we need a lot of money for that?

386
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,368
Do you have money?

387
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,746
No, I don't.

388
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,666
We have no money,
and you're talking about finding a place.

389
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,835
But still,

390
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,921
it would be super fun
if we lived together, right?

391
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:38,401
DAUGHTER OF KOREA'S FEMALE MURDERER
KIM MI-MO

392
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,745
KOREA'S FEMALE MURDERER

393
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,128
FEMALE MURDERER'S DAUGHTER

394
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,009
CRIMINALS WHO PASS DOWN THE VIOLENT GENE

395
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,010
IS VIOLENCE GENETIC?

396
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:10,809
SERIAL KILLER MASK GIRL'S DAUGHTER
CAUGHT UP IN SCHOOL VIOLENCE SCANDAL

397
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:18,858
AS THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE ALLEGED
SCHOOL VIOLENCE AGAINST MS. KIM,

398
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:22,320
BELIEVED TO BE THE MASK GIRL'S DAUGHTER,
HAS ERUPTED,

399
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:26,783
THE NAME MASK GIRL, FORGOTTEN
BY THE PUBLIC FOR A WHILE, IS RESURFACING

400
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:30,203
THE PARENTS OF STUDENTS AT THE SCHOOL
ARE VERY CONCERNED

401
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,247
SHE WAS NEARLY FORGOTTEN, BUT MG IS BACK!

402
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,376
SHE USED TO GO TO MY SCHOOL
BUT TRANSFERRED TO SEONGRIM

403
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:39,838
No way!

404
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,093
Ye-chun!

405
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,594
What?

406
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,762
Feed the baby!

407
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,305
I'm busy!

408
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,558
No allowance, then.

409
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,353
Where's the baby food?

410
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,564
-Man, seriously.
-Here.

411
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,441
Damn it.

412
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,777
-Say, "Ah."
-You are all done.

413
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,780
Honey, come and eat
if you're done dressing him up.

414
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,532
Let's eat quickly, okay?

415
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,075
-We need to get going.
-Is it good?

416
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:10,910
Okay, let's eat.

417
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,916
Guess what?
My friend is Mask Girl's daughter.

418
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,167
Isn't that amazing?

419
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,337
I feel so bad for Mi-mo.

420
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,340
I will never leave Mi-mo's side.

421
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,384
Instead, I'll help her.

422
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,598
I'm gonna need some money
to do that though.

423
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,075
Say, "Ah."

424
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,914
Yeah, it rolls well.

425
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,582
The sounds?

426
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,878
Yeah, it all plays nicely.

427
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,218
The lion button doesn't work.

428
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,222
-Yeah. The lion…
-How come it doesn't work?

429
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,434
Okay. Bye.

430
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:21,731
Oh, it really made all the noises
it should just minutes ago.

431
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,864
Then, would you like to take it
for 30,000 won?

432
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:31,783
Thank you.

433
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:32,700
Goodbye.

434
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,618
Bye.

435
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,956
You sure it's okay to sell that?

436
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,626
It's fine. She's going to take
her first steps soon anyway.

437
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,718
So we have a total
of 138,000 won between us.

438
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,680
This isn't nearly enough.

439
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,143
I have nothing else to sell now.

440
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,979
What do we do?

441
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,193
Oh, should I ask the tteokbokki granny?

442
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,405
-Tteokbokki granny?
-Yeah.

443
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:14,534
Remember I told you about a truck selling
delicious tteokbokki where I lived?

444
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,912
She is like an actual grandma to me.

445
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,374
She told me to talk to her
whenever I had worries.

446
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,376
Should we go visit her?

447
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,842
Still, I want us
to give it a shot ourselves.

448
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,809
Mi-mo, just wait for a bit.
I'll figure something out.

449
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,186
No, we do this together.

450
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,439
I'll look for other ways too.

451
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,357
Okay.

452
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,364
Hey, kid.

453
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,533
Come over here for a second?

454
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:57,910
Why?

455
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,958
Are these real?

456
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,794
Well, of course they're real.

457
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,837
Do you like them?

458
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,632
Then do you want to buy it for 10,000 won?

459
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,676
It's 20,000 won,

460
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,763
but since you're cute,
I'll sell it for 10,000 won.

461
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,640
I don't have the money though.

462
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,185
How much do you have?

463
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,896
Five hundred won.

464
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,944
Then I'll take this for now.

465
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,739
But spread the word to your friends, okay?

466
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:35,656
I will!

467
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,076
Oh, this is freaking hilarious.

468
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,243
What a freaking joke.

469
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,578
Kids still do this?

470
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,746
So freaking unbelievable!

471
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,832
Hey, girl! What are you doing here?

472
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,710
A middle-schooler ripping
a grade-schooler off for money?

473
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:48,961
You little shit!

474
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:54,133
Listen, you little thing.
You can't rip off kids here, okay?

475
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,678
Sweetie, take your 500 won
and go home. Go on.

476
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,186
Where are you going? Hey, grab her.

477
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,618
That's what you get.

478
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,081
You tattled to them, didn't you?

479
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,459
Shit, you're still
the same old Ms. Peepee.

480
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,254
What? Do you have a freaking death wish?

481
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:36,134
Keep this up, and your life might be
in danger, you know.

482
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,301
My life?

483
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,805
Didn't I tell you I'd hit you
whenever you lie again?

484
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,973
You.

485
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,518
Do you know who Mi-mo's mom is?

486
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,603
Mi-mo? Kim Mi-mo?

487
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:52,400
What? Is that bitch a rich heiress
or something?

488
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,800
Hey, kid.

489
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,478
SUSEONG POLICE SUBSTATION

490
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,688
How can I help you?

491
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,612
I told you there wouldn't be a next time.

492
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,488
Ma'am, please don't do this.

493
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:43,075
Get out of my house right now.
Do you hear me?

494
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:45,745
I wasn't

495
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,706
planning on going back anyway.

496
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,832
What did you say?

497
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,049
Hey, kid!

498
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:15,149
Hey, where have you been?
Why are you coming home so late?

499
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,652
I hung out at my friend's house.

500
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,072
Then you should've at least called us!

501
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,123
Leave me alone!

502
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,085
Have you seen the baby walker?

503
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,463
I don't know. How would I know? Get out!

504
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,261
-She hasn't seen it?
-She says she hasn't.

505
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,930
Gosh. I mean, where could it have gone?

506
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,437
Hello?

507
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,731
-What are you up to?
-Me?

508
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,608
Not much. I'm just home.

509
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,153
Can I come over tonight?

510
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,655
You mean my house?

511
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:04,824
Why?

512
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,451
Well, you know.

513
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,704
I don't want to go home.

514
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:11,789
I see.

515
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,583
Can I?

516
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,003
Just for a night.

517
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,134
I really want to have you over,

518
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,596
but my dad wreaked havoc at home again.

519
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,808
Really? Hey, are you okay?

520
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,561
Girl, it's a huge mess here right now.

521
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,230
I want to run away from home.

522
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,735
Mi-mo, why don't you go home tonight,

523
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,281
and we can run away when we're ready?

524
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:48,909
Okay.

525
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,829
Okay. Right, see you at school tomorrow.

526
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,045
Shit.

527
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:48,260
Hey, did you hear about Kim Mi-mo
from Class Two?

528
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,262
Kim Mi-mo? Who is that?

529
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,599
Well, she transferred here recently,
and she's Mask Girl's daughter.

530
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,352
"Mask Girl"? What's that?

531
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,814
You know, the PangTV psycho serial killer.
She was on TV too.

532
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,065
Whoa, seriously?

533
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:05,194
Isn't it hella shocking?
And do you know why she transferred?

534
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,278
Why?

535
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,989
She stabbed a kid
who cursed at her with a pencil.

536
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,866
What the hell? So creepy.

537
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,953
That means we attend the same school
as a psycho killer's daughter.

538
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:17,039
That's why my mom's gonna complain
to the Office of Education and ask

539
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,874
why a kid like that is still here.

540
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,510
-Kang Jeong-guk.
-Here.

541
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,470
-Kim Na-rae.
-Yes.

542
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,721
Kim Mi-mo.

543
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,435
Ye-chun. Is Mi-mo not here?

544
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,229
I'm not sure either.

545
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,859
Kim Jin-hong.

546
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:45,901
Here.

547
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,653
-Kim Ha-eun.
-Over here.

548
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,828
MI-MO♥
WHERE ARE YOU?

549
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,082
Just a second.

550
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,584
Ye-chun.

551
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,003
Yes?

552
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,921
Can I talk to you for a minute?

553
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:13,012
Mi-mo's grandma says
Mi-mo hasn't been home since yesterday.

554
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,598
Do you know anything about it?

555
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,689
You're Mi-mo's closest friend.

556
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,108
I am…

557
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,653
but I don't know either.

558
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:01,519
The number you're trying to reach
is currently unavailable…

559
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,824
The number you're trying to reach…

560
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,160
Why aren't you picking up?

561
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,502
Where the heck are you?

562
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:29,797
Ye-chun!

563
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,465
Ye-chun!

564
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,300
-Hey.
-What's with the long face?

565
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,969
Did something happen at school?

566
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,637
No, nothing.

567
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,556
We bought the fried chicken you like.

568
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,473
-Let's go.
-Go!

569
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,600
-We bought two. Okay, let's go.
-Let's go!

570
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,103
-It'll be a fried chicken party!
-Yay!

571
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,938
We had a party two days ago!

572
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:49,525
So? Our daughter loves it so much.
We can have it every day!

573
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,654
Then, let's party every day.
Let's eat it tomorrow too!

574
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,534
Why aren't you eating?

575
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,161
You can have a drumstick today.

576
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:05,666
Usually, you have to win this,
but you can have it today.

577
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,792
MI-MO♥

578
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,296
No, I'm full. I can't eat anymore.

579
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,966
Already? Then I'm going to eat it!

580
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,467
Hey, Mi-mo. Where are you?

581
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,553
Can you come out for a sec?

582
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,222
Yeah, sure. Where are you?

583
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,350
Oh, the underpass?
Okay. Just stay right there.

584
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,442
Hey! Kim Mi-mo!

585
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:36,572
Do you know how worried I was?

586
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,033
Why did you turn off your phone?

587
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,917
What is it?
Why are you looking at me like that?

588
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:52,796
Mi-mo!

589
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,340
Hey.

590
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,637
How could you do this to me?

591
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,472
What do you mean?

592
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,933
You spread the rumor, didn't you?

593
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:05,851
The rumor?

594
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,978
What are you talking about?

595
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,607
-You spread the rumor about me!
-What rumor?

596
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,904
How could you do this to me?
How could you?

597
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,698
Hold on! Mi-mo, why are you doing this?

598
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:20,824
No, stop it!

599
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,619
And you lied to me! You bitch!

600
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:27,373
Wait, Mi-mo. Listen to me.
I didn't spread the rumor about you.

601
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,957
Shut up, you backstabber!
