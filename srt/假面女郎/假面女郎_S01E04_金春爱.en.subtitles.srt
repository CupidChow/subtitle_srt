1
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,599
I think I know who this bitch is.

2
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:18,685
What?

3
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,273
You said that bitch's name is Kim Mo-mi?

4
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:07,752
MASK GIRL

5
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:13,258
KIM CHUN-AE

6
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,889
Please introduce yourself.

7
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,477
I'm Kim Chun-ae.

8
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,771
What?

9
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,898
What "ae"?

10
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,067
It's Kim Chun-ae.

11
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,237
-Kim Chun-ae?
-What kind of name is that?

12
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,698
Quiet down. And?

13
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,575
That's it?

14
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,452
Yes.

15
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,665
Grab that empty seat over there,
the second one from the back.

16
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,836
By the way,
some of you were late again today.

17
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,297
Be on time
and wear your uniforms properly.

18
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,299
Stay focused. The test is soon.

19
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,634
Min-jun, stop dozing off during class.

20
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,552
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,345
Don't be loud.

22
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,599
-Have a good day!
-Thank you, sir.

23
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,524
-Did you watch Music Plaza yesterday?
-Of course.

24
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,610
You did? Did you see my honey?

25
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,155
Oh my gosh! He was so cute!
I was honestly dying!

26
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,701
Hey, do you like SechsKies or H.O.T.?

27
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,369
Sorry?

28
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,747
SechsKies or H.O.T. Which one?

29
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,332
I like…

30
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,170
SechsKies.

31
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,380
-SechsKies?
-What?

32
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,298
What the heck?

33
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,008
-Damn!
-Oh shit. You suck.

34
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,427
-Let's just go to the snack bar.
-Let's go.

35
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,644
-Hi.
-Hello.

36
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,146
-Hi.
-Why does he always look so good?

37
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,775
You little shit!

38
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,867
Hey, long time no see.

39
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,537
His name was Bu-yong.

40
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,582
He was training to be in a boy band.

41
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,085
He was my first love.

42
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,214
At that time,
I could only watch him from afar.

43
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,008
I couldn't say a word to him.

44
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,306
The next time I saw him
was the summer of 11th grade.

45
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,730
Thank you for coming.

46
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,569
Welcome.

47
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,536
Wait!

48
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,705
You know me, right?

49
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,622
Huh?

50
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,124
We were classmates last year.

51
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,751
Yeah, we were.

52
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,336
Chun-ae, right?

53
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,299
You knew my name?

54
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,593
I remembered you had the same name
as my grandma.

55
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,847
-I see.
-Hey, what a relief though.

56
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:07,932
What is?

57
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,435
Having someone I know work here.

58
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,442
I can't sell you alcohol.

59
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,238
Can you make an exception?

60
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,253
I'm sorry,

61
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,131
but a pack of Seven as well?

62
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,092
Oh, Seven.

63
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:52,060
Look, you can't tell anyone
about this, okay?

64
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,394
Of course.

65
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,233
Thank you so much.

66
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,151
Chun-ae.

67
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,695
Bye!

68
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,993
After that day,
he started coming by often.

69
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,540
I was just happy to talk to him,
even if it was in such a trivial way.

70
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,596
Hey, you!

71
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,557
Bu-yong asked me to bring you to him.

72
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,312
Me?

73
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:37,939
To where?

74
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,399
Just get on.

75
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,943
Where are we going?

76
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,820
It's Bu-yong's birthday today,

77
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,905
and he wants you to come.

78
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,841
Kiss him!

79
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,676
-What the hell?
-Kiss him!

80
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,635
Kiss!

81
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,179
-No way.
-Hey, Chun-ae!

82
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,973
-Clear this.
-Man, I'm wasted.

83
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,559
Come here.

84
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,937
Guys, make room for her.

85
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,107
Come sit here.

86
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,114
Thanks for coming, Chun-ae.

87
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,451
No, thanks for inviting me.

88
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,413
Have you ever had alcohol?

89
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,833
-No, I've never had any before.
-Oh, really?

90
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,252
Then you can try some
for the first time today.

91
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,591
Consider it an honor, got it?

92
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:50,052
Hey, drink! Drink up!

93
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,054
Drink up!

94
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,140
Drink up!

95
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,100
-Drink it already!
-Chug it!

96
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,645
-Come on. Chug it!
-She's drinking it.

97
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,730
Look at her go!

98
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,857
Don't chug it all at once.

99
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,525
You'll get drunk.

100
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,364
I told Yong-su to come by later.

101
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,283
-Yong-su?
-What the fuck?

102
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,327
I'm sorry.

103
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,620
Pushing someone…

104
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,414
You did? Yong-su's so good-looking!

105
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,917
She just loves all men.

106
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,169
Oh, come on.

107
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,782
Why aren't you inside?

108
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,077
Are you okay?

109
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,994
What?

110
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,413
Yeah, I'm fine.

111
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,666
That's why I told you to drink slowly.

112
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,293
I'm really okay.

113
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,295
That's good to hear.

114
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,299
Hey, Chun-ae.

115
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,010
Yeah?

116
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,598
Can I ask you something?

117
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,688
My heart's fluttering

118
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:29,443
You came to me and took my heart away

119
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,071
Can I borrow some money?

120
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,533
What?

121
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,536
The bill came out to be more
than I had expected.

122
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,789
How much?

123
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,624
Around 200,000 won.

124
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,669
Ah, that's a lot.

125
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:54,176
I have some money coming in next week.
I'll pay you right back.

126
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,891
Okay.

127
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,855
Thank you so much.

128
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,149
You're seriously the best.

129
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,658
Bu-yong did not pay me back,
even after a week had passed.

130
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,243
In fact,

131
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,204
he came to see me
whenever he needed money.

132
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,004
Two bottles of soju, please.

133
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,672
Sure thing.

134
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,924
-Could you fry some rice here?
-Yes.

135
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,968
Two bottles of soju. Enjoy.

136
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,928
When should I tell you

137
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,096
I ponder every day

138
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,515
How I feel?

139
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,683
I need courage

140
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,769
I'm going to

141
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,187
My baby, look at me

142
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,938
Confess to you today

143
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,482
I run to you

144
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,860
You became a ray of light

145
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:57,615
In my boring life

146
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,161
I will protect you always

147
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:07,208
BU-YONG, HUGE CONGRATS ON YOUR DEBUT
YOU WERE TOTALLY AWESOME

148
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,835
Hey, it's busy!

149
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,672
More than a month passed,
but he never replied.

150
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,964
Get back in here!

151
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,693
Hey, over here!

152
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,652
Bu-yong!

153
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,197
Excuse us! Please don't push!
It's dangerous.

154
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:39,949
Bu-yong!

155
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,411
Excuse me. Coming through!

156
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,708
Okay, excuse me.
Please don't push. Just step aside.

157
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,666
It's so fucking cold.

158
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,334
-You have the cigarettes?
-Yeah.

159
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,587
-But I don't have a lighter.
-I do.

160
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,631
Hey, you got
a bunch of paper cranes again.

161
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:41,177
The pile of trash keeps growing bigger.
Fucking hell.

162
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,179
Can I get a light?

163
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,102
Was she someone you know?

164
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,188
Who?

165
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,064
The girl who called you by name.

166
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,487
Oh, we were in the same class
in high school.

167
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,030
I see. A schoolmate.

168
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,949
You didn't hang out with her, right?

169
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,076
Do you have a fucking death wish?

170
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,621
-Are you nuts?
-I was just kidding.

171
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,122
She was one of my ATMs.

172
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,040
ATM?

173
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,084
Yeah. An ATM to take cash out
whenever I needed it.

174
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,254
What the heck? How many ATMs do you have?

175
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,632
When I was at my damn peak,

176
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,842
I had about ten.

177
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,594
Ten?

178
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,013
You're freaking awesome.

179
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:30,059
Dude, exactly how much
did you get out of her?

180
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,978
Enough to buy an imported car?

181
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,104
Wow, that's sick.

182
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,483
She used to be my very reliable ATM. Shit!

183
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,736
-Did you ever do anything for her?
-No fucking way!

184
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,535

PHILIP (CHOI BU-YONG) LEAVES GROUP

198
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,742
I wanted to be pretty.

199
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:34,081
That was the only goal I had in my life.

200
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,836
Hello, everyone.

201
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,005
Today, at Gangcheon Plus Mart,

202
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,633
we're having a sale to celebrate
our third year since opening.

203
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,720
We will be holding a big event
during the sale period.

204
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,638
We look forward to seeing you.

205
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:04,403
I thought I'd avoid him if I ever met him,
but strangely enough, I became curious.

206
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,738
Hey. Choi Bu-yong.

207
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,990
Everyone, come quickly and…

208
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:08,908
Do I know you?

209
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,621
It's me. Chun-ae.

210
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,122
Excuse me?

211
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,708
Kim Chun-ae, from Seonghui High School.

212
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,384
I could feel the drastic change
in the way he looked at me.

213
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,762
It filled me with great joy.

214
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,990
Jeez, you scared me. Go away.

215
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,999
Let's get up and eat.

216
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,210
Just five minutes.

217
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,463
Five more minutes.

218
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,512
All he had to his name

219
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,306
was a beat-up car.

220
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,937
Bu-yong was afraid to work,
perhaps in fear of being labeled

221
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,147
a former boy band member.

222
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,858
It made me feel rather guilty.

223
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,532
Have this too.

224
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,034
Okay.

225
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,623
You can stay at my place

226
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,458
until you find work.

227
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,507
I mean, I'd love that,
but are you okay with that?

228
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,218
Just promise me
you'll work hard to find a job.

229
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,555
Of course. Yeah.

230
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,684
I had to find a job
that paid better for him.

231
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,394
Can you sing?

232
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:02,813
Just a little.

233
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,606
How about dance?

234
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,776
-I danced at promotional events.
-Oh, very nice.

235
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,487
There isn't much touching here,

236
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:14,324
but there might be some touching
depending on the person.

237
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,743
Handle it how you see fit.

238
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:19,288
We don't get many overly handsy,
obnoxious customers,

239
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,792
but some bastards turn into dickheads
when they get drunk.

240
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,022
Fill me with love

241
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,817
My love battery seems to be
All out of juice

242
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:53,197
I can't live without you
I really cannot live without you

243
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,325
You are my battery

244
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,494
No need to be handsome…

245
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,661
Soon enough,

246
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,789
I became the top hostess.

247
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,257
Hey, Ping-Ping.
What have you been up to today?

248
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,095
Did you have a good day?

249
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,642
I told you to take out the trash
this morning.

250
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,980
Why do you have the light off?

251
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,736
Why is the place like a pigsty?

252
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,908
Did you smoke in the house?
With Ping-Ping here?

253
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,913
Jeez, for God's sake.

254
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,672
Did you feed Ping-Ping?

255
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,174
Yeah.

256
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,135
Did you really?

257
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,719
I said I did.

258
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,986
What a load of crap.

259
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:19,867
I asked you where that bitch is,
but you're just saying useless shit.

260
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,035
Did I ask to hear your sob story?

261
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:22,995
No, wait!

262
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,498
That bitch comes into the story now.

263
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,085
I mean it.

264
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,590
How could you forget that?
He's one of your regulars.

265
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,883
Mr. Kim is impossible.

266
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,926
That bitch started working at the club

267
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,720
-about two months ago.
-Oh, hey.

268
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,222
Say hi to her. She's the newbie.

269
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,282
How old are you, darling?

270
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,909
Twenty-eight.

271
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,328
Then you're a year older than Mi-ae.

272
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,748
Hey, I'm actually 28 as well.
I took a year off my real age.

273
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,333
What the heck?

274
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,878
Let's see some IDs.
We gotta figure out who's older.

275
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,136
KIM CHUN-AE
DOB 06/27/1983

276
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,388
So you were born in 1983. And you?

277
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,099
I lost my ID card.

278
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,437
No. You can't pull something like that.
Come on. Show us.

279
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,398
It's not like she'd lie about being older.

280
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,859
Work it out between you two.

281
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,904
Anyway, did you pick a name?

282
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:39,821
Pardon?

283
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,991
Surely you won't be using your real name.

284
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,622
I'll be A-reum, then.

285
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,539
A-reum?

286
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,041
That's nice.

287
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,670
That bitch stole my spot
the moment she began working there.

288
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,147
The pain of losing you, my broken heart

289
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:18,443
My completely empty heart
Makes today endlessly sad

290
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,988
On a Saturday night

291
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,491
On that very day

292
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,328
On a Saturday night

293
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,415
You left me and…

294
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,512
Hey, you.

295
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,099
I was supposed to wear that today.

296
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,935
The boss told me to wear it today.

297
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,271
Take it off.

298
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,897
Off!

299
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,736
What's with you?

300
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,080
That bitch even stole my regulars.

301
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,917
Mr. Song! When did you get here?

302
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,462
Why didn't you tell me?

303
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,173
Oh, I asked for A-reum today.

304
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,341
Welcome back.

305
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,800
Hey, A-reum. You're here.

306
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,136
Here we go.

307
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,226
-You come by often.
-Of course.

308
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,734
Hey! There's this thing called ethics,
even in this business.

309
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,111
Why the fuck are you eyeing things
that belong to me?

310
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,405
I've never done that.

311
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,824
Never?

312
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,620
Then why do my regulars ask for you?

313
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,373
Why are you asking me that?

314
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,209
If you're curious, ask the boss.

315
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,673
You flirted with them.
Don't you fucking use her as an excuse.

316
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,931
You stop fucking around.

317
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,475
You fucking bitch!

318
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,813
Don't act all pretty and shit
when you've had your whole face done!

319
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,858
You got your whole face done too!

320
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,236
Let go of me!

321
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,654
Let go, bitch!

322
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,656
-Let go!
-You let go first!

323
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,117
-You let go first!
-Let go, damn it!

324
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,747
You tramp!

325
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,541
Let go on the count of three!

326
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,710
One.

327
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,212
Two.

328
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,588
Three!

329
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,258
I knew you'd do this! You fucking bitch!

330
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,300
My point exactly!

331
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,052
-You bitch!
-Hey! What's going on?

332
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,012
Stop it right now!

333
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,768
What the fuck is going on?

334
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,355
Boss, she keeps stealing my regulars!

335
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,609
How's that her fault? It wouldn't have
happened had you done your job right!

336
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,362
What? Wait.

337
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,739
Incompetent losers always blame others.

338
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,117
No, boss.

339
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,288
Actually, I think it was my fault.

340
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,626
I won't do that again, Mi-ae.

341
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,631
Are you fucking kidding me?

342
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,967
Jeez, what a way to accept an apology.

343
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,638
Be the bigger person, A-reum, will you?
She is all twisted.

344
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,015
Let's go.

345
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,899
Fuck! Seriously?

346
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,078
I left the club that day,

347
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,789
and that was the last time I saw her.

348
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,176
You think I'd believe that bullshit?

349
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,054
I'm not her, I swear!

350
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,057
Look! Her breasts are natural.

351
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,976
Mine are all silicone implants.

352
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,738
These are silicone implants?

353
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,407
Fucking hell!

354
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,536
If you're lying to me,
I'll fucking eat you alive.

355
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,706
Why would I do that?

356
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,210
I want to fuck her up just as much as you.

357
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,091
So…

358
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,928
where is that bitch right now?

359
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,270
Hey, Jin-a!

360
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,673
-She quit, apparently.
-What? Why?

361
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,426
-She got a new job that pays better.
-Where?

362
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,428
How would I know?

363
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,470
Damn it.

364
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,974
Should we just call the police?

365
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,058
We can't do that.

366
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,937
I'm going to end that bitch myself.

367
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:47,856
Whatever it takes.

368
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,902
Then I'll go to other clubs
and ask around.

369
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:57,073
A job that pays her more money means
she's become a room-only hostess.

370
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,992
We'll find her if we check those venues.

371
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,037
I'll put in some legwork.

372
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,206
That would be great.

373
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,668
I need some money to do that.

374
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,213
Money?

375
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,007
I have to do this instead of working!

376
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,508
How much?

377
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:17,886
300,000 won a day?

378
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:18,928
Let's do 100,000.

379
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,889
-200,000.
-Get lost, bitch!

380
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,474
I can just find out myself.

381
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,603
If you look into it,
everyone will know in a heartbeat

382
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,064
that some weird lady is looking for her.

383
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,691
Then she'll just move to another place.

384
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,576
I'll start tonight. I'll call you.

385
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,244
Report back regularly, okay?

386
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,346
GIL APARTMENTS

387
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,360
It's me, Chun-ae.

388
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:22,200
All the stories I told that crazy woman
about Mo-mi were actually…

389
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,535
What happened to your face?

390
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,452
…all lies.

391
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,037
Let's talk inside.

392
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,421
Mr. Kim is impossible.

393
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,881
It was true that I met Mo-mi at the club.

394
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,050
Oh, hey. Say hi to her.

395
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,635
She's the newbie.

396
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,395
Apparently, you two are the same age.

397
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,855
You should be friends.

398
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,233
You both have a lot in common.

399
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,798
This sad song makes me cry

400
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:23,219
I sing it thinking of you

401
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,347
I laugh and cry
Until it wears me out again

402
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:31,144
As I stumble drunkenly tonight

403
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,689
I remember you as you walked away from me

404
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,318
I wonder if you know
How broken my heart is

405
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:42,071
I want to erase you
As you grow farther away

406
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,533
So I try and try
But it doesn't seem to work

407
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:49,037
The pain of losing you, my broken heart

408
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,997
My totally empty heart

409
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,957
How can I live on?

410
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,920
The pain of losing you, my broken heart

411
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:00,965
My totally empty heart
Makes today endlessly sad

412
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,676
On a Saturday night

413
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,805
On that very day

414
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,767
On a Saturday night

415
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,353
You left me…

416
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,355
We were just like twins.

417
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:20,652
How we wanted to be pretty in the past,
how we were hurt by others,

418
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,863
and even how we wanted to be born anew.

419
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,324
The memories of our lives

420
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,909
were so much alike.

421
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:35,792
A-reum.

422
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,837
Isn't this yours?

423
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,130
It was on the green room floor.

424
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,632
Thanks.

425
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,510
Where did you buy it?

426
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,223
You like it? Do you want it?

427
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,475
Oh, no. That's not what I meant.

428
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,938
No, I really want to give it to you.
Come here.

429
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,736
There you go. It looks good on you.

430
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,322
Then one day,

431
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:11,119
without any notice,
Mo-mi didn't show up at the club.

432
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,375
Mo-mi.

433
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,255
Hey, what's wrong?

434
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,340
Are you sick?

435
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,305
Are you really sick?

436
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,560
Hey!

437
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,770
You're burning up!

438
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,773
Let's go to the hospital.

439
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,734
-Come on.
-I'm not going.

440
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,945
What are you saying?
You're running a high fever.

441
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,281
Come on. Get up.

442
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,992
Let's go to the hospital. Come on.

443
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:55,371
-You're gonna die at this rate! Get up!
-I said I'm not going!

444
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,003
Fine. Do whatever you like. See if I care.

445
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,176
I can't go to the hospital.

446
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,597
What are you saying?

447
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,893
I killed a person.

448
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,063
You crazy bitch.

449
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,733
You lie about crap like that
to avoid the hospital?

450
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:34,577
That's when Mo-mi told me a story
she hadn't told anyone this entire time.

451
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,540
Why she ended up here like this.

452
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:51,803
Gosh.

453
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,978
Why are you crying?

454
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,027
I wanted to protect her.

455
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,657
To me, protecting Mo-mi
was like protecting myself.

456
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:18,079
If some lady comes to the club
and asks for A-reum,

457
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,248
tell her that A-reum left for more money.

458
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,543
Sure. But why? Who is she?

459
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,922
-She's trying to extort money from A-reum.
-Oh, what a piece of trash.

460
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,049
-I'm counting on you.
-Okay.

461
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,050
-Okay.
-Bye.

462
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,304
Leave right away.

463
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,391
That woman's gonna kill you
if she finds you.

464
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,560
I have nowhere to go.

465
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,438
Can't you go to your mom's?

466
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,399
She's still your mom.

467
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,277
I'm sure she'd help her own daughter.

468
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,780
I told you, my mom is not
that kind of a person.

469
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:59,245
She'd probably call the police
as soon as she saw me.

470
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,128
Can't you go abroad?

471
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,382
It's not that easy these days.

472
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,635
Stowing away sounds a bit scary.

473
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,518
I'm sorry I got you into this mess.

474
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,270
Don't say that.

475
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,272
Let's look for a way out.

476
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,524
I'm sure there is a way.

477

GIL APARTMENTS

478
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,631
What's up?
You never sleep over anywhere else.

479
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,259
So you knew I didn't come home.

480
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,261
You never called, so I thought you didn't.

481
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,059
Did you feed Ping-Ping?

482
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,085
I'm sorry,

483
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,546
but I'd like you to leave now.

484
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,466
Do you hear me?

485
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,302
I said I would like you to leave.

486
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,429
I don't want to.

487
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,597
What?

488
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,099
I said I don't want to.

489
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,189
This is my house.

490
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,316
Get out now.

491
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:55,945
What if I say no?

492
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,617
I shouldn't have brought trash in.

493
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,746
Get out before I call the police.
Leave now, or I'll call.

494
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,747
Trash?

495
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,334
You're the trash here.

496
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,504
What?

497
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,009
You posted the pictures, right?

498
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,179
What are you talking about?

499
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,473
You know what.
Pictures that destroyed my life.

500
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,519
Wgr00 is your ID, isn't it?

501
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,398
I was using your computer, and your ID…

502
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,777
came up as "wgr00."

503
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,577
Happy to have ruined my life?

504
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,373
It wasn't me.

505
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,626
Really?

506
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:53,753
I see.

507
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,589
You fuck!

508
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,426
Fucking hell. Hey.

509
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,303
You fucking bitch.

510
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,847
Thinking about how you fucked me over…

511
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,183
I'm telling you, it's not me.

512
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,101
Don't bullshit me. Damn it!

513
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,481
I have the proof,
so don't fucking try to get out of this.

514
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,609
And what did you say to me?
You want me to leave?

515
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,949
Damn. This gets more ridiculous
the more I think about it.

516
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,666
Listen, you fucking bitch.

517
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,920
I'm not leaving until I get
the compensation I deserve.

518
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,591
I won't hit your face
since you still have to work.

519
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,135
Make a sound, and you're dead.

520
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,327
-One serving of tteokbokki, please?
-Sure.

521
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,377
Hey!

522
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,337
You're Mask Girl, right?

523
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:22,842
Wow.

524
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,927
I'm Teddy!

525
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,264
Teddy?

526
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:31,183
Mask Girl Heart Teddy.
Your fan club president.

527
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,894
Whoa! This is awesome!

528
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,148
No idea what you're talking about.

529
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:43,487
Now that I'm seeing you with my own eyes,
it's definitely you.

530
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,615
You have no idea
how dedicated a fan I was.

531
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,160
I was a big fan of your live stream.

532
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:52,121
Wow, you are so pretty now. That's crazy.

533
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:53,789
You know,

534
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,417
I don't think
you would've ever done such--

535
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,388
Hey!

536
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,182
Are you okay?

537
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:18,439
I know you are Mask Girl.
I've been looking for you for ages!

538
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,859
I'll call the police
if you keep following me.

539
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:23,778
Be my guest.

540
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,156
I'll totally keep it a secret
that I met you. I--

541
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,367
Fuck off before I really kill you.

542
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,347
Chun-ae.

543
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,767
Where are you going?

544
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,272
Let me come with you.

545
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,493
I think he's sleeping.

546
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,788
-Get what you need and come back.
-Okay.

547
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,563
Where are you going?

548
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,651
What?

549
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,951
I asked where you were going,
fucking bitch.

550
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,001
Taking Ping-Ping out for a walk.

551
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,133
Going for a walk with a designer purse?

552
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,887
Fuck. If you're gonna come up
with an excuse, use your brain.

553
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,351
Fuck!

554
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,020
Where are you going, crazy bitch?

555
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,700
I guess you haven't been beaten enough.

556
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,039
-Oh, Ping-Ping!
-You fucking mutt!

557
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:49,126
You fuck! I'm going to kill you,
you fucking bastard!

558
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,545
Die!

559
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,886
Shit! You fucking bitch!

560
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:02,222
I'll fuck you up, bitch. I played with you
because you fixed up your face.

561
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,309
You fucking mess with me?
I'll put you back in your place, bitch!

562
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,313
Death is what you deserve.

563
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,735
Die, you fucking bitch.

564
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,654
Fuck!

565
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,954
Oh fuck!

566
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,358
Who is that fucking bitch?

567
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:34,124
KIM CHUN-AE

568
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:44,051
The number you are trying to reach
is not available…

569
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,385
This fucking snake!

570
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,930
Did she skedaddle?

571
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,730
LOVE MG
5 NEW MESSAGES

572
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,023
What is this?

573
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,818
LOVE MG! MESSAGE ME WHEN YOU LOG IN!
CRAZY THING HAPPENED!

574
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,238
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS

575
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,161
THE GIRL FROM THE SUPERMARKET
MET SOMEONE

576
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,584
I MET THIS WOMAN TODAY

577
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,211
HER BOOBS CONFIRMED
SHE'S THE REAL MASK GIRL

578
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,262
GIRL WE THOUGHT WAS MASK GIRL
AND THE REAL MASK GIRL

579
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,388
KNOW EACH OTHER. ISN'T THAT CRAZY?

580
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:32,599
Shit!

581
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,893
You fucking bitch!

582
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:37,437
Shit!

583
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,409
Damn it.

584
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,215
I'm gonna tear those bitches
limb from limb.

585
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,813
Where are we going?

586
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,901
Wherever the road leads.

587
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,239
Is there anywhere you wanna go?

588
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,036
No, I don't.

589
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,501
I think I'm pregnant.

590
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,632
What? Really?

591
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,218
Who's the father?

592
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,764
Is it that Ju...?

593
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,522
So, what are you gonna do?

594
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:06,485
I'm going to keep it.

595
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:11,073
Are you crazy? How are you going to raise
the baby in this situation?

596
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,620
I don't know.
It'll probably work out somehow.

597
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,046
I wonder if the baby will be ugly.

598
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,342
You can pay for the plastic surgery.

599
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:39,101
I'm gonna tell the baby
that they're pretty.

600
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:44,856
My mom never told me I was pretty.
Not even once.

601
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,276
Even if the baby is ugly…

602
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,489
I'll tell them that they're pretty.

603
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:24,896
It will soon appear right before my eyes

604
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:29,526
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!

605
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:33,113
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!

606
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,491
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!

607
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,494
For triumph is drawing near!

608
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,579
Amen!

609
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,881
Playing in the water
in the middle of the night?

610
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,426
She's the woman I told you about.

611
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,724
I've waited for this day so eagerly

612
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:47,145
that my eyes popped out of their sockets,
you worthless bitches.

613
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,277
You deserve a painful death.

614
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,615
Is this how you dealt with my son?

615
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:03,161
Yes. That perverted fucker
you call your son,

616
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,162
I killed him.

617
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,164
What are you doing?

618
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,332
Damn.

619
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,376
No, I killed him. I did.

620
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,921
Lady! It's me. I'm Kim Mo-mi.

621
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,465
I dealt with your son. I did!

622
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,467
I killed him. I did!

623
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,094
I'm Kim Mo-mi!

624
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,014
You fucking clown-ass bitches.

625
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,642
It doesn't matter either way.

626
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,103
I was gonna kill you both anyway.

627
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,610
What the heck?

628
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,281
This fucking piece of shitty metal.

629
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,051
Chun-ae!

630
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:07,475
Chun-ae!

631
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,778
You rotten bitch.

632
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,658
You fucking bitch!

633
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,191
Die, you fucking devil!

634
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,698
Damn you!

635
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:10,205
I'll cut you up into tiny pieces
just like you did to my son!

636
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,517
Chun-ae!

637
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,402
Get up, okay? Come on. Let's go.

638
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,073
Please?

639
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,952
Come on. Let's go!

640
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,123
Chun-ae. Look at me.

641
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,833
Please?

642
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:57,919
Wake up.

643
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,009
No…

644
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,136
Please, no!

645
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:13,012
Wow, what a celebrity. A total megastar.

646
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,141
We'll be exiting now. Opening the door.

647
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,684
Execute her!

648
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,061
Look over here, please! Do you regret it?

649
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:23,523
-Why did you commit murder?
-Do you have anything to say?

650
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,691
Show us your face!

651
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,402
Do you regret committing murder?

652
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,447
-Let us through!
-Look over here, please!

653
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,700
The crowd and cameras only existed
in my fantasies.

654
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,788
A flood of camera flashes
and a stage prepared just for me.

655
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:43,585
Everyone's eyes and interest
all focused on me.

656
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,797
I dreamed of all this for so long.

657
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,594
Ms. Mo-mi!

658
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,308
Oh, Ms. Mo-mi!
