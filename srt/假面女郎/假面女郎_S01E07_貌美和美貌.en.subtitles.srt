1
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,377
Granny!

2
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:48,465
My goodness!
Why are you waiting outside? It's hot!

3
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,384
I bought some snacks
and some clothes for you.

4
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,138
-Let's go in. Are you hungry?
-Yes, I am.

5
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,907
What's the problem?

6
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,325
Mo-mi, that's enough.

7
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,454
That woman from earlier
is going to kill someone.

8
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,164
This is your final warning.

9
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,958
If you do this again,
I'll have to take appropriate measures.

10
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,668
Come on. You need to stop.

11
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,922
Someone needs to stop her!

12
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:12,692
MASK GIRL

13
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,031
MO-MI AND MI-MO

14
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,952
Wow! This jeotgal is really good.

15
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,372
I've never met a girl
who likes eating jeotgal.

16
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,960
I had this fermented for a long time
in the ground.

17
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,671
Wow, in the ground?
No wonder it's so good.

18
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,927
She really said that?

19
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,976
Sweetie, don't worry about it.

20
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,812
I'll have someone look into it
as best as I can.

21
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,608
It might take a while to find that woman,

22
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:57,362
so I'll look into your daughter
and mom first and let you know.

23
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:02,867
Shouldn't you at least
give your grandma a call?

24
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,119
My grandma's

25
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,164
probably happy that I'm gone.

26
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,833
That's not how grandmas feel at all.

27
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:15,296
She must be feeling terrible
after you ran away like that.

28
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,426
You must call and tell her you're okay
if you want to live here with me.

29
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,306
If you feel uncomfortable,
just don't mention where you are.

30
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,643
Okay, I will.

31
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,560
Good.

32
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,819
By the way, Granny.

33
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,655
Is that man your son?

34
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,659
Yes.

35
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,162
Really? I didn't know you had a son.

36
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,167
He's not with me anymore.

37
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,337
He's gone away.

38
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,029
SHIN YEONG-HUI

39
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,286
MISSING PERSONS REPORT

40
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,245
Ma'am.

41
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,122
Sorry to ask.

42
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,459
Has she, by any chance,
run away from home before?

43
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,714
Oh, well, a couple of times,
but she always came back the day after.

44
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,720
Then how about we wait
a little longer, ma'am?

45
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,805
She might have just run away again.

46
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,557
Oh, what do I do?

47
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,205
Oh my goodness, Mi-mo.

48
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,289
Where are you?

49
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,833
I'm doing well,

50
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,628
so don't look for me.

51
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,672
TELEPHONE ROOM: 02

52
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,633
The number you have called is busy…

53
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,635
Don't report me as a runaway either.

54
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,053
Wait, but…

55
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,473
You hated living with me anyway.

56
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,100
No, that's not true!

57
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:36,312
You said you felt uncomfortable around me
because I reminded you of that woman.

58
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,607
Kids at school hated me too.

59
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:45,029
I thought about it,
and the solution is for me to disappear.

60
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,364
Listen, Mi-mo.

61
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,658
What are you talking about?

62
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,034
I won't call you again.

63
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,786
Wait, hello?

64
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,037
Mi-mo. Mi--

65
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,747
GRANDMOTHER

66
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,665
POWER OFF

67
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,626
Gosh.

68
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,213
Hello?

69
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:03,923
It's me, Mo-mi.

70
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,718
How did you…

71
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,096
How is Mi-mo?

72
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,266
Why are you asking about Mi-mo now?

73
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,184
Mi-mo's doing fine.

74
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:16,811
Mom.

75
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:23,234
Is there a strange person around Mi-mo,
like an old woman or someone like that?

76
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,402
No, there isn't.

77
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,447
I don't know how you got this number,

78
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,533
but don't call me again
if you truly care for Mi-mo.

79
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,451
Mom.

80
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,368
I--

81
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,245
Hello?

82
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,205
Hello?

83
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,378
Inmate 1047. Your time is up.

84
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,296
Step out!

85
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,133
-Inmate 1047, come out now!
-Step out right now!

86
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,595
Out right now!

87
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,221
Wait, just one more call.

88
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,806
No. Come out right now!

89
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,684
-I said, "One more call."
-Come out right now!

90
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,353
-I need to make one more--
-Come out right now!

91
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,189
Do not move!

92
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,940
Stay still!

93
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:09,655
Sweetie, did you make a scene
in the telephone room?

94
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:16,579
You did that last time
when that woman came and again today.

95
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:22,126
I barely talked the warden out
of putting you in solitary confinement.

96
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,878
I'm sorry.

97
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,549
But she did say you won't be allowed
to make calls for two weeks.

98
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:34,931
Oh, by the way,
I'm looking into that woman.

99
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,225
It's taking a while
'cause she changed her name.

100
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,731
However, I did find the school
Mi-mo is attending.

101
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,194
You can certainly call them if you want.

102
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:52,657
I'll put in a good word with the warden
for this call, at least.

103
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,368
Hello?

104
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,162
Hello. Is this Seongrim Middle School?

105
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,288
Yes, it is.

106
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,084
Could I talk to Kim Mi-mo in Class 2?
She's a seventh grader.

107
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:08,256
There's something I have to tell her.
It's urgent.

108
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,841
I see. One moment, please.

109
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,542
Hello?

110
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:50,298
Inmate 1047, your time is up. Step out.

111
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,716
Hello?

112
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,474
They hung up.

113
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,351
Good job.

114
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,815
VARIOUS ROLE PLAY FOR HIRE,
ERRANDS, FAMILY PROBLEMS

115
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:08,941
Goodbye.

116
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,864
Wow, the tomato is delicious.

117
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,074
It's a good harvest this year.

118
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:21,621
They're sweet, right? I set aside
the real sweet ones just for you.

119
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,333
Aren't they tasty?
Eat as many as you'd like.

120
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,418
I'm so happy you like them.

121
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,629
Go ahead, eat. Eat up.

122
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:30,963
Go on.

123
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,052
Eun-suk. Why does Kim Mo-mi have
such a long face today?

124
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,183
How did it go? Did you talk to her?

125
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,100
Yes.

126
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,770
Eun-suk, if possible,

127
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:51,651
could you get me
some pictures of Mi-mo going to school?

128
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,319
Pictures?

129
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,029
Right.

130
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,825
Hire a girl who looks like her,
give her the school uniform,

131
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,161
and take a picture in front of the school.

132
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,957
No, she doesn't have to look
exactly like her.

133
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,709
Just similar enough will do.

134
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,753
Hey, look!

135
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,257
She left when her daughter was a baby,
so she doesn't know the girl's face.

136
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,220
Jeez.

137
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,891
Shit, it's all crooked. Damn it.

138
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,564
It'd be weird to get up close,
so they took the picture from a distance.

139
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,819
Thank you. I feel more at ease now.

140
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,572
Do you? That's good to hear.

141
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,910
I'm glad you're feeling better
because the surgery is tomorrow.

142
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,870
That's good.

143
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,460
Ma'am. You can't get this at this price
anywhere else.

144
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,796
We have fixed prices, so we can't lower--

145
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,215
Come on. I'll pay in cash.

146
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,676
So lower it a little more.

147
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,511
Here.

148
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,848
Let's settle for this.

149
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,813
QUICK GRILL BRIQUETTE

150
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,775
How much is it?

151
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,819
It's 9,700 won. Would you like a bag?

152
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,778
No.

153
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,614
Please put them in here.

154
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,102
Mi-mo, Granny's home!

155
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,731
Are you sleeping?

156
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,369
Damn it.

157
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,342
Happy birthday to you

158
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,261
Happy birthday to you

159
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,431
Happy birthday, dear Granny

160
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,225
Happy birthday to you

161
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:32,978
Is it my birthday today?

162
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,438
I didn't know.

163
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,567
By the way, how did you know
it was my birthday?

164
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,319
I saw your ID in the drawer.

165
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,365
-Granny?
-Yeah?

166
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,951
-Blow out the candle.
-Oh, yeah, sure.

167
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,290
Granny.

168
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,711
To me, you're my real grandma.

169
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,465
Live a long life, okay?

170
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,637
Of course.

171
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,603
Inmate 1047,
time for the hospital transfer.

172
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,484
I wish you the best of luck.

173
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:48,674
She looks totally different
in plain clothes.

174
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,633
She does.

175
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,094
I bought them for her.

176
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,015
My goodness, you look great in a skirt.

177
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,642
What do you think? Do you like it?

178
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,936
Yes. I do like them.

179
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:05,607
This surgery will be performed
without any outsiders' knowledge,

180
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,653
so behave yourself
at the hospital, all right?

181
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,739
Yes, I will.

182
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,073
Very well.

183
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,535
God will be with you.

184
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,465
Let me know right away
if anything happens.

185
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:30,966
Yes, ma'am.

186
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,305
Ready to go?

187
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,057
Yes.

188
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,166
Mi-mo. Come eat!

189
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,961
Wow! There's so much to eat today!

190
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,338
Yes. Right.

191
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,839
Go ahead and eat up.

192
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,674
-There you go.
-Okay.

193
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,012
Granny.

194
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,223
I need to make money.

195
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,183
Money?

196
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,144
What do you need it for?

197
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,562
What do you think?

198
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,274
I want to send you on vacation
and buy you clothes and yummy food.

199
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,361
All you have to do is live a long life.

200
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,532
What's wrong?

201
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,953
Oh, nothing. Go ahead and eat up.

202
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,831
Your soup's getting cold.

203
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,966
Wow. This is so delicious.

204
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,015
Ms. Shin. How's everything?

205
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,184
I just wanted to ask you something.

206
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,772
You know the lady who's close with Mi-mo
at our church, who sells tteokbokki?

207
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,190
Do you mean Ms. Nam?

208
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:14,653
Oh, yes, her.
Could I possibly get her number

209
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,197
and her address, by any chance?

210
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,074
Oh, well--

211
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,286
Well, she came by my house
and prayed for us,

212
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,538
so I'd like to send her a gift.

213
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,623
Oh, I see. Hold on, please.

214
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,583
Oh, sure.

215
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,296
We just arrived at the hospital.

216
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,089
Yes.

217
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,508
Yes, ma'am.

218
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,719
You can change into these, please.

219
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,429
When is the surgery?

220
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,015
We'll begin when the blood test is done.

221
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,558
I understand.

222
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,657
Could you please bring me a Bible?

223
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,825
A Bible?

224
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,787
It's major surgery.
I don't know what might happen.

225
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,166
I'll feel more at ease if I have a Bible.

226
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,542
Would you, please?

227
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,506
Put it back on.

228
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,424
Yes, ma'am.

229
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,929
You can change
once she brings you a Bible.

230
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,319
I…

231
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,822
I need to go to the bathroom.

232
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,576
Can you go after she brings you a Bible?

233
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,328
I have to go badly.

234
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,997
She'll be quick, so sit tight.

235
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,291
I need to go now.

236
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,386
How can I relieve myself like this?

237
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:03,971
Yes, you can.

238
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,682
Isn't this a human rights violation?

239
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:12,396
I'm not here for my own sake
but to donate my organ.

240
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,233
And this is how I'm being treated?

241
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,318
I apologize, but that is the rule.

242
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,114
Then I won't do it.

243
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,657
Excuse me?

244
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,286
I don't want to donate my organ
while being treated like this.

245
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,829
I mean, you can't just--

246
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:33,375
Let the penitentiary and Eun-suk know
that I'm coming back.

247
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,686
23-7 HUISE-RI,
MAEMI-EUP, JINIL-GUN

248
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,341
You're--

249
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,093
Granny. I think there's something weird…

250
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,680
about that tteokbokki granny.

251
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:33,810
Get in.

252
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,275
"Huise-ri,

253
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,569
Maemi-eup, Jinil…"

254
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,947
Please go to 23-7 Huise-ri,
Maemi-eup, Jinil-gun.

255
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:53,663
So, that old woman spread the rumor
that Mi-mo is Mask Girl's daughter?

256
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:57,834
Yes. I went around everywhere,
trying to find where it all began.

257
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:02,339
But everything led me
to that tteokbokki granny.

258
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:06,051
I heard she was really fond of Mi-mo.

259
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,595
So, why did she spread the rumor?

260
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,639
Don't you think it's weird?

261
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,295
HOLY BIBLE

262
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,765
Ma'am!

263
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,267
Are you okay?

264
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,644
Shit.

265
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:01,815
Goddamn it!

266
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,820
Hey! Don't you dare move!

267
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:08,822
Hey! You!

268
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,616
-Hey, you! Stop right there!
-Hey!

269
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,742
Get her!

270
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,794
-Oh God!
-Is she dead?

271
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,464
Oh no! Oh my gosh.

272
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,632
Oh, ma'am!

273
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,802
Are you all right?

274
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,723
Oh my gosh! You can't just
run into the street like that!

275
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,517
My goodness. You really scared me.

276
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,815
Let's get you checked out.
So let's go inside. Okay?

277
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,284
Excuse me. Where are you going?

278
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,911
You need to see a doctor!

279
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,246
Where is she going?

280
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,915
Excuse me, ma'am!

281
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,421
What is she doing?

282
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,131
That's my car.

283
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:11,343
Hey! Oh my gosh. Hey! Where are you going?

284
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,511
Is she insane?

285
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,937
-What do I do?
-Where did she go?

286
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,982
-Oh no! My car! She took my car!
-Where did she go?

287
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,776
What do I do? This is crazy!

288
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,402
-Oh fuck!
-Shit.

289
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,154
-What?
-What?

290
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,698
-You goddamn fool!
-Are you shitting me?

291
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,409
What are your eyes for, you fucking idiot?

292
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,995
I'm gonna rip
your fucking eyes out, you fuck!

293
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,504
INCORRECT PATTERN

294
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,051
TRY AGAIN IN 28 SECONDS

295
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,694
Hello?

296
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,820
It's me.

297
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,573
Mom, don't hang up. Please listen to me.

298
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,783
Mi-mo is in danger.

299
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,411
What do you mean Mi-mo is in danger?

300
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,539
Ju Oh-nam's mom is trying to harm Mi-mo.

301
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,291
What are you saying?

302
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,542
That woman has been

303
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:29,170
circling around Mi-mo all this time
and ruining her life.

304
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,882
That woman is Ju Oh-nam's mom?

305
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:38,597
Mom, do you know anything about her?

306
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,099
Oh, I…

307
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,269
I think Mi-mo is
with that woman right now,

308
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,104
so I'm on my way to see her.

309
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,064
You're heading over right now?

310
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,399
No, Mom, you can't.

311
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,985
She's really dangerous, so don't go there.

312
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,778
Just call the police first.

313
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:58,283
And if you know her address or something,
please let me know, okay?

314
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,578
Hold on.

315
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:08,543
It's 23-7 Huise-ri, Maemi-eup, Jinil-gun.

316
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,880
Thanks, Mom.

317
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,012
JINIL-GUN

318
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,815
You need to get out here.

319
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:35,820
Granny, let me come with you.
I have something to tell Mi-mo. Can I?

320
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,405
-Please?
-No way. Get out now!

321
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,746
This is 911. What's your emergency?

322
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,998
Oh, is this the police?

323
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,756
Taxi.

324
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,889
Sir, 23-7 Huise-ri, Maemi-eup,
Jinil-gun, please.

325
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,691
HOW TO TURN ON THE CAMCORDER

326
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:16,611
Shit! The letters are
as tiny as an ant's asshole.

327
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,125
Oh dear, she woke up.

328
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,920
Shouldn't have woken up this early.

329
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:46,391
I'm sure you're wondering
why I'm doing this.

330
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,853
This isn't your fault.

331
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,439
It's your mom's.

332
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,362
Do you know how my son died?

333
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,198
Your mom…

334
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,535
killed him.

335
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,038
She cut him up into pieces.

336
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,502
I really didn't want to go this far,

337
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,505
but you fell right into my lap.

338
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,300
I just went to see her,
thinking I'd let her know.

339
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,012
But that bitch looked so peaceful.

340
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,931
She even had the nerve
to blabber on and on about

341
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,726
how she was fucking saved.

342
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,354
That rotten tongue of hers.

343
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:38,359
How dare she fucking speak of salvation

344
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:43,364
when my whole life is a living hell?

345
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,325
Granny.

346
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,410
Let me say this again.

347
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,206
You did nothing wrong.

348
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,416
But what can you do?

349
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,086
If you want to blame someone,
blame your mom.

350
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,964
Granny!

351
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,342
Okay, now it's working.

352
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,636
STANDBY

353
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:08,306
I'll send your last moments to your mom.

354
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,683
RECORDING

355
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,104
Oh my gosh!

356
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,857
My gosh! There's blood on your face.

357
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,441
Are you all right?

358
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,359
I'm fine.

359
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,237
Could you give me a ride to Maemi-eup?

360
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,197
Maemi-eup?

361
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,326
But Maemi-eup is the opposite direction
to where I'm going.

362
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:14,122
I had a fight with my husband,
so I got out of the car.

363
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,624
But I have no idea where I am.

364
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,210
Could you please drive me there?

365
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,296
What kind of fight leaves you…

366
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,884
Goodness gracious!
Get in quickly. Come on.

367
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:35,602
I had a similar experience
where I wanted to jump out of the car.

368
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:40,023
Oh boy. I really should have gotten
a divorce then. Gosh!

369
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,025
I let it slide, thinking of my kids.

370
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,737
He always nags me
about every little thing at home.

371
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,781
It's not like he's ever made
enough money, you know.

372
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:49,824
Don't you agree?

373
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,996
Gosh. And you know what happened
when I was having our first child?

374
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,915
He took off!

375
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,846
Do you have something to say?

376
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,281
What is it?

377
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,910
Granny, I'm so cold.

378
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,089
-Here you go. Better?
-Granny!

379
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,758
I am sorry.

380
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,344
Please don't kill me.

381
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,514
I shouldn't have let you speak.

382
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,105
What now?

383
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,360
I'm sorry, Granny. Granny!

384
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:12,907
I looked for him afterward,
and I found him in another room sleeping.

385
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,242
Can you believe it?

386
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:18,496
I'm sorry, but can I check something
on your GPS?

387
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,831
Of course.

388
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,795
And do you know what he did
when we had our second child?

389
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,588
I got a C-section.

390
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,173
This is breaking news!

391
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,260
This afternoon, the serial killer,
Mask Girl, escaped

392
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,178
during treatment at the hospital.

393
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,096
Oh my gosh!

394
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:39,892
She's in her forties, has short hair,
and is about 170 cm tall.

395
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:44,355
She was injured during her escape
and has a wound on her face.

396
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:48,526
If you see anyone matching
the description, report it to the police.

397
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,790
Ma'am.

398
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,378
You can just drop me off here.
Thank you so much.

399
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,899
Is this the police?

400
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,238
Yes, how can I help you?

401
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:39,077
Well, we received a report that
a middle school girl was locked up here.

402
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,039
What are you talking about? I live alone.

403
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,459
I'm sorry, but could I take a look inside?

404
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,753
We need to check since it was reported.

405
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,550
Sure. Make it quick.

406
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,468
I will.

407
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,766
Wow, this is…

408
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,436
How come you have a rock in your house?

409
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,690
Man, I can feel the spiritual energy
coming from it.

410
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,776
Is this real?

411
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,156
Wow, how interesting.

412
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,660
-I'll take a look around.
-Sure.

413
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,087
What is this here?

414
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,300
Oh, it's the bathroom.

415
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,436
There's something else too.
What's this for?

416
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,480
It's the kitchen.

417
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,107
I see.

418
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,449
This…

419
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,326
What is it?

420
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,705
This should be in the fridge. It'll spoil.

421
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,624
Just leave it. Come on out.

422
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,804
I guess it was just a prank call.

423
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,764
Yeah, you came out here for nothing.

424
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,894
Bless your heart.

425
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,395
Thank you. Goodbye.

426
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:34,275
Damn, it was just a prank call.

427
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,282
Help me!

428
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,125
Hey. Did you just hear that?

429
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,460
What? Hear what?

430
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,549
I'll check again.

431
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,095
Emergency.

432
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,806
The fugitive was seen
entering Mount Huise.

433
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,725
Requesting backup to Mount Huise.

434
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,518
Copy that. We're on our way.

435
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,729
Let's get this over with quickly.

436
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,609
I'm too soft. That's the problem.

437
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,781
You reap what you sow, you see.

438
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:08,411
This is definitely
a much-deserved punishment

439
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,955
and my mission.

440
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,342
Please wait for me here.
I just need to get the child.

441
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,678
I'm sorry, but I have to get back now.

442
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,055
Could you, please?

443
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,390
I'm really sorry.

444
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,147
Even when the devil tempts me…

445
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,064
Granny, I'm sorry!

446
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,108
The Lord will hold me fast…

447
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,026
Granny!

448
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,361
I'm sorry, Granny! Please don't kill me!

449
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,481
My beloved Savior

450
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,609
The Lord will hold me fast

451
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,027
Granny!

452
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,445
Granny!

453
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,988
Granny, I'm sorry!

454
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,116
Granny, don't kill me!

455
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,743
-Granny!
-Mi-mo!

456
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,501
My goodness.

457
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,586
My word.

458
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:48,511
What the hell?

459
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,640
What are you doing in my house
like a damn thief?

460
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,312
She's just an innocent child.

461
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,732
Then what about…

462
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,234
What about my baby?

463
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,445
What did he do wrong?

464
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,530
Mi-mo!

465
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,199
-Granny!
-Who the hell are you?

466
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,078
Mi-mo's over there. Go get her quickly!

467
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,330
No way! Damn it!

468
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,835
Mi-mo!

469
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,340
Hey, Kim Mi-mo!

470
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,469
Kim Mi-mo, are you okay?

471
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,855
Mi-mo. Are you okay?

472
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,733
Mi-mo. Are you okay?

473
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,861
How did you get here?

474
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,529
I'm sorry.

475
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:53,909
I'm really sorry I lied to you.

476
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,704
I did it because I really liked you. And--

477
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,959
And your secret…
I never told anyone about it.

478
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,210
I know.

479
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:07,423
I missed you so much. I really did.

480
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,135
Can you hurry…

481
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,053
Oh, sorry.

482
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,102
I can't untie it.

483
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,146
It's too tight.

484
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,695
What? Now you're going to start acting
like her grandma?

485
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,793
You're going to hell, bitch!

486
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,756
Go say that shit to your daughter!

487
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,721
Die, you old hag!

488
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,145
Mom.

489
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,525
Mom.

490
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,743
Get Mi-mo. Quickly, go get her first.

491
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,329
Hurry. Go get her.

492
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,214
By the way, who are you?

493
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,009
Let's get out of here first.

494
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,017
Here, stand up.

495
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,654
My oh my.

496
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,325
Look who's here?

497
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,995
You crawled in here on your own.

498
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,248
My goodness, Lord.

499
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,879
You must have some kind of death wish.

500
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,559
Do you…

501
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,855
really have to go this far?

502
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,568
This is

503
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,780
the seed you have sown.

504
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,127
You bitch!

505
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,937
Get out! Right now!

506
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,063
Go!

507
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,318
You evil bitch!

508
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,453
Grandma!

509
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,626
Grandma!

510
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:17,715
Grandma.

511
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,302
It's fine.

512
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,220
Grandma.

513
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,597
I'm sorry.

514
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:28,684
I'm so sorry.

515
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:33,897
Grandma.

516
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:36,650
Mi-mo.

517
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,029
I…

518
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,034
I'm sorry.

519
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,537
Grandma.

520
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,789
I'm sorry.

521
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,875
Grandma.

522
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:54,877
Mi-mo…

523
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:58,505
Grandma.

524
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,382
Grandma!

525
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:03,510
No, Grandma!

526
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:11,185
Grandma.

527
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,604
Grandma!

528
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,114
Let's just end it here.

529
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,908
Let go of me, you bitch.

530
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,505
You want to end this?

531
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,384
It already ended when my son died!

532
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,184
You bitch.

533
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,468
Damn it!

534
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,077
Kim Mo-mi. It's all over now.

535
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,287
Put your hands up.

536
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,352
Who's that old lady?

537
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,190
Wow.

538
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,154
My Lord

539
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,657
has sent me his army.

540
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,497
Wait, that's not a gun, is it?

541
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,416
Hey, it's a gun!

542
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,626
Ma'am, put the gun down!

543
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,212
I said, "Put the gun down!"

544
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,465
You put yours down,

545
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,843
you motherfuckers!

546
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,094
Oh shit!

547
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,180
Put it down right now!

548
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,182
Or we will have to shoot, ma'am!

549
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:01,600
Ma'am!

550
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:05,103
-You should…
-This is your last warning.

551
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,439
-…feel exactly what I felt.
-Put it down!

552
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:08,857
Ma'am!

553
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,068
Put the gun down!

554
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,569
My pain.

555
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:14,946
No!

556
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,701
Mi-mo! Kim Mi-mo!

557
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,002
Where did you get that?

558
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,336
I bought a used one.

559
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,463
What did you sell this time?

560
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,550
Nothing! I saved up
and bought it with my money.

561
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:00,468
Let's go!

562
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,940
Since that day,
so many things have changed.

563
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:19,112
Ye-chun's parents became
my temporary guardians,

564
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,323
and I went back to school.

565
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:28,538
I no longer had any hatred
toward other people.

566
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,293
And

567
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,546
she no longer appeared…

568
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,467
in my dreams anymore.

569
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:17,212
KIM MO-MI

570
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:51,871
LOVE KINDERGARTEN TALENT SHOW

571
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,447
Wasn't she great?

572
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,408
-Yes!
-Miss Kim Mo-mi, what is your dream?

573
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:29,868
My dream?

574
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,287
I…

575
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:39,419
My dream is to become someone
who's loved by everyone!

576
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,755
A round of applause!

577
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:17,822
