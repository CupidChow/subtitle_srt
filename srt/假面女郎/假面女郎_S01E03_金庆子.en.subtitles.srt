1
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,140
I'm Kim Kyung-ja.

2
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:18,977
Ju Oh-nam's mom, Kim Kyung-ja.

3
00:01:55,865 --> 00:02:00,620
MASK GIRL

4
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,499
KIM KYUNG-JA

5
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:10,505
I came from nothing, so I thought
love was a luxury I couldn't afford.

6
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,675
I met my husband through a matchmaker.

7
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,929
His looks, whatever, none of it
mattered to me whatsoever.

8
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,390
He had a certification,

9
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,934
so I trusted that and married him.

10
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,312
He also didn't look like
he'd be a womanizer.

11
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,567
But that fucking bastard
barely made any money

12
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,361
and took off to live with some bitch
from the get-go.

13
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,657
So my marriage ended
after just three years.

14
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,871
But still, it was fine

15
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,582
because I had my son, Oh-nam.

16
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:50,003
Because I had Oh-nam,
I was able to do anything and everything.

17
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,267
Stand close to the urinal and pee.

18
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,560
Don't drip.

19
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,815
QUICK DELIVERY

20
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,402
Hold it in! Hold it!

21
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,363
Get out! Come on!

22
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,493
What the hell did he eat?

23
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,331
I worked my ass off

24
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,626
and finally managed
to open a teeny-tiny restaurant.

25
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,670
I have seats here, come.
Cheonggukjang? I'll make it good.

26
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,466
-Cheonggukjang, whatever, you name it.
-My gosh. Hey!

27
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,219
Are you the only one running
a damn business around here?

28
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,303
My gosh.

29
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,472
Did I drag your customers over?

30
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,768
If they don't like your food,
they come to eat my food, and vice versa.

31
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,020
So, why are you bitching? Seriously.

32
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,563
-You bitch!
-Hang tight.

33
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,065
This isn't the first time!

34
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,360
I had to act that way
in order to put food on the table

35
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,028
and raise my baby well.

36
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,780
I saw them first, you bitch!

37
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,325
Come here, you bitch,
before I rip all your hair out!

38
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,495
But raising a child wasn't
what I thought it would be.

39
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:10,667
When Oh-nam was young, some of his things
disappeared every so often.

40
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,878
How could you lose something
I bought you just a few days ago?

41
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,839
He sometimes came home
with bruises on his arms.

42
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,049
What happened here?

43
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,301
I fell while playing.

44
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,929
How are you so clumsy?

45
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,682
He even came home
with gum in his hair one day.

46
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,849
Gosh, what's this?

47
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,560
I don't know when it got in my hair.

48
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,562
For God's sake.

49
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:32,939
Come on! Gosh.

50
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:37,360
Whenever something like that happened,
I blamed myself for it.

51
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,613
Even in pitch darkness,
may he hear thy voice.

52
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,531
Yes, Lord.

53
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,493
Let him see thy light in any trials
he may face in this world.

54
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:50,540
May he live a life spreading thy gospel
and praising thee in thy power, Lord.

55
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,086
Please guide young Ju Oh-nam,
son of Sister Kim Kyung-ja,

56
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,256
wholly unto the path
thou have prepared for him

57
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,133
and into thy everlasting love.

58
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,342
-Oh, Lord!
-Amen.

59
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,097
Perhaps it was God answering my prayers,

60
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,766
but my son had pretty good grades,

61
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,811
though I couldn't afford
any private lessons.

62
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,647
My dear Oh-nam, are you studying?

63
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,316
Yes.

64
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,277
Right. You must study hard to go
to medical school.

65
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,623
Gosh, Mom. I can do this on my own.

66
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,544
Come on. Are you embarrassed now? Are you?

67
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,174
My son's all grown up now. All grown!

68
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,512
My Oh-nam got into a four-year university
in Seoul just like that,

69
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,307
although not a medical school
like I wanted.

70
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,100
My gosh, my baby!

71
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,603
You look fantastic!

72
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,106
Gosh, you're a total prince, aren't you?

73
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,024
Right?

74
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,692
-Mom.
-Oh, yes. He looks great.

75
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:07,742
But once he got a job,
he was no longer my sweet little boy.

76
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,746
Are we under colonial rule?
What's with the independence bullshit?

77
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:17,460
You shouldn't spend money like that
just because you started earning some.

78
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,005
Do you have any idea
how expensive it is to live alone?

79
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,675
It's not like you're getting married.

80
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,302
Why would you move out?

81
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,098
I just want to live alone.

82
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,729
Are you saying

83
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,649
you don't want to live with me?

84
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:45,196
No, that's not it.
It takes too long to get to work and--

85
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,823
Bullshit, it's not far!

86
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,700
It takes four hours round trip.

87
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,618
Four h--

88
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,871
When I was raising you,

89
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:58,793
I got around just fine, even if there was
a blizzard or typhoon outside!

90
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,379
But what? Four hours is your excuse?

91
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,589
My gosh.

92
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,809
I thought he'd give up
if I put my foot down.

93
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,520
But he moved out anyway.

94
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,861
On top of that, he wouldn't even
let me anywhere near his place.

95
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,120
Son! I brought you some side dishes.
Are you not home?

96
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,247
Mom, I said I didn't need them.

97
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,041
I don't have time
to eat at home these days.

98
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,712
You bastard. How could you do this to me?

99
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,257
Must I beg you
to let me bring you side dishes now?

100
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,303
Don't you know how I raised you?
You bastard.

101
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,972
Mom, that's not it. I eat just fine, so--

102
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,141
That's enough, you rude punk!

103
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,563
Forget it. I'll just never come
to your place ever again!

104
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,109
You and I,
let's just cut ties for good this time!

105
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,527
I'm done talking to you!

106
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,154
You bastard.

107
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,656
My goodness.

108
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,137
MY SON ♥

109
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,189
He only called me once after that.

110
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,734
OHNAM RESTAURANT

111
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,361
Still, though,

112
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,904
you won't even call anymore?

113
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,740
I couldn't pick up!

114
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,451
Would it kill you to try calling me?

115
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,579
Jeez! Forget it.

116
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,793
Only this today, okay?

117
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,512
My gosh. He's just too much.

118
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:19,100
You little punk,
how are you ever gonna get married?

119
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,186
No matter what he did,

120
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,481
I thought my baby would return
to being the good son he was.

121
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,359
I didn't think he'd disappear.

122
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,412
-It's done.
-Thank you.

123
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,956
Oh-nam!

124
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,292
-Oh, what is that smell?
-Jeez!

125
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:48,296
Oh gosh! Why does it smell like
rotting sewage in here?

126
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,591
-This is the bathroom.
-Where could he have gone?

127
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,969
Oh my goodness!

128
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,388
Look at this goddamn place.

129
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,056
My goodness!

130
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,475
Jeez! That scared me.

131
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,477
Oh my gosh! Who are you?

132
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,063
I said, who are you?

133
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,317
It's a life-sized female doll.

134
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,862
What? It's not a person?

135
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,697
No, it's a doll.

136
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:16,824
A doll?

137
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,284
Yes.

138
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,662
Goodness.

139
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,583
Oh shit.

140
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,753
What kind of doll looks like a human?

141
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:33,382
My word, this little punk.
Why did he put a blanket over this weird…

142
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,800
You gotta be shitting me.

143
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,139
-Hey. What's up?
-What is it?

144
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,188
What's got you so startled?

145
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:48,814
Oh my gosh!

146
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,694
What…

147
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,032
Oh my…

148
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,285
My Oh-nam…

149
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,537
-My baby.
-Don't touch it!

150
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,625
Ma'am!

151
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,960
Are you okay? Ma'am!

152
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,046
-Hey! Officer Park!
-Yes?

153
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,422
Call for backup!

154
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,383
-Yes, sir!
-Ma'am, are you okay?

155
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,218
A dismembered body has been found

156
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,221
at the home of
a recently missing office worker Mr. Ju.

157
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,391
The National Forensic Service
is conducting an autopsy

158
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,517
to identify the victim.

159
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,937
Police are investigating
the whereabouts of Mr. Ju,

160
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,690
who was last seen leaving work in October,

161
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:34,360
and trying to determine if Mr. Ju had
any connection with the body.

162
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,405
According to a police official,
the NFS DNA analysis and autopsy…

163
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,447
Excuse me.

164
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,866
I'm looking for Ms. Kim Kyung-ja.

165
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,284
…waiting to confirm

166
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,579
and said they are considering
all possibilities as they investigate.

167
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,540
SEOUL YONGCHEON POLICE STATION
SEO YONG-JIN / CHOI JONG-HUN

168
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,042
What in the world are you saying?

169
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,796
-It's not my son?
-No.

170
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,467
Oh Lord.

171
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,011
Gosh, it's not my son!

172
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,097
-It's not my son.
-That's wonderful news.

173
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,393
But then,
who was in that black plastic bag?

174
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,270
Besides the fact that it was a man,

175
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,981
we have no leads yet
to determine the identity.

176
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,901
Well, whoever it is,
it's good as long as my son is alive.

177
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,528
Oh Lord!

178
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:18,946
Oh my.

179
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,658
Can you get me some water?

180
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,618
Water.

181
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,497
If I may, ma'am.

182
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:34,962
When was the last time
you talked with your son?

183
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,089
It was two weeks ago.

184
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,051
On my birthday.

185
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,553
Oh, birthday…

186
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,182
Was there anyone who had problems
with your son, by any chance?

187
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,559
What problems?

188
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,437
He got along very well with his coworkers.

189
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,817
Wait, why are you asking
about stuff like that?

190
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,945
Oh, well…

191
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:03,741
What is this?

192
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,118
Are you possibly

193
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,829
suspecting that my son killed someone?

194
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,208
Well, ma'am, it could be
one of several possibilities, so--

195
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,668
You've got to be fucking shitting me!

196
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,712
He can't even kill a damn fly!

197
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,507
He shakes in fear, just looking at blood!

198
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,842
How could you fucking suggest
he killed someone?

199
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,094
Fuck off, you bastards!

200
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:28,349
The police even barged
into Oh-nam's workplace.

201
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:32,186
There really wasn't anyone here

202
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,271
who was close to Mr. Ju.

203
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,483
I mean, to be honest, I can say this now.

204
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:43,322
He did have a bit of a temper
when something didn't go quite right.

205
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:47,159
So I would, you know,
be startled from time to time.

206
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,703
The last time I saw him was
when he came by

207
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,122
saying he'd mail off
Ms. Kim Mo-mi's stuff.

208
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,083
Why did Ms. Kim quit?

209
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,584
I don't really…

210
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,879
She just suddenly resigned.

211
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,799
You want to know if Mr. Ju liked Mo-mi?

212
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,469
I'm not really sure about that.

213
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,513
He didn't talk much at all.

214
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,307
Oh, Mo-mi had said something once before.

215
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,728
She said she felt like
Mr. Ju was watching her or something.

216
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,273
I thought she was overreacting
at the time.

217
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,651
She overreacts pretty often, you know.

218
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,200
Gosh, I can't believe this.
Honestly. Come in.

219
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,786
The police even went
to that bitch's house.

220
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:35,249
She threw away everything,
saying she was going abroad or something.

221
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,004
Anything especially strange when she left?

222
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,256
-Anything strange?
-Yes.

223
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,637
Oh. I think she got plastic surgery.

224
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,472
Plastic surgery?

225
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,976
You know, those white bandages
wrapped around their heads

226
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,144
after the surgery.

227
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,104
She had them on too.

228
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:01,191
At first, I was so startled,
thinking she was beaten up or something.

229
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,361
By any chance,

230
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,822
was she with a man?

231
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,198
A man?

232
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,035
No. She lived alone.

233
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,787
I mean, did she ever come home with a man?

234
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,290
Never. No such thing happened.

235
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:21,170
Sometimes she would turn on the music
really loudly and sing and dance,

236
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,212
but nothing else.

237
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,634
All right. Thank you.

238
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,803
-Are you done?
-Yes, we are.

239
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,473
The police thought that my Oh-nam

240
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,975
and that girl had run off
somewhere together.

241
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,227
Around the time Mr. Ju went missing,

242
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,356
we learned that a female colleague of his

243
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,858
also disappeared without a trace.

244
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:47,196
We went to her family home in Daesan.

245
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,616
When was the last time
you talked with Ms. Kim Mo-mi?

246
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,829
The body was first found
in an apartment in Yongcheon-gu,

247
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,123
the home of Mr. Ju, who is missing.

248
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:03,879
Over 2,000 illegal adult videos
were saved on his computer,

249
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:08,342
and various sex dolls and adult toys
were found at the scene.

250
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,888
The fact that the whole house
is full of sexual media indicates

251
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,600
that he is not a person
with a normal perception of sex.

252
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,479
The problem here is
that his desire toward such persons

253
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,356
would have manifested
in a distorted fashion,

254
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,400
such as obsession or stalking.

255
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,237
Hey, you piece of shit.

256
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,281
I asked you to find my baby,

257
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,118
and you make him
a perverted stalker and murderer?

258
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,914
Should I chew all of you bastards
into tiny pieces?

259
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,542
My baby is the kindest
and sweetest kid ever!

260
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,211
There is no fucking way

261
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,547
my baby did such a thing, you fuckers!

262
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,007
You sons of bitches!

263
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,217
That's when I decided

264
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,886
that I had to find my baby myself.

265
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,222
WELCOME

266
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,353
Does it work now?

267
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:02,771
Oh, yes.

268
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,606
Well done.

269
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,696
What is this?

270
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,663
What is this now?

271
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,459
Where did it go?

272
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,631
Damn it. What the hell is all this?

273
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,177
If I wanted to find my son,
I needed to know him well.

274
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,512
So I took computer lessons first.

275
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,807
Typing is one of the basics.

276
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,560
But it isn't easy
to type with both hands at first,

277
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,271
so practice with one hand at a time.

278
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:48,525
If it's difficult, continue to practice
at home, and you'll improve a lot.

279
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,446
Today, we're going to learn
the basics of computers. Internet access.

280
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,198
On your desktop screen…

281
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,742
We'll learn how to send an email today.

282
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,327
So an email is basically

283
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,371
like a home address. Online…

284
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,542
MASK GIRL

285
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,628
MASAMO - FAN CAFÉ FOR MASK GIRL LOVERS

286
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,964
WELCOME TO MASAMO

287
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,049
To find my baby,

288
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,718
I had to dig up more about the bitch.

289
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,888
HOT POST
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT MASK GIRL

290
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,185
HER REAL NAME IS KIM MO-MI
DAEHAN INSURANCE

291
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,603
"Kim Mo-mi."

292
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,523
Four-year university, huh?

293
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,234
HANMI UNIVERSITY
CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT WELCOME PARTY

294
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,236
OH SHIT, TOTAL UGGO
NO WONDER SHE WORE A MASK

295
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,196
"Uggo"?

296
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:40,202
"She's a real orc. A total orc."
What are they talking about?

297
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,246
What are they saying?

298
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,166
To get any information here,

299
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,128
I had to learn words
young people use these days.

300
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,921
KFM

301
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:54,716
KEEP FOR MYSELF

302
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,926
"HL."

00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,138
"Hopeless."

304
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,142
"SPON."

305
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:08,897
"Suddenly Popping Out of Nowhere."

306
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,400
Damn it.

307
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,610
Fucking ridiculous.

308
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:18,991
What? You closing down?

309
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,994
Christ. Why the hell
did you SPON like that?

310
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,412
SPO… what?

311
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,372
Oh, never mind.

312
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,583
Why are you closing the restaurant?

313
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,002
What do you think? I gotta find my son.

314
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,928
BANKBOOK

315
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,725
I had quite a lot of money saved up
for decades, you see.

316
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,603
Do you want to withdraw all of this?

317
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,397
Why? Is the bank running low on money?

318
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:51,982
Oh, no. Just…

319
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,864
Someone else was looking for that bitch
as desperately as I was.

320
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,618
Teddy, the online fan café manager.

321
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,579
Hiya-hi.

322
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,497
Teddy.

323
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,666
LOVE MG: HIYA-HI. TEDDY.

324
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,877
MASK GIRL♥TEDDY: HAHA HELLO
GOOD 2 SEE U AGAIN

325
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,379
It's my daily check-in.

326
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,216
Mr. Teddy.

327
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,011
Thank you for working your ass off.

328
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,347
Gosh, can't write that.

329
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:30,395
Mr. Teddy. I'm digging your diligence.

330
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,897
MASK GIRL♥TEDDY: HAHA THX

331
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:38,445
Have you found anything today?

332
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,074
I FOUND SOMETHING FREAKING COOL

333
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,242
What is it?

334
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,246
Oh, what is it?

335
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,416
I FOUND A WOMAN WHO I THINK IS MASK GIRL

336
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,759
BUT I'M NOT TOTALLY CERTAIN…

337
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,386
SO I HAVEN'T UPLOADED ANYTHING YET

338
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,305
TAKE A LOOK

339
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,604
Hello, everyone. Today, at Plus Mart,

340
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,441
we are having a sale to celebrate
our third year since opening.

341
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,320
We will be holding a big event
during the sale period.

342
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,613
Are you saying

343
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,533
this woman is Mask Girl?

344
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,535
I'm not so sure.

345
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,787
Her face looks so different.

346
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,376
SHE PROBABLY GOT PLASTIC SURGERY

347
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,377
Plastic surgery?

348
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,337
BUT HER DANCING AND BODY
ARE BOTH SIMILAR TO MASK GIRL'S

349
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,383
THE WOMAN IN THE BACK SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT PLUS MART

350
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,553
JINCHEON? GANGCHEON?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, LOL

351
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,473
SHOULDN'T WE CALL THE POLICE?

352
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,934
I DID. BUT THEY THOUGHT
IT WAS A PRANK CALL

353
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,186
Damn it, those useless fuckers!

354
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,731
BUT I'M A BIT CONFUSED
HER BOOBS LOOK FAKE IN THE VIDEO

355
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,648
Her boobs?

356
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,943
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT SURE
CUZ MASK GIRL'S ARE NATURAL

357
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,490
YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE?

358
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,201
YOU BET HAHA
MY NICKNAME IS BOOB CONNOISSEUR

359
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,536
My gosh.

360
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:13,081
I TOLD U I BECAME MASK GIRL'S FAN
ALL BECAUSE OF HER BOOBS

361
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,834
SUCH PERFECT BOOBS ARE RARE LOL

362
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,252
You perverted bastard.

363
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,255
I am the crazy one for believing you.

364
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,556
Mom.

365
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,102
Mom, wake up.

366
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:41,902
Oh my gosh.

367
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,571
Is that you, my son?

368
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:46,948
Where are you?

369
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,206
Mom.

370
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,252
Oh my gosh.

371
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,170
Mom.

372
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,256
Mom, I'm so cold.

373
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,133
Okay, my baby.

374
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,886
Come over here quickly.

375
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,680
Come to Mom.

376
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:19,731
My baby.

377
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,943
Where have you been?

378
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,029
Where in the world have you been?

379
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,950
I've missed you so very much.

380
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:36,998
Let me have a look at your face, my baby.

381
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,241
Oh, Father…

382
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,625
Oh no!

383
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,335
Dear God!

384
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,255
Oh, my baby.

385
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,801
Oh no! My baby! No!

386
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,930
My baby.

387
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:46,401
It's all because of that bitch!
That bitch made my baby like this.

388
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,489
That whore of a bitch made
my baby like this!

389
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,079
Oh my gosh! No!

390
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,374
Ma'am.

391
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,837
Oh my gosh! No.

392
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,634
No, Father! Oh Lord.

393
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,387
A dismembered male body was found
in a suitcase

394
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,640
discovered by a hiker yesterday morning.

395
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:20,602
The victim was identified as Mr. Ju,
a missing person who lived in the house

396
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,647
where a body was found in a fridge
five months ago.

397
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,441
The police are trying to find Ms. Kim,

398
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,152
who is believed to be deeply involved
in the case.

399
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:36,660
My son has never done any harm to anyone.

400
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,122
He trembled at killing even a tiny bug.

401
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,959
No one was as kind as my boy.

402
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:48,797
I prayed, "Father."

403
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:55,178
"What did I do so wrong for you
to give me such a severe punishment?"

404
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,392
"Why would you give me sorrow
that I cannot bear?"

405
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,687
"Is this truly your will, Father?"

406
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,649
"Just how much happiness
do you have in store for me later

407
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,318
that you give me such sorrow now?"

408
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:16,658
"What do you want me to do
in your name on this earth?"

409
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,455
Only then,

410
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,750
I heard the voice of our Father.

411
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,630
"My daughter."

412
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,301
"My beloved daughter."

413
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,721
"Go upon your way."

414
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,726
"Even though you walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

415
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,229
I will protect you,
and I will always be with you."

416
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,899
"No one will be able
to stand in your way!"

417
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,611
"You are my soldier!"

418
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:59,618
Amen!

419
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,197
Who is it?

420
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,284
This is that bitch
Kim Mo-mi's house, right?

421
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:42,619
Excuse me?

422
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,663
Who is this?

423
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:49,709
I'm the mom of the victim
your daughter murdered. Open the door.

424
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,296
What the hell?

425
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,215
Hello?

426
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,136
You damn assholes!

427
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,598
Open the door.

428
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,475
Open the damn door!

429
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:11,106
You call yourselves human?
You're worse than animals, you bastards!

430
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,149
Open the door. Open it now!

431
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,111
You little…

432
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,279
I'm a housekeeper here.

433
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:22,409
The madam says she'll call the police
if you don't leave at once.

434
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:29,582
They should be rushing out
and begging on their knees, but what?

435
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,418
Ma'am. Please!

436
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,879
Do these people know
they're the parents of a murderer?

437
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,340
Nothing's been confirmed yet.

438
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:42,595
And besides, the madam cut ties
with her daughter ages ago.

439
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,183
She knows nothing about her daughter
and won't even bat an eye.

440
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:52,731
I only found out the madam had a daughter
when this incident happened.

441
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,773
Don't lie to me.

442
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,610
Just tell me where that bitch is,
and I'll leave.

443
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,613
Gosh, I would've told the police
if I knew.

444
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,824
Damn it.

445
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,704
What the hell? That bitch, there!

446
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,460
Hey, you fucking owl-like bitch!
Come down here.

447
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,337
My word, look at that cold bitch.

448
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,382
She should've groveled
like a dog before me,

449
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,843
yet that bitch acts like she's above me.

450
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,386
So vulgar.

451
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,848
Where do you think you're going? Bitch!

452
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:31,227
Lady, you keep this up here,
and I'm really going to call the police.

453
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,062
-Haven't you called them yet?
-My gosh.

454
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,898
-Should I call them?
-My gosh!

455
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:38,151
Come out right now, you fucking bitch!

456
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,320
DONG-GU POLICE SUBSTATION

457
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:44,532
Ma'am, you've come a long way.
Here, have a cup of coffee. Here you go.

458
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,456
The madam over there
said she'll let it go this time.

459
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:55,043
But if you ever come back again,
she won't let it go next time.

460
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,505
By the way,

461
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,132
is the father not home?

462
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,760
The husband?

463
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,679
He committed suicide long ago.

464
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,312

Amen

477
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,775
Amen.

478
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:05,280
Thank you so much for praying for my son.

479
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,201
You all know how smart my son was, right?

480
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,329
He could've gone to medical school,

481
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:17,041
but he threw a fit,
saying he was scared to see blood.

482
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,296
He was such a good son.
The best son in the world.

483
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:25,592
Every time I went on a trip somewhere,
he'd send me money.

484
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,553
He was so thankful
when I made side dishes for him.

485
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,431
Oh my. Sons like that
are so rare these days.

486
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,348
You're right.

487
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,811
And he was so kind and smart

488
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,647
that all the girls were so busy
chasing after him.

489
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,025
None of them were good enough for him.

490
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,776
If I had known this would happen,

491
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,322
I would've let him date whoever he wanted.

492
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,573
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

493
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,867
There, there.

494
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,077
My goodness.

495
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,127
Oh, have some apples. Eat.

496
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,379
Oh, by the way, did you hear?

497
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,550
You know the dentist
over at Jeil Plaza, right?

498
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,220
He was having an affair with his nurse.

499
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,098
Those bitches and fuckers
who open their legs like that

500
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,433
should be beaten to death.

501
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,392
You're right.

502
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,770
But do you know how they got caught?

503
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,188
How?

504
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,775
You know the fortune teller
Ms. Park talked about?

505
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,362
That fortune teller told her

506
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,865
that her husband has a mistress.

507
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,910
My gosh. How unsightly.
A churchgoer going to a fortune teller?

508
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,954
But it is a bit different there.

509
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,039
To be honest, I went there too.

510
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,040
Goodness.

511
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,209
That fortune teller was the real deal.

512
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,251
-Yeah?
-Sure!

513
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,711
Where is it?

514
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,672
Let me know too.

515
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,173
Yeah, let's go together.

516
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,675
Gosh! It's ridiculous.

517
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,301
The Lord is watching!

518
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,552
You startled me!

519
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:14,492
My gosh. You're driving me insane.
You can't see where that bitch is?

520
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,743
Wait.

521
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,125
West.

522
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,544
She's in the west.

523
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,922
I'll drop dead
searching the entire west, seriously.

524
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,092
Just tell me exactly where she is!

525
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,097
I'll give you all the money you want.

526
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:01,831
It's here.

527
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,711
What do you mean here?

528
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,256
I see the word "gang."

529
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,092
And "cheon."

530
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,138
Gangcheon.

531
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,140
Gangcheon?

532
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,268
You really just said Gangcheon?

533
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,939
This is it. This is the place.

534
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,237
She dances over there on the side.

535
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,406
This one, here.

536
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,408
I'm not sure.

537
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,535
Go ask inside over there.

538
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:43,164
-Oh, I just had a question.
-Oh, yes.

539
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,708
Would you happen to know this lady here?

540
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,961
Sure. Ms. Won-ju. Take a look.

541
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,091
Oh, this lady?

542
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,051
She sometimes came for events.

543
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:55,968
Really?

544
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,970
I haven't seen her for a while.

545
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:02,433
Oh, well, is there a way to find her?
A phone number, at least?

546
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,520
She's my daughter.

547
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,981
I haven't seen her
since she left home in high school.

548
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,443
Oh, don't we have
the event agency's phone number?

549
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,904
We can give her that, at least.

550
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:18,241
-Oh my goodness. Thank you.
-Oh, sure.

551
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,121
-Goodness, I can sleep in peace now.
-Sure.

What the hell?

555
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,805
Wow, crushed by a flush.

556
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:44,267
This punk's crushing me every time
with the last card. Damn it.

557
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,270
I guess
it's one of those lucky days for me.

558
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,399
Who are you, lady?

559
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,694
I'm looking for someone.

560
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:55,653
Someone?

561
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,865
We're not that kind of agency.

562
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,160
I heard this girl worked here.

563
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,709
Oh, Yu-mi?

564
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,295
Yu-mi?

565
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,589
She quit.

566
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,923
She quit?

567
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,510
She said she was going to get a job
that pays well and quit.

568
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,429
Damn it.

569
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,055
What was she going to do?

570
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,893
She had a great face and a banging body.

571
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,228
What do you think she would do?

572
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,272
Shit! I fold.

573
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,410
No, I've never seen her.

574
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,329
Come on. Take a good look at it!

577
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,869
-You have any change?
-No.

578
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,414
-There you go. Enjoy.
-Thank you.

579
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,209
Welcome. What would you like?

580
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,128
-Can I get some sliced sundae?
-Sure.

581
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,631
I'm starving. I could eat a person.

582
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,970
Hello, sir. I'm heading back now.

583
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,055
Okay.

584
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,991
Come back again.

585
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,034
-It was delicious.
-Sure. Goodbye.

586
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,714
Hold the sundae for me!

587
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,580
Two boxes of whiskey.

588
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:56,834
Right. Beer, three boxes of beer.
Bar snacks. Yes. Okay.

589
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:57,835
Hey, finish this up.

590
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,755
Hey, Chun-ja. Your panties are showing.

591
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,257
-Isn't that a good thing?
-You drank again yesterday?

592
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,842
I told you not to drink.

593
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,260
Hold on, ma'am.

594
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,346
Who are you?

595
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,389
You can't go in there!

596
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,766
Oh, so, I…

597
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,061
I just saw my daughter walk in this way.

598
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:16,854
Your daughter?

599
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,106
Oh, she just walked in.

600
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,277
She was wearing a denim skirt
and long shoes that come up to here.

601
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,195
Denim…

602
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,447
Oh! Mi-ae?

603
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,157
-Mi-ae?
-Yes.

604
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,410
I'll tell her you came.
Not right now though. Yeah?

605
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,287
No can do. Nope. Goodbye.

606
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,955
-Wait.
-Huh?

607
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,792
Please keep it to yourself
that I came here.

608
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:42,505
If she finds out I came here,
she is going to be absolutely mortified.

609
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,423
-You know as well.
-Sure.

610
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,051
She wouldn't want her mom to find out
she works here.

611
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:50,513
Okay, ma'am, I got it.
You should head home now. Sure.

612
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,098
-Zip. Okay?
-Of course. Zip!

613
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,935
-Mi-ae.
-Yeah, Mi-ae.

614
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,396
Head on home, ma'am. Okay? Goodbye.

615
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,065
Okay. I got it.

616
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,044
Mom! Help me, Mom!

617
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,339
Oh-nam!

618
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,428
Oh-nam!

619
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,856
Oh-nam!

620
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,655
Mom.

621
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,786
Why didn't you save me?

622
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,458
I'm sorry.

623
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,669
Weren't you also embarrassed by me?

624
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,380
What are you talking about?

625
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,636
I couldn't get into medical school,

626
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,764
nor was I popular with the girls,
so you were embarrassed by me.

627
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,891
In fact, you wanted me dead too!

628
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:03,062
That's not true. No, that's not true…

629
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,815
You're happy that I'm dead!

630
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,276
I'm sorry.

631
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,570
I'm sorry…

632
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,076
Excuse me.

633
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,703
Are you all right?

634
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,665
Ma'am!

635
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,617
-Hello.
-Welcome. How can I help you?

636
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,536
I came to get my hair done, obviously.

637
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,289
Oh. Any specific hairdresser
you're looking for?

638
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,793
Why would I look for a dresser?
I came to do my hair.

639
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,505
-Yeah, so he just went home.
-What kind of crazy…

640
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,799
He was so obnoxious.

641
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,384
That's so crazy.

642
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,471
Hey, that jerk is ghosting me for sure.

643
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:46,058
I must have been out of my mind.
I'm so pissed, damn it.

644
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,394
It's time to wash your hair.

645
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,237
Hello, ma'am. Do you have a style in mind?

646
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,989
I'd like my hair washed first too.

647
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,366
Sure.

648
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,244
Please have a seat here.

649
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,540
Just a moment.

650
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,548
All right, please lie back.

651
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,680
I've seen that necklace somewhere before.

652
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,182
Where did I see it?

653
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,857

I got you.

657
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:05,846
Finally.

658
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,771
MASK GIRL♥TEDDY
HAS REQUESTED A 1:1 CHAT

659
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,898
MASK GIRL♥TEDDY:
LOVE MG, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

660
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,399
What do you think?

661
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,321
LOVE MG: JUST SO-SO

662
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,906
LOL, DON'T BE SURPRISED!

663
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,617
I'M IN GANGCHEON

664
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,417
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT

665
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,544
AND I THINK THAT WOMAN
REALLY IS MASK GIRL!

666
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,879
LOVE MG: REALLY?

667
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,881
I WENT TO THE SUPERMARKET IN THE VIDEO

668
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,635
APPARENTLY, HER MOM

669
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,012
WAS LOOKING FOR HER IN GANGCHEON!

670
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,680
CONSIDERING ALL THAT

671
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:52,226
I THINK SHE'S REALLY MASK GIRL

672
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,353
Aren't you a detective, huh?

673
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,987
TAXICAB DRIVER'S LICENSE
KIM KYUNG-JA

674
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:07,115
Wow, it's been a long time
since you've gotten your license.

675
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,243
You're not young either.

676
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,245
Will you be okay?

677
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,998
Don't worry. I can tell the gas
and brake pedal apart.

678
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,477
CHEONHA LAUNDROMAT

679
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,693
I'm here to buy a gun.

680
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,654
You're the one who called me?

681
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,408
Damn it. Just my luck.

682
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,995
Three million won to buy one, right?

683
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,164
Here's ten million won.

684
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:08,802
This one is a Glock made in Austria, okay?

685
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,180
But in order for you to carry around--

686
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:15,100
Forget that.
Give me the most powerful one.

687
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,354
The most powerful one?

688
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,357
This is it.

689
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,329
Yeah. This is good enough.

690
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,634
-In you go.
-What is this…

691
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,721
I'm not in service today.
Take the one behind me.

692
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,098
What the hell? Seriously?

693
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,225
Damn it. Let's go.

694
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:05,817
VACANT

695
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:26,797
My goodness. You must be exhausted
from working this late.

696
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,007
Oh, yeah.

697
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,344
I feel like you're just
around my daughter's age.

698
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:33,845
How old are you?

699
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,098
I'm 28 years old.

700
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:39,810
My word. You're the same age
as my daughter.

701
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:43,522
Is that right?

702
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:58,495
Excuse me, miss.

703
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:03,208
My phone fell under the passenger seat.

704
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,252
Do you mind picking it up for me?

705
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,337
Sure.

706
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,050
There's nothing here.

707
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,844
-Is it not there?
-Where is it?

708
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,138
-I can't see it.
-Really?

709
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,723
Oh, it's here.

710
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:18,640
What?

711
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,575
Awake?

712
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:37,219
Help me! Someone!

713
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:40,347
-Help!
-Help me!

714
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,433
Please, help me!

715
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,400
Who are you, lady?

716
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,277
Why are you doing this to me?

717
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,162
You still have no clue?

718
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,039
No, I don't.

719
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,960
I don't know!
What the hell is wrong with you?

720
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,802
Ma'am, wait a second.

721
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,888
I'm sorry.

722
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,433
I don't know what I did wrong,

723
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,853
but I'll do whatever you want.

724
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,985
Now you've come to your senses a bit.

725
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,912
Who is this man?

726
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,251
You don't know?

727
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,755
-You little--
-Please, ma'am!

728
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,383
Please. I really don't know him!

729
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,928
I've never seen anyone like him before!

730
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,764
I know you though.

731
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,643
Your real name is Kim Mo-mi.

732
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:10,979
Kim Mo-mi?

733
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:15,066
Ma'am, I'm Kim Chun-ae!

734
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,318
Kim Chun-ae?

735
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,361
How tacky!

736
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,072
How many names do you have?

737
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,117
How about this?

738
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,745
Not you either?

739
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,830
Choi Yu-mi.

740
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,499
How did you get this…

741
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,545
You still wanna keep lying?

742
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,798
-I'm telling you the truth!
-You damn bitch.

743
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,222
Stay still, or I'll stomp
all over your face.

744
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:53,647
What is this mask?

745
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,611
Ma'am, why are you doing this, seriously?

746
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,488
I'm really not her.

747
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:04,282
Please don't do this.

748
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,744
I've never heard of Kim Mo-mi before.

749
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,247
Bitch, you lie
every time you open your mouth.

750
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,332
Bingo! A perfect match!

751
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,376
-Ma'am, I am not her.
-It's you.

752
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,919
It is you.

753
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,423
Ma'am, I'm telling you. It's not me!

754
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,930
Why are you doing this?

755
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:31,059
You probably killed my son
looking like that.

756
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,938
Ma'am, why would I kill your son?

757
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:36,523
I swear it's not me!

758
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,109
I've never ever seen
your son before! I swear!

759
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,568
I looked at your pictures

760
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,780
as much as my son's, you bitch.

761
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,910
This necklace you're wearing

762
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,414
is exactly the same
as the one in the photo.

763
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,374
Necklace?

764
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,103
Have you lost your goddamn mind?

765
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,195
I think I know who this bitch is.

766
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,281
What?

767
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,037
You said that bitch's name is Kim Mo-mi?
