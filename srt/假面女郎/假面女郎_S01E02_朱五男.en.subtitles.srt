1
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,902
My name is Ju Oh-nam.

2
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,157
I like spending time alone.

3
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,037
It's been that way since I was young.

4
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:41,750
When I was young,

5
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,586
other kids bullied me and made fun of me.

6
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,300
In the world of children,
you are ridiculed

7
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,011
just for being short and fat.

8
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,512
Hey, stupid! Look at me!

9
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,514
Hey!

10
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,099
Spin more!

11
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,856
I started middle school,
but nothing changed.

12
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,107
No, it's mine.

13
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,650
No, I eat first!

14
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,610
It's mine.

15
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,572
The only way to get along with my peers

16
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,784
was to stay as invisible as possible.

17
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,496
The moment I let myself be seen,

18
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,248
the bullying picked up.

19
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:37,305
Slowly, I grew afraid
of people's eyes on me.

20
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,183
And slowly,

21
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,144
I erased myself away.

22
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,857
No one was around to listen to me.

23
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,985
Except her.

24
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,449
I love you.

25
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,284
I love you.

26
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,748
I love you too.

27
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:55,526
MASK GIRL

28
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,822
JU OH-NAM

29
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,994
Thanks, Remi-chan!

30
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,539
What is this?

31
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,749
You even got a present for me?

32
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,586
You didn't have to.

33
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,258
Anyway, thanks, Remi-chan!

34
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,057
It's so cute!

35
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,685
MALE MASTURBATION TOY

36
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,572
Ah shit.

37
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,366
Hi, Mom.

38
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,953
What the hell took you so long to answer?

39
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,289
I called this morning,
but you didn't answer.

40
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,374
Do you know what today is?

41
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,251
It's my birth--

42
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,755
Didn't I say I was going to Jeju Island
with people from my church today?

43
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,089
Ah, right.

44
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,550
God, what am I gonna do with you?

45
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,136
You know Ms. Yang's son, Du-sik, right?

46
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,638
The one who became a doctor.

47
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:52,560
He sent over money
and bought his mom clothes for the trip!

48
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,604
Do I really have to spell it out for you?

49
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,730
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,647
My goodness.

51
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,234
Du-sik even got married
to a doctor as well.

52
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,529
Apparently, they both look after
Du-sik's mom so well.

53
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,782
Everyone says he is the best son,

54
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,076
and I'm sick and tired of hearing it!

55
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,411
Anyway, are you dating anyone yet?

56
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,374
What the heck? Did you just sigh?

57
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,000
It was just a yawn.

58
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,628
God, you're just bullshitting
over and over.

59
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,465
I raised you alone, without a husband,
and I don't wish for much.

60
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,093
All I want is a grandchild
to hold in my arms,

61
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,886
and you can't even do that for me.

62
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,772
I am still alone.

63
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,403
I'm still afraid of people.

64
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,578
In particular,

65
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,332
I'm even more afraid of making
eye contact with female humans.

66
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,132
Mr. Ju. Here it is.

67
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,883
DOCUMENT FOR APPROVAL

68
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,888
So I prefer looking at women's hands

69
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,099
instead of their faces.

70
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,270
This female human has moles
on both of her hands.

71
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,522
In the exact same spot.

72
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,860
She got her nails done today.

73
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,951
But here,

74
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,955
I am completely different.

75
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,964
Okay, let's take a look at all my cuties.

76
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,302
I will shower you
with tons of Heart Pangs.

77
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,388
Out of all of them, I had a favorite.

78
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,599
Mask Girl.

79
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:01,731
It's a pity that she covers her face,
but she provides the best service.

80
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:05,943
3,000 HEART PANGS

81
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,654
3,000
ONCE UPON A PRINCE

82
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,157
Once Upon A Prince! I'm so touched!

83
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,247
They were in the exact same spot
and the same size,

84
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,708
even her nail color too.

85
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,543
That was when

86
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,588
she became special to me.

87
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,012
After hovering around the 10% range,

88
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,474
our performance took
a sharp upward turn in 2008.

89
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,351
And in the first half of 2009…

90
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,928
ONCE UPON A PRINCE ENTERED THE CHAT

91
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,055
BITCH MUST LOOK LIKE AN ORC
WON'T TAKE IT OFF 'CAUSE SHE'S UGLY

92
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,807
Talking about my face again?

93
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,269
Are you that curious about my face?

94
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,565
TRUE BEAUTY IS INNER BEAUTY

95
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,275
LET'S NOT JUDGE PEOPLE BY THEIR LOOKS

96
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,652
I totally agree with Prince here.

97
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,905
It's all about looks.
Gosh, aren't you tired of it?

98
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,700
You're right, Ms. Mo-mi.

99
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,702
I think those who lack in appearance

100
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,580
are indeed more mature on the inside.

101
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:46,836
Those beautiful assholes never
had to feel any kind of discouragement.

102
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,632
I agree. Those who only care
about looks are terrible.

103
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,178
Prince, you're really deep.

104
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,222
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?

105
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:02,435
All right, enough about looks.
Do you want to listen to some music?

106
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,437
ARE YOU FAVORING PRINCE?
GET A ROOM, YOU TWO

107
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,939
I wonder if you younger ones
would know this.

108
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,816
This is my favorite song.

109
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,569
"Dance In The Rhythm" by Kim Wan-sun.

110
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,614
I hope you all like it too.

111
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,394
In the modern rhythm

112
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,398
Visible in the moment

113
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,653
To your new dance moves

114
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,657
I lose my heart

115
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,911
Under the breathtaking light

116
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,123
Your mysterious eyes...

117
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,627
You are beautiful, even without the mask.

118
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,839
I love you, Ms. Mo-mi.

119
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,635
Mr. Ju, I love you.

120
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:32,024
Milk…

121
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:36,821
Milk…

122
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,780
MILK

123
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,906
Yes!

124
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,701
I wore something pretty today.
What do I do?

125
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,495
Okay, here I go!

126
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,339
Ah, it's not breaking easily.

127
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,383
It must be because the ice is slippery.

128
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,063
All right, let's all make a toast!

129
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,149
Cheers!

130
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,276
Have a drink, everyone.

131
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,743
Cheers.

132
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,960
I think I like this wine too.

133
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,671
French wine is just our type, right?

134
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,091
Gosh, I think I'm getting drunk already.

135
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,657
Dance to the rhythm

136
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,117
Oh!

137
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,119
Sorry?

138
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,413
Hello.

139
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,047
That's not what I'm saying.

140
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,258
Telling a woman
to pour you a glass is just wrong.

141
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,718
Regardless of sex…

142
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,680
Mr. Park feels uncomfortable
when female employees pour him drinks.

143
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,600
Is a man touching a woman's chest the same
as a woman touching a man's?

144
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,518
Oh, okay.

145
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,897
-I'm just saying.
-That's enough.

146
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,107
You know what, boss?

147
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,110
Why did you put them so far away? Jeez.

148
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,029
Kids are out of control these days.

149
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:45,866
If they do this,
people donate Heart Pangs left and right.

150
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,827
It gets really crazy.

151
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,789
It's 100,000 won for 1,000
and a million won for 10,000 Heart Pangs.

152
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:56,001
Tons of kids are trying
to make money this way now.

153
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,171
Wow! Jeez. Young people are
just out of their minds.

154
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:03,801
The hottest one on here is this one.

155
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,469
Mask Girl.

156
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,515
-What's wrong?
-I'm sorry.

157
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,558
It's all right.

158
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,435
I moved near Osan Pass, so…

159
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,981
Oh, you did? Sure, get in.

160
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,863
All right, then. Ms. Lee!
Let's go for a second round.

161
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,490
-What should we eat?
-Mr. Kim?

162
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,993
Oh shit! You scared me, damn it.

163
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,871
How long were you standing there, huh?

164
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,874
You should've said something
if you were there. Gosh!

165
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,875
What?

166
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,961
I have a thing at home as well, so…

167
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,170
Sure, go. Bye.

168
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,631
Okay, next is spicy chicken feet!

169
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,717
-Let's go!
-Chicken feet!

170
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,068
No, it was totally coincidental.

171
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,155
My place is on the way to his, that's why.

172
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:10,326
Anyway. On the way,
his wife called him, right?

173
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,329
But even though
he was in the taxi with me,

174
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,790
he lied to his wife,
saying that he was alone.

175
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,751
Why did he do that?

176
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,085
HE JUST COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO EXPLAIN

177
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,129
-Exactly. That's all it is.
-Well, then.

178
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:25,466
He could've said he was with a coworker
whose place was on the way.

179
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,092
MASK GIRL, YOU'RE SO DELUSIONAL

180
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,636
Well done, Brad Pit!

181
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,763
BRAD PIT HAS BEEN KICKED FROM THE CHAT

182
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,056
How about this?

183
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:37,603
A while back, I told him,
"Oh, your cologne smells really nice."

184
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:41,523
Then he started to only wear that cologne.

185
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,652
But as I'm sure you already know,

186
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,488
I have no feelings whatsoever for him.

187
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,032
IF YOU DATE THAT MAN, I'LL KILL MYSELF

188
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,268
HOW TO CONFESS YOUR LOVE SUCCESSFULLY

189
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,981
I love you, Ms. Mo-mi.

190
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,946
Man, that's not how it's done.

191
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,782
Ms. Mo-mi.

192
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,411
Forget about someone like him.
Just come to me--

193
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,979
I'll get going now.

194
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,498
What are you doing, Ju?

195
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,752
Oh…

196
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:26,837
I…

197
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,214
Why are you still here?

198
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,259
Huh?

199
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,722
Forget it! See you tomorrow.
For God's sake.

200
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,928
Do you like that?

201
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,458
Please don't stop

202
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,212
The dance in that rhythm

203
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,885
Please don't stop

204
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,429
-Everyone.
-The dance in that…

205
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,930
Everyone.

206
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,309
I had a drink.

207
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,520
Guys.

208
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,398
Do you know what love is?

209
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,276
Oh, drat. Why isn't this working?

210
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,777
Love always hurts.

211
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,654
I know how you feel.

212
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,701
Forget that piece of trash.
Experience real love with me.

213
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,911
SHE'S GONNA CAUSE A SCENE
TALK HER OUT OF IT?

214
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,204
2,000
BEAR GRILLS

215
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,830
300
ROLL ROLL 123

216
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,253
What? What is she doing?

217
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,423
Get it together, Mo-mi. Stop!

218
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,303
Shit, no!

219
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,804
MASK GIRL! YOU'LL GET SUSPENDED

220
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:27,309
This is all because
of that son of a bitch, Park.

221
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:39,696
Ms. Mo-mi.

222
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,782
May I speak with you?

223
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,368
Pardon?

224
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:45,953
Forget it.

225
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,788
Forget what?

226
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,998
Forget about that piece of shit,

227
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,042
that married fucking bastard!

228
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,836
What's gotten into you?

229
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,506
I've watched you all this time.

230
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,716
What? You've watched me?

231
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,678
I mean, not necessarily watching you, but…

232
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,181
What is wrong with him?

233
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,059
I love you, Ms. Mo-mi!

234
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,271
I love you!

235
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,544
What took you so long?

236
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,921
What?

237
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,007
I actually

238
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,052
love you too, Mr. Ju.

239
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,306
You love me?

240
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,256
What are you doing? You okay?

241
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:24,885
Oh,

242
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,554
my wisdom tooth…

243
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,587
Excuse me.

244
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,589
Yes?

245
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,931
No, it's nothing.

246
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,870
Did you have something you wanted to say?

247
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,372
Oh, that…

248
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,253
There was a slight error
in the sales figures

249
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,464
in the data reported to Mr. Park.

250
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,799
-So I…
-Oh, really?

251
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,301
-I'm sorry.
-I adjusted them before submission.

252
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,929
Thank you.

253
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,515
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

254
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,654
No taxis.

255
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,116
I might as well die.

256
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:26,965
Wait!

257
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,050
Hey! Taxi!

258
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,266
Sir, please follow that taxi. Quick!

259
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,060
Quickly!

260
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:49,946
MOTEL

261
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,584
I ♡♡♡♡ YOU

262
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,211
SEND

263
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,130
What? What's going on?

264
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,591
Nothing.

265
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,574
Hi, Mom.

266
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,368
Why the hell do you always
take so long to answer?

267
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:22,372
Look. I made some side dishes.
When should I come by?

268
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:26,918
You don't have to bring food.
I haven't had time to eat at home lately.

269
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,088
Hell. What kind of stinking company
works you to the bone

270
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,591
and pays you an ant's ass worth of money.

271
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,344
Mom, my meeting's starting right now.

272
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,598
I'll call you later. Bye.

273
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,741
MASK GIRL HAS REQUESTED A 1:1 CHAT

274
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,202
ACCEPT

275
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,748
MASK GIRL SAYS: HI?

276
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,961
WOW, HEY! IT'S BEEN TOO LONG

277
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,297
I'M SO SAD THAT YOU GOT SUSPENDED

278
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,301
I THINK I MIGHT AS WELL
QUIT LIVE STREAMING NOW

279
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,721
WHY? NO!

280
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,600
I don't think I'm a woman
who can be loved.

281
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,851
What do you mean?

282
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,771
You're so charming.

283
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:32,317
Mo-mi, cheer up. I'm here for you.

284
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,446
You'll think differently
once you see my face.

285
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,823
Of course not.

286
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,451
I'm not that kind of man.

287
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,248
I would be so good to you.

288
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,001
DO YOU WANT TO MEET UP?

289
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:50,919
What?

290
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,089
IF I'M ALONE, I MIGHT DIE

291
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,882
YOU'RE MY FRIEND

292
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,431
WHY SAY THAT?

293
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,143
DON'T SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DIE

294
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:13,400
WHY SAY THAT?
DON'T SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DIE

295
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,531
DON'T SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DIE

296
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,246
HANDSOME MONK'S GONNA BUY ME A DRINK

297
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,872
SORRY FOR SPOUTING NONSENSE

298
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,999
MASK GIRL HAS LOGGED OUT

299
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,852
Gosh, I must be out of my mind.

300
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,524
Damn it. Whatever.

301
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,820
Oh, Ms. Mask Girl!

302
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,281
You're Ms. Mask Girl, right?

303
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:05,827
Man, I'm so glad to meet you.
I'm the Handsome Monk.

304
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,998
Wow. It's such an honor
to meet you like this.

305
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,709
Your shows are truly the best.

306
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:16,212
I think it's so real.

307
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,716
Other camgirls, they know they're pretty.

308
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,302
So they don't have a professional mindset.

309
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,263
But your show, Ms. Mask Girl,
it's so honest.

310
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:28,057
That's what's really awesome.

311
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,019
Oh, sure. Thanks.

312
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,899
Well, then,

313
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:39,068
should we speak casually now?

314
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,362
Oh, we're the same age.

315
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,948
Oh, sure.

316
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,159
Then can you take off your mask now?

317
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,869
Huh?

318
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,121
I'm not hungry.

319
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,582
No. I can't eat all of this by myself.

320
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,209
Take it off.

321
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,878
Take-- I'm going to say it really loudly.

322
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,006
-Take it off.
-Okay! Stop.

323
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,133
-Take it off.
-I will. You can stop now.

324
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,145
Stop looking at me. I'm embarrassed.

325
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,104
Wait, hold on.

326
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,401
Why did you hide your face?

327
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:21,861
You're pretty.

328
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,988
What are you saying?

329
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,324
Are you making fun of me?

330
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,408
Oh, no.

331
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,578
You're really natural and…

332
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,290
What's the Korean word?

333
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,961
Oh, attractive?

334
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,838
Yes! You're attractive!

335
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,757
You're totally attractive.

336
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,718
Did you live in America for a while?

337
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,179
You lived in America for a while?

338
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,807
Yeah. Until I graduated from college.

339
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:55,645
My family is all in America. I'm in Korea.

340
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,480
Aren't you lonely?

341
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,191
I was a little lonely at first.

342
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,111
When I first came to Korea,
I understood nothing.

343
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,071
So I cried.

344
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,948
I was lonely.

345
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,284
I see.

346
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,078
I mean, it's better now.

347
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:18,418
Mask Girl. If you go to America,
you'll be really popular.

348
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:19,836
Yeah?

349
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,507
Yeah! American guys really like
girls with monolid eyes,

350
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,134
and with this…

351
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,135
Cheekbones?

352
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,637
Yeah. They really like girls
with high cheekbones.

353
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,598
Oh, really?

354
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,186
I was thinking about getting surgery
on my cheekbones.

355
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,650
Mask Girl, you're really attractive.

356
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,988
I'm really against it.

357
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,208
Let's go.

358
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,525
Oh, sorry I took so long.

359
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:26,819
It's fine.

360
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,824
You want something else?

361
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,036
I'll have what you're having.

362
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:37,956
Excuse me.

363
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,958

I MET MASK GIRL AT THE FOOD ALLEY

HANDSOME MONK
27 YEARS OLD, MALE

367
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,173
I'LL POST PICTURES
SHE'S FUCKING UGLY

368
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,967
WAIT UP, GUYS
I'M GETTING HER DRUNK

369
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,469
SHE'S EVEN UGLIER THAN I THOUGHT

370
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:55,598
BUT STILL, I HAVE TO HAVE A TASTE

371
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,433
You motherfucker!

372
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,987
Yeah, a whole lot really.

373
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,239
What the heck? You're so funny!

ASSOCIATE MANAGER JU OH-NAM

375
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:18,204
Hey, it's really loud in here.

376
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,540
You wanna go somewhere quieter?

377
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,208
Sure! Where should we go?

378
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,545
-Shall we go outside and look?
-Okay.

379
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,130
Let's go.

380
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,389
To Cheong-dong Food Alley, please.

381
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,523
When I first came to Korea,

382
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,276
I thought Grandma's Bone Hangover Soup

383
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,945
actually had Grandma's bones in it.

384
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,988
Really?

385
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,198
Yeah, so I was super scared.

386
00:33:56,242 --> 00:34:00,705
Well, should we just get some beer
and drink in peace here?

387
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,625
Here?

388
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,295
Yeah, let's watch a movie and drink beer.

389
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,132
This is a bit too…

390
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,426
Other places are too noisy though.

391
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,227
Can I rent a room for a few hours?

392
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,064
Not at this time of night.

393
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,232
I did in Bongcheon-dong.

394
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,068
Not here though.

395
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,404
How much for a night?

396
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,031
It's 60,000 won.

397
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:52,882
Hey, Mask Girl.

398
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:56,469
I'll go buy some beer.
You can go wait in the room.

399
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:07,730
Oh fuck. I spent so much fucking money.

400
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:11,150
Man, she could've offered
to buy the beer. Damn it.

401
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,072
So fucking annoying.

EIGHT MISSED CALLS

403
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,546
MS. MO-MI, WHERE ARE YOU?
CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS

404
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,006
What's up with him?

405
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,513
Hey.

406
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,809
I don't think we should drink here.

407
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,354
Oh, all of a sudden? What's wrong?

408
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,191
You said it was fine earlier.

409
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,695
I never said it was fine.

410
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:43,993
Mask Girl. Wait a second.
Just come sit here for a moment.

411
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:47,830
What? Hey, this is a waterbed?
Wow, I've never seen this before.

412
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:50,875
Come on, Mask Girl.

413
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,127
Come sit down for a moment, yeah?

414
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,010
Come on. Let's just get comfortable,

415
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:06,974
drink beer here,
watch a movie, and talk comfortably.

416
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,519
But this place is too…

417
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,733
You're so pretty.

418
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,736
What are you doing?

419
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,990
Wait. Have I become the bad guy here?

420
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,201
Come on.

421
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,996
We were having a lot of fun, remember?

422
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,878
I'm going to go.

423
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,215
Man, if you weren't up for it,
you should've said so sooner.

424
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,925
What a fucking waste of money.

425
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,682
I'll give you the money.

426
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,058
What?

427
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,231
Playing fucking hard to get
with a fucking ugly face.

428
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,741
What did you just say?

429
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,494
I said, you play hard to get
with such a fucking ugly face, so?

430
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,247
You showed literally everything
in your live streams.

431
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,833
So, what's with
this acting-uppity bullshit?

432
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,669
I'd let it slide
if you were pretty, you know?

433
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:20,006
But you're fucking ugly,
and this is fucking bullshit!

434
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,177
Shit! Are you fucking crazy?

435
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,432
You're fucking pissing me off,
you fucking bitch.

436
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,475
Let go, you fucking bastard!

437
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,027
You!

438
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,029

Hey, wait…

441
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,117
You fucking bastard!

442
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,618
Wait! Oh fuck!

443
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,704
Fucking die! You fucking bastard!

444
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,789
You freaking lied
about coming from America.

445
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,791
Didn't you? You son of a bitch!

446
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,877
-Hey, let go!
-Fucking die, you fuck!

447
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,670
Fucking die, you son of a bitch!

448
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,717
-Damn it.
-Let go, shit!

449
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,849
For fuck's sake.

450
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,269
You crazy bitch.

451
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,064
You fucking son of a bitch.

00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,000
Hello?

460
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,877
Ms. Mo-mi!

461
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,303
Are you all right, Ms. Mo-mi?

462
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,915
Is he dead?

463
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,337
I don't know.

464
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,883
This bastard was all, like,

465
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,053
trying to force himself on me, so

466
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,932
I said I didn't want to,

467
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,892
but he kept pushing me.

468
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,160
I should report this, right?

469
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,629
If you report this, you might go to jail.

470
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,092
If I say that it was self-defense,

471
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,511
if I do that…

472
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,181
wouldn't it work out somehow?

473
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:25,519
But you did come to the motel
with this bastard.

474
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:32,109
Even if it's treated as manslaughter,
you can serve a few years at least.

475
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,746
Then what do I do?

476
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,438
You should go home, Mo-mi.

477
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:10,689
I will handle this.

478
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,367
What do you mean?

479
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,868
I can take care of this.

480
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,913
You need to go. Now.

481
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,333
No, I can't. How can I just leave?

482
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,169
I'm begging you. Please go home.

483
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:34,838
I don't think it's right.

484
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,092
Please!

485
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:44,473
Please leave.

00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,409

Ms. Yoo.

488
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,417
Did something happen to Ms. Kim?

489
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,794
-Mo-mi? I'm not sure.
-Yeah.

490
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,296
My goodness.

491
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,635
Well, this morning,
I got a message from HR.

492
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,637
Apparently, she said she quit.

493
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,554
What?

494
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:56,224
I mean, do you quit by phone these days?

495
00:48:56,308 --> 00:49:01,730
I can't believe this. Back in my day,
this was just simply unthinkable.

496
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:02,773
The person…

497
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,608
-Right?
-Oh, of course.

498
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,903
-We didn't dare dream of it.
-She even has her phone off. What's up?

506
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:31,510
Excuse me.

507
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:37,307
Could I get the home address
for Ms. Kim Mo-mi in Sales Management?

508
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,226
For what purpose?

509
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:43,605
Oh, Ms. Kim quit her job.

510
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,733
She's not answering her phone.

511
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,989
We have to send her stuff to her,
but I don't know her address.

512
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,824
Oh. Sure. Hold on, please.

513
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:26,106
The person you are calling
is currently unavailable. Please--

514
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,262
It's been a while, everyone.

515
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,931
This is my last live stream.

516
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,934
Thank you for everything.

517
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,618
SOMETHING'S OFF ABOUT HER AGAIN
IS SHE DRUNK?

518
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,721
Ms. Mo-mi, open the door.
I know you're inside.

519
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,723
Open the door right now, Mo-mi!

520
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,028
Come in.

521
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,815
Are you going somewhere?

522
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,571
Why did you quit your job?

523
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,074
I can't go to work…

524
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,204
as if nothing's happened
when something like that happened.

525
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,123
Ms. Mo-mi.

526
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,751
You must forget about what happened.

527
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,379
Just pretend it never happened.

528
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,799
You know that bastard deserved to die.

529
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,720
He was nothing more than a cockroach.

530
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,640
You are him, right?

531
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,021
Once Upon A Prince.

532
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,737
I thought it was strange…

533
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,909
how you knew
that I was meeting that bastard.

534
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,455
Once I collected my thoughts,
it became clear.

535
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:31,791
It's you, isn't it?

536
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:36,213
The one who sent me that strange email.

537
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,508
Why did you do it?

538
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,845
I said, "Why?"

539
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:46,973
I didn't do it on purpose.

540
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:52,020
When I saw you going to a motel with Park,
a burst of anger overcame me.

541
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:59,694
It was the first time
I had felt like this toward someone.

542
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:14,793
I'm sorry.

543
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:23,843
You're right.

544
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,889
You are right, Mr. Ju.

545
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:29,683
I'm going to…

546
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,646
erase what happened from my memory.

547
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:38,858
As you said,

548
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,238
I'm going to think that a cockroach died.

549
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,907
I'm going to start over.

550
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:48,076
Now the old Kim Mo-mi

551
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:49,911
is dead.

552
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,873
I'm going to start anew.

553
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:55,750
Completely

554
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:57,669
fresh.

555
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:01,631
Then what about me?

556
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,557
Are you going to erase me too?

557
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,189
Mr. Ju.

558
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,737
What do you want me to do for you?

559
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:27,240
Huh?

560
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,875
You're like everyone else.

561
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,091
Let go of me!

562
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,586
I have to protect you, Ms. Mo-mi.

563
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,963
I decided that day

564
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,423
that I…

565
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,718
I will protect you from now on.

566
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:33,264
I love you, Ms. Mo-mi.

567
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,507
What the hell did you do?

568
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,438
You son of a bitch!

569
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:18,609
