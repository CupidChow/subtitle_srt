1
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:11,667
You are like the sea

2
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:14,999
Every single day

3
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:18,999
You keep waiting

4
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:21,500
No matter if I come or not

5
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:23,999
A sudden gust of wind

6
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:27,999
Messed up my hairstyle

7
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:31,792
But it brought us together

8
00:00:31,918 --> 00:00:37,959
Only then did I discover how much I love who I am

9
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,959
Only you

10
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,792
Remind me of myself

11
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:47,375
The one who used to love smiling

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,998
Why did I lose my smile?

13
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:53,584
Unable to find a way out

14
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:56,751
I stand by the sea, feeling the breeze

15
00:00:56,876 --> 00:00:59,083
Only you

16
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:05,292
Remind me of myself and what I desire

17
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:11,334
I've finally learned That after all my overthinking

18
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:12,584
What I want the most

19
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:16,999
Is to go to the seaside And feel the breeze with you

20
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:29,999
"BREEZE BY THE SEA"

21
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:34,792
She's still not answering.

22
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:37,310
What if they ran into some bad guys?

23
00:01:37,334 --> 00:01:38,999
No way. Don't say that.

24
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:40,334
That's right.

25
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:41,250
Hainuo.

26
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:42,375
Dawu.

27
00:01:42,626 --> 00:01:44,626
Can you go to Taipei and bring them back?

28
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:24,719
Are you sure about going to Taipei with me?

29
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,918
There are paparazzi. Sit tight.

30
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,655
Does your grandma know about it?

31
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:40,167
I just ate with her. She seemed completely clueless.

32
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,626
It's fine.

33
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:44,999
I'll inform her for you.

34
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Hello, Grandma.

35
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:59,375
There's something Hainuo might not know how to tell you.

36
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,083
Well...

37
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,918
Nuonuo doesn't know how to tell you.

38
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:06,959
You asked her to go back with you, right?

39
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,999
However, she's worried about leaving me alone in Kinmen.

40
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:14,500
Aren't Yueshan and Jingliang in Taipei right now?

41
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:16,542
That's why I sent Nuonuo

42
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,834
to bring them back.

43
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,542
Maybe she'll get used to it over there.

44
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:24,083
Who knows? She might change her mind.

45
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:28,999
Don't worry. I'll be fine here on my own.

46
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:34,042
After all, I have your "Bros Forever"

47
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,459
to look after me, right?

48
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:40,876
Got it.

49
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,375
Thank you, Grandma.

50
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,751
Understood.

51
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:46,792
She can stay there for a while.

52
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:48,417
You guys just get going.

53
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:50,709
Don't worry.

54
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,083
I'm here.

55
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:53,982
I'll take good care of your grandma.

56
00:03:55,584 --> 00:03:57,999
Please look after her.

57
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:01,999
Bro.

58
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:03,334
Thank you.

59
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:06,584
Okay.

60
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,999
It's about time. Shall we go in?

61
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,999
There are paparazzi. Let's go separately.

62
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,250
Got it, stranger.

63
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:23,792
Hey, your camera looks high-end.

64
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:24,918
Are you a photographer?

65
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:26,918
You too, right?

66
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:27,999
Come on.

67
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,935
- I'll take you to some great spots in Kinmen. - No need.

68
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,393
It's just the three of us, no one else.

69
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:32,209
No need.

70
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,334
Come on.

71
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:59,167
- Hello. - Hello?

72
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:01,083
Why are you answering a stranger's call?

73
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:03,792
What's up?

74
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,999
Where are you right now?

75
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,083
I'm...

76
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:12,125
in a corner, far, far away from you.

77
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:13,918
Well...

78
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:16,751
I just wanted to tell you

79
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:18,584
there are even more paparazzi in Taipei.

80
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:21,459
So?

81
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:23,792
You don't want me to go?

82
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:26,542
So it might be a bit tricky to get into the car later.

83
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:27,947
You should be mentally prepared.

84
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:29,918
Got it.

85
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:35,209
Can you help me make a call?

86
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,167
Yueshan.

87
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:40,999
Yueshan.

88
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:43,876
Hey.

89
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:45,918
What?

90
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:48,250
Don't overthink it.

91
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:50,918
Maybe your dad just changed jobs.

92
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:54,709
This place seems far.

93
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,584
We need to figure out the route.

94
00:05:58,667 --> 00:05:59,907
Let's go there some other time.

95
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:04,876
What are you doing?

96
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,834
Didn't you say not to answer any calls?

97
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:11,000
But he's my master.

98
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,834
You made that rule!

99
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,334
I didn't answer any calls!

100
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,250
You can't answer it.

101
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:20,459
Hello, Master!

102
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,500
I'm in Taipei with Tsai Jingliang.

103
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:29,751
Why did you tell him that?

104
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:32,751
What now?

105
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:34,999
Got it.

106
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:36,042
Understood.

107
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:37,792
Thank you, Master!

108
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:38,918
What is it?

109
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:40,709
What's going on?

110
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,334
Your mood changes way too quickly.

111
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:45,209
You wouldn't understand, kid.

112
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:47,999
We're the same age.

113
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:49,626
- You... - Come with me.

114
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:51,751
Where are we going?

115
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:52,999
We got lucky.

116
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,500
Tell me what it is first.

117
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:06,999
Bai Yinmo.

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,640
Your mom joined the reality show for you.

119
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:09,500
Why did you run away?

120
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:10,975
- Will you quit the entertainment industry? - Please answer.

121
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:12,599
Will you protest to the production team?

122
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:14,709
He ran away.

123
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:16,709
Are you feeling guilty?

124
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:19,786
Excuse me. I need to pick up two people along the way.

125
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:21,999
Sure, sir.

126
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:25,569
Is this your first day on the job?

127
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:26,626
Yes.

128
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,000
I used to deliver seafood.

129
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,165
Now I deliver sea urchins.

130
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:34,626
Hello?

131
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:36,399
Li, will you be heading back today?

132
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:37,999
We'll probably be back later.

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,999
Yes.

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,040
We just got here not long ago. We're still waiting.

135
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:46,998
Lu, get ready.

136
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,542
Okay. Wait for me.

137
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
We've arrived.

138
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:14,435
- Driver, you can park here. - This is the place.

139
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:15,999
Xiaoguang will move the car later.

140
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,667
Got it, sir.

141
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:23,459
Seriously.

142
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,667
Make yourself at home.

143
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,709
Tsai Jingliang, come take a look!

144
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,792
This place is huge.

145
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:35,292
It's so big.

146
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:36,999
What's all this stuff on the table?

147
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,000
Is the outside also your house?

148
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,999
Your rooms are on the third floor. Come on.

149
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:45,999
Driver.

150
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,209
Hurry up.

151
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm off duty.

152
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:51,584
It's transparent.

153
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:54,584
The third floor.

154
00:08:56,876 --> 00:08:57,999
A gym?

155
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,709
- Yinmo, you have a gym. - There are trees.

156
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:01,999
Jingliang.

157
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,999
This is your room.

158
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:05,209
You'll sleep here.

159
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,417
It's so beautiful.

160
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:07,998
This place is amazing.

161
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:08,999
You two, follow me.

162
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:13,999
You two will sleep in this room.

163
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:19,125
It's huge!

164
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:22,319
I'll go handle some things first.

165
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,167
This is awesome.

166
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:40,792
Hello, Tang Mi.

167
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,292
I just got back to Taipei.

168
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,457
Did you and my mom get harassed when you came back?

169
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,876
When I dropped your mom off, we spotted some paparazzi.

170
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,500
I took her away immediately.

171
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:51,876
She's staying at a hotel for a few days.

172
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,167
What about Lily?

173
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:56,479
She still hasn't picked up the phone.

174
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:00,792
Okay, got it.

175
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:02,584
Thank you.

176
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:13,792
Hey, you two.

177
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:16,584
Don't you ever think about your dad and grandma?

178
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,250
After I left,

179
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:23,167
did she find me at school?

180
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,751
You finally care about her.

181
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:27,792
No.

182
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,167
I'm just asking.

183
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,042
Well, Hainuo.

184
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
My dad...

185
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,584
I didn't answer his calls. Is he really mad?

186
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,375
You two...

187
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:47,167
They're probably thrilled that you both are gone.

188
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:50,751
They finally get a break.

189
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:53,459
So you can stay in Taipei for as long as you like.

190
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:56,334
They won't be calling to check on you.

191
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:02,834
No way.

192
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:08,250
Weren't you always insisting on staying with your dad?

193
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,999
But why did you come to Taipei so abruptly?

194
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:16,312
I joined the reality show and my grandma wasn't happy about it.

195
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:19,268
Well, it's not just about the reality show.

196
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:20,999
No matter what I do, she's never happy.

197
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:23,250
I'm grown up now.

198
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:26,250
Besides, coming to Taipei won't trouble my dad.

199
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,079
I can even take care of him.

200
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,542
Plus, it's hard to explain everything over the phone.

201
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,435
A face-to-face conversation is needed

202
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,339
so he can really understand Yueshan's feelings.

203
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:38,209
What about you?

204
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:39,334
Why did you come along?

205
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:40,459
I...

206
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:42,459
I came to accompany Yueshan.

207
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:45,542
All right.

208
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:48,999
Anyway, I finally convinced Ms. Siou'e

209
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,125
to let you stay in Taipei.

210
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:55,375
However, can you promise me

211
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,042
that once you find your dad,

212
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:58,607
you'll return to Kinmen immediately?

213
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:04,667
I promise.

214
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:06,999
Hainuo.

215
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:09,667
Yinmo's news has caused quite a stir.

216
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:12,167
Is it okay for us to bother him?

217
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:16,125
We'll just stay quiet

218
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,999
and give him some space.

219
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:20,709
Got it.

220
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:26,042
You should drive slower.

221
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,709
The bouncing pebbles scratched the paint.

222
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,626
I took Hainuo to the airport today

223
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,042
to fly to Taipei with Bai Yinmo.

224
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:44,209
It's not bad.

225
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:48,334
Yes.

226
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52,999
The group chat was buzzing all afternoon.

227
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:56,209
Everyone was talking about looking for the two kids.

228
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:01,042
What's going on lately?

229
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,500
Bai Yinmo ran away from the reality show

230
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:07,999
and now the two kids have run away from home.

231
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,542
It feels like

232
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:15,375
we're all in a great escape.

233
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:18,000
But you stayed.

234
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,083
Now I finally understand

235
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:24,509
what it feels like to be the one left behind.

236
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,542
Maybe I'll leave too.

237
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:31,459
Do you prefer to say a proper goodbye or not say anything at all?

238
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,375
If you leave, who will I talk to every day

239
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,834
about my life updates?

240
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:42,667
I'll go get some paint.

241
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
You guys.

242
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:02,999
Why are you so quiet?

243
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:08,751
We saw that you were busy, so we didn't want to disturb you.

244
00:14:08,876 --> 00:14:09,959
I'm done now.

245
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:12,999
So now you can...

246
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:15,000
Party!

247
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:19,000
- I'm hungry! - Let's have hotpot.

248
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:24,584
Let's eat hotpot.

249
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:25,999
Who can cook?

250
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:27,125
I'll do it.

251
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:29,918
You guys need to help me wash the vegetables though.

252
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:30,999
Okay.

253
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:52,417
Hotpot party!

254
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:54,792
- Yes! - Yes!

255
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,918
Why is there no gas?

256
00:14:57,876 --> 00:14:59,834
Did Xiaoguang forget to pay the gas bill?

257
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,723
- What do we do now? - What do we do now?

258
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:40,959
Tsai Jingliang.

259
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:43,792
It looks nice outside.

260
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:44,999
Let's eat outside.

261
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:50,999
Won't it be cold outside?

262
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:05,459
Do you have any paper and pens for drawing?

263
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What do you want to draw?

264
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:08,999
I haven't thought about it yet.

265
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:16,417
Is this okay?

266
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:18,999
Isn't this your little notebook?

267
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Can I use it?

268
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:21,667
Sure.

269
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:27,999
This place really has a great vibe.

270
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:30,334
Don't think too much.

271
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,959
Take a look at the atmosphere inside.

272
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,999
I didn't want to be a third wheel, so I came out here.

273
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:40,999
How much longer?

274
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:42,999
It's almost ready.

275
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:44,999
How do you know?

276
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:50,542
Five.

277
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:51,999
Four.

278
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:53,459
Three.

279
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:54,709
Two.

280
00:16:56,876 --> 00:16:58,236
Are you keeping track of the time?

281
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:00,083
Yes.

282
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:01,209
It's ready.

283
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,709
It has been ages since I last had instant noodles.

284
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:16,792
Isn't it too hot?

285
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:18,792
It is.

286
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,876
Xiaoguang is in trouble tomorrow.

287
00:17:34,876 --> 00:17:36,018
The spiced peanuts are ready!

288
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:37,042
Coming.

289
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,999
Spiced peanuts.

290
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:42,998
Here are your spiced peanuts.

291
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:44,542
All right. Thank you.

292
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,542
The spiced peanuts are here.

293
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:48,587
- Please enjoy. - Fried octopus' mouth is ready!

294
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,667
Here's your octopus' mouth.

295
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:51,792
Is that enough?

296
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:52,626
Yes.

297
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:53,751
Okay.

298
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:55,279
The stir-fried snails are ready!

299
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:56,999
The spicy stinky tofu is ready!

300
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,584
The Buddha's hand is ready!

301
00:17:58,709 --> 00:17:59,959
Spicy stinky tofu.

302
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:02,266
The stir-fried instant noodles are ready!

303
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,459
Are you tired?

304
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm not tired.

305
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,079
Stir-fried instant noodles.

306
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:15,417
Thank you.

307
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:16,542
All the dishes are here.

308
00:18:16,584 --> 00:18:17,375
Enjoy your meal.

309
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Thank you.

310
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,334
"SINDA TEMPLE RESTAURANT"

311
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,667
Are you making supper?

312
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,459
Let me do it.

313
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:50,999
You cook every day,

314
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:53,000
so I made you supper.

315
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:56,042
But I accidentally dropped some eggshells in it.

316
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:58,119
It's okay. Wait for a while.

317
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:00,292
- I'll make you another one. - No worries.

318
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:02,626
It smells great.

319
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:17,250
Are you sure it's okay?

320
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:19,167
Should I...

321
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,080
It's crunchy and delicious.

322
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:23,999
Eggshells have calcium.

323
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:25,876
Do you want some?

324
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,125
I'm not sharing it with you.

325
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,000
This was cooked by the woman I love.

326
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:35,626
It's good.

327
00:19:35,751 --> 00:19:36,751
It's really good.

328
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:45,999
Grandma.

329
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:49,626
Yueshan is practicing her dancing right now.

330
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:52,792
Are you sure

331
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,959
you don't want to tell her about Ms. Siou'e's fall?

332
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:57,459
Siou'e told us not to say anything.

333
00:19:57,751 --> 00:19:59,000
Then we shouldn't mention it.

334
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,667
Ms. Siou'e dotes on Yueshan the most.

335
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:03,999
I know.

336
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,459
But she doesn't want Yueshan to worry.

337
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:09,918
By the way, how is Yinmo doing?

338
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:10,999
Is he okay?

339
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:12,417
He's not doing well.

340
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:14,626
There are paparazzi everywhere

341
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:17,626
and the news is full of negative stories about him.

342
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:20,584
Although he pretends not to care

343
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:23,999
and he's trying hard to host us,

344
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
it's just...

345
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,459
Nuonuo.

346
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:29,959
It has been a long time since you went to Taipei.

347
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,375
There's no need to rush back this time.

348
00:20:33,334 --> 00:20:34,709
Dawu will take care of me.

349
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,292
You just stay with Yinmo.

350
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,000
His circle is quite complicated.

351
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:41,999
With you by his side,

352
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,125
he won't feel alone.

353
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,667
Recently, the famous actor Bai Yinmo

354
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:47,999
who was accused of assaulting a TV host,

355
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,998
recently filmed a reality show on an outlying island.

356
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,876
His mom made a surprise appearance,

357
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:55,584
but Bai Yinmo stormed off angrily.

358
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:56,751
It also led to...

359
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:27,834
What are you doing?

360
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:32,999
I'm drawing.

361
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,083
I can't sleep.

362
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,542
Is it because of the negative news?

363
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:56,999
I'll meet with my agent tomorrow

364
00:21:57,999 --> 00:21:59,119
to figure out the situation.

365
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:06,083
Is there anything I can do to help?

366
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,417
You've already helped me.

367
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:23,834
At least I'll be able to sleep well tonight.

368
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Also,

369
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:29,079
thank you for the special sleeping pill from Kinmen.

370
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:30,626
They are very sweet.

371
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:33,999
Did you just realize?

372
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,250
Don't eat too many at once.

373
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,615
Otherwise, you'll get cavities.

374
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,292
Ms. Shuman.

375
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:16,209
Coming.

376
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:17,334
We're heading out now.

377
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,375
Okay.

378
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,626
You're finally willing to go out with me.

379
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:25,292
You're always looking out for me even though you're so busy.

380
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:26,998
I feel bad.

381
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:28,792
What's there to feel bad about?

382
00:23:28,918 --> 00:23:30,125
I'm like your grandson.

383
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:32,834
Dawu.

384
00:23:33,209 --> 00:23:35,999
I know how you feel about Nuonuo.

385
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:37,999
But don't worry.

386
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,334
Fate will guide someone

387
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:42,584
who's perfect for you to cross your path.

388
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:45,998
Right now, the most perfect one for me

389
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:47,626
is you.

390
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:49,417
So from now on, you have to listen to me.

391
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:50,918
When I ask you to go out with me,

392
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:52,959
you can't say no anymore, okay?

393
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:53,999
Okay.

394
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:55,667
I'll listen to you.

395
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,250
Did you get anything?

396
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:02,459
No, I didn't.

397
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:08,167
Wait.

398
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,542
Here they come.

399
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,292
What's his problem?

400
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:47,667
Why does he keep taking the same route?

401
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:50,542
It's fine.

402
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:51,999
Just keep following him.

403
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,042
Thank you.

404
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:03,667
- Bye. - Bye.

405
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,393
Are you sure you don't want me to give you a ride?

406
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:09,626
No need, Master.

407
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,125
There's no MRT in Kinmen,

408
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,850
so we wanted to experience it in Taipei.

409
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:14,417
Thank you, Master.

410
00:26:14,876 --> 00:26:15,876
We'll be fine.

411
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:17,999
Tang Mi.

412
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:19,667
Thank you.

413
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,083
Thank you.

414
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:31,876
- Bye then. - Bye.

415
00:26:37,876 --> 00:26:38,876
Thank you.

416
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:42,125
This is what a scandalous girlfriend should do.

417
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:44,879
I should be doing better than Xiaoguang, right?

418
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:47,042
It's hard to do worse than him.

419
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:51,459
I called your mom this morning.

420
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:52,999
She said she's fine.

421
00:26:53,334 --> 00:26:55,584
She wasn't recognized or bothered.

422
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:56,751
Don't worry.

423
00:26:57,459 --> 00:26:59,042
Once everything calms down,

424
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,584
I'll take her home.

425
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,292
Is that it?

426
00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:35,751
Is Bai Yinmo too bored or what?

427
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:37,999
- Is he crazy? - Why is he going in circles?

428
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:41,959
Forget it.

429
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:44,999
We won't get any updates by staying here.

430
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:46,954
Let's go chase another lead.

431
00:27:50,709 --> 00:27:51,709
Hey.

432
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:54,582
They've all left. Are you still going to stay here?

433
00:27:55,626 --> 00:27:56,417
Of course.

434
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:57,822
I'm not going back empty-handed.

435
00:27:59,751 --> 00:28:01,471
We'll definitely catch him if we wait here.

436
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:20,876
This is what you gave me

437
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,479
when you won your first acting award.

438
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:26,999
At the time, I didn't think you could act.

439
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:29,167
I just wanted you to give it a try.

440
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,999
I didn't expect you to really surprise me.

441
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:36,667
You lost 7 kg for a minor role.

442
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,459
You even won an award.

443
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:42,709
Best Supporting Actor.

444
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:43,834
Best Actor.

445
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:44,999
Popularity Award.

446
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:50,667
You gave me every single trophy.

447
00:28:53,626 --> 00:28:55,459
Through every sleepless night and tough day,

448
00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:58,999
I owe it to them for always being by my side.

449
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm here to hear your explanation.

450
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,999
Everyone is waiting for me to give an explanation.

451
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:17,626
How should I explain it?

452
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,918
An agent betrayed their artist

453
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,709
for the sake of the company.

454
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:37,347
You arranged for my mom to be on the show.

455
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:39,639
Those shareholders made you do it, right?

456
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,542
From your DUI to the assault incident,

457
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:49,792
the major shareholder has been threatening me

458
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:52,042
to hand the company over to someone else.

459
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,999
Even though I arranged Tang Mi to join the reality show,

460
00:29:55,042 --> 00:29:56,209
he still wasn't satisfied.

461
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:03,167
I had no choice but to go to your mom.

462
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:07,751
I know

463
00:30:09,626 --> 00:30:10,999
those are just excuses.

464
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:14,709
Did you ever consider that I might refuse to film?

465
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Of course I did.

466
00:30:17,918 --> 00:30:19,292
I warned the major shareholder,

467
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,417
but he didn't care at all.

468
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:24,042
He didn't mind sacrificing you.

469
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:28,751
He only cares about the traffic.

470
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:32,999
Well, they've succeeded.

471
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:34,751
Yes.

472
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,667
The buzz is building.

473
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:39,967
They're already discussing the second season.

474
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:44,083
So...

475
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:47,999
at least your company is safe, right?

476
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:54,834
The major shareholder called me this morning.

477
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:58,584
He said I have to take responsibility and hand over the company.

478
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:02,709
I guess

479
00:31:03,334 --> 00:31:05,534
he has been wanting to take over the company all along.

480
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:08,999
He has been using me.

481
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:17,918
Yinmo.

482
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:22,042
I've let you down.

483
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:29,000
I've taken all your honors

484
00:31:30,918 --> 00:31:31,999
for too long.

485
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:35,599
It's time to return them to their owner.

486
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:48,167
You can keep them.

487
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:49,292
I don't need them.

488
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:25,999
All right. Thank you.

489
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:27,042
That's all for now.

490
00:32:28,459 --> 00:32:29,542
Dawu.

491
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:30,959
Don't tell Nuonuo, okay?

492
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,834
Ms. Shuman, you're overreacting.

493
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:35,159
I was dealing with work stuff.

494
00:32:36,459 --> 00:32:37,250
Sorry.

495
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,375
I misunderstood.

496
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:40,334
Ms. Shuman.

497
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,792
Should we tell Hainuo about it?

498
00:32:42,918 --> 00:32:44,584
If we don't tell her,

499
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:45,998
she'll definitely scold me.

500
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:47,751
No. Don't tell her.

501
00:32:48,626 --> 00:32:51,375
It's just a stent for my heart.

502
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:53,998
Let her stay in Taipei without worrying.

503
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:55,399
We'll tell her when she comes back.

504
00:32:56,751 --> 00:32:58,584
I'm at ease with you around.

505
00:33:00,626 --> 00:33:01,626
Fine.

506
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,417
I really can't do anything about you.

507
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:04,918
Let's go back.

508
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:05,999
Let's go.

509
00:33:06,292 --> 00:33:07,292
Come on.

510
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:11,250
Where is this?

511
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:14,662
We've been walking forever since getting off the bus.

512
00:33:16,417 --> 00:33:18,792
I think the old man gave us the wrong address.

513
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:25,334
Looks like we're here.

514
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:27,292
We're here.

515
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:28,999
This is a construction site.

516
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:32,792
- Da. - Yes, sir.

517
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:34,083
Put these over here.

518
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:35,584
There are some more over there.

519
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:37,334
Use the cart to bring them over, okay?

520
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:38,584
Yes, sir.

521
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:25,667
Jingliang.

522
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:26,959
- Thank you. - Have some water.

523
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:27,876
No problem.

524
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:28,792
Rest for a while.

525
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:29,918
Okay.

526
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,999
Yueshan.

527
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:40,999
Have some water.

528
00:34:42,626 --> 00:34:45,083
Why didn't you let me know before coming over?

529
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:46,999
I could've taken leave earlier.

530
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:48,792
Never mind.

531
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:50,393
I'll ask the boss for a half day off.

532
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:53,998
Later, I'll take you and Jingliang out for a nice meal.

533
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:55,584
Give me a minute to apply for leave.

534
00:34:57,334 --> 00:34:58,959
Why didn't you go back home?

535
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,250
Did you forget about me and Grandma?

536
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,042
Of course I didn't.

537
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:23,792
How could I forget you?

538
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,918
Why aren't you working at the tea shop anymore?

539
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:35,250
Honestly, I'm not that into tea.

540
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:39,792
Moreover, after being around tea lovers for so long,

541
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:40,918
I got tired of it.

542
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:42,417
I'm exhausted.

543
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,751
This new environment is pretty good for me.

544
00:35:45,876 --> 00:35:48,167
My colleagues and friends here are all great.

545
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:50,834
We're happy every day

546
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:52,417
and time just flies by.

547
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:53,959
So don't worry, Yueshan.

548
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:55,375
I'm doing fine here.

549
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:56,667
I can handle it.

550
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:01,719
You should've told us that you changed jobs.

551
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:09,751
After all,

552
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:12,959
this isn't a respectable job

553
00:36:14,626 --> 00:36:17,000
and it doesn't pay much.

554
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:19,999
Yueshan, when you go back,

555
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,000
don't tell your grandma about it.

556
00:36:22,709 --> 00:36:23,709
Why not?

557
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:27,667
We're family. Why can't I tell her?

558
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:32,375
Why are you hiding things from us

559
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,667
just because of your pride or dignity?

560
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,999
I'm not a good father

561
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:47,167
or a good son.

562
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:51,334
I always said

563
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,125
that I'd bring you to Taipei to live with me

564
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,690
since you were in elementary school.

565
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:58,999
And look, you're grown up now.

566
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
You're in high school.

567
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:06,999
I'm sorry.

568
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:11,834
Don't say sorry.

569
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:24,959
I'm almost done with high school.

570
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:30,254
When I go to college, I can get a part-time job.

571
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,042
I can take care of myself.

572
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,375
As for Grandma,

573
00:37:35,459 --> 00:37:37,792
she loves selling oysters at the market.

574
00:37:38,751 --> 00:37:40,584
She has many friends in Kinmen.

575
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:42,292
We're doing well,

576
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:47,459
but we feel like

577
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:50,125
the past few years

578
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,203
have been a bit regrettable.

579
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:57,292
We hardly get to see you

580
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:03,000
and we miss you a lot.

581
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,167
I miss you both too.

582
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:21,292
See what a mess I've made of myself?

583
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:30,209
Your grandma always told me

584
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,999
to stay grounded

585
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:35,584
and not to aim for instant success.

586
00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:38,959
But I was too greedy.

587
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,999
When people told me

588
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:43,547
investing in the tea business would make money,

589
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:44,709
I went all in.

590
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:46,999
In the end, I didn't earn a penny.

591
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,751
Instead, I lost all my savings and ended up in debt.

592
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:53,626
I...

593
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:56,999
I'm too ashamed to go back and face everyone.

594
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:08,459
Yueshan.

595
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:19,999
Dad, are you building a community here?

596
00:39:23,918 --> 00:39:24,918
Yes.

597
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,542
There seems to be a swimming pool

598
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,751
and a reading room.

599
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,667
There's even a place for karaoke.

600
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:50,352
The rooftop seems perfect for barbecues

601
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:53,292
and there's a garden

602
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:55,999
and a fish pond as well.

603
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:58,999
I'm sure a lot of people will move in.

604
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,167
My dad

605
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:10,751
builds warm homes for families.

606
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:14,417
I'm proud of him.

607
00:40:46,417 --> 00:40:47,417
Yueshan.

608
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:52,876
From now on,

609
00:40:55,334 --> 00:40:56,999
I'll work hard and stay grounded.

610
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,500
I'll work hard

611
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,125
to pay off the debts

612
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,500
from my tea business investment

613
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:07,167
and start over.

614
00:41:11,626 --> 00:41:12,626
I hope...

615
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:16,834
I hope that one day,

616
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,667
our family

617
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:25,542
can reunite

618
00:41:28,459 --> 00:41:29,751
and live together again.

619
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:36,542
We could have meals together,

620
00:41:37,709 --> 00:41:38,959
walk by the sea,

621
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:41,626
and share laughs,

622
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:46,042
just like other families.

623
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:48,459
That would be enough.

624
00:41:49,918 --> 00:41:50,918
Okay.

625
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,334
That would be enough.

626
00:41:53,626 --> 00:41:54,626
Okay.

627
00:41:54,999 --> 00:41:56,709
Da, hurry up and get to work!

628
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,417
Okay, I'm coming.

629
00:42:03,042 --> 00:42:04,167
All right, Dad.

630
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:06,417
You go ahead and work.

631
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:08,751
I'll head back with Tsai Jingliang.

632
00:42:09,918 --> 00:42:10,918
Okay.

633
00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:11,999
Take care.

634
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:12,999
Okay.

635
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:20,834
I forgot something.

636
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,500
What is it?

637
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:36,542
You can do it, Dad.

638
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:41,834
I'll do my best in Kinmen too.

639
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:43,459
Okay, I'll do my best.

640
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:47,584
Take care of yourself, okay?

641
00:42:51,459 --> 00:42:52,999
If there's anything, let me know.

642
00:42:57,999 --> 00:42:58,999
Bye.

643
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,083
Take care of yourself.

644
00:43:00,999 --> 00:43:01,999
Stay safe on the way.

645
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,083
Bye, Mr. Wang.

646
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,209
Bye.

647
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:07,992
Let me know when you get home.

648
00:43:08,999 --> 00:43:09,876
Okay.

649
00:43:09,999 --> 00:43:10,999
Bye.

650
00:43:20,751 --> 00:43:21,918
Youtsai.

651
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,542
Has Jingliang contacted you?

652
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:24,459
No.

653
00:43:24,584 --> 00:43:25,959
He's with Yueshan.

654
00:43:25,999 --> 00:43:27,476
If he contacts me, it would be betraying her.

655
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,292
He wouldn't dare.

656
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:29,584
You know him well.

657
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:32,500
There's something I've been meaning to discuss with you.

658
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:34,292
Look.

659
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:36,876
The illustrations in this book

660
00:43:36,999 --> 00:43:39,998
may look a bit immature in terms of technique,

661
00:43:39,999 --> 00:43:42,584
but look at the elements they feature.

662
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:44,667
I think they resemble your style.

663
00:43:45,584 --> 00:43:46,918
As far as I know,

664
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,125
these were drawn by a teenage girl.

665
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,918
The author of this book,

666
00:43:50,999 --> 00:43:51,999
Mr. Ouyang Guangsyong,

667
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,959
really liked her artwork,

668
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:55,119
so he collected many of them

669
00:43:55,209 --> 00:43:57,169
and decided to use them when publishing the book.

670
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,420
These are all drawings I made when I was little.

671
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:04,667
Really?

672
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,125
Did you know your drawings were being collected?

673
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:10,167
I had no idea.

674
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:14,000
The man you mentioned

675
00:44:14,709 --> 00:44:15,709
is my grandpa.
