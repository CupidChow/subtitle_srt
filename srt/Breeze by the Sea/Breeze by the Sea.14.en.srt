1
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:11,751
You are like the sea

2
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:14,999
Every single day

3
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:18,999
You keep waiting

4
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:21,500
No matter if I come or not

5
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:23,959
A sudden gust of wind

6
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:28,125
Messed up my hairstyle

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,792
But it brought us together

8
00:00:31,918 --> 00:00:37,999
Only then did I discover how much I love who I am

9
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:40,998
Only you

10
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,584
Remind me of myself

11
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:47,959
The one who used to love smiling

12
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:50,998
Why did I lose my smile?

13
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:53,584
Unable to find a way out

14
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:56,876
I stand by the sea, feeling the breeze

15
00:00:56,999 --> 00:00:59,083
Only you

16
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:05,709
Remind me of myself and what I desire

17
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:11,334
I've finally learned That after all my overthinking

18
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:12,667
What I want the most

19
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:16,999
Is to go to the seaside And feel the breeze with you

20
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:29,999
"BREEZE BY THE SEA"

21
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:37,459
It's ringing.

22
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:38,999
Yueshan is calling.

23
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,125
It stopped.

24
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:55,334
Ms. Siou'e.

25
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:58,542
Do you want Yueshan to never run away from home?

26
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:00,250
Of course.

27
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,059
Then you have to listen to me this time.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,999
In the past, we never missed a single call from the kids.

29
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:07,999
But let me tell you.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,542
If you pick up the call this time, you'll lose.

31
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:12,042
-It'd be endless. -But...

32
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:13,250
No buts.

33
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,500
I'm telling you.

34
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:16,167
Hainuo is with her.

35
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:19,999
I bet they'll be back by tomorrow at the latest.

36
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,375
Are you sure?

37
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:24,167
Hainuo promised me.

38
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:25,834
That's why I dare say this to you.

39
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:28,709
You should've told me earlier.

40
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:31,167
Ms. Siou'e.

41
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:33,209
The kids have all grown up.

42
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:35,959
Sometimes, we just have to trust them.

43
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:39,000
That way, our lives will be easier in the long run.

44
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:01,042
My dad didn't pick up either.

45
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:04,959
They're probably mad at us.

46
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,999
Yueshan, your master is back!

47
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:11,999
Is he back?

48
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:17,250
Okay. The family meeting starts now.

49
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:19,999
First, we finally have a gas stove.

50
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:23,500
Second,

51
00:03:23,626 --> 00:03:24,999
we have to thank Hainuo

52
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,417
for taking the paparazzi out for a spin.

53
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:37,000
It's time to take you guys for a spin.

54
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:51,999
Third,

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,167
I'd like to thank myself.

56
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:55,918
Today, I finally cleared things up with Lily.

57
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:58,144
From now on, we owe each other nothing.

58
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:02,667
Next, Yueshan?

59
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,209
Do I have to stand too?

60
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:05,918
No, kids can sit and talk.

61
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:10,999
First of all,

62
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,417
I want to thank Tsai Jingliang.

63
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:16,393
Thank you for spending the entire day with me

64
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:17,792
and helping me find my dad.

65
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:25,999
Today was the first time in my life

66
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,999
I've ever seen my dad cry.

67
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:32,042
I cried too.

68
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:37,999
I ended up finding him at a construction site.

69
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,209
He failed in his tea business investment

70
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,083
and is now in debt.

71
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,042
Now, he works hard every day to save money and pay off the debt.

72
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,209
Can kids stand up too?

73
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,500
I've always hoped

74
00:05:01,626 --> 00:05:03,209
my family could live together,

75
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:07,876
but my dad apologized to me today.

76
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,417
He also said

77
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:12,459
the debt

78
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:14,334
makes him too ashamed to face us.

79
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:18,709
Hearing that really broke my heart.

80
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:23,459
So I've decided

81
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:27,250
from now on, to live well,

82
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,998
cherish every day,

83
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:29,999
work hard,

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,999
earn money,

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,500
and help my dad repay his debt.

86
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,667
I've seen my dad, so...

87
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,167
Tsai Jingliang.

88
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,012
We'll head back to Kinmen tomorrow morning.

89
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:47,542
Tsai Jingliang.

90
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,083
What?

91
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:51,999
Thank you, Master.

92
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:53,751
Thank you, Hainuo.

93
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:55,584
Thank you for taking care of us.

94
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:56,999
Thank you, Yinmo.

95
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,209
Thank you, Hainuo.

96
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:02,876
Our Taipei trip

97
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:03,999
is a success!

98
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:15,918
Honestly,

99
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,334
after coming back and experiencing so much,

100
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:22,125
I've been wondering

101
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:25,292
whether I made the right decision

102
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:27,209
or...

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,042
if I should have stayed abroad instead.

104
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,999
I didn't expect you to have moments of doubt too.

105
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:37,334
When I was an intern,

106
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:39,250
I often missed my patients' veins

107
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,999
and got scolded by the head nurse.

108
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:46,083
I used to wonder if I was really cut out to be a nurse

109
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,690
or if I should just return and take over the family business.

110
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:51,626
That's why I think

111
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:54,417
sometimes it's best

112
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,667
to not overthink.

113
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:57,999
Don't you think so?

114
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:05,999
My big brother, Dawu

115
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,999
Your confession was so cool

116
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,584
I thought I'd have a sister-in-law

117
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,584
But I was wrong

118
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:25,500
"LIVE HOUSE"

119
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:18,417
Nothing happened.

120
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,083
My legs are numb.

121
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:32,834
Not him.

122
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:38,626
Thank you for staying here this whole time.

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,840
I spent two days training with my master and will be heading back soon.

124
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,918
Here are some simple dishes I made.

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Please enjoy them.

126
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:51,159
I forgot to introduce myself.

127
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,500
I'll be her manager soon.

128
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:56,862
We look forward to your guidance.

129
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:58,751
Thank you.

130
00:08:58,876 --> 00:09:00,459
Her cooking is really good.

131
00:09:00,584 --> 00:09:03,375
- This bento box is delicious. - Eat it while it's still warm.

132
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,751
It looks tasty, doesn't it?

133
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:05,999
Yes.

134
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,059
You want some too, right? I have one here for you.

135
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,727
- This is for you. - I'll eat it later. I'm not hungry.

136
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:10,959
-No worries. -Come on.

137
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:12,167
Here. Come on.

138
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:14,999
-Eat it. -The car is here.

139
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:17,999
We'll get going. Bye.

140
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,435
-Yueshan, this way, please. -Thank you.

141
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,459
Take care.

142
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,999
-Bye. -Bye.

143
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:26,999
Lawyer Lau.

144
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:30,584
Can you review the reality show contract again?

145
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:33,876
Because of me, the show has been canceled.

146
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,375
Can you evaluate the potential negative impacts?

147
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:39,999
Also, check the contract.

148
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:42,236
Let me know how much to compensate

149
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:44,167
and what terms they might propose.

150
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:46,279
This matter is really important.

151
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:47,999
Thank you.

152
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,250
I've made breakfast.

153
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,667
Do you want to have some?

154
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:16,792
Breakfast?

155
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:20,709
Dish arrangement.

156
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,250
So...

157
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,489
Well, I'm going to start eating.

158
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:35,876
How is it?

159
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:40,834
Surprisingly, it's pretty good.

160
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,080
But it's still not quite up to your grandma's level.

161
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,209
Obviously.

162
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:48,143
Have some confidence, will you?

163
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,834
I mean the portion is smaller than your grandma's.

164
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,999
Here are some notes the two brats left for you.

165
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:05,999
Master.

166
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:08,918
I'm not the type to practice a thousand moves.

167
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:10,584
I'm like you.

168
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:13,125
I'll practice one move a thousand times.

169
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:14,959
Please wait for me to grow up.

170
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:17,000
Please keep working hard too.

171
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:20,209
Yinmo.

172
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:23,294
I hope that when I grow up, I can become someone who takes care of others.

173
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:27,125
Today, both of them

174
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,500
took the early flight back to Kinmen.

175
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:34,999
Thank you for taking care and looking after them these days.

176
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,834
Thank you for breakfast.

177
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,417
This is soy milk.

178
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,167
You can dip the food in it to eat.

179
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:53,792
Do you know this is a sake cup?

180
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:55,459
I didn't know that.

181
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,375
You don't have much stuff here.

182
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,417
I couldn't even find chopsticks.

183
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:01,125
They're in the fourth drawer.

184
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:02,959
But it's okay.

185
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:06,999
"KINMEN AIRPORT"

186
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:22,167
Come on. Let's go.

187
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:24,792
Okay.

188
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,999
Tsai Jingliang, are you okay?

189
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,000
Should I get off and walk slowly?

190
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:50,334
Or should I ask Dawu

191
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:51,999
or Mr. Fushou to come pick us up?

192
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,999
No.

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,999
We've caused enough trouble for everyone.

194
00:12:55,626 --> 00:12:58,026
My dad and your grandma are on the other side of the bridge.

195
00:12:58,167 --> 00:12:59,876
This is my chance to prove I'm a real man.

196
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:02,918
Hold on tight.

197
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,125
Okay.

198
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:15,999
Come on, Tsai Jingliang. You can do it!

199
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:19,999
You can do it.

200
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,459
-You can do it! -I can do it!

201
00:13:32,876 --> 00:13:33,876
Keep going.

202
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:35,918
I can do it.

203
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:37,667
I can do it.

204
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:41,042
I can do it!

205
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:42,999
Tsai Jingliang, keep going!

206
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:45,500
I can do it!

207
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:51,999
Keep going!

208
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:14,999
Yueshan will be home soon. Don't worry.

209
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:23,334
Grandma, I'm back.

210
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:26,959
Why didn't you answer my calls?

211
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,417
Don't you know Taipei is dangerous?

212
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:29,918
I could've been kidnapped.

213
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:33,417
What happened to your face?

214
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,083
Have you seen a doctor?

215
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:39,542
I'll call Dawu.

216
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,626
No need. He had already come to check on me.

217
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:44,834
Then why didn't anyone tell me you were hurt?

218
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:46,998
What's the point of telling you?

219
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,959
You don't even want to stay in this house.

220
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:50,959
How I am is none of your business.

221
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:52,834
Pack up your things

222
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:53,999
and go live in Taipei.

223
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,250
I'll go live with Shuman.

224
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:58,442
Not having to take care of you makes my life so much easier.

225
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:02,167
I only said I'd go to Taipei for a short time.

226
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:03,999
It's not that I'd live there.

227
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:07,125
Haven't you always wanted to live with your dad?

228
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,890
You went to find him in Taipei this time.

229
00:15:08,918 --> 00:15:10,459
Why didn't he make you stay?

230
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:15,999
My dad...

231
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:20,042
He's too busy

232
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,834
to take care of me.

233
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:24,834
I can't take care of you either.

234
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:25,751
I'm old.

235
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:26,876
I'm tired.

236
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:32,834
You're not old.

237
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:34,999
You're still young.

238
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:36,667
Right?

239
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:39,999
As I said before,

240
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:42,036
since my dad isn't in Kinmen,

241
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,250
I'll take care of you.

242
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:44,959
Okay?

243
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:49,584
Take it easy and rest if you're injured.

244
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:53,584
I'll go change into my uniform.

245
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:54,834
I still have class later.

246
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:13,792
Dad!

247
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,250
Dad!

248
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Dad!

249
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:19,959
Dad.

250
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:21,876
Dad.

251
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:26,626
You're back.

252
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:27,999
Dad.

253
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,209
I'm back.

254
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:30,414
It's good that you're back.

255
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,709
Why are you shaking so much?

256
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:34,999
Come on. Sit down.

257
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,042
It hurts.

258
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:36,999
Sit down.

259
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:37,999
What's wrong?

260
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,999
-What happened? Why... -I have a cramp.

261
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,959
Come on. Let me help you.

262
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:44,209
-Not my calf. It's my thigh. -Your thigh?

263
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:45,334
My thigh.

264
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:53,751
Are you feeling better?

265
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:54,918
Yes.

266
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:57,334
Drink some sports drinks to replenish electrolytes,

267
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:58,999
so you don't cramp up later.

268
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:06,999
Does it still hurt?

269
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,375
No, it doesn't anymore.

270
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,100
Do you want to stand up and move around?

271
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:16,584
-Can you walk? -Yes.

272
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:18,083
-Are you sure? -Yes.

273
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:20,083
Good. It's still early.

274
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:21,998
You should still make it to the third class.

275
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:22,999
Off to school now.

276
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:25,626
Also,

277
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:27,542
I'll deduct the 2,000 dollars you took

278
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:29,000
from your allowance.

279
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:30,999
All right.

280
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,500
What are you still doing here?

281
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:34,999
Go change and head to school.

282
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,042
Hello?

283
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:00,709
Dawu.

284
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,167
Yes?

285
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,507
At that time, Mr. Ouyang had already started showing signs of dementia.

286
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:09,074
I accompanied him to see his daughter off one last time.

287
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:11,334
His biggest regret was

288
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:13,083
that his granddaughter wasn't there.

289
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:17,559
We spent a lot of time looking for you, but we couldn't find you.

290
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:20,375
Luckily, you showed up in the end.

291
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:07,834
I finally found you.

292
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:25,459
Do you still remember me?

293
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:30,417
I'm Manman.

294
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:41,999
I thought you hated me.

295
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,999
You hated me for not coming home.

296
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:51,429
You hated me for not taking care of my mom.

297
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:55,876
You even

298
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:59,500
didn't tell me when my mom passed away.

299
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,334
I never thought

300
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,459
that you would keep my drawings.

301
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:13,667
Do you know?

302
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:17,751
Those are some of my most precious memories.

303
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:22,959
Grandpa.

304
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:26,999
I'm sorry.

305
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,626
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

306
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:39,500
Manman.

307
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,292
I'll take you to buy some colored pens.

308
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:52,334
Don't tell your mom.

309
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:55,083
Colored pens...

310
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:56,959
Grandpa.

311
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:02,584
Okay, I won't tell my mom.

312
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:07,626
Manman.

313
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:13,999
Take me to buy colored pens, Grandpa.

314
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,959
I won't tell my mom.

315
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:40,042
Thank you.

316
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:55,918
So the Manman that he always talked about

317
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,751
is Syu Man.

318
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:02,918
Syu Man was Mr. Ouyang's most beautiful memory

319
00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:04,083
after his dementia started.

320
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:06,999
Yes.

321
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Do you want to lie down and rest for a bit?

322
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,959
Okay, I'll sit here with you for a while.

323
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,250
I checked this morning.

324
00:23:30,334 --> 00:23:31,459
There's only one car left.

325
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,140
There must be more important news, right?

326
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,792
But the matter hasn't blown over yet.

327
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:40,375
That's why I'm meeting someone important today.

328
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:44,000
It concerns my reputation, my integrity, and my future.

329
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:45,834
That serious?

330
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,918
Will you come with me?

331
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:52,999
Sure.

332
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:56,439
Let me think about how to get there.

333
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:12,042
Why did he come here?

334
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:13,685
He wandered outside for so long.

335
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:15,417
Don't tell me he's here to buy something.

336
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,542
Did you see the car?

337
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:30,999
Not here.

338
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,250
Nothing on my side either.

339
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,334
Let's go up one more level.

340
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:42,667
It's there.

341
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:12,527
Sir, let's head to the next place.

342
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:14,334
To No.103, Section 4, Xinyi Road.

343
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:15,459
Okay, no problem.

344
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:16,999
Why are we going there?

345
00:26:17,584 --> 00:26:18,709
You'll find out soon.

346
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:20,292
Let's go.

347
00:26:44,918 --> 00:26:45,998
Damn!

348
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:47,375
He got away.

349
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,167
Why are you being so mysterious?

350
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,792
Is it okay for me to be here?

351
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:09,292
It's fine.

352
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:22,626
Is the guitar tuned?

353
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,500
Hi, nice to meet you.

354
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:26,626
I'm David Wong.

355
00:27:29,209 --> 00:27:30,209
Hello, David.

356
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,999
-Hello. -She's Li Hainuo.

357
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,626
-Hi. -Hi.

358
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,999
You're my parent's favorite singer.

359
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:41,709
It's my honor.

360
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,959
I never expected to meet you in person.

361
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:47,000
I grew up listening to your songs.

362
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,500
I don't know what to say.

363
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,106
-Calm down and speak properly. -Okay.

364
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:53,125
I heard from Yinmo

365
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,998
about the story of you, your parents, and your grandma.

366
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:57,417
I was really touched.

367
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,125
This time, even before he asked,

368
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,999
I insisted on

369
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,250
meeting you.

370
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:03,999
Thank you.

371
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,334
I don't know what to say.

372
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,292
You should thank Yinmo.

373
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:08,792
Thank you, David.

374
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:10,667
Thank you.

375
00:28:12,918 --> 00:28:15,292
This song is dedicated to you,

376
00:28:15,584 --> 00:28:17,876
your parents, and your grandma.

377
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:32,167
When you miss me

378
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,792
Don't think that I'm not missing you

379
00:28:41,626 --> 00:28:47,584
When you forget me

380
00:28:48,876 --> 00:28:52,125
Don't think that I've forgotten you

381
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,999
Whether I stay or go

382
00:28:56,999 --> 00:29:03,167
Love always holds onto your sorrows

383
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:10,999
Love spreads your hands wide

384
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,999
Riding the wind

385
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:19,834
Riding the wind

386
00:29:20,751 --> 00:29:24,000
In the wind, I think of you

387
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:27,918
In the wind, I see you

388
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:31,292
Riding the wind

389
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:35,834
Riding the wind

390
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:39,999
I can get close to your face

391
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:43,209
I can feel you...

392
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:45,999
Thank you so much for today.

393
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:49,999
I've fulfilled my biggest wish for returning to Kinmen.

394
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
You're welcome.

395
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,083
Syu Man.

396
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:03,999
Don't worry.

397
00:30:04,626 --> 00:30:05,709
I believe

398
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:07,500
your grandpa will remember you one day.

399
00:30:10,584 --> 00:30:12,000
In his memory,

400
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:13,751
Manman is still a little girl.

401
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:16,209
He doesn't need to remember me.

402
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:19,125
I just want him to be well

403
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:21,000
and know that

404
00:30:21,584 --> 00:30:24,999
the granddaughter he remembers still cares for him deeply.

405
00:30:25,584 --> 00:30:26,584
That's all that matters.

406
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,626
When did you start preparing all this?

407
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:40,999
I got the idea last night when I made a call.

408
00:30:42,751 --> 00:30:43,999
-No way. -For real.

409
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:47,159
What about the cassette tape?

410
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:51,999
The cassette tape took a little longer.

411
00:30:54,999 --> 00:30:56,999
Do you remember I knocked on your door one night?

412
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:00,518
Because you were playing your music so loud

413
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:01,999
that all of Kinmen could hear it.

414
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:04,375
-It wasn't that loud. -It was.

415
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:06,560
When I walked into your room,

416
00:31:06,584 --> 00:31:08,999
I saw a photo of you and your grandma on the wall

417
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:11,209
and I said you were cuter as a kid.

418
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,542
Then I walked over to the cabinet on the right.

419
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,999
There were a few books about Kinmen.

420
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:19,998
In the next cabinet,

421
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:21,998
I saw your painting supplies,

422
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:26,000
like watercolors and pastels and some of your artwork.

423
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,792
How can you remember all that?

424
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:30,459
I often have to keep track of lots of scenes

425
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:32,264
and continuity issues while filming, so...

426
00:31:32,918 --> 00:31:33,999
Then next,

427
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:35,292
I walked to your desk

428
00:31:36,918 --> 00:31:38,083
and saw your computer.

429
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:39,999
Beside it was that cassette tape.

430
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,999
So you randomly barged into my room that day just for that tape?

431
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,999
You could say that.

432
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:56,042
But not entirely.

433
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:58,918
Then what was it?

434
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:05,125
Why did you do all this for me?

435
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:11,999
Isn't doing something for someone you like

436
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:13,667
perfectly reasonable?

437
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,876
So you liked me back then?

438
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,250
Not at that time.

439
00:32:21,626 --> 00:32:22,751
But now...

440
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,334
I do.

441
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,959
So are you confessing now?

442
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
Yes.

443
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:02,999
Aren't you supposed to ask before kissing?

444
00:33:03,626 --> 00:33:04,626
What?

445
00:33:06,292 --> 00:33:07,292
Can I do it now?

446
00:33:08,876 --> 00:33:10,375
Is this the right moment to ask?

447
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:44,918
Ms. Shuman.

448
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:46,999
Ms. Shuman, I'm here.

449
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:48,999
Ms. Shuman.

450
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,542
Ms. Shuman.

451
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:58,167
Ms. Shuman!

452
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:00,500
Hello, this is the fire department.

453
00:34:00,626 --> 00:34:02,584
This is No.82, Tachian Road, Sea Breeze Village.

454
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,459
A 75-year-old woman has collapsed.

455
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:05,935
She is currently unconscious.

456
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:07,018
She has a history of cardiovascular issues.

457
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:08,542
Please send an ambulance right away.

458
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:10,999
Transfer to Taipei if necessary.

459
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:28,667
Are you sure you don't need my help?

460
00:34:29,876 --> 00:34:31,626
I want to learn how to cook for you.

461
00:34:32,459 --> 00:34:33,459
That's so cheesy.

462
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:35,083
Don't you like it?

463
00:34:36,209 --> 00:34:37,459
It's not bad.

464
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,998
When I've learned how to do it,

465
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:41,584
I'll cook every meal for you.

466
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:44,209
You promise?

467
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:46,626
Well, I'll be counting on you from now on.

468
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:49,114
I guess that's how it should be.

469
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:00,626
Hello, Dawu. What's up?

470
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,417
How is my grandma?

471
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:34,334
She had a heart attack.

472
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:35,959
They're performing surgery on her.

473
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:37,999
Don't worry.

474
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:40,403
I got there as soon as I could and administered first aid.

475
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:41,500
She'll be okay.

476
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:24,751
Let's go.

477
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,918
Grandma, what's wrong?

478
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:38,751
I'm fine.

479
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:41,125
Perhaps Yinmo's departure

480
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:43,792
made my heart ache for a moment.

481
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:46,584
Isn't heartache something you should get checked at the hospital?

482
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:48,042
No, I'm fine.

483
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:49,626
-Are you sure? -Yes.

484
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,292
You can eat it yourself,

485
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:54,459
or if you're passing by later,

486
00:36:54,584 --> 00:36:55,876
you can give it to him.

487
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,250
I'll get busy.

488
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,667
Grandma, are you feeling unwell?

489
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:08,500
I'm fine.

490
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:12,500
Nuonuo.

491
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:14,999
There's no need to rush back this time.

492
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:16,999
Dawu will take care of me.

493
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:19,876
You just stay with Yinmo.

494
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:35,834
Are you Lyu Shuman's family?

495
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:37,792
-Yes. -She's out of danger now,

496
00:37:37,918 --> 00:37:39,185
but she still needs to stay for observation.

497
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:40,834
Okay, thank you.

498
00:37:57,459 --> 00:37:59,299
Don't worry. Your grandma is going to be okay.

499
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,167
Right.

500
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,167
The surgery went well.

501
00:38:04,292 --> 00:38:06,852
Now we just have to wait for her to wake up from the anesthesia.

502
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:10,918
I'll call my parents.

503
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,999
I never noticed

504
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,125
how unwell my grandma was.

505
00:38:40,334 --> 00:38:41,999
If Dawu hadn't been there,

506
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:45,876
if she had passed away,

507
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:51,667
I wouldn't be able to forgive myself.

508
00:39:00,167 --> 00:39:01,584
I'll help take care of her too.

509
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:14,679
You probably have more important things to take care of, don't you?

510
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:17,999
There's nothing you can do to help here.

511
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:22,459
Can you guarantee that

512
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:25,719
reporters won't follow you to the hospital?

513
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:40,999
I need some time to cool down.

514
00:39:43,709 --> 00:39:44,834
You should go back first.

515
00:40:12,626 --> 00:40:13,999
I just want to be alone now.

516
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:29,167
Okay, thank you.

517
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:30,584
-How is she? -She's all right.

518
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:33,542
Thank goodness.

519
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:34,998
Thank goodness.

520
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:36,375
Thank goodness.

521
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:38,999
Everything will be fine.

522
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:48,667
Hainuo asked me to leave.

523
00:41:55,584 --> 00:41:57,209
I really can't do anything to help.

524
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:01,417
She said that because she's scared.

525
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,959
When she graduated from college,

526
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:07,199
she was supposed to stay in Taipei for graduate school.

527
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,834
However, her grandma was diagnosed with stage one cancer

528
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:14,998
at that time.

529
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,667
Hainuo was so frightened

530
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:18,876
that she gave up her studies and returned to Kinmen.

531
00:42:19,918 --> 00:42:21,758
Thankfully, her grandma's treatment went well.

532
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:22,999
It has been eight years

533
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:24,584
without any recurrence.

534
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:28,584
Hainuo only got back in touch with me

535
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:31,039
because she was worried about her grandma's health.

536
00:42:38,459 --> 00:42:39,751
My grandma is very stubborn.

537
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:44,709
She always says that seeing a doctor will make you sick even if you're not.

538
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:46,639
So she refuses to go back for a check-up.

539
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:50,751
Old people are like that.

540
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,375
She's not the only one.

541
00:42:53,876 --> 00:42:54,876
Dawu.

542
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,417
No matter what methods you use,

543
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:02,542
please make sure my grandma goes for her check-ups.

544
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,334
That's why I came back this time.

545
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:07,459
Leave it to me.

546
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,540
Lately, I've been taking her grandma to the doctor.

547
00:43:30,292 --> 00:43:31,999
Her condition has been getting worse,

548
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:36,999
but she doesn't let me tell Hainuo about it.

549
00:43:37,999 --> 00:43:40,167
Neither of them wants the other to worry.
