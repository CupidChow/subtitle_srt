22
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,250
Today, our village is hosting

23
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,999
many important guests, including a superstar.

24
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:59,709
Since the reality show will be live-streamed,

25
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:03,375
we kindly ask the locals

26
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:06,959
to stay indoors unless necessary

27
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,792
and to avoid interfering with the filming.

28
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:14,167
Let's make sure they have a good impression of us.

29
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,175
That's all for now.

30
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:21,577

38
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:45,375
Yin Mo must have some real talent

39
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,292
to get where he is today.

40
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,999
Don't worry, he'll make it through.

41
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:52,342
You're the one who's worried.

42

Now that the guest has left,

00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:36,537
the reunion doesn't seem that important anymore.

54
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:37,634
Do you want me to find an excuse for you?

55
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,417
No, I already promised them.

56
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:42,042
And I said I'd go with you.

57
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:46,542
I'm the one they want to see, not you.

58
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,375
That's true.

59
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,443
But still,

00:03:49,443 --> 00:03:52,509
I have to escort you, the school belle, okay?

61
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,999
Do you want to see the wish I wrote in high school?

62
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:01,377
- Now?
- Yes, do you want to?

63
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:02,626
No need. I already know.

Of course not.

00:04:17,243 --> 00:04:18,553
I've completed the task.

70
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:21,009
You promised I could be your assistant.

71
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:24,535
Why don't you let me try interning for the reality show over the next few days?

72
00:04:24,535 --> 00:04:26,337
If I do well,

73
00:04:26,337 --> 00:04:27,476
then afterward...

74
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,834
No.

75
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:30,141
I'll definitely do well.

76
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:32,210
I want to be your disciple.

77
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,999
I need a strict and comprehensive training program right now.

78
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:37,542
Even if it's tough, that's fine.

79
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:39,125
I can endure hardships.

80
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,610
For me, if it's something I don't like,

81
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,999
I don't even need one chance.

82
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:45,379
But if it's something I love, I want a hundred chances.

83
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:46,500
It's okay if I fail.

84
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,217
I can try a thousand times

85
00:04:48,217 --> 00:04:51,009

- Sit.

94

Give it to him.

95
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,125
Enter my number.

96
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,626
If you bother me, I'll block you.

97
00:05:24,626 --> 00:05:27,592
Then you can go find another mentor.

- Yes.

- Seriously.
- Hello?

- We're here.

- Hi.
- How slow. Da Wu is always the last to arrive.

104
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:53,285
- What a tardy king.
- Yes.

105

I'm not.

106
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:57,167
It has been a while.

107
00:05:57,167 --> 00:06:00,799
- I brought you the school belle.
- I have to take this call.

108
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,687
Hey, Dad.

109
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:06,250
Da Wu, I think I ate something bad.

110
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,918
The place where they're filming the reality show later

111
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:11,509
doesn't have a restroom.

112
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:13,594
Plus, I need to help some of the villagers

113
00:06:13,594 --> 00:06:15,118
with their live stream.

114
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:18,377
Could you go over and take care of everyone for me?

115
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,285
Go and check what they need, okay?

116
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:22,794
- Is it serious? Should I go home?
- No.

117
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:24,520
Well, I've already taken medicine.

118
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,083
As for Kai,

119
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,209
he can't make it because of something unexpected.

120
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:32,452
Could you ask Hai Nuo to step in and cover for him?

121
00:06:32,452 --> 00:06:34,560
We don't want the filming to be affected.

122
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay, I got it.

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,250
What's the matter?

124
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,801
We have to leave now.

125
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,083
Leave?

126
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:46,092
What about the reunion?

127
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:48,335
I just promised them I'd be there.

128
00:06:48,335 --> 00:06:50,718

Yes. What's wrong?

135
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:22,619
Please tell her that I'm back at the restaurant.

136
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:25,042
Tell her not to worry about me.

137
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:26,377
If you're worried about her,

138
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:27,912
why don't you contact her directly?

139
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:30,867
We agreed not to contact each other.

140
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:35,000
Once I pay back what I owe her, I'll change my number.

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,711
I won't bother her anymore.

142
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:39,384
I, Fang Shun Hua, keep my word.

143
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,967
Okay, whatever you like.

144
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,967
It doesn't matter if I'm not okay,

145
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:49,551
as long as she is.

146
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:56,999
Your call will be forwarded to voicemail.

147
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:58,375
Charges will apply after the beep.

148
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,103
If you don't wish to leave a message, please hang up.

149
00:08:01,103 --> 00:08:04,009
To leave a quick message, press the pound key after the beep.

150
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,433
I've transferred the money to your account in Taiwan.

151
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:09,687
Did you receive it?

152
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:13,167
Why haven't I heard from you in so long?

153
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:16,509
Please get back to me as soon as you hear this message.

154
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,502
For the past two years,

155
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:26,843
I've arranged so many auditions for you,

156
00:08:26,843 --> 00:08:29,226
but you never got selected.

157
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:30,967
Do you know why?

158
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:39,500
Maybe because I didn't fully understand the roles.

159
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,342
However, I really learned a lot from Yin Mo.

160
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:49,799
Are you sure you learned what you were supposed to?

161
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:57,384
Not everyone can appreciate works of art.

162
00:09:00,243 --> 00:09:03,800
I spent so much money on these two paintings.

163
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:08,509
Is it because they're beautiful or because I understand art?

164
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,577
Neither.

165
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:17,799
It's because the market assigns them value.

166
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,092
It's not just about the artwork.

167
00:09:22,243 --> 00:09:27,092
For actors, value is the most important thing.

168
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:32,428
Without popularity or recognition, they won't choose you.

169
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:35,834
With the rumor about you and Yin Mo,

170
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:39,669
you only landed a few magazine covers and some endorsements.

171
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:41,893
But that was all.

172
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:45,459
I arranged for you to make a cameo in a film starring Yin Mo,

173
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,434
you told me the director scolded you.

174
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:53,375
At that time, I really thought the role had a lot of depth,

175
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,434
- but the director...
- In other words,

176
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:58,999
the key is how to leverage fame to earn the director's respect

177
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,426
and win the favor of investors.

178
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:03,799
That's what really matters.

179
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:09,509
Okay.

180
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,678
I understand.

181
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,259
It's good that you understand.

182
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:20,474
Let's watch your rumored boyfriend on that reality show together.

183
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:22,867
Everyone, pay attention!

184
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:25,534
You all know today's main character

185
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:26,966
is notoriously difficult.

186
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:30,702
He hit a host before and even made a staff member cry.

187
00:10:30,702 --> 00:10:33,377
Each of you needs to be on high alert, okay?

188
00:10:33,377 --> 00:10:34,720
Everyone, smile.

189
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,259
Make him feel welcome. Got it?

190
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:44,301
Hello.

191
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:46,652
Where are the other celebrities?

192
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:47,693
Here's the thing.

193
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:51,285
The whole concept was built around Yin Mo's star power

194
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:52,693
and his high popularity.

195
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,160
After discussing with the director,

196
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,801
we decided it wasn't suitable to have other celebrities present.

197
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:58,678
We hope the audience will focus on

198
00:10:58,678 --> 00:11:01,334
the heartfelt and authentic experience

199
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:03,799
of a superstar living in Kinmen.

200
00:11:04,753 --> 00:11:06,799
Hey, Yin Mo. Hello.

201
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:11,584
They couldn't get other superstars to join, right?

202
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:13,184
- Well...
- This doesn't match the proposal.

203
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:15,268
- I'm not filming.
- Wait, listen to me.

204
00:11:15,268 --> 00:11:19,263
We found a lot of unique locals during the auditions.

205
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,687
We can arrange scenes

206
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:22,751
featuring highly interactive moments with you.

207
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:27,050
This will make it more personal and relatable.

208
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,834
With more non-celebrities,

209
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:34,209
people are less likely to suspect it's staged.

210
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:35,799
Right?

211
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:41,384
Listen to me.

212
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:15,250
You guys, step back, okay?

213
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,834
Step back. Don't get too close to the superstar.

214
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:20,697
- Step back.
- I came here for a break,

215
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:23,966
but you came back to give it your all

216
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:25,801
to rewrite your missed opportunities,

217
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:27,999
regrets, and compromises.

218
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:29,999
Thank you for the reminder.

219
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,125
I definitely won't let myself go through

220
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,469
your kind of three-stage journey.

221
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:37,243
Yin Mo, if you don't like them, we can reselect

222
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:38,786
until you're satisfied.

223
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:40,577
Then we can start filming...

224
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:42,125
Yin Mo.

225
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,639
You've found all the big shots in Kinmen.

226
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,925
- Let's start filming.
- The big shots in Kinmen...

227
00:12:51,711 --> 00:12:53,434
What's with these people?

228
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:54,933
We need to stay sharp today.

229
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:56,636
When he mentioned big shots in Kinmen,

230
00:12:56,636 --> 00:12:58,560
he was definitely being sarcastic.

231
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,592
Everyone, be careful.

232
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:03,652
Hey, I was so confused when I looked at the proposal just now.

233
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:06,377
I was wondering why it wasn't SUP or some other fun activity.

234
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:08,494
I wondered how I ended up being chosen.

235
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:11,485
There are so many cameras.

236
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:12,500
Hai Nuo.

237
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,125
I finally have a chance to be on camera.

238
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,476
Help me think about how to promote Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor.

239
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:18,386
Hey, handsome guy.

240
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:19,933
Are you the village chief's son?

241
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,375
- Yes, hello.
- Someone, help him clip on the mic.

242
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,061
I'm here to help, not to film.

243
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:25,077
It's okay.

244
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:27,626
Your appearance on the show is a big help.

245
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:29,344
- Help him clip on the mic.
- Sorry.

246
00:13:29,344 --> 00:13:33,050
Chen Da Wu, it's your time to shine.

247
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,626
- Dear villagers.
- It's your dad.

248
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:37,612
When the reality show starts in a bit,

249
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:39,250
we must do our best

250
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,017
to let the whole world see the beauty of Kinmen, okay?

251
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:43,636
Okay!

252
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:45,834
Dad, get down. It's embarrassing.

253
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,334
What's so embarrassing about it?

254
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:48,999
We're representing Sea Breeze Village.

255
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:50,335
It's not embarrassing at all, right?

256
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:51,619
Right!

257
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:53,718
Everyone, keep it up!

258
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:58,999
Yin Mo, for this net-pulling activity,

259
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,900
just pretend to pull hard later

260
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,250
and act like you're doing it, okay?

261
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,276
- Just act like I'm doing it?
- Yes.

262
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:07,426
Do you think I came here to slack off?

263
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:12,900
I told you he's difficult to deal with.

264
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,167
Everyone, get ready.

265
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:16,509
Prepare for self-introductions.

266
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:20,999
My name is Bai Yin Mo.

267
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:22,588
I'm an actor.

268
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:24,876
One more time. That wasn't good.

269
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:26,967
The dolly moved. One more time.

270
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:29,042
My name is Bai Yin Mo.

271
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:30,984
I'm an actor.

272
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:33,443
Yin Mo, that was perfect. You're very professional.

273
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:34,636
Please take a break.

274
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:37,384
Next. Thank you.

275
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:43,718
My name is Chen Da Wu. I'm a doctor.

276
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:48,384
My name is Li Hai Nuo. I run a guesthouse.

277
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,636
The best liquor in the world is Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor.

278
00:14:54,636 --> 00:14:56,527
Cut.

279
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:57,976
Just a self-introduction.

280
00:14:57,976 --> 00:14:59,577
Why are you advertising? Do it again.

281
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:02,999
Sorry.

282
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:03,999
My name is Cai You Cai.

283
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:05,834
I'm a writer.

284
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:08,546
Kinmen is a place rich in history and culture.

285
00:15:08,546 --> 00:15:09,792
Cut.

286
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:10,959
Just a self-introduction.

287
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,459
Okay.

288
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:14,577
My name is Wang Yue Shan.

289
00:15:14,577 --> 00:15:16,735
I'm a dancer.

290
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,834
Okay.

291
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,966
Cut.

292
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:20,966
Should I speak?

293
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:23,167
Only speak when the dolly stops, okay?

294
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:24,667
Sorry.

295
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,667
What did I eat?

296
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,999
Why do I have an upset stomach?

297
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:30,843
Is your stomach okay?

298
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:31,999
It's fine.

299
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,999
I got a bit too excited, so my stomach got excited, too.

300
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:36,445
- Is it still not working?
- No, it's not.

301
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:38,384
Let me do it.

302
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,334
- There you go.
- Hello, everyone. I'm Ms. Qin.

303
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:44,042
- We can watch it now.
- The new...

304
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:45,083
- Yes.
- Thank you.

305
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,626
- I also hope everyone can watch it.
- Hello, I'm Yan Ting.

306
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:49,292
- I'll go help the others.
- I'm...

307
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:50,459
Okay, go ahead.

308
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,250
My name is Guo En Bao.

309
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,759
I'm a student who returned from studying abroad.

310
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,052
Right now, our fishermen are casting the net.

311
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:05,042
They cast the net by circling along the shore

312
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:08,467
and the key is to trap all the fish near the coast

313
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,083
within the range of the net.

314
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,967
After that, the people onshore will pull the net up.

315
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:15,500
As you can see, our fishermen

316
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,125
have finished casting the net.

317
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:20,761
Next, we'll proceed with pulling the net.

318
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:24,042
- The near shore fish are all within the range we can catch.
- Good luck!

319
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:26,083
As you can see, those pulling the ropes,

320
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,259
we refer to them as shore men.

321
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:38,322
All right. Is everyone ready?

322
00:16:38,322 --> 00:16:40,300
Ready.

323
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:44,520
Pull it!

324
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,800
- Pull it!
- Pull it!

325
00:16:58,368 --> 00:17:00,695
Come on!

326
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:03,050
Pull it!

327
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,294
Along the net ropes,

328
00:17:04,294 --> 00:17:06,372
everyone takes turns taking the lead.

329
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:08,059
- There's always someone pulling
- Come on!

330
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:09,570
- the rope tight and stepping back.
- Come on!

331
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,984
This reflects the proverb,

332
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:12,834
"Pulling the net while walking backward."

333
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:13,852
Yue Shan fell!

334
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:14,868
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

335
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:15,868
I'm about to fall.

336
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,461
This is not just a fishing technique.

337
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:21,827
- It's also the ultimate symbol of teamwork.
- Come on!

338
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:25,250
- Come on!
- Come on!

339
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,946
- Pull!
- Come on. Put in some effort!

340
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,872
- Come on!
- Wait.

341
00:17:29,872 --> 00:17:31,390
Someone's slacking off!

342
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,652
Put in some effort!

343
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,999
- Come on!
- You can do it!

344
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:40,009
Pull!

345
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:53,327
Come on!

346
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:55,925
We caught the fish! Come on!

347
00:17:57,999 --> 00:17:59,426
Go!

348
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:02,718
We caught the fish!

349
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:04,955
We caught the fish!

350
00:18:04,955 --> 00:18:07,718
There are so many of them!

351
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:14,300
We caught the fish!

352
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,768
Why did I wear leather shoes?

353
00:18:45,768 --> 00:18:48,509
Being on a reality show isn't so bad.

354
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:50,047
It's my first time seeing Yin Mo

355
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:53,967
so relaxed and approachable.

356
00:18:56,728 --> 00:18:58,967
There are still haters criticizing him.

357
00:19:01,502 --> 00:19:04,195
As I said before,

358
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:07,300
not everyone understands works of art.

359
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:12,050
What the audience loves most

360
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,842
is still love stories.

361
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,834
Shun Hua.

362
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:23,842
Let me ask you something.

363
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:27,676
Is Zhi Ting short on money?

364
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:29,654
Not really.

365
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:31,035
She has saved up a sum of money for her retirement.

366
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:32,800
What's wrong?

367
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:40,300
She borrowed a million from me yesterday.

368
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:07,292
Cai Jing Liang, help me.

369
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:09,384
Wait for me.

370
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:18,342
Cheers.

371
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,002
Should we grill some more?

372
00:20:25,002 --> 00:20:27,092
Okay.

373
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,560
Listen. You've succeeded.

374
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,009
You didn't break down or...

375
00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:53,300
Someone helped me, so I could cram at the last minute.

376
00:21:06,777 --> 00:21:08,834
Let's take a selfie.

377
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,799
Da Wu.

378
00:21:11,626 --> 00:21:15,867
- One more.
- Does your heart ache?

379
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,111
What are you talking about?

380
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:21,999
It's okay. I'm here.

381
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:23,759
You got drunk without eating anything.

382
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,883
- It's okay.
- Are you drunk?

383
00:21:32,448 --> 00:21:34,527
Director, producer.

384
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:35,933
I have an idea.

385
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:37,438
Can I discuss it with you guys?

386
00:21:37,438 --> 00:21:38,843
Sure, go ahead.

387
00:21:38,843 --> 00:21:40,709
I thought of a segment

388
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:43,592
that might increase interaction among everyone.

389
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:47,467
In the past, this net-pulling activity

390
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:51,959
was a demonstration of mutual assistance and teamwork.

391
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:53,627
So, everyone who participated

392
00:21:53,627 --> 00:21:55,391
- would get a share of the catch.
- It's done.

393
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:56,966
This is where our local saying

394
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:59,012
"sharing the catch" comes from.

395
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:03,751
To make the sharing of the catch even more exciting,

396
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:06,584
later, we will have to give the food we grilled

397
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:09,660
to the person we like the most.

398
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,191
Before giving it, we need to say something heartfelt.

399
00:22:13,191 --> 00:22:15,467
Let me demonstrate first.

400
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:19,842
Hey, that's my fish.

401
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,728
Camera one, shoot Yin Mo.

402
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:27,999
Master, I'm giving my portion to you

403
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:31,542
because you're my mentor!

404
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:32,542
Lower your voice.

405
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:35,467
The boom man's ears might get ruined.

406
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:40,250
Today is really meaningful

407
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,217
because it's our first time recording a show together.

408
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:49,999
From now on, I've got your back, Master.

409
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:51,799
Yes.

410
00:22:54,584 --> 00:22:55,500
My turn.

411
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,579
I have something to say, too.

412
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:01,999
I want to give my portion of food

413
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:03,799
to my son.

414
00:23:05,544 --> 00:23:07,799
What are you doing?

415
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,209
Seafood without a fishy smell

416
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:12,665
and lamb without its distinct odor

417
00:23:12,665 --> 00:23:14,537
lose their original flavor

418
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:16,592
and thus lose their deliciousness.

419
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:21,643
Life can't always be perfect.

420
00:23:21,643 --> 00:23:25,083
This is something I only learned after becoming a father.

421
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:29,125
You've made me into a warrior in life.

422
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,000
Despite the wounds along the way,

423
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,417
these healing scars have become

424
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:36,867
the medals of my fatherhood.

425
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:38,259
Here.

426
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:44,592
I'm really happy that you were born to be my son.

427
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:48,967
It's so touching.

428
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,134
All right.

429
00:24:02,302 --> 00:24:04,209
All right.

430
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,224
Are you done?

431
00:24:05,224 --> 00:24:06,292
What a pity.

432
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:10,110
You missed You Cai's touching confession.

433
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,500
What did he say?

434
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,702
I'll tell you later.

435
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,250
It's almost our son's turn.

436
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,417
Who's next?

437
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:18,417
Jing Liang, it's your turn.

438
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,751
Jing Liang.

439
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,342
All right.

440
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:28,259
- Yue Shan.
- Stop drinking. You've had too much.

441
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:32,759
I have something to say!

442
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:36,999
What do you want to say? It's Jing Liang's turn.

443
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:40,999
I also want to share with everyone

444
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:46,092
who I'm giving my harvest to today.

445
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:50,417
It's not you. You're still too young.

446
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:52,584
- You're not grown up yet.
- Why is she here?

447
00:24:52,584 --> 00:24:55,999
- Yue Shan.
- Take her away.

448
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:57,176
Don't do this.

449
00:24:57,176 --> 00:24:58,459
This doesn't look good.

450
00:24:58,459 --> 00:25:00,050
Okay.

451
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:04,672
Since Mr. Bai is here today,

452
00:25:04,672 --> 00:25:09,926
I need you to evaluate my acting skills.

453
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:17,570
- Okay.
- Let me tell you all a romantic fairy tale.

454
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,104
Once upon a time in Kinmen,

455
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:22,669
there was a tall and handsome prince

456
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:26,751
who was skilled in both literature and martial arts.

457
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:30,500
There was also a lively, lovely,

458
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,867
and kind princess who grew up with him.

459
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,037
Why is she talking about this?

460
00:25:35,037 --> 00:25:37,300
The two of them...

461
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:42,362
fell in love.

462
00:25:42,362 --> 00:25:47,059
Isn't this a very romantic first love story?

463
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:48,417
Rate it.

464
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:52,250
Mr. Bai Yin Mo, how much do you rate it?

465
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,999
It doesn't make sense.

466
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:55,999
- How can we rate it without an ending?
- That's right.

467
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:57,685
- I can't understand without a complete story. - I can't understand.

468
00:25:57,685 --> 00:26:00,751
Well, here's my honest feedback.

469
00:26:00,751 --> 00:26:02,800
It needs improvement.

470
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:05,834
All right. No problem.

471
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:08,627
Let me make the story a bit better.

472
00:26:08,627 --> 00:26:13,792
This story doesn't have a happy ending,

473
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:15,500
but...

474
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:21,292
it's okay.

475
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:31,136
Because fate has brought about a perfect moment.

476
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:35,794
And this is the very moment.

477
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,104
How much did you drink?

478
00:26:37,104 --> 00:26:38,834
- I don't understand.
- What do you mean?

479
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:42,537
Our prince... Who is it?

480
00:26:42,537 --> 00:26:44,342
The prince is...

481
00:26:47,494 --> 00:26:49,634
Chen Da Wu.

482
00:26:51,219 --> 00:26:53,358
- You're drunk.
- The princess is...

483
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:54,883
Cai Zhen.

484
00:26:57,544 --> 00:27:00,384
Li Hai Nuo.

485
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:05,438
- Our best male and female leads from Kinmen.
- Seriously?

486
00:27:05,438 --> 00:27:07,867
Come on.

487
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:10,421
Best actress, come on.

488
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,999
You two, together,

489
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:16,407
- Seriously?
- Write a perfect ending for this story.

490
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:22,999
- Be together!
- Be together!

491
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:24,528
Okay.

492
00:27:24,528 --> 00:27:25,709
Be together!

493
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:27,500
Everyone, stop instigating, please.

494
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,167
- Be together!
- That's right!

495
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,735
- Be together!
- Be together!

496
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,759
I'm the male lead.

497
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,209
Chen Da Wu.

498
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:41,634
I really was with Hai Nuo back then.

499
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:44,872
We didn't know that.

500
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,819
Even after all these years,

501
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:50,634
she's still the female lead in my heart.

502
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:56,083
This confession...

503
00:27:56,083 --> 00:28:00,092
Everyone, stop it. He's just joking.

504
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:01,876
Stop it.

505
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:03,967
Hai Nuo, I like you.

506
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:07,799
Will you be my girlfriend?

507
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:14,092
This is what the audience loves to see.

508
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,883
Producer, our viewership is skyrocketing.

509
00:28:18,626 --> 00:28:20,217
My goodness.

510
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:24,799
Now, the whole world knows.

511
00:28:25,876 --> 00:28:27,487
All right.

512
00:28:27,487 --> 00:28:31,639
For those who are still hungry, go eat.

513
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:33,056
Okay, that's enough.

514
00:28:33,056 --> 00:28:35,125
Stop instigating, okay?

515
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,799
Keep eating.

516
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:46,092
You grill the fish. I need to use the restroom.

517
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:02,799
Hai Nuo.

518
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,134
Hai Nuo.

519
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:11,676
That confession just now didn't scare you, did it?

520
00:29:13,276 --> 00:29:15,676
I'm fine. I'm just...

521
00:29:17,794 --> 00:29:19,901
I'm fine. I'm just a bit tired from the filming.

522
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:21,017
I'm going for a walk.

523
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:22,800
You go back first.

524
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,868
There's no one here now.

525
00:29:25,868 --> 00:29:29,626
I want to tell you what's on my mind.

526
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:35,050
Well, you might not know how much you've influenced me.

527
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,252
In fact, I became a doctor

528
00:29:38,252 --> 00:29:40,800
because of you.

529
00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:43,910
Back then, you suddenly told me you wanted to break up.

530
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:47,362
No, you didn't even tell me that.

531
00:29:47,362 --> 00:29:49,586
You just disappeared from my life.

532
00:29:49,586 --> 00:29:51,999
Even after we graduated and I went to Taipei,

533
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,300
I didn't know what had happened.

534
00:29:57,999 --> 00:30:01,528
Like you said, it was a high school thing.

535
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:03,368
I've long forgotten about it.

536
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,893
The past is in the past.

537
00:30:05,893 --> 00:30:08,434
Let's not talk about it anymore.

538
00:30:08,434 --> 00:30:10,669
Fine.

539
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:12,753
Let's talk about what just happened.

540
00:30:12,753 --> 00:30:15,351
This time, don't give me an answer so quickly.

541
00:30:15,351 --> 00:30:19,217
At least give me a chance to try hard and fight for it.

542
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,131
Da Wu...

543
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:23,300
Don't rush to answer me.

544
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:34,417
Ms. Shu Man, I beg you.

545
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,410
Da Wu is going to be a doctor in the future.

546
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,667
He's smart and studies hard, right?

547
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:40,276
It must be that Hai Nuo liked him first.

548
00:30:40,276 --> 00:30:42,827
Are you saying that Nuo Nuo isn't well-behaved?

549
00:30:42,827 --> 00:30:45,176
I didn't mean that.

550
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,834
Nuo Nuo, you're back just in time.

551
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:48,226
Tell Mr. Fu Shou.

552
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:50,709
Are you and Chen Da Wu together?

553
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:52,933
Grandma, Mr. Fu Shou.

554
00:30:52,933 --> 00:30:54,209
Da Wu and I agreed

555
00:30:54,209 --> 00:30:55,544
that when we grow up, we'll go to Taipei together.

556
00:30:55,544 --> 00:30:57,527
We'll take care of each other.

557
00:30:57,527 --> 00:30:59,766
See? They are together.

558
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:04,360
Hai Nuo, Da Wu used to be the top student in school.

559
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,259
Now, his grades have plummeted.

560
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:09,631
If he continues like this, he won't be able to get into medical school.

561
00:31:09,631 --> 00:31:11,198
You're both too young.

562
00:31:11,198 --> 00:31:12,972
You can't be in a relationship. Do you understand?

563
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:15,834
This isn't a one-sided matter.

564
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:19,292
Ms. Shu Man, do you know how much effort we put into raising Da Wu?

565
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:21,103
If he doesn't get into medical school,

566
00:31:21,103 --> 00:31:24,083
all our past efforts will be wasted.

567
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:27,375
How about we have Da Wu come over and talk this through?

568
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:28,827
That's not possible.

569
00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:30,167
He's stubborn and hardheaded.

570
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:32,334
If you ask him here, he'll turn against me.

571
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:33,794
There might even be a family rebellion

572
00:31:33,794 --> 00:31:35,083
and in the end, he won't want to be a doctor anymore.

573
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,542
You...

574
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:40,235
Hai Nuo, do you really want to heartlessly ruin Da Wu's future?

575
00:31:40,235 --> 00:31:43,900
Fu Shou, you can't put all the pressure on Nuo Nuo.

576
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,292
That's unfair.

577
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:46,471
Ms. Shu Man, I'm begging you.

578
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:49,083
Hai Nuo, I'm begging you both.

579
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:51,709
Hai Nuo, you should be focusing on your studies.

580
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,083
Da Wu should be focusing on his studies, too.

581
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:54,834
That's the best thing you can do for him.

582
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:55,913
Do you understand?

583
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:58,000
Nuo Nuo.

584
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,999
Fu Shou, how could you...

585
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:03,092
I don't know what to do either!

586
00:32:26,885 --> 00:32:28,153
Here.

587
00:32:28,153 --> 00:32:30,217
Thank you, Grandma.

588
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:34,542
So? Did you end up going to the filming?

589
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:36,883
Were you worried about Yin Mo?

590
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:41,191
He did really well. We worried for nothing.

591
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:42,799
That's good.

592
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:46,959
It's delicious.

593
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:50,259
Eat more then. I cooked a lot.

594
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:58,925
I didn't expect the love charm from me would be so effective.

595
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:04,610
But one at a time would've been enough.

596
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,799
Why did two show up at once?

597
00:33:09,285 --> 00:33:11,801
Did you watch the live stream?

598
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:14,799
I heard what Da Wu said to you.

599
00:33:16,476 --> 00:33:21,799
I also noticed how Yin Mo looked at you before.

600
00:33:25,263 --> 00:33:30,426
I see everything that happens in this house.

601
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:41,459
Nuo Nuo, I know you're kindhearted.

602
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:43,509
You don't want to hurt others.

603
00:33:44,393 --> 00:33:46,309
Take your time to consider.

604
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:49,292
Your happiness is the most important.

605
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:54,718
Whatever decision you make, I will always support you.

606
00:33:57,193 --> 00:33:59,509
I know.

607
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:04,202
Who is it?

608
00:34:04,202 --> 00:34:06,509
Sit down. I'll go check.

609
00:34:19,926 --> 00:34:22,050
Who is it? It's so late...

610
00:34:23,403 --> 00:34:25,621
Cai Zhen, why are you lying here?

611
00:34:25,621 --> 00:34:27,008
Hai Nuo.

612
00:34:27,008 --> 00:34:29,302
You're drunk. Why didn't you go home?

613
00:34:29,302 --> 00:34:31,035
- Come on.
- Hai Nuo.

614
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:32,542
Okay, I'll take you home.

615
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:36,009
- Well...
- I came to check on you.

616
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:38,966
Let me ask you.

617
00:34:38,966 --> 00:34:42,676
Have you decided to accept Da Wu?

618
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:47,083
He looks so pitiful.

619
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:49,459
He's so devoted to you.

620
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:53,226
Watching from the side, I almost cried, you know?

621
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:55,768
Be careful.

622
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:58,999
Come on. I'll take you home first.

623
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:00,544
Let's go.

624
00:35:00,544 --> 00:35:04,751
Wait, there's something I want to ask you.

625
00:35:04,751 --> 00:35:06,634
Okay.

626
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,009
Do you like Bai Yin Mo, that superstar?

627
00:35:13,627 --> 00:35:14,910
I saw that you kept looking at him

628
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,287
during the filming today.

629
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:20,134
The two of you were exchanging glances.

630
00:35:21,318 --> 00:35:23,068
Let me tell you.

631
00:35:23,068 --> 00:35:26,660
Bai Yin Mo is a glamorous superstar.

632
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,834
Many women want to throw themselves at him.

633
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:33,801
Who knows how many girlfriends he has in Taipei?

634
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:37,627
Didn't he even have a scandal before?

635
00:35:37,627 --> 00:35:40,610
I'm worried you'll be deceived by him.

636
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,759
You'll get hurt if you invest your feelings.

637
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:49,083
All right. Let's talk about this tomorrow.

638
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:51,384
I'll take you back now. Come on.

639
00:35:52,626 --> 00:35:55,384
Hai Nuo, listen to me.

640
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,876
To Bai Yin Mo, all of us from Kinmen

641
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:07,059
are just passersby.

642
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:09,999
Passersby, do you understand?

643
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:13,351
Once everything is over, it's time to say goodbye.

644
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:17,300
It's time to say goodbye.

645
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,134
Is everything okay

646
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:51,217
between you and Da Wu?

647
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,999
After you and Da Wu left,

648
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:57,300
did you talk about anything else?

649
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:17,013
[Okay]

650
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:26,092
What do you mean by that?

651
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:44,184
Your spontaneous confession on today's live stream

652
00:37:44,184 --> 00:37:45,417
was impressive.

653
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:47,332
You're quite bold.

654
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:48,984
It's all right.

655
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:52,634
So, you had Hai Nuo draw horseshoe crabs on your medical car...

656
00:37:53,268 --> 00:37:55,900
The fact that you're asking this means you've already guessed it.

657
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,669
Horseshoe crabs are a symbol of couples.

658
00:37:57,669 --> 00:37:59,759
You were giving hints to her, right?

659
00:38:00,377 --> 00:38:03,735
Yes, but she didn't get it.

660
00:38:03,735 --> 00:38:05,842
That's why I said it outright today.

661
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,342
Good job.

662
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:26,792
Here's to your passionate heart.

663
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:28,759
Thank you.

664
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:37,426
This may burn out, but my heart won't.

665
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:45,259
The first round has just begun.

666
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:50,217
He handed the account over to me to manage.

667
00:38:51,544 --> 00:38:55,092
I saw that it made a lot of money.

668
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,627
So, I invested all of my money into it.

669
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,834
Miss, those profits you saw

670
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:02,834
were manipulated by the back end.

671
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:04,654
The app is fake.

672
00:39:04,654 --> 00:39:06,933
They can generate as much profit as they want.

673
00:39:06,933 --> 00:39:08,209
The money you transferred out

674
00:39:08,209 --> 00:39:10,384
will be very hard to get back.

675
00:39:24,801 --> 00:39:28,050
I've calculated the money you invested with me.

676
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,681
Give me your account details.

677
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:32,676
I'll transfer a portion of it to you tomorrow.

678
00:39:57,834 --> 00:40:00,000
Hey.

679
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,509
You don't need to transfer the money to me.

680
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:05,621
It's okay.

681
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:09,250
I took on the catering for a reality show and made some money.

682
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,867
Don't borrow from Hui Fang.

683
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,799
It wouldn't look good if word got out.

684
00:40:14,268 --> 00:40:16,999
Are you short on money recently?

685
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:19,042
No.

686
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:22,085
I was thinking if you're short on money,

687
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:25,000
I could just close up the restaurant and sell it.

688
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,083
I've been feeling really tired lately anyway.

689
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,799
No need.

690
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,867
It's not a big deal.

691
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:37,966
Money can always be earned again and the restaurant can be reopened, right?

692
00:40:37,966 --> 00:40:40,334
My boyfriend treats me very well.

693
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:43,066
We're moving to another place soon.

694
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,032
I see.

695
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,433
Don't look for me anymore.

696
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:48,967
I won't be in contact with you anymore.

697
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,728
If anyone asks about me,

698
00:40:55,728 --> 00:40:57,925
just tell them I'm doing great.

699
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:01,384
Why are you telling me this now?

700
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:14,999
Ms. Shu Man.

701
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:15,999
Are you making kimchi?

702
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:18,209
Yes, since there aren't many guests right now,

703
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,827
so I'm making some kimchi.

704
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:22,083
That way, it'll be ready when we need it.

705
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:23,101
Let me help you.

706
00:41:23,101 --> 00:41:24,799
No, it's okay.

707
00:41:27,209 --> 00:41:28,800
Ms. Shu Man.

708
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:35,101
Did you hear what Da Wu said on the show yesterday?

709
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:37,050
Yes, I did.

710
00:41:37,751 --> 00:41:40,375
Ms. Shu Man, would you be upset about it?

711
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,999
Why would I?

712
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:45,709
You're like a son to me and Da Wu is like my grandson.

713
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:47,676
Why would I be upset?

714
00:41:49,565 --> 00:41:52,999
However, fate is not something we can control.

715
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:54,584
You should just let it go.

716
00:41:54,584 --> 00:41:57,966
Let the young ones handle it themselves.

717
00:41:57,966 --> 00:42:00,347
Yes, you're right.

718
00:42:00,347 --> 00:42:02,375
I'll help you get online

719
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:04,291
- so that you can watch Hai Nuo on the show later.
- All right.

720
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:06,467
- Okay.
- Okay.

721
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,068
Hey, hurry and set up the camera.

722
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:16,933
Get that microphone ready.

723
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:19,753
The car will be here soon. Stay alert.

724
00:42:19,753 --> 00:42:21,819
Yesterday's confession on the live stream

725
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:24,131
really boosted the viewership.

726
00:42:24,131 --> 00:42:27,292
- That's great.
- I contacted the doctor and the drunk girl,

727
00:42:27,292 --> 00:42:29,131
but they refused to film again.

728
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:30,290
But don't worry.

729
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,999
I've got other plans.

730
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:33,083
For instance, today,

731
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,164
I've invited Bai Yin Mo's girlfriend

732
00:42:35,164 --> 00:42:37,209
as a surprise guest.

733
00:42:37,209 --> 00:42:40,593
This is their first time appearing together since their relationship was exposed.

734
00:42:40,593 --> 00:42:43,083
It's bound to generate a lot of buzz and attention.

735
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:45,560
Yes, that's a great arrangement.

736
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,224
Let me tell you.

737
00:42:47,224 --> 00:42:50,834
Bai Yin Mo is a glamorous superstar.

738
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:54,000
Many women want to throw themselves at him.

739
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,542
Who knows how many girlfriends he has in Taipei?

740
00:42:57,542 --> 00:43:02,753
To Bai Yin Mo, all of us from Kinmen

741
00:43:02,753 --> 00:43:05,999
- are just passersby.
- Hurry up.

742
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:06,999
They're here.

743
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:09,799
Once everything is over, it's time to say goodbye.

744
00:43:17,986 --> 00:43:19,209
Hello, Yin Mo.

745
00:43:19,209 --> 00:43:21,110
This way, please.

746
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:25,702
Yesterday's live stream had an amazing viewership.

747
00:43:25,702 --> 00:43:27,999
Your performance was flawless.

748
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:29,300
It's really...

749
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:34,900
Da Wu's confession to you yesterday was super cool.

750
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,167
- Are you going to say yes?
- Kids shouldn't ask so many questions.

751
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:40,867
Confessing on a live stream was really cool.

752
00:43:40,867 --> 00:43:43,125
It's hard to top a confession like that.

753
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:46,209
What? You aren't thinking of imitating it, are you?

754
00:43:46,209 --> 00:43:48,083
Why can't I imitate it?

755
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,050
I don't even like you.

756
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,799
Let's go.

757
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:58,250
This is where Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor is made and stored.

758
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,794
It used to be an oil depot with a long history.

759
00:44:00,794 --> 00:44:03,999
So, we've chosen this place as the filming location.

760
00:44:03,999 --> 00:44:07,050
Producer, our surprise guest has arrived.

761
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,634
Yin Mo.
