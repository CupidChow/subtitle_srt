No, let me take mine first.

That's for sure.

47
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:23,959
Village Chief, didn't you say that having the superstar here would help us?

48
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:25,834
I think your son, Da Wu, would be more helpful.

49
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:27,999
Da Wu staying in Kinmen would really help us.

50
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:29,292
No, you're too kind.

51
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:30,918
You can't compare that Da Wu with that superstar.

52
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,751
Luckily, I wasn't late.

53
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:33,918
No, you're just in time.

Sorry for squashing you so flat.

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:16,417
I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention while driving.

60
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:18,584
You got squished because of me.

00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:21,542
I shouldn't have grabbed your steering wheel.

I'm sorry.

63
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:24,834
No, it's my fault for not paying attention.

64
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:27,083
That's why you had to grab my steering wheel.

65
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,799
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:35,009
Are you apologizing to the gecko or the car now?

67
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:39,876
Why don't you apologize to the gecko

68
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:42,009
and I'll apologize to the car?

69
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:43,999
Okay.

70
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:45,792
Good.

71
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,467
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

72
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:53,375
All right. Let's call a tow truck now.

73
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,542
I'll do it. Aren't you in a rush?

74
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:57,584
Are you sure?

75
00:03:57,584 --> 00:04:00,032
Do I look unsure?

76
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,646
You step on the gas pedal and I'll push from behind.

77
00:04:02,646 --> 00:04:03,883
Okay.

78
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,042
But it's really deep.

79
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:07,459
I'm not even sure myself.

80
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:09,384
I'm certain.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,375
I guess so.

82
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,334
Good morning, everyone.

83
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:14,999
Good morning.

84
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,667
For today's medical seminar,

85
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:18,999
we have invited Dr. Chen Da Wu as our speaker.

86
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:21,334
Dr. Chen was born in Kinmen.

87
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:23,999
He went to elementary and middle school here.

88
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:27,250
After graduating at 18, he went to study in Taipei

89
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,542
and then furthered his studies in Canada.

90
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:32,549
He specialized in family medicine,

91
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:37,334
preventive medicine, geriatrics, and long-term care.

92
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:40,542
This year, he made a very important decision.

93
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:44,799
He decided to return to Kinmen to serve its people.

94
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:50,626
So, today, we've specially invited Dr. Chen

95
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:53,834
to share his work as a family physician.

96
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:56,606
Let's give a warm round of applause

97
00:04:56,606 --> 00:04:59,050
to welcome Dr. Chen Da Wu!

98
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:08,164
Hello, everyone.

99
00:05:08,164 --> 00:05:09,281
It has been a long time

100
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:11,731
since I've seen so many friends and family together.

101
00:05:11,731 --> 00:05:13,167
First of all, I'd like to thank everyone

102
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:16,339
for coming to my medical seminar.

103
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:18,799
My name is Chen Da Wu. Nice to meet everyone.

104
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:21,584
That's my son.

105
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:23,740
I gave birth to him.

106
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,782
My middle name, "Da," means "great."

107
00:05:27,782 --> 00:05:30,431
It represents my parents' expectations of me.

108
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:33,083
They want me to be generous and courageous.

109
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,431
However, I was a bit rebellious.

110
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:39,263
I didn't want to just be a famous doctor,

111
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:42,041
but a family physician who cares for people.

112
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,422
Anyone who comes to see me,

113
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:46,573
I won't see them as just a patient,

114
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:51,424
but as a person with a name, a life, and a story.

115
00:05:51,424 --> 00:05:54,467
That's why I wanted to become a family physician.

116
00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:04,263
Next, I'd like to share my medical experiences overseas.

117
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,050
- I'm stepping on it.
- Okay.

118
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:12,973
Stop.

119
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,799
- Can you do it?
- You...

120
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:17,032
Hold the brake and press the gas.

121
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:19,438
When the gas is fully pressed, release the brake.

122
00:06:19,438 --> 00:06:21,467
Okay, I'll try.

123
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,131
All right. One more time.

124
00:06:24,131 --> 00:06:26,365
Okay.

125
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,209
One, two, three.

126
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:30,164
One, two, three. Push!

127
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:31,966
One more time.

128
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:33,467
One, two, three.

129
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:37,098
One more time.

130
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:39,676
Okay, one, two, three.

131
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:47,131
Almost there. Keep going. Come on.

132
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:49,799
- All right. One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

133
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:52,842
Keep going. Come on.

134
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:58,679
Is that okay?

135
00:06:58,679 --> 00:06:59,909
One more time.

136
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:01,799
One, two, three, push!

137
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:05,372
It's moving.

138
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:07,134
One, two, three. Push!

139
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,587
Almost there!

140
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:14,359
Come on. Keep going.

141
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:15,525
Did you lift the tires?

142
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:16,859
Yes.

143
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:19,399
One more time. It's almost there!

144
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,692
In the future, whenever you feel unwell,

145
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,366
please feel free to consult your family physician.

146
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:27,525
Anytime, anywhere.

147
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:30,036
If there's anything I can help with,

148
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:32,525
I'll always be here.

149
00:07:32,525 --> 00:07:34,199
Thank you.

150
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,845
Gosh, that was fantastic.

151
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:41,751
Thank you, Dr. Chen Da Wu for the wonderful talk.

152
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:43,409
Great!

153
00:07:47,609 --> 00:07:49,333
Thank you.

154
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,823
- Can we take a photo?
- Sure, come on.

155
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,102
- Can we take a photo?
- Thank you very much.

156
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:56,569
Thank you.

157
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:57,810
I think you spoke better than me.

158
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,652
No, you're the better speaker.

159
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:01,234
Thank you, everyone.

160
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:02,478
I'm really happy you could come today.

161
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:04,276
- Thank you.
- Let me help you.

162
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,609
- Yes, I'm glad you came today.
- Come on.

163
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:07,012
- We'll stand here.
- Let me help you.

164
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:09,483
Ready. One, two, three.

165
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:11,826
All right. Let's take a look.

166
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,534
All right. One, two, three.

167
00:08:16,534 --> 00:08:17,525
Yes.

168
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:18,567
It's moving forward.

169
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,199
Go.

170
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:24,909
Almost there. One, two, three.

171
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,242
Yes.

172
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:39,624
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

173
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:40,673
Yes.

174
00:08:40,673 --> 00:08:42,692
You did a great job.

175
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:43,734
No, we did it together.

176
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:45,400
You worked hard, too.

177
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,242
No, I just stepped on the gas. That's all.

178
00:08:50,775 --> 00:08:53,859
I never imagined pushing a car could be so much fun.

179
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:56,409
- Fun?
- Yes.

180
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,200
Let's sit down.

181
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,409
Speaking of resting,

182
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:15,010
Chen Da Wu told me yesterday

183
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,400
that resting isn't for a longer journey.

184
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,659
Resting is just for the sake of resting.

185
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:23,909
Seems like it's true.

186
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,252
Anyway, it's too late to attend Da Wu's seminar now.

187
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:30,399
I'll apologize to him tomorrow.

188
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,951
For now, let's just rest well.

189
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,659
Let's not waste the day either.

190
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,159
What do you want to do?

191
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:44,318
Anywhere is fine.

192
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:46,692
But I feel like our carefree trip

193
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:49,199
is missing one important member.

194
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,681
You're back.

195
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:21,984
Grandma, is the inspection over?

196
00:10:21,984 --> 00:10:24,192
It's all done and it went smoothly.

197
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:26,017
How was Da Wu's seminar?

198
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:27,432
We didn't make it.

199
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:30,059
Grandma, we're heading out in 30 minutes.

200
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:31,951
Where are we going?

201
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,109
When will the other celebrities arrive in Kinmen?

202
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:40,192
Probably early tomorrow morning.

203
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:42,276
But they haven't signed the contract yet.

204
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:44,158
I've talked to their agents.

205
00:10:44,158 --> 00:10:46,866
They'll sign it when they arrive tomorrow.

206
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:48,498
Director and producer.

207
00:10:48,498 --> 00:10:50,399
Sorry.

208
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,817
Welcome to Kinmen.

209
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,640
And you are?

210
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,815
I'm from Kinmen.

211
00:10:54,815 --> 00:10:57,125
I'm also the executive agent for Bai Yin Mo,

212
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,699
Hong Xiao Guang.

213
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,900
Nice to meet you.

214
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,696
Executive agent. So, like an assistant?

215
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,314
Yes, but I'm working for Bai Yin Mo.

216
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:07,498
So, it's different.

217
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:09,034
See you tomorrow.

218
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:12,234
When will the car arrive?

219
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:13,318
It's over there.

220
00:11:13,318 --> 00:11:15,034
All right.

221
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,734
Lily, I've just arrived in Kinmen

222
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:20,399
and I greeted the director and everyone.

223
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,607
I'm going to find Yin Mo now.

224
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:23,242
We'll stay in touch.

225
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:38,937
What's wrong?

226
00:11:48,052 --> 00:11:49,067
I get it.

227
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:51,199
You don't know where to go, do you?

228
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:55,359
I get it.

229
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:57,732
In the past, everything was always arranged for you.

230
00:11:57,732 --> 00:11:59,399
Now that you're suddenly on your own,

231
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,199
you're unsure where to go.

232
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:04,840
It's okay. Take your time.

233
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,831
We have plenty of time and plenty of gas.

234
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,200
Yes.

235
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:21,730
It's a carefree trip. Turn off the phone.

236
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,125
I'll turn mine off, too.

237
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,659
Me, too.

238
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,557
All right. With all our phones off, we can truly relax now.

239
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:32,597
Whether you want to go forward or backward,

240
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:34,399
you're free to go wherever you wish.

241
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,734
This isn't the way.

242
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:38,409
You need to make a U-turn.

243
00:13:06,598 --> 00:13:08,200
You keep playing that.

244
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,200
You scared my grandma.

245
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:14,906
They're fishing over there.

246
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:16,324
Wouldn't they be startled?

247
00:13:16,324 --> 00:13:17,450
Hello.

248
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,524
Hi.

249
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:21,118
Hey.

250
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:39,159
Do people still go to such barbershops?

251
00:13:40,597 --> 00:13:41,899
Before you came to Kinmen,

252
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:44,184
I brought my grandma here for a makeover.

253
00:13:44,184 --> 00:13:49,283
Yes, I even got a perm to welcome a superstar.

254
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:56,252
The latest trend, root perm.

255
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:03,899
All right. Ready.

256
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,492
Three, two, one!

257
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,909
Got it.

258
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:15,083
- Hi.
- Da Wu.

259
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:17,663
Hi.

260
00:14:17,663 --> 00:14:18,696
Xu Man is here, too.

261
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:21,203
- Xu Man, sit here.
- No need.

262
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:23,057
I'm just here to say hi.

263
00:14:23,057 --> 00:14:25,131
I made a few new versions of that drink from before.

264
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,822
Come try them sometime.

265
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:28,516
Sure. Thank you.

266
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:30,729
I'll be off then.

267
00:14:30,729 --> 00:14:32,072
You two have a good chat.

268
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,367
Bye.

269
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,415
Sit down, Da Wu.

270
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:38,742
Okay.

271
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:44,442
Let's order drinks first.

272
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:46,025
I already ordered.

273
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:48,025
I still remember what you like.

274
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:51,067
Black coffee without sugar, right?

275
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:53,699
Right.

276
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:58,585
Actually, I asked Hai Nuo earlier if she wanted to join us,

277
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:01,734
but she seems to be with Bai Yin Mo.

278
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,319
She didn't even come to your seminar just now.

279
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:06,734
Should I scold her for you?

280
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:08,216
Why would you scold her?

281
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:09,275
She's accompanying the guest.

282
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,492
That's part of doing business, too.

283
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:15,727
Here's your coffee.

284
00:15:15,727 --> 00:15:17,752
Thank you.

285
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:20,001
By the way, for the class reunion this time,

286
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:21,950
both you and Hai Nuo must come.

287
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,460
Especially Hai Nuo.

288
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,148
She has missed so many years.

289
00:15:25,148 --> 00:15:26,625
Why?

290
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,492
Because you weren't here.

291
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:31,653
I'm just joking.

292
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:33,427
She keeps saying her guesthouse is super busy

293
00:15:33,427 --> 00:15:37,109
or that she has to work part-time to earn extra money.

294
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:40,242
Anyway, she comes up with a lot of excuses every year to not show up.

295
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:46,484
Hai Nuo isn't someone who makes excuses.

296
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:48,699
She's probably too busy.

297
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:56,776
You Cai.

298
00:15:56,776 --> 00:15:58,359
Xiao Guang.

299
00:15:58,359 --> 00:15:59,899
It has been a long time, right?

300
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:00,983
How's life in Taipei?

301
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:02,275
Kinmen has changed so much.

302
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:05,109
I almost got lost just now.

303
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:06,635
Lately?

304
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:07,776
Lately, I've been super busy.

305
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:09,899
I need to prepare for my boss's reality show.

306
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,818
Hey, I thought your boss Bai Yin Mo

307
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:15,576
was really aloof and cold.

308
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,899
However, after spending some time with him,

309
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:21,983
I realized he actually has this adorable contrast to his personality.

310
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:23,526
- Adorable contrast?
- Yes.

311
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:25,442
What's so adorable about him?

312
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:29,251
Yin Mo is well-known in the industry for being hard to handle.

313
00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:30,366
I'll bring a drink to the customer first.

314
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:31,859
Choose what you want.

315
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:32,974
It's on me.

316
00:16:32,974 --> 00:16:34,699
- That's nice of you.
- Don't mention it.

317
00:16:37,776 --> 00:16:38,793
Your coffee is here.

318
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:40,899
Thank you.

319
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,317
You definitely give off a cultured vibe.

320
00:16:42,317 --> 00:16:44,484
I see you've been reading that book for a while.

321
00:16:44,484 --> 00:16:46,899
- Are you interested?
- Yes, I like it a lot.

322
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:48,942
It's just that my Chinese isn't very good.

323
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,700
So, it's a bit challenging.

324
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,899
How about this?

325
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:54,400
When you have some free time,

326
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,899
I'll take you on a real tour.

327
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:57,313
- What do you think?
- Really?

328
00:16:57,313 --> 00:16:58,611
Yes.

329
00:16:58,611 --> 00:17:00,526
- I'll have to trouble you then.
- No worries.

330
00:17:00,526 --> 00:17:02,534
This way, please.

331
00:17:02,534 --> 00:17:03,668
Producer, have a seat.

332
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:04,767
Director, have a seat.

333
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,609
Producer, here's my business card.

334
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,783
[Kinmen's Sea Breeze Village, Chen Fu Shou]

335
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:13,833
Chen Fu Shou?

336
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:14,866
Yes.

337
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:15,942
Good fortune and long life?

338
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:18,333
Producer, you have the gift of gab.

339
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,833
Village Chief, this time,

340
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,442
we've invited a few superstars.

341
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:22,818
We hope you can recommend

342
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:24,899
some locals with special talents

343
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:26,442
to participate in the show.

344
00:17:26,442 --> 00:17:27,609
Of course.

345
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:30,966
In our village, we have many talented folks.

346
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,484
They'll do their best to support you

347
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:35,618
and make this show a success.

348
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:39,241
Hello, I'm Jian Jia Xin.

349
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:41,025
Today, I'm going to perform a talent

350
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:44,192
that I discovered in elementary school.

351
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:45,950
Listen carefully.

352
00:18:00,899 --> 00:18:02,899
Wait. It's dislocated.

353
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:08,492
Four happy days bringing a new moon.

354
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:15,124
Hello, my name is Cai You Cai.

355
00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:17,008
My life is very simple.

356
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:21,899
I write articles, read books, and listen to music.

357
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:24,899
- I run a decent coffee shop.
- What if your grandma finds out you're here to audition?

358
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:27,227
- I have a well-behaved son.
- If you don't tell, no one will know.

359
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:28,899
I typically run things on my own.

360
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,965
Hello, I'm Wang Yue Shan.

361
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:32,758
I'm going to perform now.

362
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:35,699
I'd like everyone to help me keep the beat.

363
00:18:49,818 --> 00:18:52,317
- Great.
- Thank you.

364
00:18:52,317 --> 00:18:53,725
I'm Yan Ting.

365
00:18:53,725 --> 00:18:56,451
I'm going to perform brick-breaking.

366
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:06,699
My name is Cai Jing Liang.

367
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,965
Do you have any talent?

368
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:14,867
I don't know. My dad told me to come.

369
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:18,466
I...

370
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:20,200
Next.

371
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:43,699
The sorghum fields are so beautiful.

372
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:46,567
The power of doing nothing is amazing.

373
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:48,367
Even my mood has changed.

374
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:56,117
I once despised the labels others stuck on me.

375
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:58,609
- Things like...
- Things like superstar,

376
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:01,576
arrogant, and difficult to get along with?

377
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,699
And spiky like a sea urchin.

378
00:20:06,818 --> 00:20:09,374
However, I figured it out later.

379
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,130
If I don't like them, I can just tear them off

380
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,699
and create my own.

381
00:20:16,557 --> 00:20:17,950
I agree.

382
00:20:42,765 --> 00:20:45,024
Hong Xiao Guang.

383
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:47,638
Da Wu?

384
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:49,075
What brings you here?

385
00:20:50,555 --> 00:20:51,917
What are you doing here?

386
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,472
I came to look for Yin Mo,

387
00:20:53,472 --> 00:20:54,790
but it seems no one is around.

388
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,699
I sent messages, but he hasn't checked them.

389
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,109
Even Ms. Shu Man isn't here.

390
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:06,851
Forget it. There's no point waiting around.

391
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:07,892
It has been so long since you came back.

392
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,183
Let me treat you to a meal.

393
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:10,392
That's so nice of you.

394
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:12,150
I have to, right?

395
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:18,357
Why did it fall down?

396
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:19,899
Shun Hua.

397
00:21:22,892 --> 00:21:24,484
Shun Hua.

398
00:21:27,976 --> 00:21:30,225
Shun Hua, isn't it business hours now?

399
00:21:30,225 --> 00:21:32,899
Why are you sitting here alone?

400
00:21:35,475 --> 00:21:37,726
Zhi Ting is gone and everything is a mess.

401
00:21:37,726 --> 00:21:39,357
I had to find someone to help.

402
00:21:39,357 --> 00:21:41,232
The dishes are wrong and the accounts are off.

403
00:21:41,232 --> 00:21:43,350
Basically, nothing is going right.

404
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,942
What is it now?

405
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:50,291
Hey, we're closed today.

406
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,642
- We're closed tomorrow.
- Shun Hua.

407
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:54,567
The day after, too. We don't have enough staff.

408
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,025
Hey, Shun Hua.

409
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,059
- Why are you knocking?
- Shun Hua, are you drunk?

410
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:04,642
He's Hong Xiao Guang.

411
00:22:04,642 --> 00:22:06,265
Who?

412
00:22:06,265 --> 00:22:07,508
The kid who used to follow me around.

413
00:22:07,508 --> 00:22:09,900
Hong Xiao Guang. Don't you remember?

414
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:17,774
Hong Xiao Guang.

415
00:22:17,774 --> 00:22:20,234
Shun Hua.

416
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:25,708
You've grown up.

417
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,900
Now, you're copying me!

418
00:22:28,517 --> 00:22:29,698
Come on.

419
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:30,767
Let's have a drink.

420
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,500
- Well...
- Come on.

421
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,574
Let's go.

422
00:22:33,574 --> 00:22:35,099
This is easier than pushing a car.

423
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:36,462
The mat.

424
00:22:36,462 --> 00:22:37,899
The mat?

425
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:54,509
- What does that mean?
- A sense of ritual.

426
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,941
Thank you.

427
00:22:59,941 --> 00:23:01,357
For what?

428
00:23:01,357 --> 00:23:03,340
Thank you for...

429
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,059
Because of you, I got the chance to take my grandma out.

430
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:09,682
Otherwise, she'd stay at the guesthouse all day.

431
00:23:09,682 --> 00:23:11,475
She wouldn't come out with me, so...

432
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:13,067
You're welcome.

433
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:25,567
Grandma?

434
00:23:26,665 --> 00:23:28,396
Grandma.

435
00:23:28,396 --> 00:23:29,941
Grandma?

436
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,804
Why did you fall asleep here?

437
00:23:32,804 --> 00:23:35,297
- I don't know how I fell asleep.
- You'll catch a cold.

438
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:36,866
Let me carry you in.

439
00:23:36,866 --> 00:23:37,875
No need.

440
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,891
- You can't carry me.
- I can carry you.

441
00:23:39,891 --> 00:23:41,567
I'll help you.

442
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:45,640
I'll go in and sleep first.

443
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,381
- Okay.
- Okay.

444
00:23:47,381 --> 00:23:48,467
Cover yourself with a blanket.

445
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:50,441
Okay. Good night.

446
00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:52,067
- Good night.
- Good night.

447
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,475
Are you okay?

448
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,842
Just now...

449
00:24:17,842 --> 00:24:19,717
I'm fine.

450
00:24:19,717 --> 00:24:23,392
I was just a bit nervous earlier.

451
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:33,299
When I was little, I used to sleep with my grandma.

452
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:37,934
As long as she was snoring, I would feel at ease.

453
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:42,665
However, whenever she wasn't snoring,

454
00:24:42,665 --> 00:24:44,392
I would wake up scared.

455
00:24:45,675 --> 00:24:47,842
It seems like I've been like that

456
00:24:47,842 --> 00:24:51,531
ever since my parents passed away.

457
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:54,099
It makes me anxious.

458
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:32,675
When my grandma was raising me alone,

459
00:25:32,675 --> 00:25:33,825
it was really tough for her.

460
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:36,075
She was so busy with work.

461
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:38,674
She'd leave me at Da Wu's house

462
00:25:38,674 --> 00:25:40,590
and I'd just cry and cry.

463
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,007
I kept crying

464
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:46,851
until the last moment when she came to pick me up.

465
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:49,434
Then I'd stop crying.

466
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:53,398
She thought that couldn't go on.

467
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:55,691
I couldn't always cling to her like that.

468
00:25:55,691 --> 00:25:58,218
So, she made a rule that

469
00:25:58,218 --> 00:26:00,675
I had to sleep alone once I started elementary school

470
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:03,675
and learn to be strong.

471
00:26:03,675 --> 00:26:05,299
So, I'm very strong now.

472
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:07,517
I'm not afraid of anything.

473
00:26:08,251 --> 00:26:13,018
Except when it comes to my grandma.

474
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,100
Sorry.

475
00:26:24,614 --> 00:26:28,099
Seeing my grandma so happy today...

476
00:26:35,365 --> 00:26:37,099
It makes me so scared

477
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:48,099
that this happiness might suddenly fade.

478
00:26:49,647 --> 00:26:51,134
Sorry.

479
00:26:51,134 --> 00:26:53,176
It's okay.

480
00:26:53,176 --> 00:26:54,299
It's okay. Your grandma is snoring.

481
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,517
It's really loud. Didn't you hear?

482
00:26:58,018 --> 00:26:59,767
Don't cry.

483
00:27:01,207 --> 00:27:03,218
- It's okay.
- It's all your fault. Why did you ask me?

484
00:27:03,218 --> 00:27:04,542
I just asked if you were okay.

485
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,892
She's snoring really loudly.

486
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:09,726
Don't cry.

487
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:12,684
I understand.

488
00:27:26,742 --> 00:27:28,159
It might be because

489
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,534
I didn't pay attention last night and wore too little,

490
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:33,001
so I caught a cold today.

491
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:35,669
I've been feeling out of it all day.

492
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:38,952
However, when I think about the fact I'll be seeing you soon,

493
00:27:38,952 --> 00:27:41,253
it makes me so happy.

494
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:43,009
Me, too.

495
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:45,277
I think about you every day.

496
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:47,393
Luckily, I have your support.

497
00:27:47,393 --> 00:27:49,893
Otherwise, it would've been hard for me to decide

498
00:27:49,893 --> 00:27:51,992
to leave Kinmen.

499
00:27:51,992 --> 00:27:54,825
Have you taken care of everything?

500
00:27:54,825 --> 00:27:56,244
Almost.

501
00:27:56,244 --> 00:27:58,567
There are some accounts that haven't been settled.

502
00:27:58,567 --> 00:27:59,867
But don't worry.

503
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:01,825
Give him some time.

504
00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:03,499
That guy...

505
00:28:05,534 --> 00:28:07,499
He's...

00:28:09,699 --> 00:28:12,042
very honest,

00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:16,499
kindhearted,

508
00:28:19,336 --> 00:28:21,292
and hardworking.

509
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:26,292
He will definitely pay me back.

00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:30,699
When you get here, I'll take you on a vacation.

513
00:28:35,034 --> 00:28:36,625
Okay.

514
00:28:37,343 --> 00:28:39,000
Bye then.

Why are you always so unreliable?

Don't cry.

Where's your grandma?

She went to brush her teeth and wash her face.

00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,645
All right. I'll go, too.

536
00:32:24,645 --> 00:32:26,718
Wait.

What's this?

This is...

540
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:47,651
I saw that you have a planner for your schedule.

541
00:32:47,651 --> 00:32:50,109
I thought this could be useful for that

542
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:52,618
and you can also keep your earphones in it.

549
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,983
That's quite a big lucky charm.

550
00:33:16,983 --> 00:33:21,234
I think I heard you guys talking about a love charm.

551
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:22,825
- What?
- What?

552
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,291
I'm going to brush my teeth.

553
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:31,899
Good morning, Grandma.

554
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:33,692
Are you shy?

555
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:35,899
I'm going to fry some eggs.

556
00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:37,866
I said it was a lucky charm.

557
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:39,109
It's the same thing.

558
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:40,427
No, it's not.

559
00:33:40,427 --> 00:33:42,100
I heard love charm.

560
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,493
Lucky charm.

561
00:33:43,493 --> 00:33:45,326
Love charm.

562
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:50,367
I want coffee.

563
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,900
All right. I'll make it for you.

564
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,251
This is hot, right?

565
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:01,200
Yes, it's hot. Sit down.

566
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,692
- Ma'am, we'll go rest over there.
- Okay.

567
00:34:11,692 --> 00:34:13,833
You still have a blood test later.

568
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:15,699
Next is Mr. Lin.

569
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:19,543
Your heart isn't in great condition, right, Mr. Lin?

570
00:34:19,543 --> 00:34:20,942
Your heart isn't in great condition.

571
00:34:20,942 --> 00:34:22,899
- Do you exercise regularly?
- Yes.

572
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:25,692
Don't eat too much, okay?

573
00:34:25,692 --> 00:34:27,825
Next is Mr. Slow.

574
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:30,074
Mr. Slow?

575
00:34:30,074 --> 00:34:32,433
Yes, because he only says "slow".

576
00:34:32,433 --> 00:34:35,484
- And he talks really slowly.
- Slow.

577
00:34:35,484 --> 00:34:37,117
Slow.

578
00:34:37,965 --> 00:34:41,484
Come on. Give me your hand.

579
00:34:41,484 --> 00:34:42,899
Help him up.

580
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:43,899
Support him.

581
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:45,567
Take it slow.

582
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:47,284
It's okay.

583
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:56,075
Slow...

584
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,699
Seriously? I forgot my bag.

585
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,642
Shun Hua.

586
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:24,776
Shun Hua.

587
00:35:24,776 --> 00:35:26,064
What's wrong?

588
00:35:26,064 --> 00:35:28,100
Where are you going?

589
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,065
I'm thinking of going to Xiamen for a while.

590
00:35:31,065 --> 00:35:32,642
I want to clear my mind.

591
00:35:32,642 --> 00:35:34,484
It's because of Zhi Ting, right?

592
00:35:34,484 --> 00:35:36,717
I don't even want to talk about you two.

593
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,300
Even though you didn't get married, you've been together for so long.

594
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,065
It's practically like being married.

595
00:35:41,065 --> 00:35:43,157
Why can't you just talk things out properly?

596
00:35:43,157 --> 00:35:44,482
Why are you fighting?

597
00:35:44,482 --> 00:35:46,075
I'll call her right now.

598
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:50,451
No, don't call her.

599
00:35:57,263 --> 00:35:58,307
Look.

600
00:35:58,307 --> 00:36:00,282
She's stuck with me through hard times for so many years.

601
00:36:00,282 --> 00:36:01,899
She used to be so glamorous,

602
00:36:01,899 --> 00:36:03,333
but she sold seafood with me.

603
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:06,367
And now she smells like fish all over.

604
00:36:09,651 --> 00:36:11,366
I used to be so romantic.

605
00:36:11,366 --> 00:36:13,750
Once, I bought her a bouquet of flowers.

606
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,833
Unfortunately, the florist added a chrysanthemum.

607
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:19,117
It looked like I was going to a memorial service.

608
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,190
I never bought her a designer bag.

609
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,148
Designer bags? Who cares?

610
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:26,607
Can you eat them?

611
00:36:26,607 --> 00:36:28,609
Those bags cost a fortune.

612
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:30,131
Only a fool would buy one.

613
00:36:30,131 --> 00:36:31,717
Did I ever buy my wife one?

614
00:36:31,717 --> 00:36:33,031
Exactly.

615
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:34,491
We are men from the outlying islands.

616
00:36:34,491 --> 00:36:36,849
We don't care about all that city guy nonsense.

617
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:38,197
Right.

618
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:39,609
We're family men.

619
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:41,550
We give all our earnings to our wives.

620
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,159
What more do they want?

621
00:36:48,315 --> 00:36:51,432
Thank you, Mr. Fu Shou.

622
00:36:51,432 --> 00:36:53,075
Don't mention it.

623
00:36:53,956 --> 00:36:55,689
Should I ask Hong Hui Fang

624
00:36:55,689 --> 00:36:57,289
to go to Taipei tomorrow and bring her back?

625
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:58,742
No.

626
00:37:00,229 --> 00:37:02,565
I'm going

627
00:37:02,565 --> 00:37:04,682
to play it cool.

628
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:08,642
She can come and go as she pleases.

629
00:37:22,983 --> 00:37:25,296
Mr. Fu Shou.

630
00:37:25,296 --> 00:37:27,992
I know a lot of people are talking about us.

631
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,451
If you hear anything,

632
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:36,451
please say something nice about Zhi Ting.

633
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:39,164
After all, she's a woman.

634
00:37:39,164 --> 00:37:41,374
Her reputation is important.

635
00:37:41,374 --> 00:37:43,404
I'm not here to talk about that.

636
00:37:43,404 --> 00:37:45,833
I came to tell you something important.

637
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:48,163
There's a group of people coming here

638
00:37:48,163 --> 00:37:50,614
to film a reality show.

639
00:37:50,614 --> 00:37:54,057
They need catering for lunch and dinner.

640
00:37:54,057 --> 00:37:55,932
I think this is a great opportunity

641
00:37:55,932 --> 00:37:57,447
to show people what you've got.

642
00:37:57,447 --> 00:37:58,783
What do you think?

643
00:38:17,572 --> 00:38:19,489
I have to catch the ferry. I'm running late.

644
00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:20,998
Take care.

645
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,699
Shun Hua.

646
00:38:44,148 --> 00:38:45,816
Zhi Ting.

647
00:38:45,816 --> 00:38:47,840
Hey, Hui Fang.

648
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,024
Why didn't you tell us that you're leaving Kinmen?

649
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:52,849
I'm sorry.

650
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:54,774
You've all been so kind to me.

651
00:38:54,774 --> 00:38:56,664
What are you apologizing for?

652
00:38:56,664 --> 00:38:58,588
Even though you and Shun Hua broke up,

653
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:00,842
we've known each other for so long, and we can still keep in touch.

654
00:39:00,842 --> 00:39:02,915
Zhi Ting.

655
00:39:02,915 --> 00:39:04,800
Hui Fang.

656
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,300
I actually wanted to ask you

657
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,539
what's going on with Shun Hua?

658
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:12,783
Why did he suddenly close the restaurant?

659
00:39:13,565 --> 00:39:16,409
She's asking why Shun Hua closed the restaurant.

660
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,117
Hello?

661
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:25,630
Zhi Ting?

662
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:30,075
Well, I was going to introduce Shun Hua to a big business deal.

663
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,134
Hello?

664
00:39:48,134 --> 00:39:50,218
I really can't stand you.

665
00:39:50,218 --> 00:39:52,717
What kind of tantrum are you throwing now?

666
00:39:52,717 --> 00:39:54,559
What do you want?

667
00:39:55,299 --> 00:39:57,134
You didn't open the restaurant yesterday

668
00:39:57,134 --> 00:39:59,592
and you posted online today that

669
00:39:59,592 --> 00:40:00,800
you're temporarily closed.

670
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,509
How old are you?

671
00:40:02,509 --> 00:40:05,218
If you don't sell food, what else can you do?

672
00:40:05,218 --> 00:40:07,009
I can do anything.

673
00:40:07,009 --> 00:40:09,134
Why do you care?

674
00:40:09,134 --> 00:40:11,475
Are you at the pier now?

675
00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:16,218
You'd better go back to the restaurant.

676
00:40:16,218 --> 00:40:18,299
- No.
- Why not?

677
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:19,299
You aren't my girlfriend.

678
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:21,267
Why are you meddling in my business?

679
00:40:22,674 --> 00:40:24,299
Fine.

680
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:26,299
You don't listen to me

681
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:29,299
and you rejected the job Mr. Fu Shou got for you.

682
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:31,299
What's your plan for the future?

683
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:34,051
If you keep going like this, you'll have no money.

684
00:40:34,051 --> 00:40:36,835
How will you ever find a girlfriend?

685
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:38,134
I'm not getting one. Not anymore.

686
00:40:38,134 --> 00:40:40,299
I'll never get a girlfriend again!

687
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:41,884
Why are you saying that out of anger?

688
00:40:41,884 --> 00:40:43,926
I'm angry at myself. Is that not allowed?

689
00:40:43,926 --> 00:40:46,134
What right do you have to interfere?

690
00:40:46,134 --> 00:40:48,299
I'm a loser!

691
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:49,557
As a thug, I failed!

692
00:40:49,557 --> 00:40:50,941
I failed in running a restaurant!

693
00:40:50,941 --> 00:40:52,299
I can't even keep the girl I love!

694
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:55,767
All I can do is this job that leaves me smelling like fish!

695
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:07,767
Shun Hua.

696
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:14,099
Can you calm down and listen to me?

697
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:17,009
No matter what happens,

698
00:41:17,009 --> 00:41:20,009
you still need to live your life.

699
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:23,425
Just tell Mr. Fu Shou that you've changed your mind

700
00:41:23,425 --> 00:41:25,509
and that you'll take the job.

701
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:28,592
You'd better hurry or someone else might snatch it up.

702
00:41:28,592 --> 00:41:30,467
Whatever.

703
00:41:30,467 --> 00:41:33,009
I don't care.

704
00:41:33,009 --> 00:41:34,934
Fang Shun Hua.

705
00:41:36,134 --> 00:41:38,018
You need to stay strong.

706
00:41:40,884 --> 00:41:43,099
The next one will be better.

707
00:41:45,717 --> 00:41:48,299
I've already had the best.

708
00:41:48,299 --> 00:41:50,099
There won't be a better one.

709
00:42:50,398 --> 00:42:51,849
What are you doing? Stop peeking.

710
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:53,218
Why are you writing for so long?

711
00:42:53,218 --> 00:42:55,158
Writing down wishes takes effort.

712
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:57,792
Chen Da Wu, why did you finish so quickly?

713
00:42:57,792 --> 00:42:59,969
Because my wish only has 10 characters.

714
00:42:59,969 --> 00:43:01,842
You must've just scribbled something.

715
00:43:01,842 --> 00:43:03,009
I'm serious, okay?

716
00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:04,259
No way.

717
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:05,299
So, what did you write?

718
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:07,634
Stop peeking. Go sit over there.

719
00:43:07,634 --> 00:43:10,434
Fine. Don't show me. How petty.

720
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,976
How about having dinner together tonight?

721
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:51,851
Let's meet at Xu Man's place tonight and have a drink together.
