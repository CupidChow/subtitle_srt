00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
♫ You are like the sea ♫

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,751
♫ Every single day ♫

3
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:19,250
♫ You keep waiting ♫

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,667
♫ No matter if I come or not ♫

5
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:24,792
♫ A sudden gust of wind ♫

6
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:28,125
♫ Messed up my hairstyle ♫

7
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:31,959
♫ But it brought us together ♫

8
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:39,083
♫ Only then did I discover how much I love who I am ♫

9
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,918
♫ Only you ♫

10
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:44,375
♫ Remind me of myself ♫

11
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,999
♫ The one who used to love smiling ♫

12
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:50,999
♫ Why did I lose my smile? ♫

13
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:53,542
♫ Unable to find a way out ♫

14
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:56,709
♫ I stand by the sea, feeling the breeze ♫

15
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:59,042
♫ Only you ♫

16
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:05,709
♫ Remind me of myself and what I desire ♫

17
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:11,292
♫ I've finally learned that after all my overthinking ♫

18
00:01:11,292 --> 00:01:13,167
♫ What I want the most ♫

19
00:01:13,167 --> 00:01:17,799
♫ Is to go to the seaside And feel the breeze with you ♫

20
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:30,799
[Breeze by the Sea]

21
00:01:36,702 --> 00:01:37,999
Okay.

22
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:39,799
Thank you.

23
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:48,627
How should we start?

24
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:52,143
Don't you perform heart transplants during surgeries?

25
00:01:52,143 --> 00:01:54,883
Put your heart on the canvas.

26
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,867
Do you mean you want me to draw a heart?

27
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,925
That's actually not a bad idea.

28
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,075
I get what you mean.

29
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:04,209
You mean

30
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:06,801
I should express my feelings

31
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:10,226
on the canvas, right?

32
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:12,759
Let's start with that.

33
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:27,009
Shun Hua?

34
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:30,175
Hey, Shun Hua.

35
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,967
I'm at Xu Man's studio.

36
00:02:34,619 --> 00:02:36,720
Zhi Ting called and told me

37
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,753
that I don't need to pay her back.

38
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:41,586
She also said if anyone asks about her,

39
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:43,368
just tell them she's not coming back

40
00:02:43,368 --> 00:02:44,645
and nobody should try to find her.

41
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:46,292
What do you think about that?

42
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:48,175
What else did she say?

43
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:50,375
It sounded like she was crying.

44
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:54,577
Xu Man, can you make us two cups of that drink?

45
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:56,883
Men's talk.

46
00:02:57,669 --> 00:02:58,753
Come on, Shun Hua. Have a seat.

47
00:02:58,753 --> 00:03:01,151
Sorry.

48
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:03,761
Let me analyze it for you.

49
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:06,050
I'll help you figure it out.

50
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,285
You said you called her...

51
00:03:07,285 --> 00:03:09,551
No, she called me.

52
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,217
Shun Hua, listen.

53
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:13,209
Turn on the speakerphone later

54
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:15,401
and I can tell you right away

55
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,966
how to respond to her, okay?

56
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:19,160
- Okay.
- Sit down.

57
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,050
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

58
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:25,799
Okay.

59
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,050
I told you not to call me again.

60
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,800
I want to argue with you.

61
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:46,799
Are you drunk?

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,744
Why do you care if I've been drinking?

63
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:51,934
Ye Zhi Ting.

64
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:54,052
Listen. I've been too good to you.

65
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:55,933
That's why you're acting all phony

66
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:57,375
and looking for a new boyfriend.

67
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,445
You're just ungrateful.

68
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:02,759
You're so full of yourself.

69
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:07,520
Ye Zhi Ting.

70
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,761
Bring that guy to Kinmen.

71
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,801
I need to see him.

72
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:13,337
I want to see who's so shameless

73
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,900
to steal my woman.

74
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,268
I'll beat him to a pulp and turn him into minced meat.

75
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:20,676
I can't accept losing like this.

76
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:24,900
You didn't lose.

77
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,309
You're right about everything.

78
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,542
I'm too full of myself

79
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:31,842
That's why things have turned out this way.

80
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:34,867
Fang Shun Hua.

81
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:38,592
I'll repay what I owe you in my next life.

82
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:44,467
She hung up. What should we do?

83
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:45,626
It's okay. Stay calm.

84
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:47,542
Let me think for a bit.

85
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,300
Well...

86
00:04:51,553 --> 00:04:54,042
She must have been scammed.

87
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:56,292
Yes. I think so, too.

88
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:57,702
- Call her.
- Call her?

89
00:04:57,702 --> 00:04:59,426
Call her.

90
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,509
Turn on the speakerphone.

91
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:05,542
- The speakerphone.
- Your call has been forwarded to voicemail.

92
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:07,083
She declined the call.

93
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,751
She just said she'll repay me in the next life.

94
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,799
Will she do something drastic?

95
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:16,301
- I'm going to find her in Taipei.
- I'm going with you.

96
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:18,217
- Let's go.
- Come on.

97
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:26,083
Don't act impulsively.

98
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,634
Have you ever thought about what she's going through?

99
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:33,966
People are softhearted creatures.

100
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:37,050
Whose call would she answer right now?

101
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:41,092
- Hai Nuo.
- Hai Nuo.

102
00:05:46,777 --> 00:05:48,676
Why call Hai Nuo?

103
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:51,676
I don't know either.

104
00:05:58,876 --> 00:06:03,014
[Hai Nuo]

105
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:11,125
Zhi Ting.

106
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,626
Shun Hua had an accident.

107
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:15,551
You'd better call Xu Man.

108
00:06:16,301 --> 00:06:18,426
Shun Hua?

109
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:21,384
That's it.

110
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,925
Her idea seems pretty good.

111
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:34,243
It seems even better than yours.

112
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:36,202
- Really?
- Yes.

113
00:06:36,202 --> 00:06:38,867
But, Da Wu, I don't have any experience.

114
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:40,125
I'll get nervous.

115
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,061
- I don't know what to do.
- The phone is ringing.

116
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:44,487
- Are you ready?
- Wait a second.

117
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,487
Okay.

118
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:48,509
Success depends on you two.

119
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:54,202
- Zhi Ting.
- Xu Man, where is Shun Hua?

120
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:55,360
Zhi Ting, Shun Hua is in bad shape.

121
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,592
Da Wu is trying to save him.

122
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,867
Zhi Ting, after Shun Hua ended the call,

123
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:02,443
he spaced out

124
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:03,469
and got into a car accident.

125
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:06,037
He said he has to see you one last time no matter what.

126
00:07:06,037 --> 00:07:09,612
Shun Hua.

127
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:10,852
Zhi Ting.

128
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:12,169
- Zhi Ting.
- Shun Hua.

129
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:13,504
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:13,504 --> 00:07:15,801
I was so harsh with you earlier.

131
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,250
Don't say anything more.

132
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,044
Zhi Ting, you need to hurry up.

133
00:07:19,044 --> 00:07:21,050
Hurry back!

134
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,242
Hello? Da Wu, I'm on my way.

135
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:42,950
Okay, wait for me.

136
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,709
I'll be there soon.

137
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,117
Da Wu.

138
00:07:55,117 --> 00:07:56,825
Are you in the parking lot now?

139
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:58,917
I'm coming out now.

140
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,499
You tricked me.

141
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,200
Even you tricked me.

142
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,959
Aren't you supposed to be in the hospital?

143
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:27,699
I'm such a fool.

144
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:30,699
How could I be so gullible?

145
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:33,034
I haven't even seen the person

146
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:36,075
and I've transferred all my money to him.

147
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:37,458
I even thought

148
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:42,625
I could spend the rest of my life abroad with him.

149
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,898
Thank goodness you're safe and haven't left yet.

150
00:08:49,898 --> 00:08:51,433
If you really go to the U.S.,

151
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:53,699
all I know are the three English lines I learned from Da Wu.

152
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,957
How could I possibly save you?

153
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:58,534
Stop talking.

154
00:08:58,534 --> 00:09:02,326
I feel so ashamed.

155
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:05,032
I'd rather die.

156
00:09:05,032 --> 00:09:06,492
Don't talk about dying!

157
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:09,699
You have no idea! I was worried to death during our call yesterday!

158
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:12,074
No, I shouldn't say that either!

159
00:09:12,074 --> 00:09:14,167
Neither of us should even mention dying.

160
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:16,864
Zhi Ting.

161
00:09:16,864 --> 00:09:18,948
You can always earn more money,

162
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:21,167
but you can't do anything foolish.

163
00:09:24,783 --> 00:09:27,209
I've already lost you once.

164
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:29,709
If I really lose you this time,

165
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:32,792
I don't know what I'd do.

166
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,765
How could you be so foolish?

167
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:41,242
I treated you like that, but you still aren't angry?

168
00:09:41,242 --> 00:09:43,825
How could you be so foolish?

169
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:45,451
Yes, I'm a fool.

170
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,891
I'm too single-minded.

171
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:49,214
That's why I made you unhappy.

172
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,409
You got scammed because of me.

173
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:55,334
It has nothing to do with you.

174
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:06,126
It does.

175
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:11,875
It's all my fault.

176
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,384
How did it go?

177
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:51,759
I've completely forgotten.

178
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,375
He got it settled at last.

179
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,709
He even said I shouldn't leave,

180
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,568
claiming two brains are better than one.

181
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:01,654
What kind of nonsense is that?

182
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:03,792
I'm so tired. I'm going back to sleep.

183
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:05,933
I earned myself a breakfast.

184
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,664
I'm done painting. It's inside.

185
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:09,092
Bye.

186
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:26,967
He's really tired.

187
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:39,050
Producer, our surprise guest has arrived.

188
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,009
Yin Mo.

189
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:05,834
Did you send Tang Mi here?

190
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:07,292
Yes.

191
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:10,125
I need Tang Mi to generate profits for the company as soon as possible.

192
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,709
What she lacks is exposure

193
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:14,167
and reality shows require engaging topics.

194
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,467
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

195
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:22,999
I know you're under a lot of pressure,

196
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:24,083
- but...
- You don't understand.

197
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,876
This reality show is my last chance.

198
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,918
Your past DUI and assault case

199
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:30,167
caused many endorsements to be canceled

200
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,999
and some even demanded compensation.

201
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:34,751
I'll take care of the compensation.

202
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:36,083
Take care of what?

203
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,999
The lawsuits haven't been resolved yet.

204
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:40,334
The major shareholders are on my back every day.

205
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:42,999
If I don't try to fix things now, the company won't survive.

206
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:45,799
The company is everything to me.

207
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:53,999
Okay, I understand.

208
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:56,799
I'll make sure she rises as quickly as possible.

209
00:12:58,959 --> 00:12:59,999
Yin Mo.

210
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:01,714
I'd never want you to do anything

211
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,799
that betrays your true intentions.

212
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,209
I'm an actor.

213
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:09,759
What I'm best at is acting.

214
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:18,799
Who is that woman?

215
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:23,209
His rumored girlfriend.

216
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:25,999
Strange, this isn't a dating reality show.

217
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:29,092
Why are they creating all these romantic vibes?

218
00:13:31,606 --> 00:13:33,768
Doesn't his manager care?

219
00:13:33,768 --> 00:13:34,966
Or is it because they're in the same company,

220
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:36,967
so they're creating news together?

221
00:13:42,744 --> 00:13:44,083
Hi, Ms. Tang Mi.

222
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,777
I heard this is your first time in Kinmen.

223
00:13:46,777 --> 00:13:48,342
My name is Wu Cai Zhen.

224
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:50,594
Do you need me to introduce anything to you?

225
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:52,683
Or would you like me to take a photo for you?

226
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:54,718
I don't need anything.

227
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:57,799
Your eyelash has fallen off.

228
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:02,799
Hey, you're here, too.

229
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:07,768
Have a cup of coffee.

230
00:14:07,768 --> 00:14:09,167
Coffee helps wake you up.

231
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:10,177
After yesterday,

232
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:12,693
I realized how amazing you celebrities are.

233
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:15,918
You stare at the camera all day and react so vividly.

234
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:19,459
- It's really hard work.
- Exactly! Back when Da Wu and I...

235
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,867
A good buddy of mine acted in a play with me,

236
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:24,933
but I got so nervous that I didn't know what to say.

237
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:27,933
- You celebrities are really impressive.
- Yin Mo.

238
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,125
Yin Mo.

239
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,584
- Yin Mo.
- She has quite a character.

240
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:35,341
Yin Mo, the filming is about to start.

241
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,883
I just had a call with Lily.

242
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:40,509
Let's do it.

243
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:48,375
Hai Nuo, it's all right.

244
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,083
Time heals everything.

245
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,099
What are you talking about? It has nothing to do with me.

246
00:14:53,099 --> 00:14:54,735
Where are you going?

247
00:14:54,735 --> 00:14:55,768
It hasn't even started yet.

248
00:14:55,768 --> 00:14:57,999
I forgot to wash the clothes that were drying at home.

249
00:14:57,999 --> 00:14:58,999
- I'll head home first.
- Drying...

250
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,626
- Come back later.
- You guys can go in now.

251
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:02,551
- Okay.
- Okay.

252
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:09,127
We have to thank Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc.

253
00:15:09,127 --> 00:15:11,676
for providing such a great venue for our filming.

254
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,474
Yin Mo.

255
00:15:13,474 --> 00:15:16,083
Do you remember when we first met?

256
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,125
Of course I do.

257
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,209
Two years ago, at the company's annual party.

258
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,250
You still remember.

259
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,167
When I first saw you, I thought you had great potential.

260
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:26,792
And that night, everyone was raising glasses to you,

261
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:30,334
saying you'd be a star in the future.

262
00:15:30,334 --> 00:15:33,083
What really left an impression on me

263
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:36,810
was when you gave our manager a look,

264
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,075
and from then on,

265
00:15:38,075 --> 00:15:40,259
my drink changed from wine to tea.

266
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:42,042
I was so touched.

267
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,533
If it weren't for you,

268
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:46,000
I wouldn't have made it home that night.

269
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,792
Do you remember?

270
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,426
How could I forget?

271
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:56,667
Actually, back then, he also helped me by drinking for me.

272
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,042
He didn't mention it.

273
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:59,290
That's just how he is.

274
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,799
Humble and thoughtful.

275
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:21,339
Okay, now let's have our Bai-Tang Couple

276
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:24,009
start the rapid-fire questions.

277
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,900
What's Bai Yin Mo's zodiac sign?

278
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,643
- Virgo.
- Virgo.

279
00:16:28,643 --> 00:16:31,342
What food does Bai Yin Mo dislike the most?

280
00:16:31,342 --> 00:16:33,867
- Greasy food.
- Greasy food.

281
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,309
What's Bai Yin Mo's biggest flaw?

282
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:38,592
- He's perfect.
- Does having high standards count?

283
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:42,167
What's Bai Yin Mo's favorite color?

284
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,695
- Gray.
- Gray.

285
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:45,209
You two are so in sync.

286
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:47,375
How do you know?

287
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,083
Okay, here's the final question.

288
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,384
What's Bai Yin Mo's secret?

289
00:17:04,693 --> 00:17:07,384
It seems like it's really a secret.

290
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:25,000
Hello, Director Chen. It's me, Lily.

291
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,584
Tang Mi is live streaming with Bai Yin Mo.

292
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:29,459
There's a lot of discussion among the audience.

293
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:33,000
Her popularity is definitely going to grow.

294
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,042
Regarding the role we discussed earlier,

295
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:37,551
you might want to consider it.

296
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:43,292
Da Wu.

297
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:45,259
Mom.

298
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:47,167
Do you need my help?

299
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,500
Sure.

300
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,000
Help me carry these two pots inside.

301
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,799
Okay.

302
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:55,452
Mom, if you need my help, just ask.

303
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:57,801
How are you feeling after last night?

304
00:17:57,801 --> 00:17:58,867
I'm fine.

305
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:02,311
Zhi Ting has already gone home.

306
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:03,537
It's all thanks to you.

307
00:18:03,537 --> 00:18:06,799
Even in a situation like that, you still helped others.

308
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:10,426
I didn't say anything.

309
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:15,579
Mom, I know you all watched the live stream.

310
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:17,834
If you have something to say, just say it.

311
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:18,943
My son is so handsome.

312
00:18:18,943 --> 00:18:21,801
Of course we had to watch.

313
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,834
Did Hai Nuo agree?

314
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,101
No.

315
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:29,370
She refuses to tell me why she broke up with me back then.

316
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,259
She won't mention anything about the past.

317
00:18:38,654 --> 00:18:41,799
The truth is, we weren't the best back then.

318
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:44,175
What do you mean, Mom?

319
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,469
At the time, to help you focus on your studies

320
00:18:50,469 --> 00:18:52,967
and get into a good university,

321
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:58,259
your dad asked Hai Nuo to break up with you.

322
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:13,202
We've always wanted to tell you,

323
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:16,050
but Hai Nuo wanted to keep it a secret.

324
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,311
She wanted you to focus on your studies

325
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:18,489
and then smoothly go abroad.

326
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:19,621
She said not to tell you,

327
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:22,634
so you wouldn't end up fighting with your dad.

328
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,993
Your dad still feels guilty about it.

329
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:30,660
Our families have such a close relationship,

330
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,900
yet he made that request for your future.

331
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,233
Even though Hai Nuo and Ms. Shu Man

332
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:37,561
say we should just move on,

333
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:40,467
your dad still can't let it go.

334
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:46,335
You relationship with your dad just improved recently.

335
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:49,217
You won't hold this against him, will you?

336
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:58,276
Is there anything else you need help with?

337
00:19:58,276 --> 00:20:00,799
If not, I'll go rest for now.

338
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,933
Try some.

339
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,568
Think carefully.

340
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,375
These are fried stuff.

341
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,999
You guys go ahead and eat.

342
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:40,711
I'm trying to eat less these days.

343
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:43,143
Grandma, are you my grandma or his grandma?

344
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:45,134
Didn't you see his...

345
00:21:02,342 --> 00:21:04,867
Are you and Bai Yin Mo really a couple?

346
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,842
Congratulations.

347
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:10,384
I also like Bai Yin Mo very much.

Yes.

What now?

It's about Da Wu, right?

358
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:41,753
I told him about

how you asked Hai Nuo to break up with him back then.

00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:46,999
What?

361
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,592
Why did you tell him that?

I knew you'd take this.

366
00:22:58,619 --> 00:22:59,751
You love this.

367
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:01,375
Is it cold?

368
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,768
- Thank you all for coming today.
- Here he is.

369
00:23:03,768 --> 00:23:07,744
I invited everyone here because I have something important to announce.

370
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:09,351
And that is, the most beautiful boss lady

371
00:23:09,351 --> 00:23:12,318
of Sea Breeze Village, Ye Zhi Ting, is back!

372
00:23:12,318 --> 00:23:13,318
Great!

373
00:23:13,318 --> 00:23:14,327
Applaud!

374
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,259
Great!

375
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:23,799
She's back.

376
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:32,768
Thank you so much for taking care of Shun Hua and me all this time.

377
00:23:32,768 --> 00:23:37,000
I left once, but now I'm back.

378
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,485
From now on, I will work even harder to serve everyone.

379
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:41,709
A toast to all of you.

380
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:43,000
- All right.
- Come on.

381
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,542
- A toast to Shun Hua.
- A toast to Zhi Ting and Shun Hua!

382
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:47,083
Thank you, everyone.

383
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,495
- All right.
- Cheers!

384
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:51,000
Come on. Cheers.

385
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,584
Sit down and eat. Hurry.

386
00:23:53,584 --> 00:23:54,584
- Come on.
- Dig in!

387
00:23:54,584 --> 00:23:55,601
Don't just focus on eating.

388
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,000
You've got to drink too, okay?

389
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,167
Fill it up.

390
00:23:58,167 --> 00:24:00,110
Okay.

391
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,685
No.

392
00:24:01,685 --> 00:24:02,910
The kids can't drink yet.

393
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:03,999
Wait a couple of years.

394
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:05,972
Wait a couple of years, okay?

395
00:24:05,972 --> 00:24:08,999
Everyone, I'm so happy today.

396
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:10,827
Starting today, for a whole week,

397
00:24:10,827 --> 00:24:12,577
any resident of Sea Breeze Village

398
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:13,934
who comes to my restaurant

399
00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:17,300
will get one signature dish on the house.

400
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:18,999
Here.

401
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,176
Da Wu didn't show up today.

402
00:24:20,176 --> 00:24:22,693
- Hai Nuo.
- Is he upset?

403
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:23,893
I don't know.

404
00:24:23,893 --> 00:24:26,967
- I told you not to...
- Thank you.

405
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:32,259
It's delicious. It's good even when it's cold.

406
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:35,627
- Here.
- It's good even when it's cold.

407
00:24:35,627 --> 00:24:36,669
I'm really happy today.

408
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:38,933
- Yes.
- Hello.

409
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:41,167
Great. That's wonderful.

410
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:42,999
Applaud.

411
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:43,999
Are you all right?

412
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:45,419
Everyone...

413
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:48,125
- I'm fine.
- Come on. Cheers!

414
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:49,500
Wait.

415
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,751
This soup is good.

416
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:52,792
It sounds lively over there.

417
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,786
Are you having a gathering?

418
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,375
- Yes.
- You were in Taipei, so you don't know.

419
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:59,334
Chen Da Wu finally confessed to Hai Nuo yesterday.

420
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:01,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

421
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,702
Congratulations, Hai Nuo.

422
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,535
- Why isn't Da Wu here yet?
- Well, you all have fun.

423
00:25:06,535 --> 00:25:08,792
I'll get some rest.

424
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:10,799
All right. Bye then.

425
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:33,918
Hai Nuo.

426
00:25:33,918 --> 00:25:36,375
When will you invite us to your wedding?

427
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:38,459
I'll give 6,000.

428
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:40,292
- It's 6,000.
- You Cai.

429
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:42,584
Is 6,000 enough? Come on.

430
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:43,959
I'll give 12,000.

431
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,000
I'll give 6,000, too.

432
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,695
If you get pregnant, I'll add another 6,000.

433
00:25:46,695 --> 00:25:49,000
- Exactly.
- When will we celebrate your wedding?

434
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,910
All right. Stop teasing her.

435
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,334
Come on. We have to.

436
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:54,459
Congratulations.

437
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:56,999
Tea is fine instead of liquor. Come on.

438
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:59,417
I didn't hear how much money you guys are going to give her.

439
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:01,626
What's going on?

440
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,077
The groom has arrived.

441
00:26:03,077 --> 00:26:04,999
Da Wu is here.

442
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:07,175
It's over.

443
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,167
Chen Da Wu.

444
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:12,050
You're finally here.

445
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,459
- You've had too much.
- Are you drunk?

446
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:16,834
Da Wu, you're drunk.

447
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:19,999
- Quick.
- He seems drunk.

448
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:21,083
Why is your face so red?

449
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,209
Have you been drinking?

450
00:26:23,209 --> 00:26:24,810
Today, Shun Hua and Zhi Ting...

451
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,751
- Da Wu. Da Wu, you...
- Da Wu, are you drunk?

452
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,643
Da Wu, do you want to sit down?

453
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:31,042
Chen Fu Shou!

454
00:26:31,042 --> 00:26:32,768
What are you doing?

455
00:26:32,768 --> 00:26:33,966
- It's okay.
- Da Wu, talk nicely.

456
00:26:33,966 --> 00:26:36,407
What's wrong with you? Did you get drunk?

457
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:38,042
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

458
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:38,999
- Da Wu.
- Da Wu.

459
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:40,334
I have something to say.

460
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:41,834
- Okay.
- Okay, go ahead.

461
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,520
- Talk nicely.
- Go ahead.

462
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,834
Chen Fu Shou.

463
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:49,000
He is always so stubborn.

464
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,925
I got that from him.

465
00:26:52,217 --> 00:26:54,125
He is always decisive in everything.

466
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:56,419
I got that from him, too.

467
00:26:56,419 --> 00:26:59,175
He always thinks of the family first.

468
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:03,584
About that, I'm still learning.

469
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:05,452
Today, during the day,

470
00:27:05,452 --> 00:27:08,799
my mom told me something from many years ago.

471
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,594
I thought I'd be really angry,

472
00:27:11,594 --> 00:27:15,735
but when I think about all the love and everything my dad did for me,

473
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:18,678
those things don't matter at all.

474
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,342
I won't take them to heart.

475
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,384
Dad.

476
00:27:28,318 --> 00:27:30,175
Dad.

477
00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:33,259
I love you.

478
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:40,259
I love you.

479
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:45,676
That scared the life out of me.

480
00:28:11,735 --> 00:28:14,300
Are you happy now?

481
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:17,634
It's all right.

482
00:28:27,801 --> 00:28:29,943
Faking being drunk and pretending to sleep.

483
00:28:29,943 --> 00:28:32,759
Aren't you tired, Chen Da Wu?

484
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,933
Most men hold back their true feelings

485
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:44,636
because of their ego.

486
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:45,843
They're afraid of awkwardness,

487
00:28:45,843 --> 00:28:47,900
so they use being drunk as an excuse

488
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,461
to say what's on their minds.

489
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:52,202
Da Wu wasn't drunk at all.

490
00:28:52,202 --> 00:28:54,250
How do you know?

491
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,436
Come on. Who am I?

492
00:28:55,436 --> 00:28:56,927
I'm Fang Shun Hua.

493
00:28:56,927 --> 00:28:59,370
Chen Da Wu has been following me around since he was barely weaned.

494
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,509
Do you think I wouldn't notice?

495
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:11,509
What you said to your dad tonight was really touching.

496
00:29:14,302 --> 00:29:17,302
That was my real confession.

497
00:29:17,302 --> 00:29:19,203
Isn't that how it always goes in movies?

498
00:29:19,203 --> 00:29:24,009
A surprising ending, followed by one final twist.

499
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:34,160
Actually, I only found out today

500
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,799
that it was my dad who asked you to break up with me.

501
00:29:41,436 --> 00:29:44,077
He has always felt guilty about it.

502
00:29:44,077 --> 00:29:46,676
I hope he can let go of it.

503
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:52,426
So, you know everything.

504
00:29:59,186 --> 00:30:01,718
I want to apologize to you.

505
00:30:03,243 --> 00:30:06,842
Back then, I left you to deal with all the pressure alone.

506
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:11,900
It's all in the past now.

507
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,883
Plus, we were so young back then.

508
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:23,518
Didn't you ask me what was on my mind?

509
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:26,300
How could we break up without a word?

510
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,134
The regret

511
00:30:31,002 --> 00:30:36,925
of being forced apart has stayed with me all this time.

512
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:40,175
But now,

513
00:30:41,443 --> 00:30:45,676
I want to put an end to the past.

514
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,799
So...

515
00:30:55,042 --> 00:31:01,092
17-year-old Hai Nuo wants to tell the 17-year-old Da Wu,

516
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:06,419
"Thank you for always being good to me."

517
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:08,759
"I will never forget it."

518
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,799
"Please take good care of yourself."

519
00:31:13,876 --> 00:31:16,900
"Become the adult you want to be."

520
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,384
"I will work hard as well."

521
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:29,799
Okay.

522
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:32,634
It's my turn now.

523
00:31:39,768 --> 00:31:42,799
I want to tell 17-year-old Hai Nuo,

524
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:47,883
"Thank you,"

525
00:31:49,428 --> 00:31:52,300
"for telling me back then that I could become a doctor."

526
00:31:55,561 --> 00:31:59,883
"From that moment, I worked extremely hard in my studies."

527
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:04,800
"Even though it was tough being alone abroad,"

528
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:09,943
"I held on"

529
00:32:09,943 --> 00:32:12,426
"because of our promise."

530
00:32:21,035 --> 00:32:23,634
"Now, I've completed my mission."

531
00:32:25,085 --> 00:32:26,999
"I've become a doctor"

532
00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:30,342
"who lives up to everyone's expectations."

533
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:33,636
"17-year-old Hai Nuo!"

534
00:32:33,636 --> 00:32:36,009
"Do you see this?"

535
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:52,092
Thank you for always encouraging me.

536
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:55,226
And thank you for

537
00:32:55,226 --> 00:32:57,799
how we could truly like each other back then.

538
00:33:05,294 --> 00:33:09,800
I wish you the best, 33-year-old Hai Nuo.

539
00:33:12,177 --> 00:33:16,799
You and your grandma will always be my loved ones.

540
00:33:22,645 --> 00:33:27,951
I also wish the best for 33-year-old Da Wu.

541
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:31,050
You'll definitely find your own happiness.

542
00:33:44,068 --> 00:33:45,967
Help me down.

543
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,799
You're using me again.

544
00:33:52,412 --> 00:33:54,999
Why would you say that?

545
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,342
It's all because of you.

546
00:33:58,334 --> 00:33:59,867
- Let's go.
- Look.

547
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:01,999
Da Wu has grown so much.

548
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,417
He can carry me now.

549
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:04,999
Right?

550
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:06,083
Is that so?

551
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:09,175
Well, you made things so emotional.

552
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:12,250
Your dad drinks all day long.

553
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,801
Will his health get worse?

554
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:16,610
I have no idea. He doesn't listen to me.

555
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,134
My mom can't convince him either.

556
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:22,500
Then you should become a doctor.

557
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,626
That way, when your dad's health gets worse from drinking,

558
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:27,042
you can cure him.

559
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:30,842
And when my grandma gets sick, you can cure her, too.

560
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:39,776
[I'll take care of Li Hai Nuo forever]

561
00:34:42,744 --> 00:34:44,753
The reality show's viewership increased

562
00:34:44,753 --> 00:34:47,259
due to Tang Mi's participation.

563
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:51,452
Besides restoring Yin Mo's image,

564
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:53,951
Tang Mi's popularity has also increased.

565
00:34:53,951 --> 00:34:56,403
That's not what I care about.

566
00:34:56,403 --> 00:34:59,702
If the results don't meet expectations, it's all for nothing.

567
00:34:59,702 --> 00:35:03,676
Didn't you mention before that there's still a risky move we could try?

568
00:35:06,612 --> 00:35:10,834
But that move is too risky.

569
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:12,269
Business is like gambling.

570
00:35:12,269 --> 00:35:15,410
There are always risks.

571
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:18,676
This is your last bet.

572
00:35:31,318 --> 00:35:32,900
Yin Mo.

573
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,252
Good morning.

574
00:35:34,252 --> 00:35:35,877
Morning.

575
00:35:35,877 --> 00:35:38,217
Is this a good time?

576
00:35:43,502 --> 00:35:45,544
You know what?

577
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:48,169
Last night, I found out my social media

578
00:35:48,169 --> 00:35:50,586
gained over 30,000 new followers.

579
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:54,799
It has taken me so long to gain that many followers.

580
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:57,966
Thank you.

581
00:35:57,966 --> 00:36:00,883
From the start of my career,

582
00:36:02,184 --> 00:36:04,167
I've relied on your guidance.

583
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:06,443
You've helped me get to where I am now.

584
00:36:06,443 --> 00:36:09,718
I hope that in the future, I can be like you.

585
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:14,184
Like me in what way?

586
00:36:14,184 --> 00:36:17,134
Full of passion for acting

587
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:20,259

588
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:23,966
Honey.

589
00:36:23,966 --> 00:36:25,768
Yesterday, I heard You Cai say that

590
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:27,834
ever since Bai Yin Mo's rumored girlfriend

591
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:29,801
appeared as a special guest,

592
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:31,735
the filming hasn't been as fun.

593
00:36:31,735 --> 00:36:33,768
You Cai even said he doesn't want to join the filming anymore.

594
00:36:33,768 --> 00:36:36,103
Won't that be a problem with the producer?

595
00:36:36,103 --> 00:36:37,801
What's the problem?

596
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:38,995
If You Cai doesn't want to join the filming,

597
00:36:38,995 --> 00:36:42,052
I'll just talk to him.

It's a good thing, right?

Da Wu.

605
00:36:58,643 --> 00:37:01,353

00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:08,936
Bring this to him.

Who?

Yin Mo.

610
00:37:13,017 --> 00:37:15,735
But I'm not going to the filming today.

611
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:20,676
Didn't you say before that the filming pays well?

612
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:24,834
Did something happen during the filming?

613
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:26,735
No.

614
00:37:26,735 --> 00:37:28,867
I see.

615
00:37:28,867 --> 00:37:30,900
You can either keep it for yourself

616
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,511
or give it to him

617
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:34,867
when you see him later.

618
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:36,799
I'll get back to my work.

619
00:37:43,419 --> 00:37:46,342
Ever since the rumors about us started,

620
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:50,103
people have been overly polite to me.

621
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:55,050
But behind my back, they say I'm just an influencer,

622
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,925
using you to climb up.

623
00:37:58,834 --> 00:38:02,943
I don't know why, but it all feels odd.

624
00:38:02,943 --> 00:38:05,169
It feels empty.

625
00:38:05,169 --> 00:38:07,300
It's not what I imagined.

626
00:38:10,966 --> 00:38:14,509
I'm surprised that you feel this way.

627
00:38:17,711 --> 00:38:19,799
It's a good thing.

628
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:25,799
Actually,

629
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:29,217
everyone has the right to choose.

630
00:38:31,401 --> 00:38:34,768
However, if during the process of choosing,

631
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:37,386
you feel confused,

632
00:38:37,386 --> 00:38:39,801
lost,

633
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:42,175
or even the entire outcome

634
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:45,009
leaves you feeling empty,

635
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:48,883
then you may need to reconsider

636
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:52,300
whether this is what you truly want.

637
00:38:59,342 --> 00:39:03,335
No matter what, let's give our best

638
00:39:03,335 --> 00:39:05,259

you can start with breakfast.

644
00:39:30,546 --> 00:39:32,621
Because that's something

645
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:35,259
that once troubled me for a long time.

646
00:39:42,669 --> 00:39:45,403
I once despised the labels others stuck on me.

647
00:39:45,403 --> 00:39:46,901
Things like superstar,

648
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:50,735
arrogant, and difficult to get along with?

649
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:53,900
And spiky like a sea urchin.

650
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,459
However, I figured it out later.

651
00:39:56,459 --> 00:39:59,092
If I don't like them, I can just tear them off

652
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:00,900
and create my own.

653
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,603
