The temperature there is much colder than ours.

159
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,883
It takes a whole day to fly there.

160
00:12:22,883 --> 00:12:24,718
If we visit him in the future,

161
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:27,809
just taking plane alone will make our bones fall apart.

He didn't even complain, so why are you?

165
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,634
Did you prepare his favorite peanut brittle?

166
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,967
I already bought it.

167
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:44,050
Mr. Chen from Shengzu knows Da Wu loves it,

168
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,759
so he made it fresh just for him.

169
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:51,172
By the way, go to the post office tomorrow and withdraw our fixed deposit.

We need to transfer the money to Da Wu.

172
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:57,342
That way, he won't have to worry about running out of money.

173
00:12:57,342 --> 00:13:00,009
He can focus better on his medical research.

174
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:04,799
It'll set a stronger foundation for his future.

175
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,009
But you should see if your son will even accept it.

176
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:09,217
Why do you care if he accepts it?

177
00:13:09,217 --> 00:13:11,351
Just transfer it over.

178
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:13,967
That's a good idea.

179
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:16,259
He didn't take our money when he was studying abroad.

180
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:19,599
This time, we'll just transfer it directly to him.

181
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,551
After he leaves this time,

182
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:26,599
I wonder when we'll see him again.

183
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:36,009
You said you were going to see a friend.

184
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:37,592
Who is it?

185
00:13:37,592 --> 00:13:39,342
You haven't met her before.

186
00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:42,925
She left Kinmen during middle school and went to the UK.

187
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:44,800
She's an artist.

188
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,799
She won quite a few awards abroad.

189
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,184
She just moved back to Kinmen recently.

190
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,226
The door is over there.

191
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:33,426
I didn't know Kinmen had places like this.

192
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:35,017
Not bad.

193
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,892
And your work

194
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:40,384
is hard to describe.

195
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:42,342
Thank you.

196
00:14:42,342 --> 00:14:44,351
Did you take that as a compliment?

197
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:50,384
You've been staring at my paintings for so long.

198
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:52,509
It shows you felt something.

199
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:55,184
That's the best compliment for an artist.

200
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:00,518
Artists are quite self-assured, right?

201
00:15:05,217 --> 00:15:08,184
However, going with the flow is mediocrity.

202
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:14,100
What's important is how we carve out our own shape

203
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,698
in the course of history.

204
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:21,184
Have you achieved that?

205
00:15:23,342 --> 00:15:25,226
Have you?

206
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,902
Here we are.

207
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,799
Xu Man, we're here.

208
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,967
Hey.

209
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:45,175
He's my customer.

210
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:46,426
Sorry, you're...

211
00:15:46,426 --> 00:15:47,718
Bai Yin Mo.

212
00:15:47,718 --> 00:15:49,800
I know him. He's our tenant.

213
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,842
I'd also like to introduce you.

214
00:15:50,842 --> 00:15:53,759
- This is Chen...
- Dr. Chen.

215
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,800
Yes, Dr. Chen, Chen Da Wu.

216
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,009
Do you all know each other?

217
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:00,767
Kinmen is small, so everyone knows each other.

218
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:07,800
So, how does this painting make you feel?

219
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,799
How does it make me feel?

220
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,246
- Do you want to move these?
- Yes.

221
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,599
Okay.

222
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:15,342
I feel...

223
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:18,141
A blue sky, white clouds, ocean, and seaweed.

224
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:21,259
- Seaweed?
- Yes, seaweed.

225
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:26,676
A seemingly calm world with a feeling of entanglement

226
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:28,842
and struggle inside.

227
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:30,600
Interesting.

228
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:32,759
So, how's the weather in Kinmen?

229
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,693
It's pretty nice, right?

230
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,694
Mr. Bai, haven't you left yet?

231
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,342
Are you planning to stick around and help out?

232
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:39,634
No, I see you three are doing fine.

233
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:41,300
I'd better not get in the way.

234
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,134
Right, superstars think differently from most people.

235
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:47,925
Hai Nuo means you're not needed here.

236
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:50,599
Leave it to me. You can head back.

237
00:16:51,883 --> 00:16:53,134
Hey, great artist.

238
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:54,883
Is there anything I can help you with?

239
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:57,092
- My name is Xu Man.
- Sorry, Xu Man.

240
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:59,599
Is there anything else you need help with?

241
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:10,634
Is there any meaning behind such an arrangement?

242
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:12,718
No meaning at all.

243
00:17:12,718 --> 00:17:15,050
Da Wu, can you do me a favor?

244
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,718
When I cue you in a bit,

245
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:19,134
can you drive over these paintings with your car?

246
00:17:19,134 --> 00:17:21,217
Why would you want to drive over these paintings?

247
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:23,384
Aren't these paintings your hard work?

248
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:25,392
They're more like a burden.

249
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:27,509
Okay.

250
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:28,883
Though I'm not sure what it means,

251
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:31,883
dealing with death is my profession anyway.

252
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:33,850
I'll give them a proper send-off.

253
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:37,467
Weren't you asking me if I had achieved it?

254
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:38,799
Don't tell me you're going to destroy these paintings

255
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,175
because of what I said?

256
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:42,351
You seem to think quite highly of yourself.

257
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,092
Didn't you say before

258
00:18:09,092 --> 00:18:12,559
that someone was willing to pay a high price for these paintings?

259
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,883
After winning the awards, I got lost.

260
00:18:17,883 --> 00:18:20,809
I started creating based on what others found beautiful.

261
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:24,892
That made me lose the original purpose of painting.

262
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,467
One of the reasons I came back to Kinmen

263
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:36,642
was to find myself again.

264
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:52,059
We really burned everything completely.

265
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,967
Where are the two of them?

266
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:58,175
They're outside.

267
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,634
It seems like what you just said

268
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:04,759
had quite an impact on them.

269
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,799
One of them seems to be carrying

270
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,551
a heavy burden whether because of life or work.

271
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:12,799
The other one's burden

272
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,599
is probably the pressure from his dad.

273
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:19,759
How about this?

274
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,476
Let's use your painting to lighten up the mood.

275
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,059
How do you both feel when you look at this painting?

276
00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:43,799
It feels like muscle tissues and a colorful CT scan.

277
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,634
That sounds like what a doctor would say.

278
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:47,892
The blue muscle tissue means it's poisoned.

279
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:51,175
Come on. Imagination.

280
00:19:51,175 --> 00:19:52,892
Your turn.

281
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,892
Isn't it just waves,

282
00:19:56,693 --> 00:20:00,551
a blue sky, and clouds?

283
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:03,134
There's a sprinkle of sunshine.

284
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:07,259
It looks like a peaceful sea, but beneath the surface,

285
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:09,842
there's some turbulence.

286
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,092
That sounds a lot like what you just said.

287
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:13,300
No way.

288
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,676
Of course, you can't see it on the surface.

289
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:15,718
You might have to look at the back.

290
00:20:15,718 --> 00:20:17,419
- The back?
- Is there something on the back?

291
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:18,509
I was making a metaphor.

292
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,009
- I see.
- There's really something on the back.

293
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:23,800
For my dear friend, Nuo Nuo.

294
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,925
Me?

295
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:26,426
It's for you.

296
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:29,059
This painting is how I feel about you.

297
00:20:29,883 --> 00:20:31,175
Thank you, Xu Man.

298
00:20:31,175 --> 00:20:33,799
I was worried you were going to burn this painting, too.

299
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,509
I wouldn't have the heart to.

300
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:37,599
How about a drink, everyone?

301
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,799
Anything in particular you'd like to drink?

302
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,799
How about you make them a special Kaoliang cocktail?

303
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:47,559
Sure.

304
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,799
We're closing soon, so we can't let you stay long.

305
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,092
Otherwise, it'll affect our work.

306
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:08,799
She's inside. Feel free to look for her.

307
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,599
Thank you.

308
00:21:29,048 --> 00:21:32,934
Grandma, have you seen Mr. Bai's shirt?

309
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,925
I already washed it and hung it out to dry.

310
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:37,384
Why did you wash it again?

311
00:21:37,384 --> 00:21:39,676
There were still some stains on it.

312
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:41,502
The washing machine didn't wash it clean.

313
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:43,634
I've got some clothes here with stains

314
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:45,224
and some pants that need mending.

315
00:21:45,224 --> 00:21:48,800
Make sure you find time to take care of them.

316
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,852
Okay.

317
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:52,028
Mr. Bai might be busy,

318
00:21:52,028 --> 00:21:54,725
- So, he's not good at...
- He can't take care of himself.

319
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:05,476
Why does my face hurt so much?

320
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:10,799
You're awake.

321
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,142
Hey, last night...

322
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:18,642
Men often tend to avoid taking responsibility when they drink too much.

323
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,342
I didn't do anything to you last night, did I?

324
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:26,767
You're so single-minded in your thinking.

325
00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:37,592
Why...

326
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:39,300
Why does my face hurt so much?

327
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,599
I punched you last night. Don't you remember?

328
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:44,925
You guys fought last night.

329
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:47,509
Do you plan to continue this morning?

330
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:49,384
I blacked out last night.

331
00:22:49,384 --> 00:22:51,226
Why did we fight?

332
00:22:51,925 --> 00:22:53,683
Ask Li Hai Nuo.

333
00:22:54,676 --> 00:22:56,392
Ask Li Hai Nuo?

334
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,767
What did you do to her last night?

335
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:03,217
What? Do you like her?

336
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:04,698
- It's none of your business.
- Fine.

337
00:23:04,698 --> 00:23:07,986
If you won't admit it, I won't tell you what happened last night.

338
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:11,009
Keep talking like that and you'll really get punched.

339
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:12,467
Don't block the way, okay?

340
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:14,551
- What? Do you want to fight?
- Do you want to get hit?

341
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:16,175
- You have a bad breath.
- Come on. Hit me now.

342
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:17,660
- It stinks. Stop talking.
- Come on.

343
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,676
- Just do it.
- Shut up.

344
00:23:18,676 --> 00:23:19,967
- Go sit on the couch.
- Don't be too...

345
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:21,592
I'm definitely going to hit you.

346
00:23:21,592 --> 00:23:24,100
- You stink.
- You're screwed.

347
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,426
Today, it's either me or him.

348
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:32,184
How boring. Do I really have to film this?

349
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:36,217
Sit down.

350
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:37,559
What are you doing?

351
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,600
So, what are you competing in?

352
00:23:44,718 --> 00:23:46,599
Wait. I'm not ready.

353
00:23:48,634 --> 00:23:50,179
- What?
- Come on.

354
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,467
Is that all you got?

355
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:53,259
- Or should we play rock paper scissors?
- Come on.

356
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:54,259
Sure.

357
00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:56,642
Rock paper scissors.

358
00:24:00,342 --> 00:24:01,883
You should clip his face, not his ear.

359
00:24:01,883 --> 00:24:03,175
Rock paper scissors.

360
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,009
Should I put one more?

361
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:07,134
Rock paper scissors.

362
00:24:07,134 --> 00:24:08,725
Wait, I need to use the toilet.

363
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:11,142
Me, too.

364
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:16,551
That's Xu Man's room.

365
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:17,592
Where are you two going?

366
00:24:17,592 --> 00:24:19,600
Nuo Nuo, just leave them be.

367
00:24:22,134 --> 00:24:24,975
My goodness. Are you guys okay?

368
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,544
You're so ugly.

369
00:24:29,544 --> 00:24:30,643
No, you're ugly.

370
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:31,759
Idiot.

371
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,134
I'm heading back.

372
00:24:33,134 --> 00:24:35,634
Yes, me, too.

373
00:24:35,634 --> 00:24:37,599
Sit down.

374
00:24:40,883 --> 00:24:43,759
Up next is a little surprise.

375
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,759
Please take a look.

376
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,434
Let me tell you.

377
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,259
Back when I was a kid, my dad and I were really close.

378
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,226
He was really funny.

379
00:24:57,092 --> 00:24:59,975
But then there was a shipwreck

380
00:25:01,718 --> 00:25:04,017
and his best friends died.

381
00:25:05,676 --> 00:25:07,559
That was Hai Nuo's parents.

382
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,967
Ever since that incident,

383
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:16,799
he started drinking a lot

384
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,934
and completely changed.

385
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:21,642
He became very strict.

386
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:24,467
He was very strict with me.

387
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:26,226
How strict?

388
00:25:28,634 --> 00:25:30,226
Da Wu.

389
00:25:32,426 --> 00:25:34,017
Da Wu.

390
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,559
What about your parents?

391
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,476
What does that mean?

392
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,799
Are they gone?

393
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,925
Pretty much.

394
00:26:06,925 --> 00:26:08,800
Sorry.

395
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,559
Sorry.

396
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:14,392
My dad...

397
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:18,599
My dad really loved me.

398
00:26:20,551 --> 00:26:22,600
Then...

399
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:26,092
he had an accident

400
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:28,134
and passed away.

401
00:26:28,134 --> 00:26:29,892
He left first.

402
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,799
Later,

403
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,009
my mom got a boyfriend

404
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:39,384
and treated me like an ATM.

405
00:26:39,384 --> 00:26:40,883
Do you know what I mean? An ATM.

406
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:42,718
An ATM machine?

407
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:46,476
Does that mean the money you earned went to them?

408
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,017
That guy...

409
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:59,017
That guy lost all the money.

410
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:02,599
Do you know how much...

411
00:27:03,384 --> 00:27:05,599
Do you know how much...

412
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:09,600
Do you know how many TVs

413
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:14,351
you could buy with that money?

414
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,642
TVs.

415
00:27:21,551 --> 00:27:24,759
Why do you want to buy so many TVs?

416
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:27,134
It's just a metaphor.

417
00:27:27,134 --> 00:27:28,892
Okay.

418
00:27:32,342 --> 00:27:33,799
And then...

419
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,599
Right.

420
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,092
All right. It's fine now.

421
00:27:49,092 --> 00:27:52,426
I'll save up money from now on.

422
00:27:52,426 --> 00:27:57,342
I'll save what I earn and buy you a lot of TVs.

423
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,934
As many as you want, all right?

424
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,642
I'll buy you tons of TVs.

425
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:10,599
- Bros forever.
- Bros forever.

426
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,434
Happy ending.

427
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:18,599
Bros forever.

428
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:43,059
Last night...

429
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,599
We both...

430
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:48,509
drank too much.

431
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:50,676
Nothing happened.

432
00:28:50,676 --> 00:28:53,092
Erase it.

433
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:55,309
Last night never happened.

434
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,842
If you tell anyone, you're dead.

435
00:29:00,842 --> 00:29:03,559
You'd better keep your mouth shut.

436
00:29:16,426 --> 00:29:18,134
[Li Shu Man sent a photo]

437
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:19,799
[You are now friends with Li Hai Nuo]

438
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,050
[You are now friends with Xu Nuo]

439
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,592
[Good morning]

440
00:29:23,592 --> 00:29:25,599
Stickers from elders.

441
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:27,667
Not replying is rude.

442
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:29,642
But if I reply, it will never end.

443
00:29:49,342 --> 00:29:51,259
Why do you look so happy?

444
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:53,634
Has someone replied to your stickers?

445
00:29:53,634 --> 00:29:57,092
Let's see if you'll still laugh at my stickers.

446
00:29:57,092 --> 00:29:59,551
That person is pretty kindhearted.

447
00:29:59,551 --> 00:30:02,134
It's Mr. Bai.

448
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,599
I take back what I said.

449
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,599
I haven't seen you drink this much since high school.

450
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:11,799
It was a mistake.

451
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:13,259
Da Wu.

452
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:16,842
I heard from Mr. Hui that you bought a car.

453
00:30:16,842 --> 00:30:20,883
- Did he tell you?
- There are no secrets in Sea Breeze Village, okay?

454
00:30:20,883 --> 00:30:23,092
Then my dad will know soon.

455
00:30:23,092 --> 00:30:25,259
Why are you afraid of your dad finding out?

456
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:26,967
Furthermore, that car is...

457
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:30,092
That car is going to be my mobile clinic.

458
00:30:30,092 --> 00:30:31,426
So, you're staying in Kinmen?

459
00:30:31,426 --> 00:30:33,551
What's wrong? Don't you want me here?

460
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:35,467
No, it's just that

461
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,799
I thought you were doing well abroad.

462
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,518
Why do you suddenly come back?

463
00:30:40,426 --> 00:30:43,799
Don't ask about grown-up stuff, brat.

464
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:44,925
I'm already 25

465
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:46,467
and I'm a certified nurse.

466
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:49,226
Shouldn't I know more about my new boss?

467
00:30:50,342 --> 00:30:52,967
Saving lives is a doctor's duty.

468
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:55,883
So, what's the difference where I save them?

469
00:30:55,883 --> 00:30:58,599
Da Wu, you know what I mean.

470
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:02,842
Little shadow, you're such a nag.

471
00:31:02,842 --> 00:31:05,975
I'm hungover. Just let me rest for a bit.

472
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:08,316
All right. Get some rest then.

473
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:16,967
You're back.

474
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:18,842
Bros forever.

475
00:31:18,842 --> 00:31:20,050
Get me a glass of water.

476
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,642
Sure.

477
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:35,134
Xu Man already deleted the video you shot yesterday.

478
00:31:35,134 --> 00:31:36,850
Shouldn't you delete it, too?

479
00:31:37,718 --> 00:31:38,932
We're in Kinmen.

480
00:31:38,932 --> 00:31:40,850
Relax, okay?

481
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:43,799
I don't get what that means.

482
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:45,799
Delete it.

483
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:47,759
No way. The weather is so nice today.

484
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,934
Why worry about something so trivial?

485
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,799
Fine.

486
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:54,009
If you don't delete it, I'll just keep bugging you.

487
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:56,267
All right. Go ahead.

488
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:04,634
Ms. Li, could you please delete the video?

489
00:32:04,634 --> 00:32:08,059
Or else, I'll keep talking like this and annoy you.

490
00:32:09,883 --> 00:32:11,175
Are you mimicking me?

491
00:32:11,175 --> 00:32:12,883
Can't you tell? It looks so bad.

492
00:32:12,883 --> 00:32:15,426
You're even worse at it than I am. No way.

493
00:32:15,426 --> 00:32:17,392
That's totally your look.

494
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:19,718
Hurry up.

495
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:21,137
Here you go.

496
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:23,184
I already deleted it.

497
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:26,351
Right. I almost forgot to give you this.

498
00:32:31,175 --> 00:32:33,476
A package from Hong Xiao Guang.

499
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:46,799
Yin Mo, the reality show proposal is out.

500
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,551
I know you don't like digital files,

501
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:50,300
so I printed a hard copy for you.

502
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,799
Lily asked you to take a look.

503
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,092
About the tape you wanted, I really looked everywhere,

504
00:32:57,092 --> 00:32:58,799
but I just can't find it.

505
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,642
I'm sorry.

506
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,799
[Okay, thank you for your hard work.]

507
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:19,551
[Thank you for your hard work]

508
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:22,600
Boss sent me a sticker for the first time.

509
00:33:52,342 --> 00:33:54,384
Have you sobered up?

510
00:33:54,384 --> 00:33:56,434
I'm still a bit hungover.

511
00:33:58,092 --> 00:33:59,725
Why are you here?

512
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:05,240
Right. You blacked out.

513
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,642
Xu Man.

514
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:10,799
I'm really sorry.

515
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:15,725
Did I ask you to teach me how to paint yesterday?

516
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:20,059
Then why aren't we doing it in the studio?

517
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,850
Outdoor sketching?

518
00:34:23,509 --> 00:34:24,799
I get it.

519
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:26,217
You invited Bai Yin Mo, too.

520
00:34:26,217 --> 00:34:30,676
You want to paint our duel from last night, right?

521
00:34:30,676 --> 00:34:33,162
Come on. Give me a hint.

522
00:34:33,162 --> 00:34:35,883
I also want to contribute to Kinmen's healthcare.

523
00:34:35,883 --> 00:34:40,850
Did I invite you to paint my medical car?

524
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:48,165
As I mentioned, Da Wu has been abroad for so many years.

525
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:52,559
I'm really glad he's back to visit us.

526
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:53,799
Da Wu is really impressive.

527
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:54,799
He's so well-educated.

528
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:55,799
It's not easy.

529
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:56,799
Exactly.

530
00:34:56,799 --> 00:34:59,175
If any of you have any health issues,

531
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:01,799
make sure to consult him now while he's here.

532
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,799
Make the most of this quality resource.

533
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:07,592
Our son is truly exceptional.

534
00:35:07,592 --> 00:35:09,551
He's indeed exceptional.

535
00:35:09,551 --> 00:35:12,396
Didn't I have a bunch of scrapped old cars?

536
00:35:12,396 --> 00:35:14,899
He said he plans to turn them into medical cars.

537
00:35:14,899 --> 00:35:16,092
I saw how dedicated he was,

538
00:35:16,092 --> 00:35:19,467
so I sold it to him at a special price.

539
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:21,134
Medical cars?

540
00:35:21,134 --> 00:35:22,592
Did he say how long he's staying?

541
00:35:22,592 --> 00:35:24,799
He didn't mention any specific time.

542
00:35:24,799 --> 00:35:27,799
Your son is as humble as you are.

543
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:29,799
He said he can't treat everyone equally.

544
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:32,092
Instead of treating strangers,

545
00:35:32,092 --> 00:35:35,800
he'd rather take care of those who watched him grow up.

546
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,356
What?

547
00:35:38,356 --> 00:35:39,718
Well...

548
00:35:39,718 --> 00:35:41,634
Does that mean he isn't leaving?

549
00:35:41,634 --> 00:35:42,799
Maybe.

550
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:45,718
If only my sons were as exceptional as yours,

551
00:35:45,718 --> 00:35:47,092
that would be wonderful.

552
00:35:47,092 --> 00:35:50,017
Whenever I think of my useless kids...

553
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:53,424
What do you think?

554
00:35:53,424 --> 00:35:55,259
I don't know.

555
00:35:55,259 --> 00:35:57,634
Didn't we already divide the work?

556
00:35:57,634 --> 00:36:01,599
I'll do the fixing and you focus on making it look nice.

557
00:36:03,718 --> 00:36:05,351
Okay.

558
00:36:09,592 --> 00:36:11,184
Hello.

559
00:36:12,676 --> 00:36:15,267
Okay, I got it.

560
00:36:17,048 --> 00:36:19,040
Sorry. I suddenly have something to deal with.

561
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,099
- I'll leave this to you for now.
- No problem.

562
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:23,392
You weren't contributing much anyway.

563
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,842
Okay. Thank you.

564
00:36:25,842 --> 00:36:27,568
Hold on.

565
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:29,476
Wipe your face.

566
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:36,184
Thank you.

567
00:36:49,551 --> 00:36:51,509
Son.

568
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:52,718
Your dad has been good.

569
00:36:52,718 --> 00:36:54,551
He said he'd drink less once you got back.

570
00:36:54,551 --> 00:36:56,267
He really hasn't had a drink.

571
00:37:06,134 --> 00:37:08,009
Son, here's the thing.

572
00:37:08,009 --> 00:37:11,660
Your dad thought you'd be going abroad soon.

573
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,309
But then you bought that car.

574
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:15,800
He feels like he only hears about your plans

575
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,599
from other people.

576
00:37:28,009 --> 00:37:30,467
Honey, say something.

577
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:32,175
Are you too lazy to talk?

578
00:37:32,175 --> 00:37:35,599
Why don't you text me and I'll speak for you?

579
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,642
My stomach hurts so bad. I can't take it.

580
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:49,392
Without me around, let's see how long you'll keep up this silent drama.

581
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:57,145
Dad.

582
00:38:07,299 --> 00:38:08,759
Dad.

583
00:38:08,759 --> 00:38:11,184
I've decided to stay in Kinmen as a doctor.

584
00:38:12,175 --> 00:38:16,217
For now, I'll spend my mornings at Dr. Liu's clinic.

585
00:38:16,217 --> 00:38:18,718
In the afternoon, I'll run a mobile clinic.

586
00:38:18,718 --> 00:38:20,799
I know the elderly are afraid of seeing doctors.

587
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:24,134
Most of them wait until it's serious before seeking help.

588
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:26,800
So, I want to reach out first.

589
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,718
Even though there's a hospital in Kinmen now,

590
00:38:29,718 --> 00:38:31,883
even with you as an additional doctor,

591
00:38:31,883 --> 00:38:33,217
if someone falls seriously ill,

592
00:38:33,217 --> 00:38:35,175
that person will still need to be transferred out.

593
00:38:35,175 --> 00:38:37,009
It might not matter much to others.

594
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:40,175
However, it makes a world of difference to me.

595
00:38:40,175 --> 00:38:43,467
I don't want them to have to be transferred every time.

596
00:38:43,467 --> 00:38:45,134
If we reach out first,

597
00:38:45,134 --> 00:38:47,134
prevention is way better than cure.

598
00:38:47,134 --> 00:38:48,842
We can also do more health education.

599
00:38:48,842 --> 00:38:52,676
Wouldn't that reduce a lot of unnecessary tragedies?

600
00:38:52,676 --> 00:38:54,799
That's what public health centers do.

601
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,384
As the village chief, I also do that.

602
00:38:57,384 --> 00:38:59,259
You've studied so much but choose to stay here.

603
00:38:59,259 --> 00:39:00,509
Isn't that a waste of your talent?

604
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:02,685
I'm treating and saving people here.

605
00:39:02,685 --> 00:39:04,799
I have many friends and family here.

606
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:08,259
Why I can't take care of the people who are close to me?

607
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:09,551
Yes, exactly.

608
00:39:09,551 --> 00:39:11,799
Honey, I think Da Wu makes sense.

609
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:13,009
We also have aches and pains.

610
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:14,342
We need Da Wu, too.

611
00:39:14,342 --> 00:39:16,030
What are you talking about?

612
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,175
I'm perfectly healthy.

613
00:39:17,175 --> 00:39:18,667
I don't need him to take care of me.

614
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:21,667
Besides, you spent so many years working hard abroad

615
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:23,193
to finally get your medical license.

616
00:39:23,193 --> 00:39:24,799
Now, you're telling me you aren't going back?

617
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:28,342
Was all the worrying your mom and I did for nothing?

618
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:30,300
No, all that experience is still useful.

619
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,175
I gained a lot of clinical experience abroad.

620
00:39:32,175 --> 00:39:34,759
- These things...
- Come on.

621
00:39:34,759 --> 00:39:37,342
Can the money you make here compare to what you'd earn there?

622
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:38,799
If you're going to do this,

623
00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:40,643
why did you even study abroad in the first place?

624
00:39:40,643 --> 00:39:44,177
Wouldn't it be nice if your son wanted to stay close and take care of you?

625
00:39:44,177 --> 00:39:46,967
When I went out today,

626
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,799
everyone was so happy to hear that Da Wu is staying.

627
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:51,799
They all said as we get older, we need our kids nearby.

628
00:39:51,799 --> 00:39:54,300
They're happy, but I'm not!

629
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,142
Don't wait for me for dinner!

630
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:02,009
Son.

631
00:40:02,009 --> 00:40:04,092
You know your dad's temper.

632
00:40:04,092 --> 00:40:07,759
Call him later or send him a text.

633
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:08,799
I've got things to do.

634
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:10,642
I won't join for dinner.

635
00:40:17,592 --> 00:40:19,799
- Your fried octopus mouth.
- All right.

636
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:21,009
- The spicy stinky tofu is ready.
- Enjoy.

637
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:22,600
Coming.

638
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:30,509
Are you all right?

639
00:40:30,509 --> 00:40:31,799
Go rinse it off. I'll take over.

640
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:32,799
I'm fine.

641
00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:34,224
I got it.

642
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,718
You go handle your stuff.

643
00:40:35,718 --> 00:40:37,184
I'm good.

644
00:40:40,342 --> 00:40:42,300
- Stinky tofu.
- Thank you, miss.

645
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,969
- Please enjoy.
- Okay, thank you.

646
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:45,842
Okay, coming.

647
00:40:45,842 --> 00:40:49,226
- How much is it?
- The total is 1,200.

648
00:40:59,883 --> 00:41:01,925
Stop working.

649
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:04,426
It has been a long day. You must be tired.

650
00:41:04,426 --> 00:41:05,759
Sit down and eat.

651
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:07,892
It's your favorite stir-fried oysters.

652
00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:12,965
Today,

653
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:15,676
when I saw you working so hard even after getting burned,

654
00:41:15,676 --> 00:41:17,767
I really felt that...

655
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,967
If we work hard for a few more years,

656
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:24,718
I can grow this business and hire a bunch of staff,

657
00:41:24,718 --> 00:41:27,799
then you could just sit back and comfortably collect the money.

658
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:29,599
What do you think?

659
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:35,800
Maybe...

660
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,518
I don't want to work hard anymore.

661
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:42,450
It's okay.

662
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,518
I'll post a job advertisement online tomorrow.

663
00:41:45,259 --> 00:41:47,934
I'll handle it right now.

664
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,842
Hey, Da Wu.

665
00:41:52,842 --> 00:41:56,226
I want to ask you how to post a job vacancy online.

666
00:41:57,009 --> 00:41:59,351
All right, see you in a bit.

667
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,892
It's all set.

668
00:42:04,426 --> 00:42:08,599
Actually, there's something else I want to say.

669
00:42:10,799 --> 00:42:12,434
What is it?

670
00:42:19,551 --> 00:42:22,467
I made you some hangover soup. Hurry up and drink it.

671
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:25,134
Didn't I tell you I didn't drink?

672
00:42:25,134 --> 00:42:26,634
Well...

673
00:42:26,634 --> 00:42:27,634
It's all right.

674
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:29,799
Since the soup is already hot,

675
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:31,592
you should drink it while it's warm.

676
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:32,799
Drink it now.

677
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:34,259
Sit there and drink it.

678
00:42:34,259 --> 00:42:36,226
Quick, drink it.

679
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:47,799
Da Wu said he'll be really busy today.

680
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:50,059
He isn't coming home tonight.

681
00:42:50,676 --> 00:42:53,184
He isn't coming home tonight?

682
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,175
Tell him that if he doesn't come home tonight,

683
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,599
then don't come back ever.

684
00:43:00,467 --> 00:43:01,883
Gosh.

685
00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:03,642
Honey.

686
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:29,808
Is it okay?

687
00:43:31,799 --> 00:43:33,599
It's okay.

688
00:43:35,718 --> 00:43:37,600
It's really beautiful.

689
00:43:40,509 --> 00:43:41,599
Thank you.

690
00:43:44,759 --> 00:43:47,175
I'm leaving this part for Li Hai Nuo.

691
00:43:47,175 --> 00:43:48,759
Let her take the lead with you.

692
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:52,259
Her paintings give people a sense of joy and relaxation.

693
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:54,718
I hope everyone you care about who sees it

694
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:57,059
will feel the same way.

695
00:43:58,718 --> 00:44:00,925
I'm off now.

696
00:44:00,925 --> 00:44:02,599
Bye then.

697
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:07,434
Xu Man.

698
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:10,634
Thank you.
