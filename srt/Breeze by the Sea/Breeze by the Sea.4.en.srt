Don't you find it strange?

Why is this place called Kinmen?

28
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,999
This name actually dates back to the Hongwu era of the Ming dynasty.

29
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:37,334
Due to the geography of Kinmen

- Come on.

Does it hurt? But you said you were fine.

67
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:20,899
It's an old injury. It's not related to what happened this morning.

Well, do your parents know?

75
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,942
You're the first to know.

76

Your dad is going to be so mad.

77
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:53,800

- Then it will offer you a different sensation.

91

Every time Jing Liang's birthday is approaching, he gets all awkward.

103
00:07:35,592 --> 00:07:38,009
when his mom was still around in the past,

104
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:40,717
she would always cook a whole table of his favorite dishes for his birthday.

105
00:07:40,717 --> 00:07:42,009
I'm not good at cooking,

106
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,634
so I always end up getting him a cake.

107
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:48,299
Four dishes and a soup. That's so thoughtful.

108
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:50,299
Well, it's just a last-minute effort.

109
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:52,299
I hope it turns out well.

110
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:54,967
- You really don't need my help that day?
- No.

111
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:56,592
You've helped me so much.

112
00:07:56,592 --> 00:08:01,259
I hope to make it myself, so it feels more sincere.

113
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:02,299
Right.

114
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:04,550
Last time, you taught me how to make kimchi.

115
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,300
I tried making it.

116
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,051
It's outside. Could you come and take a look?

117
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:11,509
Sure.

118
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:15,299
I remember when you first moved back to Kinmen,
you didn't know how to do anything.

119
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:17,383
You couldn't even wash clothes properly.

120
00:08:17,383 --> 00:08:21,299
Now, you can cook breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

121
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:24,300
Look at you. You even make kimchi now.

122
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,550
That's impressive.

123
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,365
No, I still cook terribly.

124
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:31,134
Jing Liang barely likes what I make.

125
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:32,342
He still prefers instant noodles.

126
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:35,692
That stuff is so unhealthy.

127
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,967
When Jing Liang was little,

128
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:43,134
he used to follow me around everywhere.

129
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:45,176
Sometimes, he would even give me massages.

130
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:46,759
- He was so cute.
- Yes.

131
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,299
He was so cute as a child.

132
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:51,299
Now, he only smiles when he's with Yue Shan.

133
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,592
Teenagers' moods can be so tricky.

134
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:58,299
You have always been living for your child.

135
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:00,884
Once he goes to college, you'll have more free time.

136

Really? I don't expect much free time.

Of course I do.

162
00:10:46,783 --> 00:10:49,825
You know what? David Wong has been my idol since I was young.

163
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:52,699
Every time I play his music when I'm feeling down,

164
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:54,659
it's like taking a trip back in time.

- No.

It's a limited edition of only 500 copies.

173
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:16,492
I lined up for three days and nights. I can't sell it.

- One moment. I'm sorry.

Okay.

178
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:28,351
All right. I'll be right there.

179
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:29,599
Okay. Wait for me.

180
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:34,199
- Thank you. I'm sorry about that.
- Hey, what if I pay you...

181
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,909
If I pay you 150,000, would you sell it?

182
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:48,267
[Exit]

183
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:49,434
Officer, I'm sorry.

184
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:50,683
I'm his dad.

185
00:11:50,683 --> 00:11:53,599
Here's my ID.

186
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:56,226
- Okay. You may take him away.
- Thank you.

187
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:59,199
I'm sorry for the trouble.

188
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:16,599
Are you done?

189
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:19,492
One moment.

190
00:12:38,142 --> 00:12:41,302
I was wondering why were you up so early on a Saturday?

191
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,599
Turns out you're going to Taipei to see your mom.

192
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:49,725
Did you ever consider that she might have plans and not be at home?

193
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:51,559
Not at home?

194
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,599
Then why isn't she at this home?

195
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:57,118
Well...

196
00:12:57,934 --> 00:13:01,255
You... You haven't been in touch with her, have you?

197
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:03,599
She doesn't even know you're coming.

198
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:08,599
- How could she be there?
- I could've told her if you let me contact her.

199
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:11,242
It's all because of you.

200
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,396
There are things you don't understand.

201
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,434
Your mom...

202
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:20,642
All right. Let me ask you.

203
00:13:20,642 --> 00:13:22,683
Where do you plan to sleep tonight?

204
00:13:22,683 --> 00:13:25,267
At my online friend's place.

205
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:26,934
An online friend's place?

206
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:29,809
Do you even know the person? No, you... A stranger's place?

207
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,342
When you wake up, you might be missing an organ.

208
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:33,909
I'm not an idiot.

209
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:36,350
You lost your stuff the moment you left the house.

210
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,100
If you're not an idiot, who is?

211
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,819
You're so annoying.

212
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:44,283
Wait, Cai Jing Liang.

213
00:13:53,892 --> 00:13:56,351
Why can't you control your mouth, Cai You Cai?

214
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,767
Would it kill you to say a few words less?

215
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:01,826
What a big mouth.

216
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:13,683
Mr. Bai, you're still here?

217
00:14:13,683 --> 00:14:18,118
Well, did you hear everything?

218
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:22,199
I'm sorry about that.

219
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:29,767
I want to ask you something.

220
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:34,224
What should I do next about this situation?

221
00:14:34,224 --> 00:14:37,896
Give your mouth a rest.

222
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:39,897
You're straight to the point.

223
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:42,351
Me and my big mouth. I was regretting it just now.

224
00:14:42,351 --> 00:14:44,476
Get to the main point.

225
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:48,242
The main point...

226
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,599
How about I help you...

227
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:54,934
No, I mean, you help me with this one

228
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:56,897
and I'll fulfill your request.

229
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,200
Is that the main point?

230
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:03,184
Are you sure your son will listen to me?

231
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:07,309
Of course, you're straightforward and much more persuasive than I am.

232
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:09,191
Where do we start looking for him?

233
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:10,984
When he's in a bad mood, he looks for Yue Shan.

234
00:15:10,984 --> 00:15:13,434
We'll definitely run into him somewhere near her place.

235
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:15,476
Well, about the cassette...

236
00:15:15,476 --> 00:15:17,600
Don't worry, it's nothing. No problem at all.

237
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,434
- All right.
- Get on the ride.

238
00:15:20,434 --> 00:15:22,392
- Your ride is...
- My...

239
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:24,809
My ride seems to have a little issue.

240
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:27,742
One moment.

241
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:31,721
Well...

242
00:15:53,226 --> 00:15:56,434
Up until now, the number of subscribers has barely increased.

243
00:15:56,434 --> 00:15:59,809
Cai Jing Liang, did you tell all your friends to subscribe to my channel?

244
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:01,962
I did.

245
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:06,557
I even treated them to bubble tea. It cost me a lot of money.

246
00:16:06,557 --> 00:16:10,582
When will I ever reach 5,000 subscribers?

247
00:16:10,582 --> 00:16:12,097
Don't let Bai Yin Mo fool you.

248
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:15,389
Even if you get 5,000 subscribers, he won't hire you as his assistant.

249
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:17,724
Cai Zhen can vouch for me.

250
00:16:17,724 --> 00:16:19,157
Besides, he's my idol.

251
00:16:19,157 --> 00:16:20,392
There's no way he'd lie to me.

252
00:16:20,392 --> 00:16:23,178
And who are you to him?

253
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:26,338
How do you know he won't deceive you?

254
00:16:26,338 --> 00:16:28,909
I don't want to talk to you.

255
00:16:59,576 --> 00:17:01,372
What's wrong with you today?

256
00:17:01,372 --> 00:17:03,842
You seem upset.

257
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:09,161
I...

258
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,313
I...

259
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:14,176
I failed.

260
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:20,967
No way. Did you buy the ticket?

261
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:25,776
The worst part is, I lost my ID at the airport.

262
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:28,692
Why didn't you tell me? Come on.

263
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:30,567
Next time you go, you'd better tell me.

264
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:32,442
I'm serious. Got it?

265
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:33,734
All right.

266
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:36,692
It hurts.

267
00:17:36,692 --> 00:17:40,000
The police even contacted my dad.

268
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,275
Now, he's going to keep an eye on me.

269
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:47,167
I wonder when I'll get another chance.

270
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:51,400
Mr. You Cai is too much.

271
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,274
He won't contact your mom himself,

272
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:55,859
so why stop you from contacting her?

273
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:57,484
Every time I ask about my mom,

274
00:17:57,484 --> 00:17:59,190
he starts going off-topic.

275
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,109
He'd start talking about how
we're the descendants of "Seven Cranes"

276
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:02,899
and I have to get into a prestigious school
to bring glory to the family,

277
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:04,109
revitalizing the Cai lineage.

278
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:06,734
Look, I've heard it so many times that I've memorized it.

279
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:09,750
Does he still talk about that?

280
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:13,150
I'm sorry.

281
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,651
Hurry up and film.

282
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:16,067
After that, we can go home.

283
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:17,567
Let's do it another day.

284
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:19,899
I'm not in the mood.

285
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:22,734
Let's do it today.

286
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,941
Are you sure?

287
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:27,500
What do you want me to say?

288
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:31,498
Your birthday is coming up.

289
00:18:31,498 --> 00:18:34,126
How about your birthday wish?

290
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:40,442
Hello, everyone. Welcome back to "543." I'm Shan.

291
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:43,899
Today, we've brought you to Nanshu Park.

292
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:46,899
This is the latest popular spot in Kinmen.

293
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:48,417
It's called "Shouting Spring."

294
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:49,692
What's a Shouting Spring?

295
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:53,542
Let's have one of the visitors here give us a demonstration.

296
00:18:57,692 --> 00:19:00,499
Action.

297
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:04,526
My birthday wish this year

298
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:07,609
is for my dad to stop treating me like an idiot!

299
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:08,899
I can't take it anymore!

300
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:15,192
I hate him!

301
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:19,899
I hate him!

302
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:25,418
I hate him!

303
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,692
Let me get a shot of your face.

304
00:19:30,692 --> 00:19:33,256
Give me a smile.

305
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:36,209
I can't smile.

306
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:51,499
What now?

307
00:20:26,908 --> 00:20:30,289
My job and my marriage...

308
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:33,959
My entire life feels like it's drifting away.

309
00:20:35,454 --> 00:20:39,406
When Jing Liang first started middle school,

310
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,774
I called his mom.

311
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:47,016
I thought maybe she could check in on him or reach out to him.

312
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:50,875
But I heard a baby crying on the other end of the line.

313
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:55,450
She said it was inconvenient for her to stay in touch with us.

314
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,034
Later, she changed her phone number.

315
00:20:58,034 --> 00:21:00,800
I couldn't find her anymore.

316
00:21:01,534 --> 00:21:07,034
I never told Jing Liang about this

317
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:11,799
because having to grow up with a loser dad like me is bad enough.

318
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:16,367
So, I thought

319
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:20,159
it's better to let him think that I'm stopping him from contacting his mom.

320
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,909
If he's going to hate someone, let him hate me alone.

321
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,634
I don't want him to feel abandoned.

322
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:33,909
I originally planned to keep this secret with me for the rest of my life.

323
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:36,909
However, today, I'm really sad.

324
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:40,342
I can't hold it in anymore.

325
00:21:47,534 --> 00:21:49,159
I'm sorry.

326
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:53,134
It's an old habit. I talk too much.

327
00:21:57,534 --> 00:22:00,199
Why are you being so nice to me?

328
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:03,799
Aren't you annoyed by my endless talking?

329
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:15,426
Some things are hard to keep inside.

330
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:20,331
I understand. Constipation is uncomfortable.

331
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:21,603
Right.

332
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:25,742
It feels like constipation.

333
00:22:25,742 --> 00:22:28,742
Come on. Let's go to the Shouting Spring.

334
00:22:28,742 --> 00:22:32,799
They're still there. How can we go back there?

335
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:35,784
- Are you his dad?
- Yes.

336
00:22:35,784 --> 00:22:37,826
Are you the one who loves him the most in the world?

337
00:22:37,826 --> 00:22:40,283
- Yes.
- Will you never abandon him?

338
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:41,742
- Yes.
- That's right!

339
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:45,659
Shout out what you really feel and let your son know.

340
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:46,867
- Okay.
- Let's go!

341
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:50,718
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

[Shouting Spring]

343
00:23:02,992 --> 00:23:05,199

345
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:08,883
What brings you here?

347
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:29,784
Son, I don't think you're an idiot!

348
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,534
You're better than me!

349
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:33,199
You're more handsome than me!

350
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:37,784
I hope you live more freely and happily than I do!

351
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:46,883
I love you!

353
00:24:02,617 --> 00:24:04,699
Happy birthday.

354
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:07,384
I love you.

355
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:13,367
Are you crazy?

356
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:16,759
This is so embarrassing.

357
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:22,759
No, Jing Liang...

358
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:29,175
Jing Liang!

359
00:24:33,364 --> 00:24:36,331
Do you need me to call you a car?

360
00:24:36,331 --> 00:24:39,397
Obviously.

361
00:24:39,397 --> 00:24:42,496
Jing Liang!

362
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,575
Jing Liang!

363
00:24:44,575 --> 00:24:47,259
Jing Liang!

364
00:25:01,575 --> 00:25:06,784
I never imagined I could watch the sea with my idol.

365
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:09,506
It's so romantic.

366
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:12,397
We're just waiting for the car.

367
00:25:12,397 --> 00:25:15,551
It's still romantic.

368
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,766
Yin Mo, can I discuss something with you?

369
00:25:21,766 --> 00:25:24,676
Just say it from there.

370
00:25:28,697 --> 00:25:31,539
Can I negotiate with you about something?

371
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:34,430
It's too hard for me to reach 5,000 subscribers.

372
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:38,676
Can I do something else to be your assistant?

373
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:42,499
All right.

374
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,583
If you can get Cai Jing Liang

375
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:48,499
to say more than 20 sentences to his dad each day for 10 days straight,

376
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:49,792
I'll agree.

377
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:53,499
As long as I can make them talk 20 sentences each day for 10 days straight,

378
00:25:53,499 --> 00:25:56,350
I can be your assistant?

379
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:02,350
Does it count even if they don't reconcile?

380
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:06,542
Why do you care so much about their relationship?

381
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:09,684
It's none of your business.

382
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:24,517
My idol is a kind-hearted person!

383
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:34,500
By the way, are you and Tang Mi really...

384
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,499
What do you mean?

385
00:26:36,499 --> 00:26:38,499
Haven't you seen your own news?

386
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:43,187
Everyone is going crazy, saying you are dating each other.

387
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:45,251
Nobody knew who Tang Mi was before.

388
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:48,292
After the news broke, the whole world is talking about her.

389
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:52,099
Your rumored relationship really helped her a lot.

390
00:26:53,418 --> 00:26:57,167
How did Tang Mi do today?

391
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:58,499
She works really hard.

392
00:26:58,499 --> 00:27:02,126
Going from an influencer to an actress isn't easy.

393
00:27:02,126 --> 00:27:05,084
- She...
- She just needs a chance.

394
00:27:05,084 --> 00:27:08,892
Do you have to keep bringing this up?

395
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:14,292
I know you were the one who mentored me.

396
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:19,059
If I can help the artist you signed, I will.

397
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:27,350
So, are you guys really dating?

398
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:35,021
It doesn't work on Cai You Cai.

399
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:36,499
He's not willing to sell it.

400
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:37,693
Look online again.

401
00:27:37,693 --> 00:27:41,167
I have to get it in the next couple of days.

402
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:44,099
The car is here.

403
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,418
My hat.

404
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,459
Da Wu.

405
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:53,484
Yue Shan.

406
00:27:53,484 --> 00:27:54,860
Do you need a ride back?

407
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,499
No need. I need to stay and shoot some footage.

408
00:27:57,499 --> 00:28:00,892
Just take my idol back.

409
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:04,292
Bai Yin Mo.

410
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:06,500
There's a gathering at Sinda Temple Restaurant tonight.

411
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,917
Li Hai Nuo asked me to take you there.

412
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:11,042
Get in the car.

413
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:12,499
Thank you, Da Wu.

414
00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:14,934
No worries.

415
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:18,934
This way, please.

416
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:33,499
Let's start over.

417
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:37,418
Hello, my name is Chen Da Wu.

418
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:42,099
I heard you came to Kinmen to participate in a reality show.

419
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:46,908
I think your skills are quite good.

420
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:51,000
Is this from your acting training?

421
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,499
You're the same as Li Hai Nuo.

422
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:53,499
Yes.

423
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,875
We grew up together.

424
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:59,851
You both like to chat nonsense while driving.

425
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,033
I know you don't like me and you're forcing yourself to talk to me.

426
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:08,123
Don't you find it disgusting?

427
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:09,907
I'm starting to feel uncomfortable myself.

428
00:29:09,907 --> 00:29:12,665
Do you believe I'll hit you again?

429
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:15,726
But you don't dare to do it.

430
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:21,326
No need to force a conversation with me.

431
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,009
Just drive.

432
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:38,699
Hey, Mr. He just called to reserve a table.

433
00:29:38,699 --> 00:29:43,326
Make sure to reserve the freshest seafood for him.

434
00:29:43,326 --> 00:29:44,367
No.

435
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,700
Everything good today is already reserved.

436
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,284
Wait a minute. Didn't Mr. Chen cancel his table?

437
00:29:49,284 --> 00:29:53,534
Just give Mr. He the canceled table and the problem is solved.

438
00:29:53,534 --> 00:29:55,366
No, Da Wu is back.

439
00:29:55,366 --> 00:29:56,909
Everyone agreed to give him a welcome dinner.

440
00:29:56,909 --> 00:29:58,825
Help me pick out these vegetables.

441
00:29:58,825 --> 00:30:01,409
I know.

442
00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:02,699
How about we split it?

443
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:05,200
We can mix the premium dishes with some mid-tier ones.

444
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,284
That way, both tables get to eat well.

445
00:30:07,284 --> 00:30:10,242
- It seems fair, right?
- No way.

446
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:12,117
Da Wu rarely comes back.

447
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:13,360
Our restaurant is like his home.

448
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,699
We need to give him the best.

449
00:30:15,699 --> 00:30:16,699
Come on.

450
00:30:16,699 --> 00:30:20,009
He's not just here for one day.

451
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:22,576
Shun Hua.

452
00:30:22,576 --> 00:30:25,075
If you really want him to eat the best,

453
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:28,699
we can make it up to him tomorrow night.

454
00:30:28,699 --> 00:30:31,800
How could I even say that to him?

455
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:35,825
Just tell Mr. He that we're fully booked today.

456
00:30:35,825 --> 00:30:38,867
Ask him to come tomorrow.

457
00:30:38,867 --> 00:30:40,200
This is a big order.

458
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,134
But this is Da Wu.

459
00:30:49,492 --> 00:30:52,699
- Fried fish. Okay.
- You're here.

460
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:53,825
Hey, come here.

461
00:30:53,825 --> 00:30:55,950
Okay. No problem.

462
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,576
Okay, I saw it. All right, I'll give it to you later.

463
00:30:58,576 --> 00:31:01,618
- It has been a while.
- They're here.

464
00:31:01,618 --> 00:31:03,117
- This way.
- Da Wu.

465
00:31:03,117 --> 00:31:04,618
You came just in time.

466
00:31:04,618 --> 00:31:08,134
- It has been a while.
- Hello, Cai Zhen.

467
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,618
Here.

468
00:31:11,618 --> 00:31:14,034
The dynamic duo who took down the thief.

469
00:31:14,034 --> 00:31:16,492
Chen Da Wu, didn't I teach you well?

470
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:18,783
You never lose in a fight, right?

471
00:31:18,783 --> 00:31:19,992
Mr. Bai.

472
00:31:19,992 --> 00:31:22,409
I didn't expect a superstar like you to be so good at fighting.

473
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:24,699
You and Da Wu are evenly matched.

474
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:25,867
Eat as much as you can.

475
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:29,867
I'll go grab some of our signature dishes for you to celebrate. Wait for me.

476
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:32,034
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Shun Hua.

477
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:34,659
- One more...
- Okay. No problem.

478
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,825
Everything is super fresh. I just brought them today.

479
00:31:36,825 --> 00:31:39,909
Take your time. I'll cook it right away.

480
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:44,592
You two must've had a good chat on the way here, right?

481
00:31:46,492 --> 00:31:48,409
- Stir-fried instant noodles.
- Okay. Thank you.

482
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:49,699
Enjoy your food.

483
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,867
It's a specialty from Kinmen. It's called Buddha's hand.

484
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:53,075
Mr. Bai, let me tell you.

485
00:31:53,075 --> 00:31:56,534
- It's here.
- This dish costs over 1,000 dollars per plate in Europe.

486
00:31:56,534 --> 00:31:57,576
Shun Hua.

487
00:31:57,576 --> 00:31:59,445
Mr. Bai doesn't eat Buddha's hand.

488
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:01,326
He says it doesn't look light enough.

489
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:03,195
He doesn't like oily or salty food.

490
00:32:03,195 --> 00:32:04,576
He prefers boiled food.

491
00:32:04,576 --> 00:32:05,699
Just give him two boiled eggs.

492
00:32:05,699 --> 00:32:07,699
I had something earlier, so I'm not hungry.

493
00:32:07,699 --> 00:32:10,034
No problem. Boiled eggs, I'll make you two.

494
00:32:10,034 --> 00:32:12,284
- Have them with some liquor. One moment.
- Okay.

495
00:32:12,284 --> 00:32:13,699
Honey, two boiled eggs.

496
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:17,300
- I'm busy.
- All right. I'll handle it.

497
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:22,075
Well, since it's already cooked, why not give it a try, Mr. Bai?

498
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:24,159
Yes, give it a try.

499
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,842
It's very light and fresh.

500
00:32:33,992 --> 00:32:35,699
Why didn't you pick a smaller one?

501
00:32:35,699 --> 00:32:38,842
This size is just right.

502
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:50,284
Do you know how to eat it?

503
00:32:50,284 --> 00:32:51,699
That's not how you eat it.

504
00:32:51,699 --> 00:32:53,659
You have to peel it open from the middle.

505
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:56,299
- Let me show you.
- Show him.

506
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:01,659
See? Just like this.

507
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:03,032
Peel it this way.

508
00:33:03,032 --> 00:33:05,783
I usually use my teeth, but I can't use my teeth to peel it for you.

509
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:09,051
So, just suck it out like this.

510
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,541
It's delicious.

511
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:25,409
Come on. Be brave.

512
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:26,699
Yes.

513
00:33:26,699 --> 00:33:30,242
- Yes, that's it.
- It's really tasty.

514
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:31,699
I got it.

515
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:33,534
- Did you get it?
- How is it?

516
00:33:33,534 --> 00:33:34,534
Does it taste good?

517
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:36,200
- So?
- It's too greasy.

518
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,117
- Too greasy?
- I see.

519
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:41,299
But it's light.

520
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:51,943
- Hello?
- Hello.

521
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:53,326
Boss, I've taken care of...

522
00:33:53,326 --> 00:33:54,966
Cut the crap.

523
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,624
When will you send the tape?

524
00:33:56,624 --> 00:33:59,034
After I transferred the money, the seller disappeared.

525
00:33:59,034 --> 00:34:00,166
I can't reach him.

526
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:01,699
So?

527
00:34:01,699 --> 00:34:03,867
- Just in time.
- Let me...

528
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,534
The food is here. Please enjoy.

529
00:34:05,534 --> 00:34:06,867
Thank you.

530
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:10,089
- It's pretty good.
- Zhi Ting.

531
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,659
How much?

532
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:14,159
Well, it's 2,300...

533
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,409
- Zhi Ting, get me a bottle of Kaoliang liquor.
- Shun Hua, what are you doing?

534
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:20,367
- It's rare for me to be back.
- Yes, exactly.

535
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:21,783
It's rare for you to be back. Just sit tight.

536
00:34:21,783 --> 00:34:22,783
Let me treat you for once.

537
00:34:22,783 --> 00:34:24,963
How can I charge you since you come back rarely?

538
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:26,030
Mr. Bai isn't here.

539
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,967
He didn't eat the boiled eggs.

540
00:34:31,062 --> 00:34:32,239
One moment.

541
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,805
Come over.

542
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,592
Come over.

543
00:34:37,464 --> 00:34:38,649
What's wrong with you?

544
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:40,390
Da Wu is finally back and everyone is happy.

545
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,473
- Do me a favor, will you?
- Come on.

546
00:34:42,473 --> 00:34:46,372
You can't treat everyone every time when you think the vibe is right.

547
00:34:46,372 --> 00:34:48,113
How are we supposed to stay in business like this?

548
00:34:48,113 --> 00:34:50,774
We'll make money from others. Don't make money from our people.

549
00:34:50,774 --> 00:34:52,723
Others? There's no one else here.

550
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,758
Everyone in the Sea Breeze Village is one of us.

551
00:34:54,758 --> 00:34:56,816
Shun Hua, listen.

552
00:34:56,816 --> 00:34:58,029
No, you listen.

553
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,298
You just came home. How can I charge you?

554
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:03,550
- Come with me.
- No.

555
00:35:04,565 --> 00:35:06,042
Zhi Ting.

556
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:10,918
There are guests here. Please do Shun Hua a favor.

557
00:35:10,918 --> 00:35:14,999
All right, Zhi Ting. Let's go cool off.

558
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:16,125
I'll leave it to you.

559
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:19,351
Don't be mad.

560
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:35,257
I know Shun Hua cares a lot about Da Wu.

561
00:35:35,257 --> 00:35:39,999
But every time I see him there keeping up appearances,

562
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:44,125
I really want to strangle him.

563
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:46,417
Right.

564
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:49,667
But after you broke up, you still decided to live together.

565
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:53,125
Doesn't that mean you're used to each other's way of living?

566
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,999
I just can't stand his habits.

567
00:35:55,999 --> 00:35:57,648
She always drags her feet when we go out.

568
00:35:57,648 --> 00:35:58,999
She won't go out without makeup.

569
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:00,281
Also, she hoards stuff.

570
00:36:00,281 --> 00:36:01,834
She says it's cheaper because it's a flash sale.

571
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:05,375
She buys toner by the dozen without finishing them and they end up expiring.

572
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:07,334
She always nitpicks the little things I do.

573
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:09,000
He gets in bed without showering.

574
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,999
His socks are thrown everywhere.

575
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:12,459
He misses the toilet and doesn't clean up.

576
00:36:12,459 --> 00:36:15,626
She says I pee standing up and make the whole bathroom smell like pee.

577
00:36:15,626 --> 00:36:17,459
I do clean up, okay?

578
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:18,876
Also,

579
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:23,083
he eats a ton of garlic and burps right next to me.

580
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:26,626
I guess that does sound kind of uncomfortable.

581
00:36:26,626 --> 00:36:29,042
I'm trying to change the things she mentioned.

582
00:36:29,042 --> 00:36:30,792
Girls are like that.

583
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:31,876
But, look.

584
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:33,709
She told you to charge me today, but you didn't.

585
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:35,197
That's the one thing I didn't listen to.

586
00:36:35,197 --> 00:36:36,751
You're my buddy.

587
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:38,207
Why should I charge you?

588
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:40,942
Not only Zhi Ting, but I'm also getting mad now.

589
00:36:40,942 --> 00:36:43,683
I'm your buddy, but business is business.

590
00:36:43,683 --> 00:36:47,767
If I make you two fight again, I won't come here anymore.

591
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:53,667
Shun Hua is a loyal person.

592
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:55,787
As long as it's for a friend, he'd do anything.

593
00:36:55,787 --> 00:36:58,600
That's his good side.

594
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:03,500
That's true.

595
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,876
Back then,

596
00:37:04,876 --> 00:37:09,999
when I came to Taipei from Hong Kong, I always got bullied as a model.

597
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:12,709
He didn't hesitate and took me away.

598
00:37:12,709 --> 00:37:13,876
Exactly.

599
00:37:13,876 --> 00:37:16,959
Didn't you tell me that he got beaten up because of you

600
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:18,500
and stayed in the hospital for days?

601
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,999
That's why you came to Kinmen with him, right?

602
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:25,292
However, life and habits are different.

603
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:27,918
Living together and loving each other

604
00:37:27,918 --> 00:37:29,292
are also different.

605
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:33,709
You two are together because of love.

606
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,142
Right?

607
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,959
Because of love and because we're together,

608
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:42,209
we have to work hard to adapt to each other's habits,

609
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:45,999
not nitpicking every single day.

610
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:47,566
Just like these bean sprouts.

611
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:50,966
If you pick off the head and tail, they become silver sprouts, not bean sprouts.

612
00:37:50,966 --> 00:37:52,709
Then would I still be called Fang Shun Hua?

613
00:37:52,709 --> 00:37:55,164
You're contradicting yourself.

614
00:37:55,164 --> 00:37:57,892
Didn't you just nitpick her?

615
00:38:08,622 --> 00:38:10,887
Where did they go?

616
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:19,963
What's wrong?

617
00:38:20,657 --> 00:38:21,799
Mr. Bai.

618
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,975
Since you're here in Kinmen now,

619
00:38:23,975 --> 00:38:28,999
would you be willing to promote our Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor?

620
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:31,599
No.

621
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:36,329
How about this?

622
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:38,582
We'll invite Tang Mi, too.

623
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,372
I'll talk to the company

624
00:38:40,372 --> 00:38:46,142
and get you two to show up together as a couple.

625
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:06,859
All right, you kick it off.

626
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:11,399
Is this revenge for tricking you into going to Jiangong Island last time?

627
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:13,192
I'd forgotten if you hadn't mentioned it.

628
00:39:13,192 --> 00:39:15,775
But don't worry, I'll definitely get back at you for that.

629
00:39:15,775 --> 00:39:18,399
What are you doing in Kinmen?

630
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:22,093
Ever since you got here, all our lives have been messed up.

631
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,567
Have they?

632
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:26,650
You caused Ms. Shu Man to get hurt.

633
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,333
You ran away from home and made Mr. Fu Shou gather everyone to settle you down.

634
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,775
You even fought with Da Wu, and now you made my dad go to Shouting Spring.

635
00:39:32,775 --> 00:39:34,826
Isn't that so?

636
00:39:34,826 --> 00:39:35,885
What are you angry about?

637
00:39:35,885 --> 00:39:38,734
Your dad loves you. Is that embarrassing?

638
00:39:38,734 --> 00:39:41,984
Don't interfere in our family affairs.

639
00:39:41,984 --> 00:39:45,227
Who do you think you are?

640
00:39:45,227 --> 00:39:47,999
You don't know anything.

641
00:39:52,692 --> 00:39:55,667
Cai Jing Liang.

642
00:39:56,399 --> 00:39:58,999
Cai Jing Liang.

643
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:05,999
Do you know what your dad meant by giving you that name?

644
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,399
"A life filled with bright scenery."

645
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:17,067
What are you laughing at?

646
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:19,109
Do you know that right now,

647
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:23,000
your dad's scenery is filled with darkness and loneliness?

648
00:40:23,817 --> 00:40:26,234
If it weren't for your rebellion and selfishness,

649
00:40:26,234 --> 00:40:28,986
your dad wouldn't have to live so humbly and lacking in confidence.

650
00:40:28,986 --> 00:40:31,567
How would you know?

651
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:34,442
You don't have empathy, but you should at least have some observational skills.

652
00:40:34,442 --> 00:40:36,359
What happened to your observational skills?

653
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:37,977
When you were making videos for your girlfriend,

654
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,626
have you thought about what your dad has done for you?

655
00:41:06,775 --> 00:41:08,400
You don't have to say that to me.

656
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,366
Okay.

657
00:41:10,366 --> 00:41:12,399
I won't say anything.

658
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:14,900
I won't interfere in your family matters.

659
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,442
And you don't need to talk to your dad.

660
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:22,375
As for your girlfriend, she doesn't need to work for me.

661
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:26,399
What do you mean?

662
00:41:26,399 --> 00:41:28,326
Are you threatening me?

663
00:41:28,326 --> 00:41:31,026
You should be more concerned about your dad.

664
00:41:31,026 --> 00:41:34,399
Maybe the only thing that can brighten his life now

665
00:41:34,399 --> 00:41:37,292
is you,

666
00:41:38,151 --> 00:41:40,999
Cai Jing Liang.
