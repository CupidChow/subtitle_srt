00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:32,408
Jing Liang.

186
00:18:32,408 --> 00:18:34,708
Looks like he has found his calling.

187
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,865
This one of the village chief...

188
00:18:46,865 --> 00:18:48,866
You must've helped him a lot, right?

189
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:50,658
I helped with the sketching.

190
00:18:50,658 --> 00:18:53,375
Probably 90 percent was sketching, right?

191
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:58,865
Turns out Shun Hua has got some artistic talent, too.

192
00:18:58,865 --> 00:19:01,134
Zhi Ting helped him out.

193
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:02,865
Then it must be 100 percent her work.

194
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:05,791
- Their styles are identical.
- They're exactly the same.

195
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:09,865
Wait.

196
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:13,799
Da Wu's drawing shouldn't get a passing grade.

197
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,916
I think it's pretty cute.

198
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:23,459
Mrs. Chen.

199
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:25,749
Cai Zhen's drawing is good, too.

200
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,083
This is the big family of Sea Breeze Village.

201
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:49,241
Hey, Mr. Bai.

202
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:51,408
Hey, it has been a while.

203
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:53,241
- Superstar.
- Mr. Bai.

204
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:54,844
- How have you been?
- Mr. Bai.

205
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:56,426
Gosh, you're looking great.

206
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:58,059
It has been a while.

207
00:19:58,059 --> 00:19:59,075
It has been a while for everyone.

208
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:00,865
I've never seen this before.

209
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:01,865
It's all right.

210
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:03,949
- Bro.
- Bro.

211
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:05,865
- It has been a while.
- It has been a while.

212
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:08,793
I'm glad you could come back. This is great.

213
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:10,502
[Six Months Ago]

214
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:13,075
What beautiful flowers.

215
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:14,908
- Thank you for coming.
- Mr. Fu Shou.

216
00:20:14,908 --> 00:20:17,116
Ms. Shuman.

217
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,116
Ms. Shu Man.

218
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,366
Is it about to start?

219
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:21,450
- Almost.
- Soon.

220
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,450
Fu Shou.

221
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,799
Does this outfit seem too casual?

222
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,784
Grandma, you're wearing the dress my dad gave you,

223
00:20:28,784 --> 00:20:29,865
the brooch my mom gave you,

224
00:20:29,865 --> 00:20:31,991
and the earrings I gave you.

225
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:33,865
And the bracelet your grandpa gave me.

226
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,865
Yes, you're decked out in gifts from our family.

227
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:36,908
You look perfect.

228
00:20:36,908 --> 00:20:38,283
That's right, Ms. Shu Man.

229
00:20:38,283 --> 00:20:40,865
Your outfit today is very meaningful.

230
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,865
It's really beautiful.

231
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:45,916
- Thank you.
- Come on. We'll take you in.

232
00:20:46,617 --> 00:20:48,832
Now, let's invite the county magistrate to present

233
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:51,665
the Annual Model Mother Award.

234
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:56,200
The first recipient

235
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,116
is Ms. Lu Shu Man from Sea Breeze Village.

236
00:20:58,116 --> 00:21:00,375
Please come to the stage to receive the award.

237
00:21:01,116 --> 00:21:03,791
- Ms. Shu Man.
- Ms. Shu Man.

238
00:21:15,492 --> 00:21:18,292
Family members, please come on stage to present flowers.

239
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:30,865
Ms. Shu Man, I'm serious.

240
00:21:30,865 --> 00:21:35,700
Today, among all the model mothers attending the event,

241
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,865
you're the most outstanding.

242
00:21:36,865 --> 00:21:39,241
What a sweet talker.

243
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:42,158
It's such an honor for our family to have a model mother.

244
00:21:42,158 --> 00:21:43,200
Exactly.

245
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,533
Today is such a special day. We have to take a photo.

246
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:47,069
Da Wu, why are you standing there? Come and take a photo.

247
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:48,784
Okay, you two take one first.

248
00:21:48,784 --> 00:21:51,033
- Come on.
- There's nothing extraordinary about me.

249
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:53,208
I'm just lucky

250
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:55,991
to have such a wonderful granddaughter

251
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:58,875
and so many good friends at Sea Breeze Village.

252
00:21:59,991 --> 00:22:01,991
I've had a very happy life.

253
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:04,125
I have no regrets.

254
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:09,116
Come on. Look at the camera and smile.

255
00:22:09,116 --> 00:22:12,300
Three, two, one.

256
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,799
- Da Wu, take a few more photos.
- Okay.

257
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,200
Make sure to show your teeth when you smile.

258
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,617
All right. One more.

259
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:20,158
Three, two, one.

260
00:22:20,158 --> 00:22:22,666
Ms. Shu Man, you look amazing today.

261
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,184
I definitely need to take a few more.

262
00:22:25,184 --> 00:22:27,366
Here. From this angle.

263
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:29,866
- It's so special.
- Three, two, one.

264
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:30,908
Okay.

265
00:22:30,908 --> 00:22:32,866
Let's try a shot from a low angle.

266
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:34,665
Perfect.

267
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:36,075
Fu Shou.

268
00:23:36,075 --> 00:23:39,467
I love listening to your broadcasts about local news.

269
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:43,325
In my heart, not only are you a perfect village chief,

270
00:23:43,325 --> 00:23:45,575
but you're also like a son to me.

271
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:46,865
Hui Fang.

272
00:23:46,865 --> 00:23:51,075
Fu Shou has quit drinking and Da Wu is back.

273
00:23:51,075 --> 00:23:54,208
Your life is going to get better and better.

274
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,658
Shun Hua.

275
00:23:56,658 --> 00:23:58,908
Soon, you'll be holding a spatula in one hand

276
00:23:58,908 --> 00:24:01,325
and a diaper in the other.

277
00:24:01,325 --> 00:24:05,116
I believe you'll do a great job.

278
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:06,676
Zhi Ting.

279
00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:09,709
You've found the man who loves you the most

280
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:12,325
and you're going to be a mother soon.

281
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,375
Congratulations.

282
00:24:17,949 --> 00:24:18,991
Cai Zhen.

283
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:24,000
You work really hard, but you should drink less.

284
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:27,865
You Cai.

285
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:29,617
Not only are you talented,

286
00:24:29,617 --> 00:24:32,865
but you're also an amazing father.

287
00:24:32,865 --> 00:24:33,865
Jing Liang.

288
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:35,492
You're becoming more mature

289
00:24:35,492 --> 00:24:38,665
and I'm sure you'll be a great adult someday.

290
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,865
Yue Shan.

291
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:45,575
Be brave and step forward.

292
00:24:45,575 --> 00:24:48,033
I hope all your dreams come true.

293
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:49,784
Xiu E.

294
00:24:49,784 --> 00:24:53,241
Yue Shan will take good care of you,

295
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,625
but you should also take care of yourself.

296
00:24:58,617 --> 00:24:59,865
Xu Man.

297
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,766
Learning to paint with you

298
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,458
has brought me so much peace and fulfillment.

299
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,865
Da Wu.

300
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:15,426
I see you as my own grandson.

301
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:18,292
You came back to Kinmen to take care of everyone.

302
00:25:19,158 --> 00:25:22,083
I'm so proud of you.

303
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:28,542
Yin Mo.

304
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:32,500
In my heart, you aren't a superstar.

305
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,634
You're a warm and kind person.

306
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,665
Thank you for being with us.

307
00:25:39,634 --> 00:25:41,283
Nuo Nuo.

308
00:25:41,283 --> 00:25:43,459
My ordinary life

309
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:47,200
has become so meaningful because of you.

310
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,742
Every day is filled with happiness.

311
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:54,709
You're the most important person in my life.

312
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:58,584
I love you so, so much.

313
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
During the first three months,

314
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,759
Hai Nuo hardly ever left the house.

315
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:25,832
After the guesthouse reopened,

316
00:26:25,832 --> 00:26:28,766
she'd occasionally stop by my shop to buy coffee for the guests.

317
00:26:28,766 --> 00:26:32,116
However, she still wasn't doing well.

318
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:34,799
Later on, I thought I'd write some articles

319
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,643
in memory of Ms. Shu Man.

320
00:26:36,643 --> 00:26:37,969
When I showed them to her,

321
00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:40,865
she smashed the cups in the shop.

322
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,048
Right.

323
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,191
I once told Hai Nuo

324
00:26:45,191 --> 00:26:47,200
that Ms. Shu Man had mentioned

325
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,366
that the corner at the intersection was too dark

326
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:50,865
and needed a streetlight.

327
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:53,408
I said that we were lucky to have Ms. Shu Man.

328
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:56,958
But she kicked me out before I could even finish my sentence.

329
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,766
One day, Hai Nuo came to my studio

330
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:04,241
and happened to see me hanging up her grandma's painting.

331
00:27:04,241 --> 00:27:06,665
She turned around and left immediately.

332
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,125
You can't bring up her grandma around her.

333
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:11,991
I accidentally mentioned the time

334
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:14,610
you and her grandma went camping.

335
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,832
She punched me right away.

336
00:27:16,832 --> 00:27:18,865
I've never seen her like that.

337
00:27:18,865 --> 00:27:22,866
That's not all.

338
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:26,865
Our restaurant is working on a new dish,

339
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:28,241
"Grandma's Butter Crab".

340
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:29,932
I thought of inviting her to try it.

341
00:27:29,932 --> 00:27:31,799
But before I could even finish saying the name,

342
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:35,250
she punched me right away as soon as she heard the word "grandma".

343
00:27:36,492 --> 00:27:38,333
When dealing with Ms. Shu Man's funeral,

344
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,866
Hai Nuo was so calm.

345
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,575
She didn't shed a single tear.

346
00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:45,726
Keeping it all bottled up isn't good for her.

347
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:48,766
Yes, if this continues, she'll end up getting sick.

348
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:51,865
Mr. Bai, we really don't know what else to do.

349
00:27:51,865 --> 00:27:55,166
That's why we asked for your help.

350
00:28:05,865 --> 00:28:08,158
Is there something you need?

351
00:28:08,158 --> 00:28:09,866
I've been trying to remember,

352
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:11,033
but I've forgotten again.

353
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:12,949
Have you forgotten how to get home?

354
00:28:12,949 --> 00:28:14,575
The owner of the guesthouse is there.

355
00:28:14,575 --> 00:28:17,832
Go inside and call your family to come pick you up.

356
00:28:17,832 --> 00:28:20,665
Grandma, why are you standing there?

357
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,667
He is Hong Xiao Guang's boss, Bai Yin Mo.

358
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:24,865
He's our guest.

359
00:28:24,865 --> 00:28:26,283
Yes.

360
00:28:26,283 --> 00:28:27,283
Bai Yin Mo.

361
00:28:27,283 --> 00:28:29,325
Gosh, I tried to remember but still forgot.

362
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:33,033
Mr. Bai, welcome to our guesthouse.

363
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:34,792
I got drunk last night.

364
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:37,865
I heard that you carried me back.

365
00:28:37,865 --> 00:28:39,158
I'm really sorry.

366
00:28:39,158 --> 00:28:41,450
Next time, you carry me.

367
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,742
You owe me one.

368
00:28:43,742 --> 00:28:46,658
Sure. No problem.

369
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,865
I'll prepare my own food for tomorrow.

370
00:28:48,865 --> 00:28:51,092
You aren't going to burn down my kitchen, right?

371
00:28:51,092 --> 00:28:55,617
No, I won't. Tomorrow, I'll...

372
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:57,116
I'll choose a bigger pot tomorrow

373
00:28:57,116 --> 00:28:58,991
and I might fill it with water up to here,

374
00:28:58,991 --> 00:29:02,865
so the water will cover the eggs.

375
00:29:02,865 --> 00:29:06,575
I know your gas stove might need four clicks, right?

376
00:29:06,575 --> 00:29:09,759
After four clicks, the flame will get a little stronger.

377
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,832
And don't turn it in the one o'clock direction.

378
00:29:11,832 --> 00:29:14,075
It should be four o'clock instead, so...

379
00:29:14,075 --> 00:29:16,949
I was just messing with you.

380
00:29:16,949 --> 00:29:18,200
Yin Mo, look.

381
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,116
I've patched it up for you.

382
00:29:20,116 --> 00:29:22,865
Torn clothes bring bad luck and can affect your career.

383
00:29:22,865 --> 00:29:25,033
You're a superstar. You should dress nicely.

384
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:26,408
- I'm taking it apart.
- I'm wearing it.

385
00:29:26,408 --> 00:29:28,250
I'm...

386
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:35,584
- He's mad.
- Well...

387
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:37,865
Don't be mad.

388
00:29:37,865 --> 00:29:40,325
If you want to wear it...

389
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:43,617
Then go ahead and wear it.

390
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:45,250
Come on.

391
00:29:55,617 --> 00:30:00,375
Your cooking is the worst in the entire world.

392
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:03,685
I understand now.

393
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:04,700
Is it bad?

394
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,075
Even if it's bad, you still have to eat it.

395
00:30:06,075 --> 00:30:08,250
- Here.
- All right.

396
00:30:13,408 --> 00:30:15,949
After you've settled everything back home,

397
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:18,408
make sure to come visit us again.

398
00:30:18,408 --> 00:30:22,799
I'll cook something even worse for you next time.

399
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,665
Okay.

400
00:30:47,865 --> 00:30:50,833
It's okay. Let's go home.

401
00:31:12,866 --> 00:31:16,417
[David Wong]

402
00:32:16,974 --> 00:32:19,000
I've already watered it.

403
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:23,708
I've watered that one, too.

404
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,208
It's okay. We'll have more water today.

405
00:32:37,784 --> 00:32:39,584
Hey.

406
00:32:41,408 --> 00:32:43,158
What?

407
00:32:43,158 --> 00:32:45,292
I know how to do this.

408
00:32:51,865 --> 00:32:54,791
Separate recyclables from the regular trash.

409
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,125
Sorry.

410
00:33:31,575 --> 00:33:34,083
If you don't know how to do it, don't mess with it.

411
00:33:37,366 --> 00:33:39,542
I can learn from you.

412
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:28,292
From now on, I'll check the pockets before doing laundry.

413
00:34:29,832 --> 00:34:31,665
Thank you.

414
00:35:12,366 --> 00:35:15,083
- Your popcorn is ready.
- Thank you.

415
00:35:18,342 --> 00:35:20,241
Ms. Hui Fang, I'm here. Where are you?

416
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:22,450
Hey, Dad. I'm here.

417
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,200
Why did you suddenly ask me to watch a movie today?

418
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,217
It's okay. Take your time.

419
00:35:26,217 --> 00:35:27,982
How much longer?

420
00:35:27,982 --> 00:35:29,865
Next one?

421
00:35:29,865 --> 00:35:31,865
It's too late.

422
00:35:31,865 --> 00:35:34,208
- Bye.
- Da Wu.

423
00:35:35,158 --> 00:35:37,075
Xu Man, you...

424
00:35:37,075 --> 00:35:38,825
You came to watch a movie too?

425
00:35:38,825 --> 00:35:41,665
Your mom invited me to a movie.

426
00:35:47,866 --> 00:35:51,658
My dad said he had something to do and can't make it.

427
00:35:51,658 --> 00:35:53,033
Your mom said she needs to accompany your dad,

428
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:55,166
so she's not coming either.

429
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:58,665
We've been set up.

430
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,949
We've got the whole place to ourselves.

431
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:06,708
Yes, so don't have high hopes for this movie.

432
00:36:10,592 --> 00:36:12,865
Did you silence your phone?

433
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:14,426
Does it matter?

434
00:36:14,426 --> 00:36:15,718
We've got the place to ourselves.

435
00:36:15,718 --> 00:36:18,325
Come on. It's out of respect for the movie.

436
00:36:18,325 --> 00:36:21,666
Man... Of course I turned it off.

437
00:37:13,158 --> 00:37:18,366
I truly hope our son ends up with Xu Man.

438
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:20,241
Whenever I go to Xu Man's place to learn painting,

439
00:37:20,241 --> 00:37:23,075
I think they're such a good match.

440
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:28,417
But dear, Da Wu always puts work first.

441
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:29,865
That won't do.

442
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:32,200
We need to find a way to give them a push.

443
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,241
Anyway,

444
00:37:33,241 --> 00:37:36,408
whenever we can, we'll just gently nudge them a bit

445
00:37:36,408 --> 00:37:38,908
and push them closer.

446
00:37:38,908 --> 00:37:39,941
I have a feeling

447
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:42,908
that they'll naturally end up together.

448
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:44,283
Okay.

449
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:49,200
Why are you back so soon?

450
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,784
Yes, why so soon?

451
00:37:50,784 --> 00:37:52,908
A movie is an hour and a half and it takes twenty minutes to get home.

452
00:37:52,908 --> 00:37:55,700
- Is that fast?
- Of course, it's fast.

453
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,075
The theater has so many movies.

454
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:58,865
You can watch one and then another.

455
00:37:58,865 --> 00:38:00,865
Yes, or you can have dinner after the movie

456
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:02,075
and then go to the beach to enjoy the night view.

457
00:38:02,075 --> 00:38:05,158
Then grab a drink and talk about your feelings, right?

458
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,208
You can discuss how you'll cooperate in the future.

459
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:10,366
Dad, are you asking me to copy the way you wooed Mom back in the day?

460
00:38:10,366 --> 00:38:11,658
It doesn't have to be that way.

461
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:14,509
You can be creative with it.

462
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:16,667
Dad, Mom, let me tell you.

463
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:19,634
This is something you don't need to worry about for me.

464
00:38:19,634 --> 00:38:20,865
True.

465
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,865
You're bold like me, right?

466
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:25,584
Like father, like son.

467
00:38:27,892 --> 00:38:28,949
Really?

468
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:31,033
I remember you pursued me for a long time.

469
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:32,908
In the end, I had to gather the courage

470
00:38:32,908 --> 00:38:34,408
to ask you out myself.

471
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:35,408
Right?

472
00:38:35,408 --> 00:38:37,949
After all these years, are you sure you remember that right?

473
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,200
How could I possibly get that wrong?

474
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,283
I still remember your expression.

475
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:41,533
All right.

476
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:44,158
You two can take your time figuring out who pursued who.

477
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:45,916
I'm heading in first.

478
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,949
Don't forget what I said.

479
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:51,700
Find a chance and give him a push.

480
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,665
Me? Give him a push?

481
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:19,116
I feel really touched.

482
00:39:19,116 --> 00:39:20,791
Sort of.

483
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:27,718
This is exactly the kind of movie my parents would watch.

484
00:39:27,718 --> 00:39:30,166
Sorry for dragging you into this.

485
00:39:32,733 --> 00:39:36,708
I think it's pretty good.

486
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,791
Yes.

487
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:51,292
It's pretty good.

488
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:58,575
Actually, in this short time,

489
00:39:58,575 --> 00:40:00,665
we've done a lot of things.

490
00:40:04,325 --> 00:40:05,825
From me going to your studio,

491
00:40:05,825 --> 00:40:07,949
- you teaching me to paint...
- A scalpel?

492
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:12,250
To us helping Shun Hua get Zhi Ting back.

493
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,584
Then the free clinic we did a while ago.

494
00:40:36,116 --> 00:40:37,825
Now, we're...

495
00:40:37,825 --> 00:40:39,075
The movie is over.

496
00:40:39,075 --> 00:40:41,799
Please exit the theater.

497
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:43,865
Sorry. Could you give us a minute?

498
00:40:43,865 --> 00:40:46,333
We aren't finished yet. Thank you.

499
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,693
Now, we're...

500
00:40:52,693 --> 00:40:55,125
We need to clear the theater.

501
00:40:56,908 --> 00:40:58,665
All right.

502
00:41:00,742 --> 00:41:02,617
Let's go.

503
00:41:02,617 --> 00:41:04,333
Let's go.

504
00:41:08,283 --> 00:41:10,542
I know what you're going to say.

505
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:13,832
You're going to say that we've finally completed the task

506
00:41:13,832 --> 00:41:16,665
and you can explain it to your parents.

507
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:20,041
Not really.

508
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:34,208
- Hey.
- Hey.

509
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,700
Have you warmed up?

510
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,617
Are you ready to get wrecked?

511
00:41:37,617 --> 00:41:38,949
How do you want to play?

512
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:40,832
I'm fine with anything. Best two out of three?

513
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,075
Sure. What happens if you lose?

514
00:41:43,075 --> 00:41:45,116
I'm fine with anything.

515
00:41:45,116 --> 00:41:46,575
Run across Kinmen Bridge ten times.

516
00:41:46,575 --> 00:41:48,825
- Okay, bring it on.
- Are you sure?

517
00:41:48,825 --> 00:41:49,865
I'm not going to lose.

518
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:52,147
- All right. The ball.
- The ball.

519
00:41:52,147 --> 00:41:53,866
Didn't you bring one?

520
00:41:53,866 --> 00:41:55,832
I thought you'd bring one.

521
00:41:55,832 --> 00:41:56,866
Me, too.

522
00:41:56,866 --> 00:41:59,784
Why would I have a ball?

523
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:01,974
Seriously, give me the ball.

524
00:42:01,974 --> 00:42:04,865
I really didn't bring one. I thought you'd bring it.

525
00:42:04,865 --> 00:42:06,241
For real?

526
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,584
How funny. What do we do now?

527
00:42:21,751 --> 00:42:23,584
So?

528
00:42:25,116 --> 00:42:29,833
How are things going between you and Hai Nuo?

529
00:42:30,866 --> 00:42:33,033
You're so straightforward.

530
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:35,208
Not really.

531
00:42:35,865 --> 00:42:37,958
I've already figured it out.

532
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:45,099
I feel like I was too obsessed with my first love in the past.

533
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:46,791
Later, I realized that

534
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:52,450
we often focus on something far away

535
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,875
and forget about the person who has always been by our side.

536
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,665
Xu Man?

537
00:43:01,908 --> 00:43:05,500
Don't worry. You can tell me anything.

538
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:12,208
You two are pretty good together.

539
00:43:12,865 --> 00:43:14,676
When Ms. Shu Man passed away,

540
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:17,665
it had a huge impact on me.

541
00:43:18,408 --> 00:43:19,991
I felt really guilty.

542
00:43:19,991 --> 00:43:22,865
Luckily, when I was feeling down,

543
00:43:22,865 --> 00:43:24,833
she was there

544
00:43:25,617 --> 00:43:29,166
to drink and talk with me.

545
00:43:30,033 --> 00:43:32,458
So, have you...

546
00:43:33,751 --> 00:43:37,033
begun your three-step journey with her yet?

547
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:40,375
Do you mean missed opportunities, regret, and compromise?

548
00:43:41,784 --> 00:43:43,749
We aren't quite there yet.

549
00:43:44,366 --> 00:43:46,292
When it comes to confessing,

550
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,458
I have a trauma.

551
00:43:53,825 --> 00:43:56,158
All right.

552
00:43:56,158 --> 00:43:58,250
So, does Hai Nuo

553
00:43:59,658 --> 00:44:02,958
still refuse to come out and meet everyone?

554
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,250
I hope she gets better soon.

555
00:44:13,865 --> 00:44:15,665
Don't worry.

556
00:44:16,575 --> 00:44:21,158
I'll do my best.

557
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,250
Leave it to me.
