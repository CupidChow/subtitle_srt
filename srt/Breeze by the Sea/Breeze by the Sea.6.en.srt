♫ Through the crowded, bustling streets ♫

2
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:17,626
♫ Who will I say goodnight to? ♫

3
00:00:17,626 --> 00:00:19,999
♫ The vulnerability I long to embrace ♫

4
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:22,918
♫ Is buried deep inside ♫

5
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:26,584
♫ Under the moon's radiant glow, dreams surge and swell ♫

6
00:00:26,584 --> 00:00:28,999
♫ Waiting for a reason to run wild ♫

7
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:36,125
♫ Can you walk with me for a while without saying a word? ♫

00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:42,292

00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:52,042
♫ I want to feel the wind full force ♫

00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:55,167

[Breeze by the Sea]

18
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:37,685
You always feel unwell around this time of year.

19
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:40,292
As we get older, falling is our worst fear.

20
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:43,300
A single misstep can lead to long-term issues.

21
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,619
Hasn't Da Wu already returned?

22
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,375
Why do you still come here to see a doctor?

23
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,375
It's all his fault.

24
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,967
How childish. You fell on your own.

25
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:59,918
Can you make me another pink one?

26
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:01,799
Sure.

27
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:07,042
Xu Man painted really well.

28
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:09,786
Why don't you let her paint the whole car?

29
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:14,726
Well, she said she saved the front for you

30
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:16,800
since it's the most important part.

31
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:26,799
Is your medical car really on call all the time?

32
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:29,209
Hopefully not.

33
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:32,125
I want everyone to stay healthy.

34
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,250
I'd rather this car be ready but not needed.

35
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,175
You're right.

36
00:02:38,794 --> 00:02:42,592
Then why did you ask me to paint a horseshoe crab on the front?

37
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:49,759
Because...

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,999
It's cute.

39
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:58,967
It's cute?

40
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:02,799
What's so funny? Why are you smiling like that?

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,050
Shu Man.

42
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:09,134
Shu Man.

43
00:03:10,436 --> 00:03:12,269
Hey, Mr. Bai.

44
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:13,720
This fish is for...

45
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,799
Just put it in the fridge.

46
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:33,867
Shu Man is too kind.

47
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:35,678
She probably didn't mention it to you,

48
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:38,368
but they'll be very busy tomorrow.

49
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:43,134
If possible, leave early and return late.

50
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:57,669
If my dad were still around,

51
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:01,621
he'd be thrilled to see

52
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:03,676
his beloved car turned so cute.

53
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,759
Yes, he'd definitely show it off to my dad.

54
00:04:10,735 --> 00:04:14,143
He'd even drive the car and take our moms

55
00:04:14,143 --> 00:04:17,893
to Sinda Temple to join the square dancing.

56
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:19,083
Right.

57
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,883
Square dancing.

58
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:25,883
He'd also take your whole family on trips everywhere.

59
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,867
Thank you, Da Wu.

60
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:36,667
Thank you for giving this car

61
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:39,959
a new life and a new journey.

62
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,799
No need to thank me.

63
00:04:43,702 --> 00:04:46,660
Nuo Nuo, do you know where we're going later?

64
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,687
I don't.

65
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,292
We're taking you to see your favorite deer.

66
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:51,751
I want to feed the deer.

67
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:52,768
Of course you can.

68
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:53,999
Aren't you afraid of getting bitten?

69
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:56,334
I'm not afraid. I want to feed the deer.

70
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:59,285
All right, but be careful and gentle.

71
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:01,471
- Don't scare them, okay?
- Okay.

72
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:04,667
Go slowly. Don't scare them.

73
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:05,695
They're waiting for you.

74
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:07,068
- Nuo Nuo.
- Yes.

75
00:05:07,068 --> 00:05:08,984
Bambi, do you want more?

76
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:10,560
This one is called Bambi.

77
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,334
Do you have a name?

78
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:14,799
Little Bambi.

79
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:39,967
Little Bambi.

80
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:45,592
It has been a while.

81
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:48,676
Little Bambi.

82
00:05:55,494 --> 00:05:57,669
Mr. Bai, you're still up.

83
00:05:57,669 --> 00:05:58,900
Yes.

84
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,083
Right.

85
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,568
An old lady brought a fish today.

86
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:03,419
I told her to put it in the fridge.

87
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,235
Do you mean Xiu E?

88
00:06:05,235 --> 00:06:06,436
I guess so.

89
00:06:06,436 --> 00:06:08,799
Okay, got it. Thank you.

90
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:11,175
By the way...

91
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:17,636
I'll probably be out early and back late tomorrow.

92
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:21,478
So, you don't need to prepare any meals for me tomorrow.

93
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:23,685
Did Xiu E tell you something?

94
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:25,626
No, she didn't say anything.

95
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:26,999
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:29,777
Tomorrow is Nuo Nuo's parents' death anniversary,

97
00:06:29,777 --> 00:06:32,334
so we might be a bit busy.

98
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:35,592
However, we can still prepare your meals.

99
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,999
By the way, Mr. Bai,

100
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:45,883
you aren't going to sleep yet, right?

101
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:49,467
Is there anything you need?

102
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:10,175
What are you doing here?

103
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:13,209
Nothing, I just...

104
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:15,925
I want to experience Kinmen's nightlife.

105
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:21,799
The door.

106
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:40,759
Well, Grandma told me to watch the deer at night,

107
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,718
so I came to take a look.

108
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:57,042
On a day like this,

109
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:59,676
it's better to have someone with you.

110
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,584
I spend a day like this alone every year.

111
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:08,300
I'm used to it.

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,626
It's called Little Bambi.

113
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:29,751
Its parents aren't around anymore either.

114
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:32,799
I come to see it every year around this time.

115
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:36,351
You can use this to feed it.

116
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,553
However, it depends on its mood.

117
00:08:37,553 --> 00:08:39,342
It might not eat.

118
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:43,626
Little Bambi.

119
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:44,999
Bambi.

120
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:46,925
Little Bambi, over here.

121
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:56,134
You need to attract its attention.

122
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,799
There you go.

123
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:09,134
Feed it slowly.

124
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,592
Keep going.

125
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,799
You can pet it. It doesn't bite.

126
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,125
Was it always this chubby?

127
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,612
That's called well-fed.

128
00:09:32,612 --> 00:09:34,799
Looks like it's in a good mood.

129
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:38,799
Little Bambi.

130
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:20,799
The dishes at a fancy restaurant have to look brand new.

131
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:25,676
I'm washing them cleaner than a dishwasher.

132
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,452
That day, Yin Mo came to celebrate your birthday.

133
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:35,125
You guys...

134
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,792
Carrying trays needs some skills.

135
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,876
I have to carry 30 plates at once.

136
00:10:39,876 --> 00:10:42,799
I could join a circus with this skill.

137
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:49,527
The money Yin Mo gave you to buy two houses

138
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:52,175
should've lasted you both a lifetime.

139
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:56,217
How did he blow it all?

140
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,085
We failed in business.

141
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:05,485
He wanted me to ask Yin Mo for more money,

142
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:07,175
but I refused.

143
00:11:08,428 --> 00:11:11,883
I wasn't useful to him anymore, so he left me.

144
00:11:14,494 --> 00:11:16,967
However, I'm fine now.

145
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,925
At least I can support myself.

146
00:11:23,452 --> 00:11:24,933
Sorry.

147
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:27,009
I still have work to do.

148
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:44,900
Yu Mei, thank you.

149
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,761
Bye.

150
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:48,375
Manager, I'm leaving now.

151
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,459
Yu Mei, wait.

152
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,759
Yu Mei, I just wanted to let you know.

153
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:54,799
I'm raising your salary to 40,000 starting next month.

154
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:57,976
A whole 10,000 more?

155
00:11:57,976 --> 00:11:59,518
Yes, so keep up the good work.

156
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,384
Keep doing your best.

157
00:12:03,627 --> 00:12:06,419
Is it because of that lady who came today

158
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:08,799
that you're paying me more?

159
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:12,842
Yes.

160
00:12:13,702 --> 00:12:17,794
Please give the money back to her.

161
00:12:17,794 --> 00:12:20,643
You've got to be kidding me.

162
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:23,676
Are you turning down money that has been handed to you?

163
00:12:28,786 --> 00:12:31,009
I'm not worth that amount.

164
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,083
That's it.

165
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,476
Just write the info down.

166
00:12:35,476 --> 00:12:38,592
- That's it.
- All right. I'll give it a shot.

167
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:42,660
Shun Hua, why are you suddenly hiring?

168
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,786
You're even learning to manage a fan page.

169
00:12:45,786 --> 00:12:48,259
Isn't Zhi Ting the one who usually handles that?

170
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,577
Well, she has worked hard for so many years.

171
00:12:52,577 --> 00:12:54,083
I need to learn to be independent, too.

172
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,883
What do you mean?

173
00:12:58,434 --> 00:13:00,300
It's nothing.

174
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:03,125
She suddenly told me

175
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:07,202
that she wants to withdraw her investment in the restaurant.

176
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:09,592
Is she looking to invest in something else?

177
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:11,662
Mr. Bai, look.

178
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:15,799
Nowadays, a lot of celebrities are investing.

179
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:19,175
I know.

180
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,452
I've actually looked into it.

181
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:24,999
When it comes to side businesses for celebrities,

182
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:27,999
most of them have boutiques, spas,

183
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:30,711
and all sorts of other ventures.

184
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:35,092
However, the most profitable one is still catering.

185
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:37,951
Am I going from being a guest of the guesthouse

186
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,226
to being your investor?

187
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:42,452
Investor?

188
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:45,720
That's just a term.

189
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,009
You can think of it as opening up another path in life.

190
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:52,125
That's a better fit.

191
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,342
Are you opening a new branch?

192
00:13:57,494 --> 00:13:59,560
I asked her the same thing,

193
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,467
but she told me

194
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,867
she wants to leave Kinmen.

195
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:05,645
I was going to ask more,

196
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,561
but seeing how awkward and uneasy she looked,

197
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:10,592
I didn't want to push her.

198
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:14,799
Could it be that she wants to cut ties with you?

199
00:14:17,502 --> 00:14:19,720
Does it really have to be like that?

200
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,918
No, that's not what I meant.

201
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:21,934
Forget I said anything.

202
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:23,083
No, I wasn't talking about you.

203
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,209
I was talking about Zhi Ting.

204
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:28,009
Not opening a branch? Then why did you come to me?

205
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,300
I want to...

206
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:41,709
I want to leave Shun Hua.

207
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:43,959
I guess she might have found someone new.

208
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,744
However, I can't blame her.

209
00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:47,035
We've been broken up for a while now

210
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:49,542
and I kept telling her that she could find someone else.

211
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:50,876
But you know me, Chen Da Wu.

212
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:53,584
I was just saying it, but I didn't actually mean it.

213
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:55,999
Well, that's just your guess.

214
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,375
I know the last time you fought was because of the bill.

215
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,999
But you also mentioned a lot of other things

216
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:02,735
like your daily habits not matching

217
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,209
and personality differences.

218
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:06,351
Maybe she just wanted...

219
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:08,417
To scare me?

220
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:09,999
To give me a warning?

221
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:11,842
It could be.

222
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:19,652
I'm afraid that if I take back the investment,

223
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,901
he won't be able to manage it.

224
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:27,351
I don't know who else to ask for help, so...

225
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:31,217
Maybe you're the only one who can help me.

226
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:39,592
Even though we broke up, we were together for so long.

227
00:15:40,735 --> 00:15:43,799
I still want him to live a good life.

228
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:50,467
I get it now.

229
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:55,634
So, you came to me for investment to ease your guilt?

230
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,676
I know you're worried about him.

231
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,110
However, have you ever thought

232
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,467
that maybe leaving him might make him better off?

233
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:18,009
After all, nobody will stop living because they're missing someone.

234
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:31,800
Ms. Ye Zhi Ting.

235
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:35,654
Welcome to today's ribbon-cutting ceremony.

236
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:37,695
This new bathroom door

237
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:39,428
guarantees you won't get locked inside

238
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:43,259
and it will give you full privacy when using the bathroom.

239
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:45,327
And the new laundry basket.

240
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:46,351
From now on, when I get home,

241
00:16:46,351 --> 00:16:49,384
I'll toss my dirty clothes and smelly socks into it.

242
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:52,042
And with the new mouthwash,

243
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:53,900
I can rinse right after eating garlic

244
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,676
and always have fresh breath.

245
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:02,509
I have...

246
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:07,925
someone new.

247
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:59,342
Hey, Da Wu. What's up?

248
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:01,428
Hey, Hai Nuo. Is my dad with you?

249
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:02,720
He isn't here yet.

250
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,999
He disappeared this morning.

251
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:06,285
Disappeared?

252
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:08,202
Yes, but it's probably nothing serious.

253
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:10,151
I'll go look for him.

254
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:12,520
He never leaves without his phone.

255
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,711
Don't worry, Mom. Dad only goes to a few places.

256
00:19:14,711 --> 00:19:17,925
Wait at home and let me know when he gets back.

257
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:24,834
Grandma.

258
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:26,285
Da Wu said he couldn't find his dad.

259
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:28,800
I'll go look for him. I'll be right back.

260
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:53,217
Dad.

261
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,669
Ma'am, have you seen the Village Chief?

262
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:59,459
- No, I haven't.
- Okay, thank you.

263
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:02,118
- Dad!
- Ma'am, did you see Mr. Fu Shou today?

264
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,134
No, I didn't.

265
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:04,799
Okay, thank you.

266
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:07,561
Ma'am, has Mr. Fu Shou been here today?

267
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:09,594
No, he hasn't.

268
00:20:09,594 --> 00:20:11,586
Ma'am, did my dad come to buy alcohol today?

269
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:12,933
Yes, he did.

270
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:14,125
- He did?
- Yes.

271
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,842
Okay, thank you.

272
00:20:36,594 --> 00:20:39,551
Grandma, what's wrong?

273
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,799
Dad!

274
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:47,292
Hey, Da Wu!

275
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:49,842
- Did you find him?
- No.

276
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:58,083
Sir, did you see the Village Chief?

277
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,842
- No, I didn't.
- Thank you.

278
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,999
Hey, Village Chief.

279
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:14,318
Why are you drinking this early?

280
00:21:14,318 --> 00:21:17,092
Be careful. Stay safe.

281
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:31,801
I've checked all the places my dad might go.

282
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:34,125
This is the last spot left.

283
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,636
This area is huge. Let's split up.

284
00:21:35,636 --> 00:21:36,652
- Okay.
- Okay.

285
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:39,092
You go there, I'll go there, and you go there.

286
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:55,834
Sir, have you seen the Village Chief?

287
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:57,169
- Yes.
- Where?

288
00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:59,083
I just saw him over there. He was drunk.

289
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,933
- Drunk?
- Yes, I even told him to be careful not to fall into the sea.

290
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:03,537
- Over there, right?
- Yes, that way.

291
00:22:03,537 --> 00:22:04,728
Okay, thank you.

292
00:22:04,728 --> 00:22:06,799
- Be careful.
- Okay.

293
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,417
Hearty...

294
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:12,900
Calling...

295
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,125
Dad!

296
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,459
Dad!

297
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:18,417
Did you hear that?

298
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:20,813
Hearty... Hong Si.

299
00:22:20,813 --> 00:22:22,800
Dad!

300
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:27,426
Dad!

301
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:32,368
Dad!

302
00:22:32,368 --> 00:22:36,042
Hong Si, Si Ting.

303
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:41,393
Didn't you say you'd come find me to take you back?

304
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,000
Dad!

305
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,311
Do you miss everyone? Do you want to see everyone?

306
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:46,485
Dad, what are you doing there?

307
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:47,500
Where are you guys?

308
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,636
Mu Yu... Mu Yu is in the southwest sea area.

309
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,834
I know that place.

310
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:54,936
- Come up, Dad.
- I'm coming right now.

311
00:22:54,936 --> 00:22:58,842
I'll fill up the gas.

312
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:04,250
- Dad!
- There's no gas left.

313
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,000
Hold on.

314
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,292
I'll fill up the gas.

315
00:23:08,292 --> 00:23:10,603
Where's the liquor?

316
00:23:10,603 --> 00:23:14,167
Dad, come up here!

317
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,775
It's here.

318
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:18,883
- I'm filling up.
- It's dangerous!

319
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:22,050
Dad!

320
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,000
Dad!

321
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,799
Dad!

322
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:42,083
It's so loud.

323
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:45,083
It must be a big fish.

324
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,759
I'll catch you later.

325
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:07,966
While Dad and I are away these few days,

326
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:09,209
you have to listen to Grandma, okay?

327
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:10,250
Okay.

328
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,042
Darling, for that art project from art class,

329
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:14,709
wait until I get back to help you, okay?

330
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:16,000
Okay, you have to remember.

331
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,377
I'll remember, but you have to give me a kiss.

332
00:24:19,377 --> 00:24:20,584
Yes.

333
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,592
- What about me?
- What about Mom?

334
00:24:23,377 --> 00:24:25,379
We love you the most.

335
00:24:25,379 --> 00:24:27,151
- Hong Si, Si Ting.
- Mom.

336
00:24:27,151 --> 00:24:31,309
- Mom.
- You guys be careful, okay?

337
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:32,495
- Don't worry.
- Don't worry, Mom.

338
00:24:32,495 --> 00:24:33,999
- We'll be back safe.
- Ms. Shu Man, don't worry.

339
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:36,535
We'll be back in two days.

340
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:37,709
Let's take a photo.

341
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,967
- Sure.
- Come on.

342
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,292
One.

343
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:45,360
Two.

344
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,509
Three.

345
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,500
Finish your meal quickly.

346
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,551
I will take you out afterward.

347
00:24:52,794 --> 00:24:55,842
Hello, this is Hong Hui Fang.

348
00:24:57,702 --> 00:25:00,217
Mom, I don't want to eat that.

349
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,759
Okay, got it.

350
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:06,268
Sir.

351
00:25:06,268 --> 00:25:07,933
There's no response. Apply pain stimulus.

352
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:08,999
Still no response.

353
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:10,292
The patient is unconscious now.

354
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:11,999
- Prepare the emergency equipment.
- Okay.

355
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:13,999
Check his breathing. Check the carotid artery simultaneously.

356
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:16,638
1,001, 1,002, 1,003,

357
00:25:16,638 --> 00:25:19,827
1,004, 1,005, 1,006, 1,007.

358
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:20,999
Senior, the patient is unconscious.

359
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:23,627
- His cardiopulmonary function has stopped.
- Okay.

360
00:25:23,627 --> 00:25:26,542
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

361
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:29,999
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

362
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:32,217
Come on. Breath.

363
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:36,083
One, two, three, four, five, six,

364
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:38,083
seven, eight, nine, ten.

365
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:41,500
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

366
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,042
One, two, three, four, five,

367
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,867
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

368
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:50,092
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

369
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:59,375
- Hello, is this the fire department?
- Who drowned?

370
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:00,429
Someone has drowned here.

371
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:02,799
Da Wu!

372
00:26:22,693 --> 00:26:23,918
Who drowned?

373
00:26:23,918 --> 00:26:25,584
Your son drowned.

374
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,652
He's awake.

375
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:27,999
He's awake.

376
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:29,799
He's awake.

377
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,759
Sorry to bother you. Thank you.

378
00:26:36,535 --> 00:26:39,799
Da Wu, are you okay? Let me help you.

379
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:44,676
Are you all right?

380
00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:47,259
I'm fine.

381
00:27:06,801 --> 00:27:08,335
Did you save me?

382
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,092
I didn't want to.

383
00:27:10,751 --> 00:27:12,799
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

384
00:27:14,184 --> 00:27:15,167
I'll buy you a new one.

385
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,925
Can you stop talking?

386
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,375
Hong Si.

387
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,125
Hong Si.

388
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,799
Come to my place immediately.

389
00:27:30,626 --> 00:27:32,471
Mr. Fu Shou, wake up.

390
00:27:32,471 --> 00:27:34,320
- Hai Nuo, what are you doing here?
- Your son drowned.

391
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,933
I made plans with your mom and the others.

392
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:38,360
We're going to catch pomfret fish on the south side of Mu Yu

393
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,000
and bring them home.

394
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
He said they miss us.

395
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,052
They want to come back and see us.

396
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:47,626
I'll go bring the pomfret fish back.

397
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:49,410
Mr. Fu Shou.

398
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,676
I'll bring them back.

399
00:27:54,494 --> 00:27:57,594
Hai Nuo, let's go.

400
00:27:57,594 --> 00:28:00,259
My mom and your grandma are still waiting for us at home.

401
00:28:06,454 --> 00:28:09,511
Your dad always gets emotional on this day every year.

402
00:28:09,511 --> 00:28:11,403
That's why he got so drunk.

403
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:13,375
Don't blame him.

404
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:17,342
When he sobers up, talk to him properly.

405
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:19,542
Call your grandma.

406
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:21,751
Let her know we're safe.

407
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:23,342
Okay.

408
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:27,000
Let's go.

409
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,009
What about your dad?

410
00:28:29,685 --> 00:28:30,711
He's always like this.

411
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:32,883
He'll be fine when he wakes up.

412
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,799
What if he falls into the sea?

413
00:28:50,577 --> 00:28:52,967
He'll untie himself when he wakes up.

414
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:56,134
Let's go.

415
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:59,134
I'll call my grandma.

416
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:25,393
Lend me your car later.

417
00:29:25,393 --> 00:29:27,428
You guys go do your thing.

418
00:29:27,428 --> 00:29:28,860
Where are you going?

419
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,243
To clear my mind.

420
00:29:31,243 --> 00:29:32,555
You can stay in your room.

421
00:29:32,555 --> 00:29:34,535
You won't disturb us.

422
00:29:34,535 --> 00:29:36,867
I'm going to change clothes and head out to buy some mouthwash.

423
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:39,702
I want to erase that awful memory.

424
00:29:39,702 --> 00:29:41,176
Here.

425
00:29:41,176 --> 00:29:42,544
Sinhu Fishing Port, yes.

426
00:29:42,544 --> 00:29:44,667
Someone has drowned here.

427
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:46,799
Please come quickly.

428
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:49,059
Should I buy you a bottle, too?

429
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:52,410
Sure. I want double mint.

430
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,209
Car keys.

431
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,134
I'll go in through the side door.

432
00:29:56,768 --> 00:29:58,799
- Let's go.
- Okay. Let's go.

433
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:07,217
This time, he really needs a good lesson.

434
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,096
- They're back.
- Grandma.

435
00:30:10,096 --> 00:30:11,876
- My son.
- Ms. Hui Fang.

436
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,042
Are you all right?

437
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:14,302
Should we go to the hospital for a checkup?

438
00:30:14,302 --> 00:30:16,511
Mom, I'm fine. Look.

439
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:18,553
No, I won't be at ease until a doctor examines you.

440
00:30:18,553 --> 00:30:21,925
Mom, did you forget what I do for a living?

441
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:27,000
Well, Dr. Chen,

442
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,799
can you check on my son to see if everything is okay?

443
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,042
Other than having a forgetful mom,

444
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,334
everything else is okay.

445
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:40,900
- Well, Dr. Chen...
- Mom.

446
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,967
If you keep this up, it's going to get boring.

447
00:30:46,786 --> 00:30:48,687
By the way, Hai Nuo, what did you say on the phone just now?

448
00:30:48,687 --> 00:30:50,151
I didn't quite understand.

449
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:52,999
You said Fu Shou was sun-drying by the sea.

450
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:54,309
What does that mean?

451
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:57,050
Well, I'll let Da Wu explain.

452
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:03,050
It's like a form of self-reflection.

453
00:31:07,852 --> 00:31:10,711
I see.

454
00:31:10,711 --> 00:31:13,527
Yes, he should reflect on himself.

455
00:31:13,527 --> 00:31:15,687
Sons are their dad's nemesis.

456
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:17,217
Well done, my son.

457
00:31:17,217 --> 00:31:18,999
Let him evaporate in the sun.

458
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:22,217
All right, he has learned his lesson.

459
00:31:22,217 --> 00:31:24,925
My crabs. I need to take care of them.

460
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:27,083
It's all good now.

461
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,092
Let's get ready.

462
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:37,309
This is the biggest shirt I have.

463
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:40,092
Hurry up and wash up. I'll get things ready.

464
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:55,125
Put it in the microwave for one and a half minutes.

465
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,500
Remember to cover it.

466
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,799
Otherwise, it'll splatter everywhere.

467
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:28,252
Tell him I'm not going back anymore.

468
00:32:28,252 --> 00:32:31,193
I've started a new life in Taiwan.

469
00:32:31,193 --> 00:32:34,711
Yes, I may not be a famous model,

470
00:32:34,711 --> 00:32:36,794
but at least I don't need to rely on anyone.

471
00:32:36,794 --> 00:32:38,676
That's all.

472
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,000
No cilantro but extra spicy, right?

473
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,009
I'll add a braised egg for you.

474
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:49,711
Hey, Liu.

475
00:32:49,711 --> 00:32:52,000
I've got the swimsuit with me.

476
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,643
But can I choose one that isn't so revealing?

477
00:32:55,643 --> 00:32:59,167
All right. I'll decide when I get there.

478
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:03,334
Okay, I'm heading over right now.

479
00:33:03,334 --> 00:33:06,711
Miss, a lot of people take advantage of outsiders.

480
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:08,777
Be careful.

481
00:33:08,777 --> 00:33:09,852
I don't have time now.

482
00:33:09,852 --> 00:33:11,799
I'll come back for it later.

483
00:33:14,485 --> 00:33:17,518
Check, please. How much is it?

484
00:33:17,518 --> 00:33:19,667
- It's 60 dollars.
- Okay, here you go.

485
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:21,106
- Here's 60. Thank you.
- Thank you. Was it delicious?

486
00:33:21,106 --> 00:33:22,867
- Yes. Okay, bye.
- Please come again.

487
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,900
- Bye.
- It's too conservative.

488
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,459
I said I wanted sexy photos.

489
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:27,626
What kind of swimsuits did you bring?

490
00:33:27,626 --> 00:33:30,375
Come on. It's not attractive at all.

491
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,375
Look at it from an artistic perspective.

492
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:34,667
Broaden your perspective.

493
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:37,250
But this isn't what we initially agreed on.

494
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,999
What's the difference?

495
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:41,876
It's just an artistic shot. It's not a big deal.

496
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:43,999
Hey, your takeout is ready.

497
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:45,250
Go pick it up.

498
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,926
Go, it's at the front.

499
00:33:46,926 --> 00:33:48,375
- What are you trying to do?
- What do you want?

500
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:49,626
Are you trying to be a hero?

501
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:52,799
You two, let's talk this over.

502
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:57,167
All right, we're leaving.

503
00:33:57,167 --> 00:34:00,125
Is this your stall? Just you wait!

504
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:02,050
Miss, sorry about that.

505
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,410
This bowl of noodles is soggy.

506
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,801
I'll cook you a new one.

507
00:34:05,801 --> 00:34:08,000
Have a seat.

508
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,967
Come and sit inside.

509
00:34:10,627 --> 00:34:11,744
Sorry about that.

510
00:34:11,744 --> 00:34:12,867
Let me clean this up.

511
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:15,634
Give me a moment. Have a seat.

512
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:22,167
Is it the usual?

513
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,634
No cilantro but extra spicy, right?

514
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,000
Why did you come to Kinmen?

515
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,645
I recently found out that they hired someone

516
00:34:33,645 --> 00:34:36,000
to smash your stall.

517
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,999
They even beat you up so badly that you ended up in the hospital for a week.

518
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:41,933
It's nothing.

519
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:44,134
I fell off the bike.

520
00:34:44,134 --> 00:34:45,401
I'm sorry.

521
00:34:45,401 --> 00:34:48,667
It's all because of me that you got hurt.

522
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:49,693
What are you apologizing for?

523
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:51,676
It has nothing to do with you.

524
00:34:52,285 --> 00:34:58,467
I'm really grateful to you for being genuine with me.

525
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:01,169
Grateful?

526
00:35:01,169 --> 00:35:03,660
We haven't even spoken much these past two years.

527
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,520
Most of our lines were "No cilantro but extra spicy."

528
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,592
and "Eat here or take away?"

529
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:22,042
Do you want to stay in Kinmen with me?

530
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:24,009
I have some savings.

531
00:35:24,009 --> 00:35:25,876
I'm planning to open a restaurant here.

532
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:28,375
Although it won't make much money,

533
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:31,883
it should be able to cover the expenses for two people.

534
00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:40,842
What's wrong with you?

535
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:46,551
Why are you so silly?

536
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:49,207
I don't understand Cantonese.

537
00:35:49,207 --> 00:35:50,959
I don't mean anything else.

538
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:53,568
I'm not trying to take advantage of you.

539
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,799
If you want to leave now, I can take you to the airport right away.

540
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:00,502
Wait here. I'll get the car.

541
00:36:00,502 --> 00:36:02,342
Fang Shun Hua!

542
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,842
Did you call me?

543
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,209
Actually, I have some savings, too.

544
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:13,799
We can work together to make the restaurant bigger.

545
00:36:31,494 --> 00:36:33,925
I still don't understand.

546
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:42,967
I figured you'd be here.

547
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:30,759
Mr. Bai, what are you doing here?

548
00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:33,248
Village Chief, what are you doing here?

549
00:37:33,248 --> 00:37:34,429
I...

550
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:38,883
I borrowed some crab cages from a friend.

551
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:42,753
You missed quite a show.

552
00:37:42,753 --> 00:37:43,794
What show?

553
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,292
Your son fell into the water and almost drowned.

554
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:48,792
My... Da Wu!

555
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:50,967
- Da Wu!
- He almost didn't make it.

556
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:55,925
Where is he now?

557
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:58,786
When they were looking for you,

558
00:37:58,786 --> 00:38:00,799
did you want them to find you?

559
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,000
Or maybe the person they were looking for

560
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,083
wasn't really you,

561
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,360
but someone who doesn't drink excessively

562
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,660
and run away from problems.

563
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,842
Someone who won't make them worry.

564
00:38:18,193 --> 00:38:20,401
Village Chief.

565
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:23,292
You've always hoped your son would bring honor to your family,

566
00:38:23,292 --> 00:38:26,799
but have you ever thought about what he really wants?

567
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:31,368
What does he want?

568
00:38:31,368 --> 00:38:33,842
Are you asking me? How do I know?

569
00:38:37,711 --> 00:38:39,360
Da Wu didn't drown today,

570
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,318
which means fate is giving you another chance to start over.

571
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:46,167
You don't have to keep trapping yourself in the past.

572
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:50,050
It was you who chose to stay trapped there.

573
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:56,426
Also, haven't you sun-dried yourself long enough?

574
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:11,967
What your son wants is actually simple.

575
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:18,294
He just wants his dad to support his dreams

576
00:39:18,294 --> 00:39:20,085
and allow him to stay here

577
00:39:20,085 --> 00:39:22,718
to take care of everyone he cares about.

578
00:39:26,285 --> 00:39:28,327
What are you still standing here for?

579
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:31,586
Go back and fix your relationship with your son.

580
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:33,799
At least you still have the chance.

581
00:39:50,662 --> 00:39:53,009
What right do I have to talk about others?

582
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:02,342
Today wasn't bad.

583
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:09,050
Get the rice out.

584
00:40:26,933 --> 00:40:28,799
Done with sun-drying?

585
00:40:38,226 --> 00:40:40,678
Look at you.

586
00:40:40,678 --> 00:40:43,799
Why did you have to make such a big deal out of it?

587
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,235
Last night, I dreamed about Hong Si and Si Ting.

588
00:40:48,235 --> 00:40:50,786
They came back happily and told me

589
00:40:50,786 --> 00:40:52,509
that they missed everyone.

590
00:40:52,509 --> 00:40:54,601
They wanted to come back and see us.

591
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:59,125
So, I thought maybe I could bring them back today.

592
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,125
It has been so long.

593
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,799
How could you still find them?

594
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:08,601
I've always considered my son and daughter-in-law

595
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:10,999
to be buried at sea.

596
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:12,626
Even if you found them today,

597
00:41:12,626 --> 00:41:15,375
I would still send them back to the sea.

598
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:23,250
Well, I'm very happy you came back safely.

599
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,799
But why was it only me who came back?

600
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:32,584
Ms. Shu Man, I really did my best.

601
00:41:32,584 --> 00:41:35,092
I couldn't hold onto them. I...

602
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:38,417
I let them down.

603
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:41,083
I let Si Ting down. I let them down.

604
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,259
I really did my best.

605
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:47,933
I'm so sorry...

606
00:41:47,933 --> 00:41:50,167
I'm so sorry for Hai Nuo.

607
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:52,167
It was all because of me.

608
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:54,643
If Hong Si and Si Ting were still here,

609
00:41:54,643 --> 00:41:56,933
they would definitely love her very much.

610
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:58,643
I'm the one who hurt Hai Nuo.

611
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:02,426
I made her lose her parents at such a young age.

612
00:42:15,485 --> 00:42:17,235
She still has me.

613
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:19,867
And you all love Hai Nuo so much.

614
00:42:19,867 --> 00:42:21,842
There's also Da Wu.

615
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:25,619
Although I also have some regrets,

616
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:28,125
I've always told Hai Nuo

617
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:31,009
that her parents are doing well.

618
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:35,842
We should also live well so that they can be at peace.

619
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:41,693
You drank so much as if our family is so unfortunate.

620
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:44,925
Do you really wish for us to be unhappy?

621
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:51,134
Fu Shou, you're also like my son.

622
00:42:51,134 --> 00:42:53,125
You keep tormenting yourself like this.

623
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:56,634
Have you ever thought about how much it hurts me?

624
00:42:59,933 --> 00:43:03,478
I'm sorry.

625
00:43:03,478 --> 00:43:04,768
All right.

626
00:43:04,768 --> 00:43:06,417
Stop apologizing to me.

627
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,594
You didn't do anything wrong.

628
00:43:07,594 --> 00:43:09,553
You didn't let anyone down.

629
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:11,026
You should stop drinking.

630
00:43:11,026 --> 00:43:13,520
Take care of yourself and live well.

631
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,799
Don't make us all worry anymore, okay?

632
00:43:17,786 --> 00:43:19,959
If you don't listen next time.

633
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:23,967
I'll spank you with this.

634
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,050
I promise you.

635
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:54,603
Good.

636
00:43:54,603 --> 00:43:56,250
Luckily, we're still on time.

637
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,344
Come on. Let's pray.

638
00:43:57,344 --> 00:44:00,353
Come on, everyone. Let's pray.

639
00:44:00,353 --> 00:44:02,160
Put the offerings here.

640
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,718
Light four sticks of incense.
