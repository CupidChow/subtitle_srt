She knows you don't like doing shows.

12
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:55,271
So, our strategy is to promote the movie, and restore your image!

13
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:58,500
As you know, your recent news hasn't been great.

14

But it's okay!

We just need to stay positive, kind, and warm. That's all.

16

Hello, everyone, I'm Bai Yin Mo.

17
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:06,999
- Hello, Chef Fred.
- Hello.

18
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:08,522
- Thank you for having me today.
- No problem.

19
00:02:08,522 --> 00:02:10,999
- So, you're here to promote a new movie?
- Yes.

20
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:13,292
I'm here to promote my new film, "Operation Dawn."

21
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:14,709
I hope everyone supports it.

22
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:16,042
All right, everyone, show your support.

23
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:19,676
Let me ask you. Do you have any cooking experience?

24
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:21,834
I don't cook.

25
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,056
I got it. Don't worry.

26
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:26,751
Let me tell you. Today's dish is a classic.

27
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:28,792
It's white wine clams.

28
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:32,292
First, get the clams ready.

29
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:35,467
Once they're ready, we'll place them over there.

30
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:38,292
Pour some white wine

31
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:42,134
and it turns into white wine clams.

32
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,459
Right? Did I get that wrong?

33
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:46,867
No.

34
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:47,885
You're funny.

35
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:49,834
It's pretty funny, right?

36
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:53,125
So after this, we'll start cooking.

37
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,999
Come on.

38
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:57,967
What do we need when making white wine clams?

39
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:00,993
White wine.

40
00:03:00,993 --> 00:03:02,459
You're familiar with it, right?

41
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,999
White wine. Bai Yin Mo.

42
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:06,542
You know wine well, don't you?

43
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:09,792
So, when making white wine clams, white wine is the key.

44
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:10,834
But don't worry.

45
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:14,334
When we cook it over high heat,

46
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:17,224
the alcohol will burn off, and there will be none left.

47
00:03:17,224 --> 00:03:20,050
After you eat it later, you can still drive.

48
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:23,999
Just kidding. All right?

49
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:27,417
After we prepare the onions,

50
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:29,584
we'll move on to the garlic.

51
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,459
It's perfect for home cooking.

52
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,483
When it comes to home cooking, your mom will cook it for you.

53
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,792
You can cook it for friends, too.

54
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:38,999
Let me ask you.

55
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:42,925
When it comes to making friends, what do you look for?

56
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:46,999
It's okay. My mom used to tell me this.

57
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:49,134
We need to be mindful when making friends.

58
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,751
Watch out for the little things.

59
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:52,918
For example, sometimes,

60
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:56,542
when you want to grab something, you'll tell them to grab it for you.

61
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:59,342
When they turn around, they might turn like this.

62
00:04:00,918 --> 00:04:01,999
Do you know what that means?

63
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:04,334
He must have been arrested before.

64
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:06,459
Or maybe he has been handcuffed.

65
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:07,918
Got it?

66
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:09,759
You got it, right?

67
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:14,999

00:14:47,424 --> 00:14:50,351
I finally have a celebrity friend.

180
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:53,399
I have a celebrity friend.

181
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:50,059
Isn't it fixed?

182
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:52,234
You were so fierce before.

183
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,599
What is it?

184
00:17:37,384 --> 00:17:38,799
Don't you know what time it is now?

185
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,009
You have your music on so loud.

186
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:44,309
- It's only a little past ten.
- I go to sleep by ten.

187
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,599
- I'll turn it off later.
- Turn it off now.

188
00:17:59,898 --> 00:18:02,309
Is that a photo of your grandma?

189
00:18:03,426 --> 00:18:05,017
Yes.

190
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:08,850
Is this you as a kid?

191
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,100
You were cuter as a kid.

192
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,642
Hey, I didn't say you could come in.

193
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:19,850
Do you like to read?

194
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:24,259
You live in Kinmen now. Why do you still read about Kinmen?

195
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:26,191
It's none of your business.

196
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:27,342
Wait.

197
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:29,799
You can't just barge into a girl's room at midnight.

198
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:32,683
- What are you even doing?
- Didn't you say it's still early?

199
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,892
So, you don't read, but you like to draw?

200
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:46,057
You use advertising paint to paint oil paintings.

201
00:18:46,057 --> 00:18:47,600
Colored markers.

202
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:59,132
Are you just looking for something to do?

203
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:01,559
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

204
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:11,559
Is this the legendary love charm?

205
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:17,142
If you really want to stay with your grandma, you should throw it away.

206
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:20,999
You know nothing.

207
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:24,709
This love charm's red thread connects me and my grandma.

208
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:26,125
So? Is there anything else?

209
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,676
Nothing. What else?

210
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,967
What a weirdo.

211
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:40,800
Why does it look like a radish to me?

212
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:43,500
Why do I feel that it looks like a winter melon?

213
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,801
I still think it looks more like a radish.

214
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:48,417
Or are we going to cook the radish and winter melon together?

215
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:51,334
How can you pair radish with winter melon? They don't go well together.

216
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:52,999
I just...

217
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:55,718
That's a daikon. What are you two doing?

218
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:59,167
We don't know what you like to eat,

219
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:03,000
so Grandma suggested finding clues from your work photos.

220
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,709
If it is called a work photo, do you think I'll eat it?

221
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:09,876
You see. I told you it was all in vain.

222
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,667
So, what do you want to eat?

223
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,292
Just cook it like before.

224
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:15,509
Before?

225
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:22,634
I want to eat your cooking.

226
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:36,342
Does it taste good?

227
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:39,925
It's so delicious.

228
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:42,925
Is it really that good?

229
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:45,999
How about this?

230
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:49,967
Next time, I'll make boiled eggs for you to eat.

231
00:21:10,626 --> 00:21:11,626
Good morning.

232
00:21:11,626 --> 00:21:13,999
Morning.

233
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:15,718
Boiled eggs?

234
00:21:16,918 --> 00:21:18,626
I got drunk last night.

235
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:21,709
I heard it was you who carried me back.

236
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:22,999
I'm really sorry.

237
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:25,009
Next time, you carry me.

238
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:27,467
You owe me one.

239
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:31,384
Sure. No problem.

240
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,925
It's hot. Let me help you.

241
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:39,417
- What is that?
- He cooked it himself.

242
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:41,779
- I can tell.
- Is this enough?

243
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:42,999
I'm used to it.

244
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:44,876
Grandma, you don't need to worry about him.

245
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:47,467
He only eats the healthiest food.

246
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:55,551
He eats raw food.

247
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:01,842
My nutritionist said
that this is the right doneness for me.

248
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:05,342
I see.

249
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:11,967
- Don't you guys want to eat?
- Let's eat.

250
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,925
Mr. Bai, you must be joking.

251
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm just joking.

252
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,799
Just joking.

253
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:35,883
I peeled this for you.

254
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:39,342
Did you wash your hands?

255
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:42,209
I washed my hands.

256
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:43,900
If you don't want to eat, that's fine.

257
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,300
Just joking.

258
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:51,842
Just joking.

259
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,292
I'm just joking.

260
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,834
This is really delicious.

261
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,751
- Grandma, do you understand what I mean?
- I understand.

262
00:22:58,751 --> 00:23:00,799
If it's good, eat more.

263
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:06,009
I'm eating. I'm not joking.

264
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:15,296
Yin Mo.

265
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:18,982
I know you pack every day full with work.

266
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,164
However, this time,

267
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:22,467
you're going to Kinmen with a half-vacation mindset.

268
00:23:23,707 --> 00:23:26,034
You should try to relax as much as possible.

269
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:28,242
Xiao Guang said you fainted in Kinmen.

270
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,742
Are you okay?

271
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,626
I'm fine.

272
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,199
I'll handle it. What if you fall?

273
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:39,199
How do you use this?

274
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:43,250
Just roll and pull it. It should be the same height as that.

275
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:45,867
Be careful.

276
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:47,999
Be careful.

277
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:52,375
- Like this?
- A little higher.

278
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:55,334
Align it. Thank you.

279
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:09,709
What do you think about the reality show?

280
00:24:17,034 --> 00:24:18,999
All right. I'll take it.

281
00:24:20,283 --> 00:24:22,659
Are you still having trouble adjusting over there?

282
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:26,500
Do you need anything? I can send you some stuff from Taipei.

283
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:30,199
I want to continue experiencing life in Kinmen.

284
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:31,933
Send me the proposal once it's done.

285
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:33,209
That's it.

286
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:44,775
Mr. Bai.

287
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:45,799
Sorry.

288
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:50,042
I think I heard you said you want to stay in Kinmen to experience life.

289
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,584
Do you have time later?

290
00:25:10,318 --> 00:25:11,490
Nuo Nuo!

291
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,867
Nuo Nuo!

292
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:14,118
Nuo Nuo!

293
00:25:14,118 --> 00:25:15,584
Nuo Nuo!

294
00:25:17,784 --> 00:25:19,365
Did you guys call me?

295
00:25:19,365 --> 00:25:21,118
Why do you have your music so loud?

296
00:25:21,118 --> 00:25:22,532
Are you hard of hearing?

297
00:25:22,532 --> 00:25:24,541
Is it really that loud?

298
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:27,409
Mr. Bai is going with me to the market to buy groceries.

299
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:28,674
He said he wants to...

300
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:30,407
Wants to what? No way.

301
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:32,341
No way for what?

302
00:25:32,341 --> 00:25:34,784
For letting him cook.

303
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:36,951
I'm afraid you'll blow up our kitchen.

304
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:39,999
I just want your grandma to take me to experience life in Kinmen.

305
00:25:41,242 --> 00:25:43,591
That's good. No problem. Take care.

306
00:25:43,591 --> 00:25:45,909
- Then we'll head out. Bye.
- Come back early.

307
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:47,542
Okay.

308
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,547
- Grandma.
- What's wrong?

309
00:26:35,547 --> 00:26:37,116
I forgot to bring my wallet.

310
00:26:37,116 --> 00:26:39,397
It's okay. I have money.

311
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:42,076
I'm going out with a woman, of course I'll pay.

312
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:45,042
- I'll go get it. I'll be back soon.
- All right.

313
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,999
Sir.

314
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:20,330
Sir.

315
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,667
Li Hai.

316
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:36,225
Police station?

317
00:27:36,225 --> 00:27:38,364
I'm at the Sea Breeze Guesthouse.

318
00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:40,175
There's a stranger collapsed here

319
00:27:40,175 --> 00:27:42,292
and he's seriously injured.

320
00:27:47,534 --> 00:27:49,334
At the scene...

321
00:30:23,325 --> 00:30:26,415
I have a strange fate with police stations, huh.

322
00:30:26,415 --> 00:30:28,626
What's up? Kinmen branch.

323
00:30:42,184 --> 00:30:43,309
Mr. Bai Yin Mo.

324
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:46,599
Can you describe what happened at that time?

325
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,848
I was supposed to go out

326
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,599
to buy groceries with Ms. Shu Man.

327
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,309
I realized I had forgotten my wallet,

328
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,267
so I rushed back to the guesthouse.

329
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:58,567
When I got back to the guesthouse,
I saw an injured man lying on the ground.

330
00:30:59,965 --> 00:31:01,400
Sir.

331
00:31:05,434 --> 00:31:06,875
Hai Nuo.

332
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,599
I really don't feel well.

333
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:11,399
I've forgotten so many things.

334
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:14,584
I only remember

335
00:31:14,584 --> 00:31:18,900
I was at the guesthouse to ask about accommodation.

336
00:31:20,434 --> 00:31:24,900
A stranger grabbed a knife from the side...

337
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,483
and suddenly attacked me.

338
00:31:28,892 --> 00:31:31,599
I didn't react in time.

339
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,817
I was knocked unconscious.

340
00:31:34,725 --> 00:31:36,149
Mr. Chen Da Wu.

341
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:38,525
Could you describe the situation at that time?

342
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:41,599
Sorry.

343
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,932
I haven't been back in a long time.

344
00:31:42,932 --> 00:31:44,991
I'm a bit allergic.

345
00:31:44,991 --> 00:31:46,476
I just returned to Kinmen.

346
00:31:46,476 --> 00:31:49,934
On my way home, I passed by Sea Breeze Guesthouse.

347
00:31:49,934 --> 00:31:53,142
I haven't been back in so long, so I wanted to go in and take a look.

348
00:31:53,142 --> 00:31:56,767
When I entered the yard, I saw a man standing there sneakily.

349
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:59,399
I approached to ask what he wanted.

350
00:32:00,226 --> 00:32:02,026
He suddenly attacked me.

351
00:32:03,476 --> 00:32:05,142
I do have some training.

352
00:32:05,142 --> 00:32:07,599
So... I might've hit him too hard.

353
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:09,599
After I called the police,

354
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:12,142
I wanted to go in and see what was happening.

355
00:32:12,142 --> 00:32:13,809
I saw that guy.

356
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:16,599
The knife-wielding man I subdued.

357
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:18,809
I was worried he had accomplices,

358
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:21,567
so I picked up his knife.

359
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:26,067
After checking the first floor, I went to the second floor.

360
00:32:27,085 --> 00:32:30,252
And I ran into the man I had subdued.

361
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:31,900
That man...

362
00:32:32,725 --> 00:32:34,399
That man...

363
00:32:37,392 --> 00:32:39,567
- Clearly looked like a bad guy.
- Looked like a bad guy.

364
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:44,467
I really had no idea what was going on.

365
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:46,066
What were you doing at the time?

366
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:48,642
Collecting laundry, folding clothes,

367
00:32:48,642 --> 00:32:49,975
and listening to music.

368
00:32:52,358 --> 00:32:57,399
Officer, may I ask what exactly happened?

369
00:33:31,507 --> 00:33:33,109
Da Wu!

370
00:33:37,608 --> 00:33:39,599
Why didn't you tell us you were coming back?

371
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:41,142
I wanted to give you a surprise.

372
00:33:41,142 --> 00:33:44,192
A surprise? That's quite a surprise.

373
00:33:45,731 --> 00:33:48,408
By the way, that's Bai Yin Mo.

374
00:33:48,408 --> 00:33:50,073
He stays at our guesthouse.

375
00:33:50,073 --> 00:33:51,300
Mr. Bai.

376
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,318
This is Chen Da Wu, the village chief's son.

377
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:59,215
By the way, I just heard from the police

378
00:33:59,215 --> 00:34:01,149
that the criminal is a wanted suspect.

379
00:34:01,149 --> 00:34:02,929
He specializes in robbery and assault.

380
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:04,066
Good thing I was home.

381
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:05,731
If my grandma was home alone,

382
00:34:05,731 --> 00:34:07,617
it would have been too dangerous.

383
00:34:07,617 --> 00:34:09,224
I'll go back to find your grandma.

384
00:34:09,224 --> 00:34:10,797
I just contacted her.

385
00:34:10,797 --> 00:34:12,608
She went out to buy groceries.

386
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,896
Hai Nuo, I'll go home first. I'll find you and your grandma later.

387
00:34:14,896 --> 00:34:16,692
Okay.

388
00:34:20,557 --> 00:34:21,599
See you later!

389
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,067
- Bye!
- Bye.

390
00:34:27,797 --> 00:34:29,399
Let's go.

391
00:34:32,797 --> 00:34:34,641
Was that your boyfriend?

392
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:35,896
No.

393
00:34:35,896 --> 00:34:38,683
He's a good friend I grew up with.

394
00:34:38,683 --> 00:34:39,934
We had so much fun as kids.

395
00:34:39,934 --> 00:34:42,724
We'd play hide and seek in the sorghum fields.

396
00:34:42,724 --> 00:34:44,962
We'd go to the beach and play Eagle and Chicks.

397
00:34:44,962 --> 00:34:47,516
At night, we'd catch crabs and roast them to eat.

398
00:34:47,516 --> 00:34:49,984
My childhood was fun, right?

399
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,288
- How dirty.
- Dirty?

400
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:56,692
How clean was your childhood?

401
00:34:58,434 --> 00:35:00,817
You didn't spend your childhood acting, did you?

402
00:35:01,665 --> 00:35:03,252
Who is that Lin guy?

403
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:04,896
Is he Xiao Guang's cousin?

404
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:06,133
He is Xiao Guang's cousin.

405
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:08,476
His last name is Chen. He's Chen Da Wu.

406
00:35:08,476 --> 00:35:10,615
He's the representative of Kinmen's model students.

407
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:12,226
He's smart and kind.

408
00:35:12,226 --> 00:35:13,525
Unlike you.

409
00:35:14,267 --> 00:35:15,949
Stop insulting people.

410
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,790
I can tell from your expression.

411
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,145
Listen up, don't bully the people of Kinmen.

412
00:35:20,145 --> 00:35:21,356
I'm not insulting anyone.

413
00:35:21,356 --> 00:35:23,038
Your expression says it all.

414
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,689
Nuo Nuo.

415
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,896
- Nuo Nuo.
- Grandma.

416
00:35:26,896 --> 00:35:29,342
Grandma.

417
00:35:29,342 --> 00:35:31,392
Let me help you.

418
00:35:31,392 --> 00:35:33,371
Let me help you.

419
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:36,106
Let me carry this, and you can take this.

420
00:35:36,106 --> 00:35:37,758
Be careful.

421
00:35:37,758 --> 00:35:39,899
Grandma, Da Wu is back.

422
00:35:39,899 --> 00:35:41,818
Really?

423
00:35:41,818 --> 00:35:43,900
Where is he now?

424
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,025
I think he's going back to his parents' home.

425
00:35:46,025 --> 00:35:48,734
He should come to find us later.

426
00:35:48,734 --> 00:35:51,359
That's great, he's back. That's wonderful.

427
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,783
We can cook more dishes for him tonight.

428
00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:04,282
This time, we really have to thank Mr. Bai and Da Wu.

429
00:36:04,282 --> 00:36:06,899
Without them, Nuo Nuo
wouldn't have been safe and sound.

430
00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:07,942
Grandma.

431
00:36:07,942 --> 00:36:09,484
Mr. Bai didn't even see the thief

432
00:36:09,484 --> 00:36:11,150
and the thief was already subdued.

433
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,275
Da Wu thought he was the thief,

434
00:36:13,275 --> 00:36:15,692
so he fought with him and pinned him to the floor.

435
00:36:15,692 --> 00:36:16,899
Are you listening to me?

436
00:36:16,899 --> 00:36:18,065
Wait a minute.

437
00:36:18,065 --> 00:36:19,425
What are you posting?

438
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:20,734
It's done.

439
00:36:20,734 --> 00:36:23,109
Check it out in the group chat.

440
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:25,326
Let me take a look.

441
00:36:26,282 --> 00:36:29,859
Mr. Bai and Da Wu subdued the criminal together.

442
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:32,140
Everyone misunderstood Mr. Bai.

443
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,275
He's actually a very nice person.

444
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,699
He even protected Hai Nuo today.

445
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:41,727
Mr. Bai.

446
00:36:41,727 --> 00:36:43,458
My grandma has cleared your name

447
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:46,534
from being the public enemy of Kinmen.

448
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:48,950
Thank you.

449
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,899
I'm sorry.

450
00:36:52,899 --> 00:36:54,526
Da Wu isn't here and I keep bothering you.

451
00:36:54,526 --> 00:36:55,899
No worries.

452
00:36:55,899 --> 00:36:59,109
Da Wu is studying abroad, and he's the pride of Kinmen.

453
00:36:59,109 --> 00:37:02,526
As someone who he has respected since he was little,

454
00:37:02,526 --> 00:37:05,367
it's only right for me to help his parents.

455
00:37:06,526 --> 00:37:10,859
He always gets into fights because he was following in your footsteps.

456
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,275
Has Shun Hua gotten into another fight recently?

457
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:15,776
Stop talking about those fights.

458
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:18,576
Shun Hua has turned over a new leaf now.

459
00:37:18,576 --> 00:37:20,899
He has become a warmhearted guy.

460
00:37:20,899 --> 00:37:22,484
Look.

461
00:37:22,484 --> 00:37:24,859
Look at our Kinmen elementary and middle school's track team.

462
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:26,899
They've broken records. Look.

463
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:28,289
What's so special about that?

464
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:30,816
- There?
- Yes, thank you.

465
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:34,859
Da Wu has been the best since Kinmen High School was founded.

466
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:37,699
He graduated at the top of a medical school.

467
00:37:50,942 --> 00:37:52,692
My son!

468
00:37:52,692 --> 00:37:54,734
Mom.

469
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:56,634
Why didn't you tell us you were coming back?

470
00:37:56,634 --> 00:37:58,150
I could've asked your dad to pick you up.

471
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,159
There's no need for that.

472
00:38:01,465 --> 00:38:02,598
Hi, ma'am.

473
00:38:02,598 --> 00:38:04,200
Zhi Ting.

474
00:38:05,442 --> 00:38:08,034
Shun Hua.

475
00:38:13,275 --> 00:38:14,909
It has been a while.

476
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,899
Da Wu, you're getting handsome.

477
00:38:19,899 --> 00:38:23,998
- You flattered me.
- Not only is Da Wu handsome, but he's also smart.

478
00:38:23,998 --> 00:38:26,631
He speaks fluent English overseas.

479
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:29,697
Unlike me. When a foreigner asks me for directions,

480
00:38:29,697 --> 00:38:30,965
I become mute.

481
00:38:30,965 --> 00:38:33,783
Shun Hua, let me tell you. English is very simple.

482
00:38:33,783 --> 00:38:36,282
You only need to learn three sentences.

483
00:38:36,282 --> 00:38:38,998
When you buy something, you ask, "How much?"

484
00:38:38,998 --> 00:38:42,932
When you want to haggle, you say, "Too much."

485
00:38:42,932 --> 00:38:45,359
And when you say goodbye, "Thank you very much."

486
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,581
I know this one.

487
00:38:46,581 --> 00:38:48,999
- Thank you very much!
- See? Isn't it easy?

488
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:51,557
All right. My handsome son is finally back.

489
00:38:51,557 --> 00:38:54,651
Let me take him inside to see my husband first.

490
00:38:54,651 --> 00:38:57,075
Thank you very much.

491
00:39:00,776 --> 00:39:03,280
Why is the paint on our door peeling?

492
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,442
It's your dad's masterpiece.

493
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:10,326
He got drunk and couldn't find the key, so he used a rock to knock on the door.

494
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:13,899
Why stick this here?

495
00:39:13,899 --> 00:39:16,699
Once, he got drunk and went to the bathroom at night.

496
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:25,366
He actually opened it and peed inside.

497
00:39:25,366 --> 00:39:27,531
You know that day is coming soon.

498
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,274
Your dad is getting a bit gloomy.

499
00:39:29,274 --> 00:39:31,965
Lately, he has been having nightmares.

500
00:39:31,965 --> 00:39:34,917
You need to talk to him properly this time.

501
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:37,742
Don't let him drink so much that he risks his life.

502
00:39:38,734 --> 00:39:40,917
- All right.
- Dad.

503
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:42,230
Our son just got back.

504
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,734
You haven't even offered him any drinks

505
00:39:43,734 --> 00:39:45,941
and you keep talking about random stuff.

506
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:47,272
Da Wu, sit down.

507
00:39:47,272 --> 00:39:48,783
Have some tea.

508
00:39:56,656 --> 00:39:59,536
Dad, do you still drink a lot?

509
00:39:59,536 --> 00:40:01,163
Just a little.

510
00:40:01,163 --> 00:40:03,159
It helps me sleep better at night.

511
00:40:05,262 --> 00:40:08,899
Hong Hui Fang, aren't you concerned about how he has been doing abroad?

512
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:10,739
Of course I am.

513
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:13,884
He said he's doing okay. Healthy and safe.

514
00:40:13,884 --> 00:40:16,575
Did you tell him not to send us money anymore?

515
00:40:16,575 --> 00:40:19,299
He should save it for himself to buy a house and get married.

516
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:22,509
I've told him many times, but he insists on giving it to me, what can I do?

517
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:24,509
Do you know how long he plans to stay this time?

518
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:26,888
Why don't you ask him yourself? Why do you keep asking me?

519
00:40:26,888 --> 00:40:29,100
He's sitting right across from you.

520
00:40:33,299 --> 00:40:34,509
Dad.

521
00:40:34,509 --> 00:40:38,851
I came back early to Kinmen this time because I wanted to stay longer.

522
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:41,342
Staying longer isn't the issue.

523
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:43,300
The question is how long you'll stay.

524
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,795
You need to figure that out.

525
00:40:44,795 --> 00:40:46,926
Your age now

526
00:40:46,926 --> 00:40:50,299
is the prime time for a man to make a career.

527
00:40:50,299 --> 00:40:52,099
You understand, right?

528
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,099
Dad, let me take this call.

529
00:40:59,092 --> 00:41:00,518
Hello.

530
00:41:21,342 --> 00:41:23,967
Your grandma's cooking is still more delicious.

531
00:41:23,967 --> 00:41:25,800
Many people are selling Chinese dishes out there,

532
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,300
but only your grandma's cooking fits my taste.

533
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,365
Come on.

534
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:33,299
You used to mooch off my family for years.

535
00:41:33,299 --> 00:41:37,059
That flavor must be etched deep into your soul.

536
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:41,342
My grandma always says

537
00:41:41,342 --> 00:41:43,299
that she never thought you would become a doctor.

538
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:45,299
She thought you'd be an athlete,

539
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:48,299
a bodyguard, or something like that.

540
00:41:48,299 --> 00:41:51,099
After all, you've loved fighting since you were little.

541
00:41:54,176 --> 00:41:56,134
I did think about it.

542
00:41:56,134 --> 00:41:58,675
That's why I became a doctor.

543
00:41:58,675 --> 00:42:00,800
To hurt people and then heal them.

544
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,300
That way, I can save on compensation and medical fees.

545
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,726
What kind of twisted logic is that?

546
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,342
You actually came back to Kinmen
to run a guesthouse

547
00:42:08,342 --> 00:42:11,300
after finishing university in Taipei.

548
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,092
I'm not just saying that.

549
00:42:14,092 --> 00:42:17,309
If I say it, I'll do it.

550
00:42:18,299 --> 00:42:19,365
Running a guesthouse...

551
00:42:19,365 --> 00:42:22,100
You just want to stay close to your grandma, right?

552
00:42:23,134 --> 00:42:26,976
Yes, because I want to be her bodyguard.

553
00:42:27,602 --> 00:42:29,842
- Nice.
- What about you?

554
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:31,641
I'm more interested in hearing your story.

555
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:33,399
You have been to so many places.

556
00:42:33,399 --> 00:42:35,425
How do you feel about that?

557
00:42:35,425 --> 00:42:37,774
How do I feel?

558
00:42:37,774 --> 00:42:39,733
Not much.

559
00:42:39,733 --> 00:42:44,299
I've seen and experienced a lot outside. I gained a lot of insight.

560
00:42:44,299 --> 00:42:46,684
Now, I just want to come back to Kinmen.

561
00:42:49,051 --> 00:42:51,018
Because you're here.

562
00:42:55,176 --> 00:42:56,642
Me?
