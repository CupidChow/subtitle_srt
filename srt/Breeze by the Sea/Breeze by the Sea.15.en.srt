♫ You are like the sea ♫

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,451
♫ Every single day ♫

4
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:19,000
♫ You keep waiting ♫

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,400
♫ No matter if I come or not ♫

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,509
♫ A sudden gust of wind ♫

7
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:28,109
♫ Messed up my hairstyle ♫

8
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,676
♫ But it brought us together ♫

9
00:00:31,676 --> 00:00:38,899
♫ Only then did I discover how much I love who I am ♫

10
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:44,399
♫ Only you Remind me of myself ♫

11
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,899
♫ The one who used to love smiling ♫

12
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:50,899
♫ Why did I lose my smile? ♫

13
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,709
♫ Unable to find a way out ♫

14
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:56,818
♫ I stand by the sea, feeling the breeze ♫

15
00:00:56,818 --> 00:01:06,042
♫ Only you Remind me of myself and what I desire ♫

16
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:11,359
♫ I've finally learned that after all my overthinking ♫

19
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:06,175
Go on in.

20
00:02:37,494 --> 00:02:41,167
Don't blame yourself for not being by your grandma's side.

21
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,192
Grandma being discharged doesn't mean

22
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:55,526
she won't have another heart attack.

23
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:59,317
What are you afraid of?

24
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:01,259
I'm here.

25
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,578
Because of my carelessness,

26
00:03:05,578 --> 00:03:07,899
I almost lost my grandma.

27
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:13,442
I won't leave her again.

28
00:03:33,852 --> 00:03:35,534
Bai Yin Mo.

29
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:37,484
Bai Yin Mo.

30
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:40,209
Why don't you have the guts to face everyone?

31
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:42,468
The man and woman at the hospital earlier

32
00:03:42,468 --> 00:03:44,519
were also on the reality show.

33
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,834
Who are they to you?

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,899
Why are you running away?

35
00:04:00,794 --> 00:04:02,833
What are you hiding from?

36
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,277
Why did you go to the hospital?

37
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:07,792
What's your relationship with them?

38
00:04:10,452 --> 00:04:12,584
What are you afraid of?

39
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:17,767
There's nothing you can do to help here.

40
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:20,361
Can you guarantee that

41
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,999
reporters won't follow you to the hospital?

42
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,239
Why have you been hiding for so many days?

43
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,886
Is it because you abandoned your mom

44
00:04:33,886 --> 00:04:36,289
and don't want people to know?

45
00:04:41,401 --> 00:04:44,100
I'm giving you a chance to explain yourself.

46
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,999
Staying silent means you're admitting it, right?

47
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:19,426
It's confirmed that Bai Yin Mo abandoned his mom!

48
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:09,143
Do you have any paper and pens for drawing?

49
00:06:09,143 --> 00:06:11,134
What do you want to draw?

50
00:06:21,268 --> 00:06:23,553
Why are you a starfish?

51
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:27,918
Because starfish have amazing regenerative abilities.

52
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:34,286
Why am I a sea urchin?

53
00:06:34,286 --> 00:06:36,461
Do I have that many spikes?

54
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:38,899
I said you're like a sea urchin because

55
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,143
even though you've grown all these spikes to protect yourself,

56
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:45,893
you're actually very soft deep down inside.

57
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:47,494
Plus, I'm like a starfish.

58
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,378
I have invincible regenerative abilities.

59
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:50,999
If a starfish is with you,

60
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:52,799
what's there to be afraid of?

61
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,662
Don't worry. I'll take good care of them.

62
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:02,799
It's my responsibility.

63
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:08,350
As for you, please give it your all.

64
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,775
Don't give up just because of a small setback, bro.

65
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:16,531
What's with that look?

66
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,647
You're the one who can help them.

67
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:31,532
Helping and falling in love are two different things.

68
00:07:32,798 --> 00:07:34,598
Right now,

69
00:07:35,258 --> 00:07:38,016
I just want Hai Nuo to be happy.

70
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:41,698

You were admitted for a week, but it felt like you were gone for so long.

No, I won't cook.

You still have a loan to pay for the guesthouse.

Here's my bankbook.

130
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:45,725
I started saving this for you in the first year

131
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:48,024
after your parents left.

132
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:50,865
I planned to give it to you when you got married.

00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:53,008
You can take it now.

00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:02,325
I'll find another way to manage it.

What way?

139
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:05,432
Don't be so distant with me.

140

00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:49,875
You misunderstood me.

157
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:53,658
I'm not good with words.

158

It's for my daughter.

From the very first time I saved that money,

161
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,865
I thought of you as my daughter.

162
00:12:04,865 --> 00:12:06,908

Really?

173

I have a friend who works at Kinmen Hospital.

174
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,492
Do you want me to introduce you?

175
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,116
No need.

The best way to get over a broken heart

177

00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:08,625
Are you done?

185
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:10,685
Yes, I'm done.

186
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:12,665
All right, let's drink.

187
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,700
So, that packet fruit juice tastes great in cocktails.

188
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,384
Impressive, right?

189
00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:23,916
Let me add something else and see how it turns out.

190
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:26,241
Three, two, one.

191
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,158
One more shot. Come on.

192
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,865
Do you want to take a look at the photos?

193
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:30,865
They're nice.

194
00:14:30,865 --> 00:14:32,033
Welcome.

195
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:34,865
Welcome to Sea Breeze Village.

196
00:14:34,865 --> 00:14:37,866
Is this the place where Bai Yin Mo used to live?

197
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:39,533
Yes, he lived in...

198
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:41,485
- Do you see the second floor?
- Really?

199
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:43,791
I'm the village chief.

200
00:14:45,141 --> 00:14:47,283
Grandma.

201
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:48,958
I...

202
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:52,066
I checked the booking website this morning

203
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:55,617
and I found out that we're fully booked for this month.

204
00:14:55,617 --> 00:14:57,676
Really?

205
00:14:57,676 --> 00:14:59,865
It must be because of Yin Mo.

206
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,991
The Internet is really powerful.

207
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:05,665
They even found out that he once stayed here.

208
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,542
Yes, that's true.

209
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:20,791
Nuo Nuo.

210
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:25,450
Are you really not going to tell me anything?

211
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,266
Tell you what?

212
00:15:28,865 --> 00:15:30,283
I have always said

213
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:31,799
that no matter what decision you make,

214
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,492
I'll support you.

215
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:36,425
Whatever I promised, I'll keep my word.

216
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:41,966
If I decide to stay single,

217
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:44,233
you will support me, right?

218
00:15:45,484 --> 00:15:48,065
That would make my heart ache.

219
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:51,908
But nowadays, many women

220
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:54,732
can live perfectly fine without getting married.

221
00:15:54,732 --> 00:15:56,982
It's different from my generation.

222
00:15:56,982 --> 00:15:58,865
I'm not old-fashioned anymore.

223
00:15:58,865 --> 00:16:00,965
I've figured it out.

224
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:03,908
Grandma.

225
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:06,125
We're just going back to how things used to be.

226
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:10,450
Before Yin Mo showed up, we were doing just fine.

227
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,166
Yes.

228
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:16,865
Soon, our house will become lively again.

229
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:18,865
We're going to get busy again.

230
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:21,283
I'm doing fine. I want to be busy.

231
00:16:21,283 --> 00:16:24,699
I hope the guesthouse is full every day.

232
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:28,200
Should we clean up the house first?

233
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,325
Let's sweep the stairs.

234
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:30,916
All right.

235
00:16:45,726 --> 00:16:47,625
Welcome.

236
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:51,323
Are you the coffee shop owner on the reality show with Bai Yin Mo?

237
00:16:51,323 --> 00:16:53,865
Yes, that's me, and my son, too.

238
00:16:53,865 --> 00:16:55,991
You've got great style and a great sense of humor.

239
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:58,658
- Thank you.
- Your son is also super cool.

240
00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:00,732
- What would you like to drink?
- Two hot lattes, please.

241
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:01,908
Two hot lattes, okay.

242
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:03,158
- I'll bring them over to your seat.
- Okay.

243
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:05,408
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

244
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:14,617
Cai You Cai.

245
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,417
It's been a while.

246
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:39,376
It has been a while.

247
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:41,408
Why are you here?

248
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:44,575
I want to take Jing Liang to Taipei.

249
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:51,200
It wasn't convenient for me to contact Jing Liang before

250
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,408
because my mother-in-law was living with us.

251
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,839
She has strong opinions and I didn't want to upset her.

252
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:00,773
She has gone to live with my brother-in-law in Canada.

253
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:02,459
My husband is very understanding.

254
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:04,158
He knows I miss Jing Liang a lot,

255
00:18:04,158 --> 00:18:07,542
so he agreed to let me bring Jing Liang to Taipei to live with us.

256
00:18:08,158 --> 00:18:10,660
Your husband agreed?

257
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,350
You expect me to follow an agreement you made with a stranger.

258
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,417
Isn't that strange?

259
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:20,248
Even though you've been taking care of our son,

260
00:18:20,248 --> 00:18:25,015
don't forget we agreed on joint custody during the divorce.

261
00:18:25,015 --> 00:18:28,965
I have the right to request custody of Jing Liang as well.

262
00:18:29,618 --> 00:18:32,100
Also, Jing Liang is about to start university.

263
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,965
If he comes to Taipei earlier,

264
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:35,241
it will help him adjust sooner.

265
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:38,091
I can offer him a better environment.

266
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:43,965
I don't mean anything by that.

267
00:18:44,865 --> 00:18:47,733
I see you've opened this coffee shop

268
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:50,075
and it's doing quite well.

269
00:18:50,075 --> 00:18:52,366
You've worked really hard.

270
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:55,158
- You've changed a lot.
- I don't need your compliments.

271
00:18:55,158 --> 00:18:57,275
I don't care about that.

272
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,800
I also watched the reality show you were on.

273
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:08,491
Jing Liang has grown so tall.

274
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:11,365
He's already so grown up

275
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:14,866
and I've been absent from his life.

276
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:19,416
I... I really regret it.

277
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,765
You regret it?

278
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:29,476
So, to make up for your regrets,

279
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:31,965
you want to take him away from me?

280
00:19:32,592 --> 00:19:35,899
You haven't called even once in all these years.

281
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:38,675
I know I've been heartless.

282
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:41,949
I also know you won't agree.

283
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:44,442
But Jing Liang has grown up now.

284
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:46,693
Shouldn't we let him decide for himself?

285
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:49,584
That way, he'll know what's best for him.

286
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:54,057
You know what I'm like.

287
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:56,198
If you don't agree,

288
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:59,458
I'll go to his school and talk to him myself.

289
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:06,175
You're so certain I won't argue with you, right?

290
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,367
You've been taking care of Jing Liang alone for many years.

291
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:17,759
I'm really grateful to you.

292
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,966
That's why I didn't go directly to find him.

293
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:23,258
I wanted to...

294
00:20:23,258 --> 00:20:25,450
show you some respect.

295
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:32,492
Do you know how many times

296
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:35,609
Jing Liang wanted to sneak to Taipei to find you?

297
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,400
Do you know how many arguments we've had over you?

298
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,492
Do you know how much he misses you?

299
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:12,692
Dad, why did you close up so early today?

300
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:18,965
What's wrong?

301
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,742
Someone is waiting for you upstairs.

302
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,732
Waiting for me?

303
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:29,600
Who?

304
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,666
Go on.

305
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:54,080


306
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:09,300
Can Mommy...

307
00:23:10,308 --> 00:23:12,765
Can I give you a hug?

308
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,358
I'm so sorry.

309
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,091
I'm so sorry.

310
00:23:33,116 --> 00:23:36,183
I missed you so much. Do you know that?

311
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:48,865
I'm so sorry.

312
00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:52,665
I missed you so much. Do you know that?

313
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,466
Maybe I'll leave, too.

314
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:30,865
Do you prefer to say a proper goodbye

315
00:24:30,865 --> 00:24:33,465
or not say anything at all?

316
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:51,799
Hai Nuo, how's your grandma doing now?

317
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:54,200
She's doing okay, and her condition is pretty stable.

318
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,900
That's good then.

319
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:08,932
Wu Cai Zhen has a package for Li Hai Nuo.

320
00:25:08,932 --> 00:25:12,000
Please accept it.

321
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:15,141
What is this?

322
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:17,266
Why are you giving me this all of a sudden?

323
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,082
I saw how worried you've been about your grandma.

324
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:20,964
You look completely worn out.

325
00:25:20,964 --> 00:25:22,565
Do I?

326
00:25:25,075 --> 00:25:26,183
I know what this is.

327
00:25:26,183 --> 00:25:27,609
I've bought this before.

328
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,865
But it seems a bit different now.

329
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:33,600
Yes, my doctor friend told me

330
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,083
that they've added probiotics, iron, collagen,

331
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:38,733
and enhanced vitamin C to it.

332
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:40,865
It provides nine nutrients in one.

333
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:43,832
It's also incredibly popular in white-collar circles

334
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:45,865
and is a bestseller from Japan.

335
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:47,525
You actually know so much about it.

336
00:25:47,525 --> 00:25:49,684
It was specially chosen for you.

337
00:25:49,684 --> 00:25:52,865
Thank you for bringing it to me.

338
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,325
Actually, I came today

339
00:26:02,325 --> 00:26:05,075
to apologize

340
00:26:05,075 --> 00:26:07,083
and say goodbye.

341
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:12,732
I shouldn't have drunk so much during the reality show

342
00:26:12,732 --> 00:26:16,908
and brought up your past with Da Wu in front of everyone.

343
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:20,141
Come on, I already forgot about it.

344
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:22,542
But what's the goodbye about?

345
00:26:23,225 --> 00:26:26,075
I'm being transferred to Taipei.

346
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:29,865
I'll be leaving Kinmen next month.

347
00:26:29,865 --> 00:26:31,308
That's so sudden.

348
00:26:31,308 --> 00:26:33,866
Well, it's kind of like a promotion.

349
00:26:37,075 --> 00:26:40,108
I don't know if I should be happy or sad.

350
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:42,158
A promotion is a good thing.

351
00:26:42,158 --> 00:26:44,158
It's just that...

352
00:26:45,765 --> 00:26:48,091
You're also going to Taipei.

353
00:26:50,898 --> 00:26:54,840
Make sure to take care of yourself in Kinmen.

Mr. Bai.

391
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:51,949
It's really you. What a coincidence.

392
00:29:51,949 --> 00:29:54,600
I rarely come here and I actually ran into you.

393
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,931
I really want to thank you

394
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:59,642
for helping me take care of Jing Liang in Taipei.

395
00:29:59,642 --> 00:30:01,708
If you ever come over, I'd do the same for you.

396
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:07,883
Are you doing okay?

397
00:30:07,883 --> 00:30:11,468
The reality show crew pulled all those tricks

398
00:30:11,468 --> 00:30:14,949
and then there was some negative news about you.

399
00:30:14,949 --> 00:30:17,491
And your mom...

400
00:30:17,491 --> 00:30:20,308
Exposing personal matters of public figures

401
00:30:20,308 --> 00:30:22,166
to the scrutiny of the public

402
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:25,091
is truly a cruel thing to do.

403
00:30:27,832 --> 00:30:30,450
Sorry, it's a bad habit of mine.

404
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,966
I've started talking too much again.

405
00:30:32,966 --> 00:30:34,531
I know you're concerned about me.

406
00:30:34,531 --> 00:30:36,166
It's all good.

407
00:30:37,308 --> 00:30:39,433
Mr. Bai.

408
00:30:39,433 --> 00:30:43,116
I truly believe there's a unique

409
00:30:43,116 --> 00:30:45,023
and remarkable bond between us.

410
00:30:45,023 --> 00:30:46,108
You know what?

411
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:49,307
Every time something major happens in my family,

412
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:51,950
I always happen to run into you.

413
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,133
Has something happened?

414
00:30:55,651 --> 00:31:00,325
Well, that reality show had a pretty big impact.

415
00:31:01,308 --> 00:31:04,799
Jing Liang's mom came to see me yesterday.

416
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,216
She wants to take him to Taipei.

417
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:12,665
So, what's your decision?

418
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:23,075
Well, some people bring love home,

419
00:31:23,075 --> 00:31:27,865
but there are some who put love away.

420
00:31:27,865 --> 00:31:31,258
I don't know. It's a tough decision.

421
00:31:31,258 --> 00:31:34,065
I still can't figure out an answer.

422
00:31:39,308 --> 00:31:41,000
What about you?

423
00:31:41,915 --> 00:31:43,865
Are you here...

424
00:31:44,742 --> 00:31:46,700
to make a decision?

425
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:53,665
I'll put it back.

426
00:32:05,642 --> 00:32:07,865
That's a wise,

427
00:32:08,765 --> 00:32:11,133
but tough decision.

428
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:14,932
Thank you.

429
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:17,033
I know what I need to do now.

430
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:25,325
Lily, I'm sorry.

431
00:32:25,325 --> 00:32:27,033
Johnny can't make it today due to urgent matters.

432
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:28,517
He asked me to apologize to you on his behalf.

433
00:32:28,517 --> 00:32:31,400
Don't worry, it's been a while since we met anyway.

434
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,558
By the way, Lily,

435
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:35,684
is there something you want to talk about today?

436
00:32:37,732 --> 00:32:39,200
I was thinking

437
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,732
that public relations work is similar to being a manager.

438
00:32:42,732 --> 00:32:48,008
Is there any chance you can help me get a job at your company?

439
00:32:53,642 --> 00:32:55,366
Lily.

440
00:32:55,366 --> 00:32:59,425
We wouldn't dare hire someone as experienced as you.

441
00:33:01,091 --> 00:33:02,865
Besides,

442
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:08,665
I just got promoted to PR director not long ago, so...

443
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:11,651
I understand.

444
00:33:11,651 --> 00:33:14,175
I'll ask Johnny directly.

445
00:33:17,817 --> 00:33:20,476
- I'll see you another time.
- All right. See you soon.

446
00:33:20,476 --> 00:33:23,108
- I'll get going now. Keep in touch.
- Goodbye.

447
00:33:23,108 --> 00:33:26,258
Lily, to be honest with you,

448
00:33:26,258 --> 00:33:30,525
the fact that you arranged for Yin Mo and his mom to appear on that reality show

449
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:33,575
has now spread throughout the entire circle.

450
00:34:17,633 --> 00:34:19,565
Yu Mei.

451
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:24,965
- Mom.
- Jing Liang.

452
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,450
Be careful.

453
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,965
- Hello, ma'am.
- Mom.

454
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:33,300
- Hello.
- Do you remember Yue Shan?

455
00:34:34,175 --> 00:34:37,241
I'm Wang Yue Shan. I'm his classmate.

456
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,600
I remember you.

457
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,075
You're Ms. Xiu E's granddaughter, right?

458
00:34:42,075 --> 00:34:44,049
You've grown up so much,

459
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,517
but you're still as cute as when you were a child.

460
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:48,116
Let's go inside for dinner.

461
00:34:48,116 --> 00:34:49,608
Okay.

462
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:02,409
After dinner, you still want to eat roasted wheat flour?

463
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:04,434
Are you a kid?

464
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:06,693
Cai Jing Liang.

465
00:35:06,693 --> 00:35:08,300
Cai Jing Liang.

466
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,308
Cai Jing Liang.

467
00:35:11,308 --> 00:35:13,366
Why aren't you saying anything?

468
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:18,100
I just realized

469
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,592
the feeling of a dream coming true

470
00:35:22,492 --> 00:35:24,350
is so...

471
00:35:25,283 --> 00:35:27,651
So...

472
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:29,508
Happy?

473
00:35:29,508 --> 00:35:31,198
No.

474
00:35:31,198 --> 00:35:33,465
Excited?

475
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,075
No.

476
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,283
It feels sticky.

477
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:40,426
Sticky?

478
00:35:40,426 --> 00:35:42,183
I don't know.

479
00:35:43,132 --> 00:35:45,408
It's a complicated feeling.

480
00:35:47,366 --> 00:35:50,908
Are you really going to move to Taipei with your mom?

481
00:35:50,908 --> 00:35:52,159
Seriously?

482
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:55,907
I know you've always wanted to go to Taipei with your mom,

483
00:35:55,907 --> 00:35:58,450
but you've never met your stepdad.

484
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,058
Won't it be hard to adjust?

485
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:01,866
How would I know if I don't give it a try?

486
00:36:01,866 --> 00:36:05,684
What about your dad? What will he do?

487
00:36:05,684 --> 00:36:07,551
He'll probably be thrilled.

488
00:36:07,551 --> 00:36:09,033
He's free now.

489
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:11,283
Maybe he'll find someone else.

490
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:14,165
What about me?

491
00:36:14,165 --> 00:36:16,100
What do you mean?

492
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:25,225
Are you hungry?

493
00:36:28,075 --> 00:36:30,016
If you go to Taipei,

494
00:36:30,016 --> 00:36:32,676
who's going to talk to me from now on?

495
00:36:32,676 --> 00:36:33,865
Who's going to eat my breakfast?

496
00:36:33,865 --> 00:36:36,091
Who's going to help me with my homework?

497
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:40,933
Are you angry?

498
00:36:43,357 --> 00:36:45,016
Yue Shan.

499
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,175
Yue Shan.

500
00:36:49,642 --> 00:36:52,333
- Yue Shan.
- I'm just messing with you.

501
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:55,866
I'm just messing with you.

502
00:36:57,308 --> 00:36:59,612
If your dream comes true,

503
00:36:59,612 --> 00:37:01,402
I'll be happier than you are.

504
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:03,050
Just go to Taipei without any concerns.

505
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,310
When you've settled in Taipei,

506
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,308
you have to take me out to have fun.

507
00:37:09,073 --> 00:37:11,200
Really?

508
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,208
That's because you're my friend.

509
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:16,308
Here, take my share.

510
00:37:17,865 --> 00:37:18,865
It's mine, okay?

511
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:21,100
If you want to eat, order your own.

512
00:37:46,457 --> 00:37:47,858
Dad.

513
00:37:48,691 --> 00:37:50,466
Dad.

514
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:52,025
You're back.

515
00:37:57,433 --> 00:37:59,108
Well...

516
00:38:00,308 --> 00:38:03,702
Mom hopes that I can go with her...

517
00:38:03,702 --> 00:38:05,342
Go to Taipei?

518
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:09,758
Yes.

519
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:21,283
Remember to bring your ID when you take the plane.

520
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:24,049
If you forget, I won't deliver it.

521
00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:26,965
Got it, I won't forget.

522
00:38:33,283 --> 00:38:35,542
Take out the trash for me.

523
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,383
I'll go in first.

524
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,505
Best Actor Bai Yin Mo

525
00:39:07,505 --> 00:39:10,949
won the Popularity Award at the GFA Awards this year.

526
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,567
His career seemed to be on the rise,

527
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:14,765
but rumors emerged about a suspected drunk driving incident

528
00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:16,100
and refusal to cooperate with the police.

529
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:20,100
Footage of him handcuffed and taken to the police station also surfaced.

530
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,633
The scandal hadn't passed when he was caught on a live stream assaulting the host.

531
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:28,865
Incidents of violence and drunk driving caused his reputation to plummet.

532
00:39:28,865 --> 00:39:31,675
Later, Bai Yin Mo went to Kinmen to participate in a reality show...

533
00:39:31,675 --> 00:39:34,241
which briefly improved his public image.

534
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:37,865
Unexpectedly, his mom, who had never been seen before, suddenly appeared

535
00:39:37,865 --> 00:39:39,991
and the abandonment scandal broke out.

536
00:39:39,991 --> 00:39:43,533
Most of Bai Yin Mo's current endorsements have been suspended,

537
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:44,865
his new drama has halted production,

538
00:39:44,865 --> 00:39:47,558
and he has reached a low point in his acting career.

539
00:39:47,558 --> 00:39:52,558
The entertainment industry is uncertain about his potential to make a comeback.

540
00:39:55,725 --> 00:39:57,241
When you left the previous time,

541
00:39:57,241 --> 00:40:00,266
you were in such a hurry that I didn't have time to see you off.

542
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:02,275
Now that you're here,

543
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:04,565
why not stay a bit longer?

544
00:40:05,517 --> 00:40:07,350
Here,

545
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:12,075
I saw the village chief and Da Wu

546
00:40:12,075 --> 00:40:14,049
as well as you and Jing Liang,

547
00:40:14,049 --> 00:40:16,158
who care deeply for each other,

548
00:40:16,158 --> 00:40:19,325
working hard to mend your father-son relationship.

549
00:40:19,325 --> 00:40:22,175
I also saw the adorable grandparent-grandchild bond

550
00:40:23,158 --> 00:40:25,765
between Hai Nuo and Ms. Shu Man.

551
00:40:25,765 --> 00:40:28,765
As for Shun Hua and Zhi Ting,

552
00:40:28,765 --> 00:40:31,932
even though they argue a lot in daily life,

553
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:34,100
when they're apart,

554
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,365
they realize how important they are to each other.

555
00:40:37,365 --> 00:40:39,425
In Sea Breeze Village,

556
00:40:41,283 --> 00:40:43,684
you all seem like one big family.

557
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,575
If you stay,

558
00:40:46,575 --> 00:40:49,865
you'll be a part of this big family.

559
00:40:58,492 --> 00:41:01,366
Some people deserve the warmth of a home.

560
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,949
Some people...

561
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:08,508
want it but can't have it.

562
00:41:09,558 --> 00:41:12,016
And some don't need it at all.

563
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,408
Take care.

Bai Yin Mo has gone from being a shining movie star to a pariah,

568
00:41:52,675 --> 00:41:54,765
with fans lamenting his fall.

569
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:57,658
We now have a breaking news update.

570
00:41:57,658 --> 00:41:59,699
Bai Yin Mo's mom recorded a video

571
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:01,350
to clarify the abandonment scandal.

572
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,733
She has also replied to the many allegations made against him recently.

573
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:07,565
Let's hear her side of the story.

574
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:13,433
Yin Mo is a filial child.

575
00:42:13,433 --> 00:42:16,108
He has always treated me well.

576
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:21,765
My downfall is entirely my own fault.

577
00:42:22,865 --> 00:42:23,865
When I remarried,

578
00:42:23,865 --> 00:42:25,158
[Bai Yin Mo's mom shares the acot'rs painful past]

579
00:42:25,158 --> 00:42:27,765
I gave all the money from Yin Mo

580
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:31,734
to his stepdad for investment.

581
00:42:31,734 --> 00:42:34,541
Later, the business failed

582
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:39,765
and even the two houses he bought for me were lost.

583
00:42:41,057 --> 00:42:42,766
I'm sorry.

584
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:46,241
I took advantage of Yin Mo

585
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:47,900
and you.

586
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:52,433
That's why things are the way they are now.

587
00:42:54,998 --> 00:42:56,665
I'm sorry.

588
00:42:57,642 --> 00:42:59,949
For the first time in my life,

589
00:42:59,949 --> 00:43:02,116
I wanted to truly help Yin Mo,

590
00:43:02,116 --> 00:43:04,508
but I ended up

591
00:43:04,508 --> 00:43:06,442
hurting him.

592
00:43:08,392 --> 00:43:10,865
I came to you today

593
00:43:10,865 --> 00:43:14,158
to ask for a favor,

594
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:16,742
to make up for my mistakes.

595
00:43:17,765 --> 00:43:20,766
After I broke up with that man,

596
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:25,534
I was too ashamed to tell my son.

597
00:43:25,534 --> 00:43:28,158
So, I had to go to work.

598
00:43:28,158 --> 00:43:31,266
Yin Mo never abandoned me.

599
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:36,983
Instead, as his mom,

600
00:43:36,983 --> 00:43:40,058
I failed to take care of him when he was young.

601
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:44,658
Everyone has misunderstood him.

602
00:43:44,658 --> 00:43:47,266
It was all because of me.

603
00:43:48,082 --> 00:43:50,308
It was all my fault.

604
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:53,833
Please don't blame Yin Mo.

605
00:43:59,433 --> 00:44:01,308
I've sent it to all the major media outlets.

606
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:04,365
I'm sure it'll spread soon.

607
00:44:04,365 --> 00:44:06,609
Thank you.

608
00:44:06,609 --> 00:44:08,584
That's the least I could do.

609
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:13,725
What are your plans for the future?

610
00:44:15,865 --> 00:44:18,133
