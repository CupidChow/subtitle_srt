Mr. He, this doesn't make sense.

You've been an actor before.

5
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:44,792
Can you go through with acting like this?

6
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:48,339
This is a commercial film, so the audience won't think too much.

7
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:51,474
- Logic isn't that important.
- No, one guy against ten?

Also, why do I have to scream at the sky?

10
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,209
Back when I did period dramas,

00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:01,626
they had one guy against dozens or even a hundred.

- What a fog.

179
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:51,792
- The airport will...
- They're grounding all the planes.

180
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,033
Why are you still here?

181
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:04,825
I just checked the weather.

182
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:07,117
There's a heavy fog in Kinmen today. The plane probably can't take off.

183
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:08,532
That's why I'm still here.

184
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:10,325
Can you read the weather?

185
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:12,033
Of course I can't read the weather.

186
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:13,825
I checked my phone.

187
00:12:13,825 --> 00:12:15,700
The app says there's heavy fog today.

188
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,492
Is there any other way to leave Kinmen?

189
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:21,708
Unless you have a private yacht.

190
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,532
My phone is dead. Can I borrow yours?

191
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:27,284
Of course.

192
00:12:27,284 --> 00:12:28,533
- Here.
- Take me to the pier.

193
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:30,367
[Chen Fu Shou, Village Chief]

194
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:32,532
All right.

195
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:35,905
Mr. Bai, I'm sorry. The fog is really thick today.

196
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:39,284
We don't know when it'll clear up.
Why don't we go back to the guesthouse?

197
00:12:39,284 --> 00:12:40,825
I'm not going back there.

198
00:12:40,825 --> 00:12:42,242
Find me another hotel.

199
00:12:42,242 --> 00:12:43,825
I'll pay you double.

200
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:45,667
Well...

201
00:12:46,742 --> 00:12:49,992
Well, Mr. Bai, I'd like to ask what exactly happened?

202
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:53,200
Sea Breeze is a highly rated guesthouse

203
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,532
and Ms. Shu Man's cooking is excellent.

204
00:12:55,532 --> 00:12:57,875
The problem is her granddaughter.

205
00:12:58,783 --> 00:12:59,931
What?

206
00:12:59,931 --> 00:13:02,532
Her granddaughter? What's wrong with her?

207
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,159
She's very filial and kind.

208
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,533
Kind?

209
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:09,451
I only broke one of her tapes and she freaked out on me.

210
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:10,492
She's very rude.

211
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:11,532
I...

212
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:13,532
Well, I just want to ask.

213
00:13:13,532 --> 00:13:16,867
- Was that tape from the tape recorder?
- Yes.

214
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:20,492
- Her parents left it for her.
- So what?

215
00:13:20,492 --> 00:13:24,033
Her parents have already passed away.

216
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:27,033
Her family is her weak spot.

217
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:30,167
She'll go crazy if someone triggers it.

218
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,992
You can't leave now anyway.

219
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:35,255
How about coming to my place for a cup of tea first? Okay?

220
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:38,583
I'll help you with your luggage. Come on.

221
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:41,332
Let's go.

222
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:03,532
Gosh, our baby has grown so much.

223
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:05,908
Do you think we won't be able to carry her soon?

224
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:07,367
Of course not.

225
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:09,700
What you should worry about is that in a few years,

226
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,532
she'll be getting married.

227
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:15,583
Just thinking about it makes me so reluctant.

228
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:32,451
It's fixed.

229
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:34,231
Grandma!

230
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:36,959
Grandma, it's fixed!

231
00:14:37,742 --> 00:14:39,532
I fixed it.

232
00:14:39,532 --> 00:14:40,730
Really?

233
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,167
Impressive.

234
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,750
Hey.

235
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:17,033
Okay.

236
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:19,542
All right.

237
00:15:21,558 --> 00:15:23,730
Thank you.

238
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,333
Thank you.

239
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:29,115
Who was that?

240
00:15:29,115 --> 00:15:32,063
It's just a friend.

241
00:15:32,063 --> 00:15:34,167
A friend?

242
00:15:35,155 --> 00:15:39,332
A friend wouldn't make you act
so secretive on the phone.

243
00:15:40,254 --> 00:15:43,221
Was it the bank calling about the loan?

244
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:46,390
We've been holding on for so long.

245
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,451
It's exhausting for you to take on so much work to pay off the loan.

246
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:52,932
Why don't we close this place down?

247
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:54,433
Of course not.

248
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,183
I can decline other jobs,

249
00:15:56,183 --> 00:15:58,267
but this is the home we built together.

250
00:15:58,267 --> 00:15:59,932
We can't close the guesthouse.

251
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:01,225
Close this place down

252
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:04,932
and you can find someone to fall in love with and get married.

253
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:06,684
Wouldn't that be nice?

254
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:09,933
What are you talking about?

255
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:14,433
We were discussing the loan and now it's about me getting married?

256
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:15,677
I don't get it.

257
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:16,932
It's time to water the plants.

258
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:19,225
Water...

259
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:22,317
We just watered them this morning.

260
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:25,932
Those guys who used to pursue you,

261
00:16:25,932 --> 00:16:27,826
their kids are already in elementary school.

262
00:16:27,826 --> 00:16:32,475
And you don't even have a boyfriend.

263
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:35,183
Why does everything always come back to this?

264
00:16:35,183 --> 00:16:37,933
You work so hard every day.

265
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:40,517
You don't even have time to dress up.

266
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:42,267
You have no time to make friends.

267
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,932
That won't do.

268
00:16:43,932 --> 00:16:45,932
Grandma.

269
00:16:45,932 --> 00:16:47,932
Grandma!

270
00:16:47,932 --> 00:16:49,092
What's wrong with the way I dress?

271
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,498
And I do have friends.

272
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:52,851
Cai Zhen, Zhi Ting, Shun Hua.

273
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:56,442
Everyone in Kinmen is my friend.

274
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,684
I know you run the guesthouse

275
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:02,684
so that you can stay home and take care of me.

276
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:04,100
Don't worry.

277
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,350
If you meet someone nice, just go for it.

278
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,725
Date them and get married.

279
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:12,058
Even if you end up in Taipei, it's okay.

280
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:14,100
Video calls are so easy now.

281
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,933
We can still keep in touch.

282
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:19,419
We just have trouble paying the loan now,

283
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:21,392
but you're already imagining me married and living in Taipei.

284
00:17:21,392 --> 00:17:23,767
Also, video calls?

285
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:25,100
My goodness.

286
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,942
I really regret arguing with my God of Wealth this morning!

287
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,932
This is the village chief speaking.

288
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:35,600
My fellow villagers,

289
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,932
a superstar, Mr. Bai, is at my place.

290
00:17:39,932 --> 00:17:44,517
However, due to some issues with his accommodation tonight,

291
00:17:44,517 --> 00:17:51,183
I'm asking everyone to come over to my house right away

292
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:56,392
so that we can discuss how to solve the problem.

293
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:58,567
That's all.

294
00:18:01,932 --> 00:18:03,767
Mr. Fu Shou.

295
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:07,851
Weren't you supposed to find me a place to stay?
Why are you throwing a feast?

296
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:08,851
Mr. Superstar.

297
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:10,475
Haven't you heard of this saying?

298
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:13,975
"Meeting in person leaves a better impression and sharing a meal makes you closer."

299
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:15,908
Since you've graced us with your presence,

300
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:17,932
I should hold a welcome party for you.

301
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:19,892
Isn't that great?

302
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:21,942
I'll figure it out myself.

303
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:24,225
Everyone will be here soon.

304
00:18:24,225 --> 00:18:26,308
Your problem will definitely be solved.

305
00:18:26,308 --> 00:18:28,016
Don't feel embarrassed.

306
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:31,178
Your announcement was already embarrassing enough.

307
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:33,851
Come on. Sit here.

308
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:36,609
Enjoy the view here. Look.

309
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,142
Everything is almost ready.

310
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:41,851
Right, Ms. Xiu E,

311
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:43,932
remember to lock the doors and windows when you go out.

312
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:47,932
I heard from Mr. Yong at the market that their place got robbed.

313
00:18:47,932 --> 00:18:49,058
Right.

314
00:18:49,058 --> 00:18:52,559
The security in Sea Breeze Village is good. How could there be a thief?

315
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,942
All right. Just come over quickly.

316
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,932
Why are you helping that rude celebrity?

317
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:02,932
I'm the village chief. I have to serve the people.

318
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:08,725
Besides, having a celebrity in our village gives us some prestige too, right?

319
00:19:08,725 --> 00:19:09,932
How nosy.

320
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:11,933
By the way, don't drink too much later.

321
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:14,350
Okay.

322
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,932
Cai Zhen, you've worked hard.

323
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:17,642
You're busy with marketing and still have to do deliveries.

324
00:19:17,642 --> 00:19:19,933
This is heavy. Can you manage?

325
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:22,975
I can. I'll get going. The village chief is waiting for me.

326
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:25,108
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

327
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,933
Xiao Guang, help me find this tape online.

328
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:33,517
No matter how much it costs, you have to buy it for me.

329
00:19:33,517 --> 00:19:35,933
Are you studying or playing on your phone?

330
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:38,775
When you eat, just focus on eating.

331
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:41,517
Don't be shy.

332
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:43,933
Come on.

333
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,933
Drink some juice.

334
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:47,932
Mr. Fu Shou.

335
00:19:47,932 --> 00:19:51,308
- Why are you helping him find a place to stay?
- Stop nagging. Hurry up.

336
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:54,025
Mr. Fu Shou, I'm here.

337
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:56,975
What did Shun Hua bring? Where is he?

338
00:19:56,975 --> 00:19:59,183
How would I know?

339
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:01,767
He's your beloved and you don't know?

340
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,263
Stop talking nonsense.

341
00:20:03,263 --> 00:20:04,642
We've broken up.

342
00:20:04,642 --> 00:20:07,100
We're just roommates now.

343
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,725
Do you still live together after a breakup? Isn't that strange?

344
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:11,183
- I don't get it.
- Be careful.

345
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:13,809
- We opened the restaurant together.
- Be careful.

346
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:17,439
Even if we broke up, living upstairs together makes things easier, right?

347
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:18,932
Yes.

348
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:21,100
You two are really complicated.

349
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,600
Complicated.

350
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,142
Anyway, I'm single now.

351
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,975
- Being single is good.
- Yes.

352
00:20:27,975 --> 00:20:30,392
Mr. Fu Shou, help me out. You don't need to make an announcement.

353
00:20:30,392 --> 00:20:31,932
Everyone!

354
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:34,016
Zhi Ting is single now, okay?

355
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:36,517
Whoever wants to date her, come and get her number.

356
00:20:36,517 --> 00:20:39,308
- Me.
- Me.

357
00:20:39,308 --> 00:20:40,600
I want.

358
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,932
Pick me.

359
00:20:42,932 --> 00:20:44,932
- Mr. Fu Shou.
- Look...

360
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:47,975
That Bai is so clueless. Why are you helping him?

361
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:49,932
How many times do I have to say it?

362
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:52,100
I'm the village chief, so I have to serve the people.

363
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,475
Moreover, he's a superstar.

364
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:55,975
Having him here brings some attention to our village.

365
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:57,892
- Hey, you're here, too.
- Have a seat.

366
00:20:57,892 --> 00:20:58,932
Go ahead and eat first.

367
00:20:58,932 --> 00:21:00,725
Have a seat. I'll take the dish over.

368
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,600
- Wait, I'm coming.
- Here.

369
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,225
Hello, Mr. Bai. Welcome to Kinmen.

370
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:08,892
My name is Wu Cai Zhen. I'm Hai Nuo's friend.

371
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,392
I work at Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc.

372
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:14,108
- I wanted to invite you...
- I'm heading back to Taipei tomorrow.

373
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,358
- I see.
- Yin Mo!

374
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:19,809
Yue Shan.

375
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:21,732
Do you still remember me?

376
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:26,192
We had such a great chat yesterday and now we meet again today.

377
00:21:28,642 --> 00:21:33,064
Yin Mo, can I be your assistant?

378
00:21:33,064 --> 00:21:34,397
I don't need a salary.

379
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:36,031
I just want to follow you around.

380
00:21:36,031 --> 00:21:37,057
Please.

381
00:21:37,057 --> 00:21:38,851
Please...

382
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:40,307
Mr. Bai, let me tell you.

383
00:21:40,307 --> 00:21:43,932
Yue Shan has her own channel with a lot of subscribers.

384
00:21:43,932 --> 00:21:45,733
How many?

385
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,467
50 people.

386
00:21:53,715 --> 00:21:56,684
Talk to me again when you have 5,000.

387
00:21:56,684 --> 00:21:58,840
5,000 people?

388
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,388
Yue Shan.

389
00:22:00,388 --> 00:22:01,692
Come here.

390
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:05,785
What is it?

391
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:09,185
What weird things are you saying to him again?

392
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:10,642
I have a great opportunity now.

393
00:22:10,642 --> 00:22:13,833
If I close this deal, I can go live with Dad in Taipei.

394
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,792
Stop thinking about all that nonsense.

395
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,209
Focus on your studies.

396
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:18,226
Sit here.

397
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:21,175
Don't sit with that rude person. Sit down.

398
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,000
It's not some random nonsense.

399
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,167
You hurt Ms. Shu Man this morning.

400
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:30,425
Everyone knows about it now.

401
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:34,242
It seems like everyone is mad at you.

402
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,775
I'd better blend in.

403
00:22:36,775 --> 00:22:38,232
I'll go sit with them.

404
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,032
I'm sorry.

405
00:22:47,692 --> 00:22:49,109
Everyone.

406
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:51,232
Is everyone here?

407
00:22:51,232 --> 00:22:54,358
As the village chief, I'd like to introduce you all

408
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:57,232
to the latest product from Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc.,

409
00:22:57,232 --> 00:23:00,859
Kinmen Extradosed Bridge Welcome Liquor.

410
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:05,192
The bottle has gold fragments on it.

411
00:23:05,192 --> 00:23:07,692
There's also the iconic Kinmen's Wind Lion God,

412
00:23:07,692 --> 00:23:12,400
Wind Rooster, and this magnificent crown.

413
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,232
I hope this liquor brings peace, good fortune,

414
00:23:16,232 --> 00:23:19,817
and all the best to the people of Kinmen.

415
00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:22,325
- Good!
- Thank you.

416
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:24,400
Mr. Fu Shou.

417
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,025
- It's time to get to the main issue, right?
- Right.

418
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:30,442
There's another important matter

419
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,567
that I need to discuss with you all.

420
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:34,817
Because our superstar guest

421
00:23:34,817 --> 00:23:38,900
is having some issues with his accommodation tonight,

422
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:48,567
I hope one of you can kindly offer up a room for him to stay in.

423
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:50,450
Me!

424
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:58,233
Please, everyone. Be enthusiastic.

425
00:23:58,233 --> 00:23:59,316
Any volunteers?

426
00:23:59,316 --> 00:24:01,151
Shun Hua? Anyone?

427
00:24:01,151 --> 00:24:02,483
Our place is full. Sorry.

428
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,706
Right, Zhi Ting?

429
00:24:04,706 --> 00:24:06,775
It's fine.

430
00:24:06,775 --> 00:24:08,825
I'll just find a hotel.

431
00:24:12,773 --> 00:24:14,440
Me.

432
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,992
Me. Over here.

433
00:24:20,815 --> 00:24:23,109
Well...

434
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:24,977
Mr. Bai.

435
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:26,817
Would you like to reconsider

436
00:24:26,817 --> 00:24:30,032
staying at Sea Breeze Guesthouse?

437
00:25:19,232 --> 00:25:22,473
I don't want to sell it either,

438
00:25:22,473 --> 00:25:25,572
but we really can't hold on any longer.

439
00:25:25,572 --> 00:25:27,232
The guesthouse is my only home.

440
00:25:27,232 --> 00:25:30,033
How can you sell it?

441
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:42,249
Okay.

442
00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:45,925
I'll reluctantly agree.

443
00:25:54,232 --> 00:25:55,733
That's great!

444
00:25:55,733 --> 00:25:58,852
So, this matter is now resolved perfectly.

445
00:25:58,852 --> 00:26:01,075
Everyone, clap!

446
00:26:02,692 --> 00:26:06,232
All right, please enjoy the food as much as you can.

447
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,151
This is great.

448
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,692
- Just a little. Let him...
- All right.

449
00:26:10,692 --> 00:26:11,695
Eat more vegetables.

450
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,094
These are my signature dishes. No leftovers are allowed

451
00:26:13,094 --> 00:26:14,968
All right. She drank too much.

452
00:26:14,968 --> 00:26:17,233
- It's fine.
- Come on.

453
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:19,151
Just a little.

454
00:26:19,151 --> 00:26:21,232
I'm fine.

455
00:26:21,232 --> 00:26:24,151
Grandma, I'm going to check on Mr. Bai.

456
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:25,608
Go ahead.

457
00:26:25,608 --> 00:26:28,942
- Stop drinking.
- We don't...

458
00:26:28,942 --> 00:26:30,232
All right. Come on.

459
00:26:30,232 --> 00:26:31,316
Let's drink.

460
00:26:31,316 --> 00:26:33,151
Fill it up.

461
00:26:33,151 --> 00:26:36,075
- Ma'am, let's drink.
- Cheers to everyone.

462
00:26:44,232 --> 00:26:46,109
Pour your own drink.

463
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:47,358
Drink up.

464
00:26:47,358 --> 00:26:50,032
Just a little. Help yourself.

465
00:26:54,496 --> 00:26:55,853
Mr. Bai.

466
00:26:55,853 --> 00:26:57,480
Are you sure you don't want to eat anything?

467
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,158
- I can bring some for you.
- I'm not hungry.

468
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,117
Well...

469
00:27:08,117 --> 00:27:12,875
Thank you for agreeing to stay at our guesthouse.

470
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:22,167
Grandma, come on.

471
00:27:23,532 --> 00:27:26,616
I'll go find Fu Shou later

472
00:27:26,616 --> 00:27:30,332
and see if anyone is willing to take over the place.

473
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:33,284
The guesthouse is my only home.

474
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,332
How can you sell it?

475
00:27:36,783 --> 00:27:40,658
You know I can't lose this home.

476
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:43,532
I don't want to sell it either,

477
00:27:43,532 --> 00:27:49,333
but we really can't hold on any longer.

478
00:27:56,867 --> 00:28:00,117
I'll bring the God of Wealth back.

479
00:28:00,117 --> 00:28:03,292
If I find him, the loan won't be a problem.

480
00:28:04,532 --> 00:28:08,332
Even if I have to kneel, I'll beg him to come back.

481
00:28:08,992 --> 00:28:10,750
Okay?

482
00:28:26,325 --> 00:28:29,700
You guys have been eating for quite a while.

483
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,375
It should be about done.

484
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:37,833
Well...

485
00:28:38,992 --> 00:28:41,292
About this morning,

486
00:28:42,117 --> 00:28:44,492
I'm really sorry.

487
00:28:44,492 --> 00:28:48,332
I was very rude toward you.

488
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,583
I'm sorry.

489
00:28:55,992 --> 00:29:00,708
Can you take down the one-star review?

490
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,875
Thank you.

491
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:18,532
How about this? You can give us a five-star review.

492
00:29:18,532 --> 00:29:20,451
What do you think?

493
00:29:20,451 --> 00:29:22,125
We'll see.

494
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,532
Hai Nuo.

495
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:28,533
- What's up?
- Ms. Shu Man drank too much.

496
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,367
Shouldn't you help her back to rest?

497
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:32,825
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

498
00:29:32,825 --> 00:29:34,277
I'll go help my grandma first.

499
00:29:34,277 --> 00:29:37,332
I'll help you with your luggage later.

500
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,708
Grandma.

501
00:29:52,532 --> 00:29:56,332
I'm sorry about this. I have to trouble you with my grandma.

502
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:03,992
I'll treat you to Kinmen rice ale beef noodles tomorrow.

503
00:30:03,992 --> 00:30:05,825
It's made with beef bone broth.

504
00:30:05,825 --> 00:30:07,532
The taste is really rich.

505
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:10,616
The best part is it's oil-free and low in salt.

506
00:30:10,616 --> 00:30:11,700
You'll love it.

507
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,080
- Just focus on leading the way.
- Okay.

508
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,284
Wait.

509
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:19,332
Wait.

510
00:30:20,117 --> 00:30:22,292
One moment.

511
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:26,908
Well...

512
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,532
I see you're out of breath. Let me take over.

513
00:30:29,532 --> 00:30:30,981
You?

514
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:32,700
What if your grandma gets hurt?

515
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,332
I'll do it.

516
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,451
How much longer?

517
00:30:37,451 --> 00:30:39,532
It should be another five minutes.

518
00:30:39,532 --> 00:30:40,532
Five minutes?

519
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:44,325
- Well, go straight, turn left, and we'll be there.
- All right. Let's go.

520
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:46,209
Okay.

521
00:30:47,872 --> 00:30:49,253
- Is this the way?
- Yes it is.

522
00:30:49,253 --> 00:30:50,416
Okay.

523
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:56,992
Come on.

524
00:30:56,992 --> 00:30:59,251
Watch your step.

525
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:02,209
Didn't you say five minutes?

526
00:31:03,075 --> 00:31:04,532
It is five minutes.

527
00:31:04,532 --> 00:31:06,575
Why does it feel like it has been 15 minutes?

528
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:08,750
Help me.

529
00:31:09,532 --> 00:31:10,664
Which way?

530
00:31:10,664 --> 00:31:13,080
- Clockwise.
- Turn...

531
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,367
Watch your feet.

532
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:17,084
One, two.

533
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,451
I'll go get some water.

534
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,063
Hai Nuo.

535
00:31:27,063 --> 00:31:31,200
You lost your parents when you were so young.

536
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,825
It hurts my heart so much.

537
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:37,532
I feel very sorry for you.

538
00:31:37,532 --> 00:31:40,532
You had to give up your dream

539
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:45,042
and work very hard to make money with me.

540
00:31:52,532 --> 00:31:55,532
Be careful. You're going to hit the wall.

541
00:31:55,532 --> 00:31:57,159
Try again.

542
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:00,532
Just keep your hand straight.

543
00:32:00,532 --> 00:32:02,875
Good job.

544
00:32:07,895 --> 00:32:10,820
Are you pretending to sleep? Are you hungry?

545
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:19,829
She's so obedient, so dutiful, and so well-behaved.

546
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:22,292
You'd better not forget her.

547
00:32:23,325 --> 00:32:27,284
She's already 30 years old.

548
00:32:27,284 --> 00:32:32,164
If she doesn't get married soon, she won't be able to have kids.

549
00:32:32,164 --> 00:32:33,522
Here's your water.

550
00:32:33,522 --> 00:32:36,667
Stop talking and drink some water. Come on.

551
00:32:38,532 --> 00:32:42,056
I already told Xiu E.

552
00:32:42,056 --> 00:32:46,929
Once the guesthouse closes, I'll move in with her.

553
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:48,715
You don't need to worry about me.

554
00:32:48,715 --> 00:32:51,383
Our guesthouse won't close and you don't have to live with Ms. Xiu E.

555
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:52,938
We'll stay here forever.

556
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:54,667
Hurry and drink more.

557
00:32:58,545 --> 00:33:00,345
You all carry on.

558
00:33:06,532 --> 00:33:08,995
If a girl doesn't get married,

559
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:11,706
who will take care of her when she gets old?

560
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:14,214
Who will take care of me? I can take care of myself.

561
00:33:14,214 --> 00:33:16,532
I can live with Cai Zhen. She's not getting married either.

562
00:33:16,532 --> 00:33:18,581
No.

563
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:20,532
If a girl doesn't get married,

564
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:23,631
there won't be a place for her memorial tablet

565
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:25,541
and there'll be no one to pray for her.

566
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:27,581
How pitiful.

567
00:33:27,581 --> 00:33:28,697
I can't bear it.

568
00:33:28,697 --> 00:33:30,796
It's heartbreaking.

569
00:33:30,796 --> 00:33:31,829
I'm reluctant.

570
00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:33,451
Ms. Lu Shu Man.

571
00:33:33,451 --> 00:33:35,155
What are you thinking?

572
00:33:35,155 --> 00:33:36,796
My memorial tablet?

573
00:33:36,796 --> 00:33:39,251
No wonder you can't sleep well at night.

574
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:54,862
- Love charm.
- What love charm?

575
00:33:54,862 --> 00:33:55,867
Your feet.

576
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,329
You have a love charm under your pillow.

577
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:01,084
When did you put it there? Why didn't I know?

578
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:08,125
How funny.

579
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:51,000
You're back, Mr. Bai.

580
00:35:53,116 --> 00:35:54,951
Mr. Bai.

581
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:57,032
Why do you look so pale?

582
00:35:57,032 --> 00:35:59,751
I'll get you a cup of warm water.

583
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:14,533
Did he faint because he didn't eat anything?

584
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:15,700
That's possible,

585
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,951
but it could also be due to his long-term lack of sleep.

586
00:36:19,951 --> 00:36:22,032
Lack of sleep?

587
00:36:22,032 --> 00:36:25,751
Doctor, can you take a look at this for me?

588
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,584
What is this?

589
00:36:30,784 --> 00:36:33,492
This is a high-dose sleeping pill.

590
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:39,242
If taken long-term, it can greatly affect your sleep.

591
00:36:39,242 --> 00:36:41,158
Thank you.

592
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:43,784
Once the drip is done, just let him rest a bit.

593
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,242
He'll feel better.

594
00:36:45,242 --> 00:36:47,075
So, there's no need to worry.

595
00:36:47,075 --> 00:36:49,909
Let's leave him alone for now.

596
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:51,625
Thank you.

597
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:21,158
Grandma, where are you going?

598
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:24,032
I'm going to buy some nutritious food to cook for Mr. Bai.

599
00:37:24,032 --> 00:37:26,200
- Wait for me. I'll go with you.
- No need.

600
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,815
You stay here with him.

601
00:37:27,815 --> 00:37:29,867
He just received an IV drip, so he should sleep for a while.

602
00:37:29,867 --> 00:37:31,367
I'll go with you for a while and come back.

603
00:37:31,367 --> 00:37:33,450
- I said no need.
- Yes.

604
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,742
- No.
- Yes.

605
00:37:34,742 --> 00:37:36,032
No need.

606
00:37:36,032 --> 00:37:38,075
Yes.

607
00:37:38,075 --> 00:37:40,325
- Wait for me.
- I said no need.

608
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:41,492
Yes.

609
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,158
I want to go with you.

610
00:37:43,158 --> 00:37:46,542
- Come on. I'll help you.
- Why are you so disobedient?

611
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:04,909
Yin Mo, why didn't you call before you came back?

612
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:06,617
Yin Mo.

613
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,533
Why are you here?

614
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:10,832
Whose shoes are those?

615
00:38:11,909 --> 00:38:13,242
A friend of mine.

616
00:38:13,242 --> 00:38:15,542
Yu Mei, that...

617
00:38:16,742 --> 00:38:19,032
Do you know today is my dad's death anniversary?

618
00:38:19,032 --> 00:38:21,242
Famous actor Bai Yin Mo is suspected of drunk driving

619
00:38:21,242 --> 00:38:23,116
and refused police checks.

620
00:38:23,116 --> 00:38:25,742
- Bai Yin Mo has now been handcuffed
- Cuff him up.

621
00:38:25,742 --> 00:38:28,042
and taken to the police station.

622
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:32,032
How did he get injured?

623
00:38:32,032 --> 00:38:35,565
While filming, he fell off a horse.

624
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:36,792
I'll exclude him from the film first.

625
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:39,700
Let him rest for a few months and see how he's doing

626
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,158
before deciding if he wants to stay in this industry.

627
00:38:42,158 --> 00:38:46,075
If he can't make money, what value does he have?

628
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,909
I don't want to act anymore.

629
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,032
Yin Mo.

630
00:38:50,032 --> 00:38:52,700
Why are you up? Are you in pain?

631
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,248
Yu Mei, we should go.

632
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,450
The plane won't wait.

633
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:59,032
Mom, did you hear what I said?

634
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:00,575
Yin Mo.

635
00:39:00,575 --> 00:39:02,032
I have to go now.

636
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:04,167
Lily will take care of you.

637
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:08,663
I'm sorry to trouble you.

638
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:13,784
Yin Mo, you should lie down first.

639
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,951
We won't go back to the set for a few days.

640
00:39:15,951 --> 00:39:17,951
I don't want to rest.

641
00:39:17,951 --> 00:39:19,700
I want to go back to the set.

642
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,032
I want to make money.

643
00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:24,032
I have to make money for them.

644
00:39:24,032 --> 00:39:26,459
I have to make money for them.

645
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:32,314
Mr. Bai.

646
00:40:36,904 --> 00:40:38,870
Where did he go?

647
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,332
Grandma.

648
00:40:42,332 --> 00:40:45,092
Mr. Bai isn't in his bed.

649
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:47,542
Slow down.

650
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:49,332
- Go and ask around.
- Okay.

651
00:40:49,332 --> 00:40:50,458
Mr. Shui.

652
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:54,000
- Have you seen that superstar?
- That superstar? I haven't seen him.

653
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,792
Okay, thank you.

654
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:57,332
Thank you.

655
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:59,416
Grandma, you wait at home. I'll go find him.

656
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,759
No, I'm worried, too.

657
00:41:57,209 --> 00:41:58,332
After my dad passed away,

658
00:41:58,332 --> 00:42:00,042
all you ever do is tell me to go out and make money.

659
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:03,467
Where did all the money go? Where's your boyfriend?

660
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,717
Yin Mo.

661
00:42:27,332 --> 00:42:28,750
Listen to me.

662
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:32,009
Don't rely too much on the sleeping pills.

663
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:42,967
Happy birthday.

664
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:49,603
You can rest over there.

665
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:51,404
It's nice to feel the breeze.

666
00:42:51,404 --> 00:42:53,320
The view is beautiful, too.

667
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:56,583
He can't rest.

668
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:59,042
Mom, did you hear what I said?

669
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:00,708
I don't want to act anymore.

670
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,332
I want to go back to school.

671
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:06,436
If he can't make money, what value does he have?

672
00:43:06,436 --> 00:43:08,125
I don't want to rest.

673
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:09,583
I want to go back to the set.

674
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:11,332
I want to make money.

675
00:43:11,332 --> 00:43:13,508
I have to make money for them.

676
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,342
Bai Yin Mo, aren't you embarrassed?

677
00:43:21,292 --> 00:43:23,251
This is the last time I will see you.

678
00:43:23,251 --> 00:43:26,216
From now on, my mom is dead.
