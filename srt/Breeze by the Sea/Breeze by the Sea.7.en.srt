Calculate the total investment for the restaurant plus interest.

19
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:44,167
Let me know and I'll transfer the money to you.

20
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:47,417
Ye Zhi Ting, you need to remember this.

21
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:49,999
You're destined for wealth and prosperity.

22
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:51,918
Don't step into the kitchen or learn to drive.

23
00:01:51,918 --> 00:01:53,626
Play dumb when you can.

24
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:54,876
Don't be too clever.

25
00:01:54,876 --> 00:01:56,999
Otherwise, you'll end up working hard for nothing.

26
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:59,042
Why are you still saying this to me?

27
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:01,876
We're already over.

28
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:03,209
So what?

29
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:05,626
Every beginning has an end.

30
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,918
All good things must come to an end.

31
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:10,334
We'll go our separate ways and start anew.

32
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:12,417
Go live happily with that guy.

33
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:13,999
I'll find someone else, too.

34
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:15,999
I'll make the restaurant really successful

35
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:17,459
and open a branch in Taiwan.

36
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,999
You can bring your husband and kids to my restaurant to support me.

37
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:20,918
I'll give you a discount.

38
00:02:20,918 --> 00:02:22,799
I'm going to America.

39
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:28,999
America? That's pretty far.

40
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:31,542
If I want to open a branch there,

41
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:33,509
I'll have to work even harder.

42
00:02:35,626 --> 00:02:37,542
It's about time. You should go.

43
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:39,384
I've got work to do, too.

45
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:57,999
Got it.

00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:19,083
Dad, Mom.

50
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:23,799
I miss you both, but I will be brave.

51
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,842
Da Wu, what's wrong?

52
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:35,999
I still remember when I was little,

53
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,918
I stepped on glass by the sea and cut my foot.

54
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,259
You carried me all the way back to the shore.

55
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:43,167
I had strong muscles back then.

56
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:45,592
I can't do that now.

57
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:51,751
Actually, I was always afraid of water as a child.

58
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:55,300
But you always told me that the sea is like your parents.

59
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:01,125
When you swim in the sea,

60
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:04,050
it's like your parents are holding you close.

61
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,542
You've been optimistic since you were young.

62
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:11,542
The sea took both your parents

63
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,751
and it left my dad living in its shadow,

64
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:15,592
unable to move on.

65
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,704
You were so young back then,

66
00:04:19,704 --> 00:04:21,967
yet you were able to make peace with the sea.

67
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:26,584
That's why everyone calls me Starfish.

68
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:29,063
Because starfish have strong vitality.

69
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:30,563
That's right.

70
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,629
If you're going to get through the day anyway,

71
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:34,360
why not do it with a smile?

72
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,134
- Yeah.
- What do you think I'm like?

73
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:41,459
- You're like a dolphin.
- A dolphin?

74
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:44,800
You're smart, kind, with a bit of mischief.

75
00:04:46,164 --> 00:04:48,613
Do you know who's like a sea urchin?

76
00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:50,898
Sea urchin?

77
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:54,065
- Cai Zhen?
- No, it's Bai Yin Mo.

78
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:57,800
Don't you think he's all spiky, just like a sea urchin?

79
00:05:01,198 --> 00:05:03,050
Yes, they're pretty similar.

80
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:29,959
Hi.

81
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:32,867
Are you here alone?

82
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:34,409
Here to drink, look at paintings,

83
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,999
or just passing time?

84
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,876
The third one.

85
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:44,283
Would you like a drink?

86
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:45,909
I'm driving.

87
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:50,999
Let me make you a non-alcoholic drink to pass the time.

88
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,199
First, take these hangover pills to the toilet.

89
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,951
Toilet? Who's in there?

90
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:05,707
Shun Hua.

91
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:08,199
Just leave him be. Don't bother him.

92
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,534
If he pukes, will you clean it up?

93
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:12,542
It'll be ready by the time you're done.

94
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:44,159
Hi, are you Xu Man?

95
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,792
Yes.

96
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:48,466
Here's the thing. I'm Hai Nuo's friend.

97
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:49,608
My name is Wu Cai Zhen.

98
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:51,199
I worked at Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc.

99
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,159
- I heard you're great at making drinks.
- Just so-so.

100
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,992
I brought a special bottle of liquor today and thought we could exchange some ideas.

101
00:06:56,992 --> 00:06:58,659
Sure.

102
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:01,118
This bottle is a commemorative liquor made to celebrate

103
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:03,999
the completion of the Kinmen bridge.

104
00:07:04,826 --> 00:07:06,397
Look at the design of the bottle.

105
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:08,492
It has got a misty blue glaze,

106
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:11,325
symbolizing the beauty of seeing the bridge

107
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:16,076
through the dense fog of Kinmen.

108
00:07:16,076 --> 00:07:17,575
Would you like to try it?

109
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:18,700
Or maybe you can use

110
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,999
this bottle of liquor to make a few cocktails?

111
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:29,784
Calm down.

112
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:33,292
Yes, very good. Just like that.

113
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:54,042
I'll quietly slip out now.

114
00:08:06,497 --> 00:08:09,367
- Here's another one. Try it.
- Thank you.

115
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:10,681
I'll get you some snacks.

116
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:12,042
Okay.

117
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:22,083
She just left quietly.

118
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:25,992
I don't want it.

119
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:27,700
Don't leave.

120
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,199
I don't want to hire anyone.

121
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,648
I don't want it. I don't like curly hair.

122
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:34,076
I don't want other women.

123
00:08:34,076 --> 00:08:36,492
I only want Zhi Ting.

124
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:38,951
Zhi Ting, why did you leave me?

125
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,839
I've even started sitting down to pee

126
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,534
and putting my dirty clothes in the laundry basket.

127
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:49,167
Why did you leave me?

128
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:54,417
Don't go.

129
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:03,542
Every time I come here, there's some drunk guy.

130
00:09:04,298 --> 00:09:06,083
How disgusting.

131
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:25,497
- Where's Cai Zhen?
- She left.

132
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:27,648
She looked really embarrassed when she left.

133
00:09:27,648 --> 00:09:29,834
What were you two doing in the restroom?

134
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:34,000
This drink was really hard to get.

135
00:09:36,897 --> 00:09:38,815
I'm about done.

136
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,232
- Are you leaving just like that?
- What else?

137
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:43,258
Take him home.

138
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:45,032
I was just here to kill time.

139
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:47,430
Hey, this isn't a hotel.

140
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,463
Last time, I allowed you and your bro to stay over,

141
00:09:50,463 --> 00:09:52,209
that was an exception.

142
00:10:01,298 --> 00:10:03,109
Is he okay?

143
00:10:03,109 --> 00:10:04,622
Don't worry.

144
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:06,999
Even animals find their way home.

145
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:10,463
I usually don't get involved.

146
00:10:10,463 --> 00:10:13,159
I'm not going home. I'm really not.

147
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,217
What's so funny?

148
00:10:15,217 --> 00:10:16,740
Calm down.

149
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,217
Laugh all you want!

150
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,709
Hey, no fighting.

151
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:22,999
Sorry, he's drunk.

152
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:26,331
Do you think it's funny?

153
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:30,232
Do you think being embarrassed is funny?

154
00:10:30,232 --> 00:10:31,907
It's funny.

155
00:10:31,907 --> 00:10:34,999
He's already in your car. Just take him home.

156
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:38,272
Hey.

157
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:40,138
Is he safe like this?

158
00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:41,355
Is he not safe?

159
00:10:41,355 --> 00:10:43,000
Do you see the seat belt?

160
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:55,792
We're here.

161
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:09,864
Don't puke.

162
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:11,250
We're almost there.

163
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,954
[I kept this for you in case you're hungry]

164
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:05,964
Okay, it's about time.

165
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:07,999
I should clean up this place, too.

166
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,946
You're awake.

167
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,671
That's not the restroom.

168
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:32,194
I'm not done talking.

169
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:34,492
Let's go inside first.

170
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:36,810
It's cold outside. Let me take you inside.

171
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,060
I'm not done talking.

172
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,917
Okay, what is it?

173
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:47,917
Actually, that day

174
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,667
was my mom's birthday.

175
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,499
There was also an awards ceremony that night.

176
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:57,418
I still foolishly

177
00:12:58,253 --> 00:13:00,500
bought her a cake.

178
00:13:02,277 --> 00:13:04,334
When I arrived,

179
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,159
I found out the house had already changed owners.

180
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,042
It has been a while, but you moved without saying a word.

181
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:14,950
I had no idea you've become so frugal.

182
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,145
You're not living in the mansion I gave you

183
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:18,742
and you live in a place like this instead?

184
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:20,576
Didn't I send you money?

185
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:21,576
Where's the money?

186
00:13:21,576 --> 00:13:26,167
That man lost everything, including the house.

187
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:34,409
My mom is renting a really rundown place now.

188
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:36,000
When she saw me...

189
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:48,292
She told me not to look for her anymore.

190
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,367
I used to think

191
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,699
it didn't matter if my dad was dead because I still had my mom.

192
00:13:57,699 --> 00:13:59,742
However, that day...

193
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:01,699
That day, I realized

194
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:04,792
I lost my mom, too.

195
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:09,084
Bro!

196
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:11,499
Bro!

197
00:14:12,492 --> 00:14:14,499
Bro!

198
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:17,625
It's okay. I'm here.

199
00:14:18,242 --> 00:14:20,583
It's okay, bro. I'm here.

200
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:27,576
Grandma.

201
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,699
No wonder he's like a sea urchin.

202
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:32,667
He's covered in spikes.

203
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,699
He's afraid of getting hurt,

204
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:41,084
so he has to constantly protect and disguise himself.

205
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:44,709
That sounds a bit sad.

206
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:47,792
I feel sorry for him.

207
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:18,499
I've seen lucky cats at the entrances of many stores.

208
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:21,583
The one at your door

209
00:15:23,242 --> 00:15:25,332
used to bring in good fortune.

210
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:29,126
Now, it probably just attracts hate.

211
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,834
I'm working on redeeming his image.

212
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:37,359
You're helping Bai Yin Mo clean up his act?

213
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:39,700
I didn't know you were so funny.

214
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:44,484
Is there a shareholders' meeting coming up?

215
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:46,942
Yes, there is.

216
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:49,950
So, I need to come to an agreement with you first.

217
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,326
You've spoiled Bai Yin Mo too much.

218
00:15:57,618 --> 00:16:02,025
He turned down those earlier films,

219
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:06,609
complaining about the scripts being too shallow.

220
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:10,034
As a result, those films became big hits.

221
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,442
Our company lost a lot

222
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:16,909
and I was heavily criticized by the other shareholders.

223
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:20,109
He has an artist's temperament.

224
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:22,950
If he's resistant inside, he won't do well.

225
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,659
He's almost washed up.

226
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:29,767
The Tang Mi you've been recommending...

227
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:32,275
She has been actively auditioning.

228
00:16:32,275 --> 00:16:34,942
You've talked to her, you know she has what it takes.

229
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:37,492
She just needs a chance.

230
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:40,117
However,

231
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:43,242
you're running out of chances.

232
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,742
Just cut to the chase.

233
00:16:47,752 --> 00:16:53,825
Your company is just a tiny part of our entire group.

234
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,760
The reality show is Mr. Wang's investment.

235
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,442
You were the one who strongly recommended Bai Yin Mo,

236
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:02,699
so I went to beg for it.

237
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:09,699
If this reality show fails, I'll lose face.

238
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,899
I also won't be able to hold my position

239
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,700
as a shareholder in the group.

240
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,992
As for your position...

241
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:25,284
I understand.

242
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,699
You might not understand.

243
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:33,659
This is your last chance.

244
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:36,699
If you mess up again,

245
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:44,692
I might hand over your artists and your company to Ken.

246
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:46,700
He's much better at making money than you are.

247
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:50,618
You know this company means everything to me, right?

248
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:54,159
Don't fail then.

249
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:00,484
I've warned you.

250
00:18:00,484 --> 00:18:02,699
Your fate...

251
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:12,699
Who will decide it?

252
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:32,159
Dad, how did you hurt your wrist?

253
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:34,942
Well, that day...

254
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:36,567
You tell him.

255
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:39,699
If he doesn't come back, then don't ever come back.

256
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:43,859
I accidentally lifted something too heavy.

257
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:45,942
That's how I sprained it.

258
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:48,150
It was pretty bad.

259
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,242
He shouted really loud.

260
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:54,163
All right. Don't lift anything heavy for now.

261
00:18:54,163 --> 00:18:55,818
I'll take some blood tests later

262
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:58,659
to check for any other issues.

263
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:06,163
Mr. and Mrs. Village Chief.

264
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:09,498
I want to set a new rule today.

265
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:12,691
From now on, your son will take care of your health.

266
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:15,409
You don't need to see other doctors anymore.

267
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:18,234
A dream come true.

268
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:19,651
Our son stays in Kinmen

269
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:22,950
and all my aches and pains are gone.

270
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:26,025
Wait, I forgot something.

271
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:27,699
Hold on.

272
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:39,541
Village Chief speaking.

273
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,616
Yesterday, my son, Chen Da Wu,

274
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,526
accidentally fell into the water.

275
00:19:44,526 --> 00:19:49,692
I want to thank our distinguished guest, Mr. Bai Yin Mo,

276
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:53,025
for saving him just in time.

277
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:57,717
I'd like to express my utmost gratitude

278
00:19:57,717 --> 00:20:02,223
to the superstar, Mr. Bai Yin Mo, for his heroic act.

279
00:20:02,223 --> 00:20:05,616
He's now a great benefactor to our family.

280
00:20:05,616 --> 00:20:07,032
It's so noisy.

281
00:20:07,032 --> 00:20:10,908
Additionally, I have another important announcement

282
00:20:10,908 --> 00:20:13,609
to make to all the villagers.

283
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:17,708
And that is, Dr. Chen Da Wu

284
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:23,130
has decided to stay in Kinmen to serve all of you.

285
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,899
If anyone has any health issues,

286
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:29,229
- Grandma, Da Wu made it.
- You may call us.

287
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,998
Yes, I'm so happy for him.

288
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,900
We'll provide home service.

289
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,700
That concludes my announcement.

290
00:20:56,983 --> 00:21:00,305
[She won't even know you're drunk or fighting with others...]

291
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:01,825
What the heck?

292
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:12,031
She won't even know even if you're drunk

293
00:21:12,031 --> 00:21:15,534
or fighting with others.

294
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,291
Instead of this,

295
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:24,692
why don't you do something more meaningful?

296
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:31,117
If you need help, find me at the guesthouse.

297
00:21:34,341 --> 00:21:36,576
That Bai Yin Mo.

298
00:21:43,884 --> 00:21:46,692
Good art is art with substantial value.

299
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:49,484
You're currently the most commercially valuable artist.

300
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:51,776
Just stick to the style of your previous works.

301
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:53,734
Mr. Yang has bought them all at high prices.

302
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:56,700
He has even secured your future series.

303
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:23,517
Cai Jing Liang.

304
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:25,484
Why are you dragging your feet?

305
00:22:26,175 --> 00:22:27,258
Are you still fixing your hair?

306
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:30,016
Hurry up. Your hair looks great.

307
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:40,381
I specifically learned a few dishes from Ms. Shu Man to cook for you.

308
00:22:40,381 --> 00:22:42,241
They're all your favorites.

309
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:46,049
I know you've grown up now

310
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:48,297
and you want to learn to take care of yourself.

311
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:52,489
But just for today.

312
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:54,033
It's your birthday.

313
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:56,150
Let me do something for you.

314
00:22:58,099 --> 00:23:00,840
Here. Today's lunchbox.

315
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,732
It's a bit different from usual.

316
00:23:02,732 --> 00:23:04,330
It's a birthday meal.

317
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,183
Also, I've washed all your clothes.

318
00:23:06,183 --> 00:23:08,241
I've also done all the cleaning

319
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:09,983
and taken out the trash.

320
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:11,651
You don't have to do anything today.

321
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:17,340
Also, I won't force you to study anymore from now on.

322
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,075
I just want you to be happy every day.

323
00:23:20,075 --> 00:23:21,651
That's all that matters.

324
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,899
Dad, are you done?

325
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,014
Yes, I'm done.

326
00:23:30,014 --> 00:23:31,734
Then I'm heading to class.

327
00:23:32,856 --> 00:23:34,392
- Not even a bite?
- I am almost late for class.

328
00:23:34,392 --> 00:23:38,505
No, but you have to blow out a candle and make a wish.

329
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:41,025
Who celebrates a birthday first thing in the morning?

330
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,531
I thought you young people only drink bubble tea.

331
00:23:47,531 --> 00:23:49,165
That's for other young people.

332
00:23:49,165 --> 00:23:50,957
I only drink this.

333
00:23:50,957 --> 00:23:52,965
Right.

334
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:55,498
I remember when we were kids, after playing basketball,

335
00:23:55,498 --> 00:23:57,183
we'd all be drinking soda,

336
00:23:57,183 --> 00:23:59,932
but you'd be the only one sitting there drinking vegetable juice.

337
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,609
I think it's pretty good. It's healthy.

338
00:24:05,864 --> 00:24:07,264
Actually, when I was a kid,

339
00:24:07,264 --> 00:24:09,684
I thought your reason for becoming a doctor was super cool.

340
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:12,513
You're not going to tell me

341
00:24:12,513 --> 00:24:14,983
you become a nurse because of me, are you?

342
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:20,024
I didn't study as well as you and I'm not as brave as you.

343
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:21,698
The responsibility of being a doctor is too great.

344
00:24:21,698 --> 00:24:25,429
I don't think I have the ability to handle life-and-death situations.

345
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:28,983
However, I still want to do my part.

346
00:24:30,689 --> 00:24:33,396
Doctors aren't gods.

347
00:24:33,396 --> 00:24:36,396
Besides doing my best with each treatment,

348
00:24:36,396 --> 00:24:38,484
I also want to help more people.

349
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:41,924
That's why I'm using this mobile medical car

350
00:24:41,924 --> 00:24:44,400
to fulfill my ideals.

351
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,151
We're all ordinary people.

352
00:24:48,151 --> 00:24:50,942
When it comes to life and death, we all feel powerless.

353
00:24:50,942 --> 00:24:54,900
But as long as we give it our all when treating patients,

354
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,617
that's enough.

355
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,826
My little shadow has grown up.

356
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:08,767
- Ms. Shu Man.
- Grandma.

357
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:09,809
- Why so many things?
- That's a lot of things.

358
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:10,892
Da Wu.

359
00:25:10,892 --> 00:25:14,045
I brought some things today to give Mr. Bai.

360
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,170
That's a lot.

361
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,221
Is Mr. Bai here?

362
00:25:17,221 --> 00:25:19,850
- I'll get him.
- All right.

363
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:23,122
Bai Yin Mo, your bro and his dad are here!

364
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,191
Bai Yin Mo, come out!

365
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,619
- Coming!
- Mr. Bai.

366
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:29,401
I brought my son today.

367
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:31,644
We wanted to thank you personally.

368
00:25:31,644 --> 00:25:35,518
Look, I also brought you some specialties from Kinmen.

369
00:25:35,518 --> 00:25:36,869
These are a little token of my gratitude.

370
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,221
Thank you so much for that day.

371
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:40,045
I hope you'll like them and accept them.

372
00:25:40,045 --> 00:25:42,467
Also, this is a special liquor from our Kinmen distillery

373
00:25:42,467 --> 00:25:45,777
that we'll be launching in the Year of the Dragon.

374
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,551
It comes in four colors.

375
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:48,777
Red, white, gold, and blue.

376
00:25:48,777 --> 00:25:51,467
They represent the different aspects of the four seasons.

377
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,399
No need.

378
00:25:54,975 --> 00:25:56,962
I mean, no need to be so polite.

379
00:25:56,962 --> 00:25:58,470
I'm sure you'll like them.

380
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:02,399
Or you could take them home and give them to your parents.

381
00:26:03,652 --> 00:26:05,626
Or you could give them to your friends, right?

382
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:08,109
He's being shy. I'll accept them for him.

383
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,645
- All right.
- I'm off to exercise now.

384
00:26:09,645 --> 00:26:11,437
All right. Exercise.

385
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:14,192
Come on. Let me show you something.

386
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:20,434
Da Wu!

387
00:26:20,434 --> 00:26:21,609
Hurry up.

388
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:23,059
It's stuck.

389
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:24,692
What's wrong?

390
00:26:28,012 --> 00:26:30,977
It's stuck. It can't move.

391
00:26:30,977 --> 00:26:32,859
It's trapped.

392
00:26:38,153 --> 00:26:40,399
Hey, what are you doing? Fishing?

393
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:50,467
It's just a tortoise stuck there.

394
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:52,399
What's so hard about it?

395
00:26:53,617 --> 00:26:55,942
Here, let me do it.

396
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:21,434
Common sense still requires some thinking.

397
00:27:21,434 --> 00:27:24,935
Da Wu. Thank you, you're the best.

398
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,692
You're welcome.

399
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:32,067
It seems like there's nothing you can beat me at.

400
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,427
One-on-one.

401
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:41,725
Okay.

402
00:27:41,725 --> 00:27:44,100
It's time to settle this.

403
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,442
Excuse me. Are you Mr. Bai Yin Mo?

404
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,059
Can we play together?

405
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:50,226
Sorry.

406
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:51,934
I have some personal matters to deal with him.

407
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:53,892
Can you deal with it later?

408
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:55,017
Just one quick game.

409
00:27:55,017 --> 00:27:57,525
It's a rare opportunity. Please.

410
00:27:58,918 --> 00:28:02,153
Let me handle these kids first and then I'll deal with you.

411
00:28:02,153 --> 00:28:03,168
Just one game.

412
00:28:03,168 --> 00:28:05,725
Rock paper scissors.

413
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,184
- Bai Yin Mo always throws paper.
- You're no different with the open palm.

414
00:28:08,184 --> 00:28:09,753
- What do you mean?
- Chen Da Wu.

415
00:28:09,753 --> 00:28:12,109
- How unlucky.
- I'm the unlucky one.

416
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:16,599
- Can you do it?
- Can you handle it?

417
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,850
Guard your man, okay?

418
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,650
Stop talking nonsense.

419
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,866
Can't you guard properly?

420
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:26,400
Listen, I'm a doctor. I don't want to hurt anyone.

421
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,399
Pass the ball.

422
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:38,151
- Pass it.
- You're so noisy.

423
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,683
One more game.

424
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:46,410
What's wrong with your neck? Does it hurt again?

425
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,500
It's an old problem.

426
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,179
- I'll take a look for you.
- It's fine.

427
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:51,210
I'm fine. It's just an old problem.

428
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,326
Let Da Wu check it for you.

429
00:28:53,326 --> 00:28:54,518
No need.

430
00:28:54,518 --> 00:28:56,942
Why does your shirt look so familiar?

431
00:28:58,059 --> 00:28:59,683
You threw it away, right? Does it look good?

432
00:28:59,683 --> 00:29:01,309
It's all pilling.

433
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:02,842
It's so dirty. Let's just toss it.

434
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:06,318
No way. I think it fits well.

435
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,892
Three, two, one.

436
00:29:10,892 --> 00:29:16,599
Yes! Let's welcome the hip-hop artist, Lu Shu Man!

437
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:18,892
Say hi! Hi!

438
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:20,476
- You need to start.
- How do I start?

439
00:29:20,476 --> 00:29:23,184
Put one hand on your ear and raise the other hand.

440
00:29:23,184 --> 00:29:25,599
And say, "Yo, yo, yo."

441
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,100
- Yo, yo, yo.
- Yo, yo, yo.

442
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Put your hands up.

443
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,309
I'm Ms. Shu Man.

444
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:35,599
Ms. Shu Man is here.

445
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,399
My arms are tired.

446
00:29:38,017 --> 00:29:39,100
- Go.
- Go.

447
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,276
Put your hands up.

448
00:29:46,476 --> 00:29:48,599
Chen Da Wu, can you be more serious?

449
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,399
One more game.

450
00:29:52,518 --> 00:29:54,399
Pass.

451
00:29:55,642 --> 00:29:57,399
One more game.

452
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:03,059
One more game.

453
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:05,109
I have to win at least one game today.

454
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,642
Can you guys play seriously?

455
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:09,850
We are serious.

456
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,399
It's still early. One last game.

457
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:15,399
- One more game.
- One more game!

458
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,833
Can't I win just one game?

459
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,567
Hold on.

460
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,683
- One more game.
- One more game.

461
00:30:33,683 --> 00:30:34,798
No more.

462
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:36,575
We've been playing since morning.

463
00:30:36,575 --> 00:30:38,149
We're going home for dinner.

464
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:40,956
- Let's go.
- No, just one more game.

465
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:42,399
Didn't you say it's a rare opportunity?

466
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,067
Didn't you want to play?

467
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:55,050
If I weren't wearing sandals today,

468
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,417
there's no way I would've lost.

469
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:58,441
Let me tell you.

470
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:02,399
The floor and hoop aren't even standard.

471
00:31:07,989 --> 00:31:11,775
Today was really a unique life experience.

472
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,896
Yes.

473
00:31:13,896 --> 00:31:16,239
We played from morning until night and didn't win a single game.

474
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:18,764
All because of a teammate like you.

475
00:31:18,764 --> 00:31:21,123
It's because of a teammate like me

476
00:31:21,123 --> 00:31:23,399
that we could save the tortoise together.

477
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:27,331
Technically, you were the one who saved it.

478
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:30,942
Technically, you saved me before.

479
00:31:35,015 --> 00:31:36,830
Let's not talk about it.

480
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,567
Don't mention it.

481
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:42,198
Put on your jacket.

482
00:31:42,198 --> 00:31:45,151
You've been sweating so much. You'll catch a cold.

483
00:31:46,147 --> 00:31:48,442
So, what were you saying about your mom last time?

484
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:51,624
I blacked out and forgot everything.

485
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:54,283
You black out from drinking,

486
00:31:54,283 --> 00:31:57,022
but your past life doesn't just disappear like that.

487
00:31:57,022 --> 00:31:58,549
Don't you think you're annoying?

488
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,040
You always get to the bottom of things.

489
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,764
You know that. I'm a doctor.

490
00:32:01,764 --> 00:32:04,650
Do you have to uncover people's scars?

491
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,316
Uncovering scars is how I find out what's wrong.

492
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:09,432
Am I your patient now?

493
00:32:15,457 --> 00:32:17,399
You're someone I can talk to

494
00:32:19,224 --> 00:32:21,192
about anything when I'm drunk.

495
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,734
Don't you think that sounds gross?

496
00:32:26,797 --> 00:32:28,724
I must be crazy

497
00:32:28,724 --> 00:32:31,265
to spend the whole day hanging out with a guy.

498
00:32:31,265 --> 00:32:32,830
I think I'm the one going crazy.

499
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,281
I've saved so many people,

500
00:32:35,281 --> 00:32:38,873
but this is the first time I've had to endure mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

501
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:42,399
and was forced to give away my first kiss with a guy.

502
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,232
I got drunk outside for the first time

503
00:32:44,232 --> 00:32:46,015
and rambled nonsense.

504
00:32:46,015 --> 00:32:47,764
I'm the one who's losing it.

505
00:32:47,764 --> 00:32:50,156
First time being drunk and losing it?

506
00:32:50,156 --> 00:32:51,650
No way.

507
00:32:53,165 --> 00:32:56,231
When I talk to strangers, it usually doesn't last more than five minutes.

508
00:32:56,231 --> 00:32:58,650
And I don't get involved in other's family matters.

509
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:03,382
So, you're actually quite suited to be an unconventional life coach.

510
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:06,406
- It's not bad.
- No, thank you.

511
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:09,432
I have no interest in guiding other people's lives.

512
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:13,399
It sounds like your life here is pretty exciting.

513
00:33:14,394 --> 00:33:16,069
Exciting?

514
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,518
Ever since I came here, I haven't had a packed schedule.

515
00:33:19,518 --> 00:33:22,691
I never know what's going to happen each day.

516
00:33:22,691 --> 00:33:25,465
My life feels like it's on pause.

517
00:33:25,465 --> 00:33:27,757
Does that count as exciting?

518
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:29,590
Isn't that a good thing?

519
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,947
You can rest properly.

520
00:33:31,947 --> 00:33:33,665
It's true.

521
00:33:33,665 --> 00:33:36,399
Resting is to prepare for a longer journey.

522
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,899
Not really.

523
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:41,983
Resting is just for the sake of resting.

524
00:33:41,983 --> 00:33:44,651
Take those fighters for an example.

525
00:33:44,651 --> 00:33:47,899
If they force themselves to rest, they just get more anxious.

526
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:50,825
Sometimes, you should relax without any purpose

527
00:33:51,818 --> 00:33:53,742
and enjoy doing nothing.

528
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:56,534
Like what we're doing now.

529
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:18,025
Xu Man, I'm here.

530
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:20,181
What are we painting today?

531
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:21,620
Take off your shoes.

532
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,109
Take off my shoes?

533
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:25,899
Then should I take off my socks too?

534
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:27,699
Yes.

535
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:30,034
Here you go.

536
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:34,699
Come on.

537
00:34:35,692 --> 00:34:37,699
Are you ready?

538
00:34:39,818 --> 00:34:41,576
That fast?

539
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:52,109
The texture feels amazing.

540
00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:54,818
Are we painting with our feet today?

541
00:34:54,818 --> 00:34:56,699
Yes.

542
00:34:58,032 --> 00:35:00,983
Usually, we paint with our hands.

543
00:35:00,983 --> 00:35:04,742
However, art can be done with different mediums.

544
00:35:05,484 --> 00:35:08,367
Feel every step as you go.

545
00:35:19,899 --> 00:35:23,692
Aren't you finding yourself again now?

546
00:35:23,692 --> 00:35:26,983
So, would you want to have a boyfriend?

547
00:35:26,983 --> 00:35:31,150
I'd rather enjoy my time alone.

548
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:35,200
But what if you meet someone you like?

549
00:35:36,275 --> 00:35:38,825
If I meet someone I like?

550
00:35:41,899 --> 00:35:47,067
When I interact with people, I open all my senses.

551
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:49,107
Here.

552
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:51,592
Just like when I paint.

553
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:53,517
I clear my mind.

554
00:35:53,517 --> 00:35:57,899
So, if the time comes and that person appears,

555
00:35:57,899 --> 00:36:00,067
I'll know.

556
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:02,067
What if you don't know?

557
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:05,109
You've also painted things you didn't like

558
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:07,067
and felt lost before, right?

559
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:08,899
You're right.

560
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:13,032
Getting lost is also a way of exploring love.

561
00:36:13,032 --> 00:36:14,783
Do you have someone you like?

562
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,416
I don't know.

563
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:21,242
I'm also in the process of getting lost and exploring.

564
00:36:23,442 --> 00:36:26,249
How many boyfriends have you had?

565
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:27,783
You first.

566
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,583
Come on.

567
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:38,289
Even if you add my fingers to yours, it's still not enough.

568
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:39,932
Seriously?

569
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:41,291
What about you?

570
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:46,899
For me, technically, only one.

571
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:49,282
Was it unforgettable?

572
00:36:49,282 --> 00:36:51,064
It was confusing.

573
00:36:51,064 --> 00:36:53,130
Who is he?

574
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,300
Do I know him?

575
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,534
It's hard to say.

576
00:36:59,097 --> 00:37:02,130
This is really slippery.

577
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,699
Just pretend you're skating.

578
00:37:10,899 --> 00:37:12,950
This is really fun.

579
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,565
In any case, this reality show will have three cameras

580
00:37:17,565 --> 00:37:19,798
and you'll have your own private space.

581
00:37:19,798 --> 00:37:23,909
I've already informed the crew about your dietary restrictions and preferences.

582
00:37:24,899 --> 00:37:28,200
So, you were in such a hurry to video call me was just to tell me this?

583
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:33,064
Well, have you read the proposal I sent you?

584
00:37:33,064 --> 00:37:34,163
Are there any issues?

585
00:37:34,163 --> 00:37:38,699
I'll also get the topics from the crew so that you can practice in advance.

586
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:41,406
The proposal is generally fine.

587
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:45,272
But isn't the point for the audience to see our genuine reactions to situations?

588
00:37:45,272 --> 00:37:48,032
If we practice everything first, wouldn't that be deceiving the audience?

589
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,783
I don't want to fake it.

590
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:52,706
Boss...

591
00:37:56,097 --> 00:37:58,031
Who would've thought a superstar

592
00:37:58,031 --> 00:37:59,983
doesn't even have a laptop

593
00:37:59,983 --> 00:38:02,699
and doesn't know how to use one for video calls?

594
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:07,432
If I knew how to do everything, my assistant would be out of a job.

595
00:38:07,432 --> 00:38:09,326
I see.

596
00:38:12,426 --> 00:38:15,017
What about you? What are you painting?

597
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:18,198
I'm painting you.

598
00:38:18,198 --> 00:38:19,875
Sea urchin.

599
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,849
Why am I a sea urchin?

600
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:23,899
Do I have that many spikes?

601
00:38:23,899 --> 00:38:25,576
It's hard to say.

602
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:30,031
And you? What are you?

603
00:38:30,031 --> 00:38:31,576
Me?

604
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:36,442
Why are you a starfish?

605
00:38:36,442 --> 00:38:40,498
Because starfish have amazing regenerative abilities.

606
00:38:40,498 --> 00:38:42,640
I thought it was because starfish don't have brains.

607
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,998
You're the one without a brain.

608
00:38:43,998 --> 00:38:45,239
You really don't have a brain.

609
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,539
The guesthouse owner is sleeping soon.

610
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:47,840
Please return to your room.

611
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,409
Thank you for your cooperation.

612
00:38:56,262 --> 00:38:57,576
Hey.

613
00:39:00,724 --> 00:39:03,882
I said you're like a sea urchin because

614
00:39:03,882 --> 00:39:05,423
even though you've grown all these spikes

615
00:39:05,423 --> 00:39:07,196
to protect yourself,

616
00:39:07,196 --> 00:39:09,742
you're actually very soft deep down inside.

617
00:39:12,139 --> 00:39:14,531
Thank you for saving Da Wu.

618
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:16,950
I know you're a good person.

619
00:39:24,298 --> 00:39:25,699
Goodnight, Starfish.

620
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,499
Goodnight, Sea Urchin.

621
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:13,495
My room has some dirty stuff.

622
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,117
Aren't you the only one staying there?

623
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:25,796
Come here.

624
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,270
Gecko eggs.

625
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,987
Gecko eggs?

626
00:40:38,817 --> 00:40:41,109
Do you know what geckos mean?

627
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:43,067
That the room wasn't cleaned properly?

628
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:44,276
No.

629
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:48,442
My grandma says geckos represent protection and wealth.

630
00:40:48,442 --> 00:40:49,824
It's a good thing.

631
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:51,366
Isn't it just about catching mosquitoes?

632
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,859
How could it have so much meaning?

633
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:55,318
Catching mosquitoes is good, too.

634
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:57,409
That way, you won't need mosquito coils.

635
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:02,609
I think Grandma has a point.

636
00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:05,609
It's here, so you came.

637
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:07,960
You're my lucky charm for wealth.

638
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,151
All right.

639
00:41:09,151 --> 00:41:11,252
Your lucky charm or the gecko.

640
00:41:11,252 --> 00:41:13,399
Pick one yourself.

641
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:14,525
Pick one?

642
00:41:14,525 --> 00:41:16,151
Why should I pick one?

643
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:18,400
Why not? I'm not sleeping with geckos.

644
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,201
Get rid of them.

645
00:41:20,201 --> 00:41:21,524
If I get rid of them,

646
00:41:21,524 --> 00:41:23,650
what if their parents can't find them when they come back?

647
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,609
Don't worry. Animals always find their way home.

648
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:27,399
They haven't even hatched yet.

649
00:41:27,399 --> 00:41:29,109
How are they supposed to find their way home?

650
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:31,400
What you're doing is basically breaking up a family.

651
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,118
Those poor babies would be all alone without their parents.

652
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,199
That's not what I meant.

653
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:51,492
I know you didn't mean it that way.

654
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:55,400
Anyway, I'll be gone before they hatch.

655
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,992
I'll just pretend I didn't see them for now.

656
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:04,076
Right. You're leaving soon.

657
00:42:10,442 --> 00:42:13,151
Nuo Nuo, are you done?

658
00:42:13,151 --> 00:42:14,192
We're running late.

659
00:42:14,192 --> 00:42:16,192
Okay, I'm coming.

660
00:42:16,192 --> 00:42:17,300
Where are you going?

661
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,442
Let's go.

662
00:42:19,442 --> 00:42:21,432
You don't know? I'll tell you on the way.

663
00:42:21,432 --> 00:42:22,624
Come on.

664
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:24,199
Let's go.

665
00:42:25,775 --> 00:42:28,200
Slow down.

666
00:42:31,026 --> 00:42:32,151
Dad, it's not even your speech.

667
00:42:32,151 --> 00:42:34,109
Why are you so nervous?

668
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:35,650
Isn't it good to be prepared?

669
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:38,192
That's just how your dad is. Don't mind him.

670
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:40,234
Well, are you really sure?

671
00:42:40,234 --> 00:42:41,525
Should I announce it again?

672
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:44,492
No need. We've already made the announcement.

673
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:50,817
Look at Dr. Chen.

674
00:42:50,817 --> 00:42:53,609
He's handsome and accomplished.

675
00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:54,984
He has been a top student since he was a kid.

676
00:42:54,984 --> 00:42:57,151
He's also the best fighter among us.

677
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,958
That's why Xiao Guang and I always followed him around.

678
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:01,399
The other seniors didn't dare bully us at all.

679
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:02,775
Yan Ting, let me ask you.

680
00:43:02,775 --> 00:43:08,567
Were Dr. Chen and Hai Nuo ever a thing?

681
00:43:08,567 --> 00:43:10,276
Don't ask me that.

682
00:43:10,276 --> 00:43:12,118
Talking about it could be dangerous.

683
00:43:12,118 --> 00:43:13,399
Come on. It won't.

684
00:43:13,399 --> 00:43:15,984
I promise I won't tell anyone.

685
00:43:15,984 --> 00:43:17,900
They're both my seniors.

686
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,742
That's all I can say.

687
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,714
I'm not going.

688
00:43:22,714 --> 00:43:25,067
Why not?

689
00:43:25,067 --> 00:43:26,692
I'm afraid I'll outshine him if I go.

690
00:43:26,692 --> 00:43:27,833
You're overthinking it.

691
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:29,984
Da Wu is a superstar in Kinmen.

692
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:31,775
He didn't invite me.

693
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:35,399
He didn't say it, but I know he wants you there.

694
00:43:35,399 --> 00:43:36,483
Just go.

695
00:43:36,483 --> 00:43:38,817
If you're bored, you can leave.

696
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:40,318
However, Da Wu's speech won't be boring.

697
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:41,442
You know that.

698
00:43:41,442 --> 00:43:43,692
No, I'm not going.

699
00:43:43,692 --> 00:43:45,534
A gecko.

700
00:43:46,234 --> 00:43:48,318
Could it be the baby gecko's parents?

701
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:50,700
I think you should focus on driving.

702
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,350
It got squished?

703
00:44:15,399 --> 00:44:17,034
Well...

704
00:44:18,285 --> 00:44:20,199
I didn't mean to.
