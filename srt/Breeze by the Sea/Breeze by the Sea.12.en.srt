but she still arranged for my mom to join the filming.

145

I don't know who I can trust anymore.

146

that I would never become someone's tool for making money again.

148
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:11,799
But I keep getting betrayed by those closest to me.

149
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:13,834
First, it was my mom.

150
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:15,800
Now, it's my manager.

151
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:22,799
When my mom showed up on the reality show pretending nothing had happened,

152
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,259
how should I respond?

153
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:36,799
I really can't handle it.

154
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:42,417
Could it be that...

155
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:45,009
Maybe they just...

156
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:48,459
Never mind.

00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:58,568
I'm sorry.

160
00:15:58,568 --> 00:16:00,718
I don't know how to comfort you.

161
00:16:11,918 --> 00:16:13,999
It's okay.

162
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:15,918
You've already comforted me.

163
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:17,592
Really?

164
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:22,050

and a new one has appeared.

167
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:29,167
I'm worried...

168
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:30,450
Worried about what?

169
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,509
Are you worried I'll turn into a durian?

170
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:44,799
Whether you're a sea urchin or a durian,

171
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:52,800
I know you're a kind and warm-hearted person.

172
00:16:53,794 --> 00:16:59,042
So, no matter what they say or do, you are still you.

173
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:01,584
Don't let them affect you

174
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:04,676
and don't stop trusting people because of them.

175
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:07,469
Most importantly,

176
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:10,050
don't let those bad memories affect you.

177
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,676
That's impossible.

178

Sea Breeze Village, the people here,

179
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,799
and you...

180
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,009
I'll only hold on to the best memories.

181
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,718
Yes!

182
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,718
This is really good.

183

Is she asleep?

184
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:49,467
I'll take a nap, too.

185
00:18:53,918 --> 00:18:59,626
Sorry, I went ahead and turned this place into a wardrobe.

186

You don't mind, right?

187
00:19:02,943 --> 00:19:04,098
Okay, no problem.

188
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:05,500
I'll sleep on the couch.

189
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,759
No, wait.

190
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:11,676
Come here and see if this is okay.

191
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:14,925
Take a look.

192
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:19,667
You sleep near the door,

193
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:23,976
so it's more convenient for you to go to the bathroom at night.

194
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:26,561
I even brought your dumbbells over

195
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:31,292
so you can work out while I binge-watch shows before bed.

196
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:34,601
It won't be as boring for you.

197
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:36,342
Is that okay?

198
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:40,052
Okay.

199
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:43,136
I made fried instant noodles with two eggs.

200
00:19:43,136 --> 00:19:44,852
You can eat first.

201
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:47,017
Then we can take a nap together

202
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:49,302
and get up to open the shop.

203
00:19:49,302 --> 00:19:51,799
Is that okay with you?

204
00:19:56,761 --> 00:20:02,195
Or we could take a nap together first

205
00:20:02,195 --> 00:20:06,799
and then eat the fried noodles afterward.

206
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:26,535
Grandma.

207
00:20:26,535 --> 00:20:28,799
Drink some water first.

208
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:32,092
Be careful. It's hot.

209
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:36,175
How are you feeling now?

210
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:41,050
Be careful.

211
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:48,268
Did Yue Shan mention anything about her grandma?

212
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:49,693
She didn't explain clearly.

213
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:52,370
She just said the situation isn't good and...

214
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,085
Either way, let's take a look.

215
00:20:55,085 --> 00:20:57,720
If it's too serious, we'll send her to the hospital.

216
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,509
Okay.

217
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,436
Da Wu.

218
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:08,799
- Yue Shan.
- Yan Ting.

219
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:10,900
After my grandma came back from collecting oysters today,

220
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,226
she looked unwell.

221
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:14,125
Grandma.

222
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,735
It's not that serious.

223
00:21:15,735 --> 00:21:18,118
Why are you up?

224
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:20,461
Yue Shan made a fuss and brought you here.

225
00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:22,386
I'm really sorry.

226
00:21:22,386 --> 00:21:23,535
It's fine.

227
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:25,134
How can you say it's not serious?

228
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:26,276
You couldn't even stand up just now.

229
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:28,118
Your face was pale.

230
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:29,834
I told you to see a doctor, but you wouldn't.

231
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:31,966
That's why I called Da Wu.

232
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:35,759
Don't worry, Ms. Xiu E. Let me check on you first.

233
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,801
Did you forget to drink water today?

234
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:47,494
You seem a bit dehydrated.

235
00:21:47,494 --> 00:21:48,502
Yue Shan is right.

236
00:21:48,502 --> 00:21:49,834
She's just worried about you.

237
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:51,579
If dehydration gets serious,

238
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,999
it can be life-threatening.

239
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:55,101
Sit down for a bit.

240
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:57,502
Yan Ting and I will get an IV ready to rehydrate you.

241
00:21:57,502 --> 00:21:59,044
Let's go, Yan Ting.

242
00:21:59,044 --> 00:22:00,052
See?

243
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,999
It can be life-threatening.

244
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:04,518
You never listen to me.

245
00:22:04,518 --> 00:22:06,518
If I don't take care of you, who will?

246
00:22:06,518 --> 00:22:07,834
Take care of me?

247
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:10,235
You can't even take care of yourself.

248
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:11,579
With the exams coming up,

249
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:15,243
you still went behind my back to join that reality show.

250
00:22:15,243 --> 00:22:18,900
If no one had told me, I wouldn't have known.

251
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,445
You never study,

252
00:22:20,445 --> 00:22:22,867
always walking around with your phone taking photos.

253
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:24,268
You ignore me when I call

254
00:22:24,268 --> 00:22:26,544
and even take your phone into the bathroom.

255
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:28,867
I really don't get it.

256
00:22:28,867 --> 00:22:30,910
What's the point of studying?

257
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,951
Look at them. They studied so hard.

258
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,799
Now, they're stuck here looking after the elderly.

259
00:22:36,627 --> 00:22:37,629
Yue Shan.

260
00:22:37,629 --> 00:22:39,834
Studying isn't just about passing exams.

261
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:42,735
There's a lot of useful knowledge that you'll need in life, right?

262
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:44,461
Besides, we aren't forced to stay here.

263
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:45,711
We chose to stay.

264
00:22:45,711 --> 00:22:47,819
It's not just elderly patients we care for.

265
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:50,042
Don't tell me to study.

266
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:52,810
My dad also says it's okay if I'm not good at studying.

267
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,335
Your dad?

268
00:22:54,335 --> 00:22:55,900
Your dad didn't like studying either.

269
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,092
He kept changing jobs and couldn't earn any money.

270
00:22:58,092 --> 00:23:00,092
That's why he left you for me to take care of.

271
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:02,801
He has a tea business in Taipei.

272
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:05,568
He said once it's stable, he'll bring us over to live with him.

273
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:07,269
Do you still believe anything he says?

274
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:09,720
He has been saying that for years.

275
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,819
If he's busy, we can go visit him.

276
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:13,301
I've told you many times.

277
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:15,500
I'm too old and weak to take you there.

278
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,626
Then I'll go by myself.

279
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:17,709
You're too young for that.

280
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:20,134
If you want to go to Taipei, ask him to come get you.

281
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:23,509
I don't want to talk to you.

282
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:42,999
Hello.

283
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:45,867
Don't I look a little like him?

284
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:49,268
A little. You two have similar eyes.

285
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:52,842
- Are you being playful?
- Yue Shan, how does this work?

286
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:56,125
- Like this?
- You're bad at this.

287
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,999
No?

288
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:00,167
Is it boring going out with me?

289
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:01,626
Not at all.

290
00:24:01,626 --> 00:24:03,667
You rarely come home.

291
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:06,083
All right. I'll come back whenever I have time.

292
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,999
Really?

293
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:09,799
I promise.

294
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:16,860
When you don't know what to say, just give a thumbs up.

295
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,551
Thumbs up.

296
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,500
Is it boring going out with me?

297
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,999
Not at all.

298
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:27,999
You rarely come home.

299
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,459
All right. I'll come back whenever I have time.

300
00:24:30,459 --> 00:24:32,167
Really?

301
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:33,842
I promise.

302
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:35,999
I'll come back whenever I have time.

303
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:37,999
Really?

304
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:39,799
I promise.

305
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:56,999
Is it boring going out with me?

306
00:24:56,999 --> 00:24:58,367
Not at all.

307
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:00,417
You rarely come home.

308
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,999
All right. I'll come home whenever I have time.

309
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:04,999
Really?

310
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:06,799
I promise.

311
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:45,134
Be careful.

312
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,544
How did you know I'm here?

313
00:25:55,544 --> 00:25:58,560
Your bro told me.

314
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,011
So...

315
00:26:00,011 --> 00:26:02,351
what is your relationship with Da Wu?

316
00:26:02,351 --> 00:26:04,834
He's my bro, too.

317
00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:07,627
What about you and Tang Mi?

318
00:26:07,627 --> 00:26:09,426
What do you think?

319
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:12,759
It's probably just like that.

320
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:25,134
Tang Mi sent me a message.

321
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,966
She said my mom felt really guilty.

322
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:31,799
She thinks I should go see her.

323
00:26:38,393 --> 00:26:40,342
Do you want to go?

324
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:46,883
Do you want to go and talk to her face-to-face?

325
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:50,292
I don't know.

326
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:51,933
What would you do if it were you?

327
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:53,799
Me?

328
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:58,393
If it were me, of course I'd go.

329
00:26:58,393 --> 00:27:02,627
I'd talk things through with her.

330
00:27:02,627 --> 00:27:05,718
At least I won't have any regrets.

331
00:27:06,867 --> 00:27:09,268
Plus, I'm like a starfish.

332
00:27:09,268 --> 00:27:11,867
I have invincible regenerative abilities.

333
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:13,334
What about you?

334
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:15,259
A sea urchin.

335
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,933
If a starfish is with you,

336
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:19,759
what's there to be afraid of?

337
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,967
Let's go.

338
00:27:25,702 --> 00:27:27,509
Let's go.

339
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:35,551
Do you want to come back to Taipei with me?

340
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,710
[Kinmen Airport]

341
00:27:59,434 --> 00:28:03,800
They told me you were in trouble.

342
00:28:04,568 --> 00:28:07,676
I thought being on the show could help you.

343
00:28:09,351 --> 00:28:11,759
Why are you still so easily fooled?

344
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,925
I saw on TV that everyone is criticizing you.

345
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,342
I really don't understand why this is happening.

346
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:41,042
It was Lily who brought me here.

347
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:42,883
Did you know that?

348
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,799
She came to the restaurant to find me.

349
00:28:49,459 --> 00:28:52,175
She gives me an extra TWD10,000 every month.

350
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:55,384
I trust her a lot.

351
00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:57,799
After all,

352
00:28:58,417 --> 00:29:00,799
she has taken care of you for so many years.

353
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:04,509
She has spent more time with you,

354
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:09,092
More than I have.

355
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,799
I don't want to talk about her right now.

356
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,217
Right.

357
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:19,141
Right.

358
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:21,799
This has nothing to do with anyone else.

359
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:27,634
If we hadn't gone through so much in the past,

360
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:30,799
you wouldn't feel so sad

361
00:29:31,584 --> 00:29:33,799
seeing me now, right?

362
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,967
Where do you work now?

363
00:29:47,761 --> 00:29:49,967
I wash dishes at a restaurant.

364
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:53,384
I also do some house cleaning.

365
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:57,268
You don't need to give me money anymore.

366
00:29:57,268 --> 00:29:59,250
I can support myself now.

367
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,092
I really can.

368
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:06,125
Right.

00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:03,999
That was awkward.

549
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:05,799
Sorry.

550
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:12,626
By the way, Grandma, once I go back to Taipei,

551
00:40:12,626 --> 00:40:14,417
please stop sending me those stickers.

552
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:16,634
I won't reply.

553
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:19,610
Why?

554
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,810
Also, your cooking

555
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,842
is the worst food in the entire world.

556
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:29,441
I understand now.

557
00:40:29,441 --> 00:40:30,608
Is it bad?

558
00:40:30,608 --> 00:40:31,867
Even if it's bad, you still have to eat it.

559
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:33,759
Here.

560
00:40:39,149 --> 00:40:41,834
After you've settled everything back home,

561
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:44,083
make sure to come visit us again.

562
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:48,494
I'll cook something even worse for you next time.

563
00:40:48,494 --> 00:40:50,384
Okay.

564
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,275
Where is Hai Nuo?

565
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:53,351
I can't seem to contact her.

566
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,693
Do you know where she went?

567
00:40:55,693 --> 00:40:57,584
I have no idea.

568
00:40:57,584 --> 00:41:01,009
That brat is out and about again.

569
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:03,626
Grandma, are you hiding something?

570
00:41:03,626 --> 00:41:05,426
No, not at all.

571
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,459
- Your expression is the same as when you tricked me to find Hai Nuo...
- Here's the thing.

572
00:41:09,459 --> 00:41:11,551
I forgot...

573
00:41:15,568 --> 00:41:17,999
I don't even remember tricking you.

574
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:20,009
I guess I'm really getting old.

575
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,092
Right.

576
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,209
I made an eye mask for you.

577
00:41:26,209 --> 00:41:27,867
It's filled with lavender.

578
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:30,967
It'll help you relax and sleep better.

579
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,867
Thank you, Grandma.

580
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:39,476
I'll definitely sleep well with this.

581
00:41:39,476 --> 00:41:41,134
That's good then.

582
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,250
Is this for me?

583
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,083
You drew this?

584
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:59,092
What do these English words mean?

585
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:02,509
It means

586
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,509
I'll be back.

587
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:09,083
Okay.

588
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:11,134
I'll be waiting for your return.

589
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,800
It's such a cute drawing.

590
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:25,158
Gosh, it's terrible.

591
00:42:25,158 --> 00:42:26,358
Say that again.

592
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:28,518
Here. Eat more.

593
00:42:28,518 --> 00:42:30,709
I've got work in Taipei. I can't get fat.

594
00:42:30,709 --> 00:42:33,592
You can lose weight when you get back.

595
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:42,876
Hello.

596
00:42:42,876 --> 00:42:43,885
Where to?

597
00:42:43,885 --> 00:42:45,509
Taipei.

598
00:42:55,266 --> 00:42:58,092
- Thank you.
- All the best, Mr. Bai.

599
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,592
There are two guys taking photos behind you.

600
00:43:27,933 --> 00:43:30,092
I know. They're paparazzi.

601
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,592
What are you doing here?

602
00:43:33,999 --> 00:43:35,799
Just passing by.

603
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:41,601
Hai Nuo told me.

604
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:43,883
You told her to come find me at the beach.

605
00:43:46,867 --> 00:43:48,586
That's just my doctor instinct.

606
00:43:48,586 --> 00:43:51,050
I treat every case like an emergency.

607
00:43:53,768 --> 00:43:55,610
Thank you, Dr. Chen.

608
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:58,634
But seriously, why are you here?

609
00:43:58,634 --> 00:44:00,768
Are you here because you can't bear to see me leave?

610
00:44:00,768 --> 00:44:02,799
Are you crazy?

611
00:44:03,999 --> 00:44:06,217
I'm here to send off someone else.
