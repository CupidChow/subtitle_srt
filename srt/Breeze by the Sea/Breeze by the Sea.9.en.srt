♫ Through the crowded, bustling streets ♫

2
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:17,500
♫ Who will I say goodnight to? ♫

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,999
♫ The vulnerability I long to embrace ♫

4
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:22,918
♫ Is buried deep inside ♫

5
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:26,709
♫ Under the moon's radiant glow, dreams surge and swell ♫

6
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:28,999
♫ Waiting for a reason to run wild ♫

7
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:36,209
♫ Can you walk with me for a while without saying a word? ♫

8
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:39,250
♫ Follow the neon lights into the night ♫

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,209
♫ I try to find you every night ♫

10
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:47,125
♫ What must I do to see through that distant line? ♫

11
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:52,417
♫ I want to feel the wind full force ♫

12
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,500
♫ My lonely soul begins to shake ♫

00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,999
♫ I want to bring my freedom forth, and take your hand ♫

[Breeze by the Sea]

18
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:33,459
- Hey, Bai Yin Mo...
- Hey.

19
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:36,167
Did you steal rosemary from Maya's place?

20
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:37,250
I didn't steal anything.

21
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,999
No way. You know, in Taipei,

22
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,626
we always use rosemary when we cook.

23
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:44,417
- Seriously, he took a whole bunch of it.
- Yin Mo.

24
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:45,667
What if they catch him?

25
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:47,799
Yin Mo!

26
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,459
I heard you, but I was chatting with her.

27
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:55,999
- I'm sorry.
- Xiao Guang, you're back.

28
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:58,751
I was wondering why you're driving.

29
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,459
Being a driver for two days was fun.

30
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,799
Good to know that.

31
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,167
Thank you.

32
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:10,500
Xiao Guang.

33
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,999
Ms. Shu Man.

34
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,032
Come in and have a seat.

35
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:17,250
Everything for the meeting is ready, right?

36
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,999
Yes, I put it in the drawer.

37
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:20,676
Okay.

38
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,709
I guess I won't go.

39
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:45,459
It'll be weird if I join your meeting.

40
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:47,134
Weird?

41
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,999
It isn't weird, right?

42
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:51,667
No, it's not.

43
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,500
Why would it be weird? Let's discuss it together.

44
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,334
Let's go. More people, better results.

45
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:58,999
We're going to go live, Miss.

46
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:00,834
And you're doing this now?

47
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:02,209
What am I supposed to do?

48
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,467
Hey.

49
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:07,175
What's wrong?

50
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:10,009
We're screwed.

51
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:12,360
The celebrities that were supposed to come

52
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,500
canceled at the last minute.

53
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,217
What now?

54
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,445
That's why I said to get the contract signed first.

55
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:21,751
- Don't just negotiate with the agent.
- It's too late now.

56
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:22,999
We don't have time.

57
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:24,999
Bai Yin Mo will be here soon.

58
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:28,417
We'll just use the revised proposal for the meeting.

59
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,794
I'll discuss the rest with Mr. Yang and the others.

60
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,876
Listen.

61
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:35,834
Pick a few local folks from the first day of auditions

62
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:37,375
and make them the cast.

63
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,050
Hurry and get in touch with them now.

64
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:45,801
- Yin Mo.
- Yin Mo.

65
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:46,999
Welcome.

66
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:48,834
This is the room where you'll be staying

67
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:49,860
during the filming.

68
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,610
You can take a look around first.

69
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,999
No need. We can start the meeting right away.

70
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,292
All right.

71
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:56,134
After you.

72
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:00,999
This is the newly revised proposal.

73
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:03,799
Please take a look, Yin Mo.

74
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:20,966
What does this mean?

75
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:22,000
One finger means water.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,999
Two means coffee.

77
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:24,000
Three means tea.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,417
Four means hot tea.

79
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:28,799
Boss likes efficiency, but sometimes, we forget.

80
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,417
- Are you usually this quiet during meetings?
- Yes.

81
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:38,092
Boss doesn't like noise, so we rarely talk.

82
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:40,834
He seems pretty serious.

83
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:42,744
Serious is good.

84
00:04:42,744 --> 00:04:43,801
Let me tell you.

85
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:46,842
Boss is at his best when he's serious.

86
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:16,485
- Da Wu.
- Hey.

87
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:17,542
Sorry.

88
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:21,309
I missed your first seminar, Dr. Chen.

89
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:24,592
So, today, dinner is on me.

90
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,184
I knew you would say that,

91
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:31,334
so I ordered the most expensive dishes in this restaurant.

92
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:33,125
Okay.

93
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,900
Hand me the keys to your medical car after this.

94
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,718
I'll take you to the ER after eating.

95
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:43,009
Does the dinner include service?

96
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:46,726
Of course.

97
00:05:46,726 --> 00:05:48,584
Is there anything else you need?

98
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:50,626
I can take care of it.

99
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:52,300
Sure.

100
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:03,966
Da Wu, do you want some?

101
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:04,959
No.

102
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,800
I'm full. You go ahead.

103
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:10,553
Still the same two flavors?

104
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:13,834
This looks better than the ice cream we had as kids.

105
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:16,300
Are you sure you don't want some?

106
00:06:17,852 --> 00:06:20,175
If you want some, get it yourself.

107
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:27,676
What are you doing?

108
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:34,999
What is this?

109
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:38,334
Isn't this the wish box we exchanged back in high school?

110
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:39,885
Yes.

111
00:06:39,885 --> 00:06:42,626
You didn't peek, did you?

112
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:44,959
No way.

113
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,000
Come on.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,999
If you had told me earlier, I'd have brought yours, too.

115
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:50,083
It's fine.

116
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,999
I remember what I wrote.

117
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:54,667
I forgot everything I wrote.

118
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:58,792
I still remember us saying that we'd open it

119
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:02,209
when we turned 30 to see if our wishes had come true.

120
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:05,250
I remember, but you were abroad when we turned 30,

121
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,125
so we missed it.

122
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,827
It doesn't matter. We can do it now.

123
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:13,799
I'm a little nervous about what I wrote back then.

124
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:26,999
Xu Man.

125
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:28,883
Where's your true love?

126
00:07:29,634 --> 00:07:31,009
It's coming soon.

127
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:36,887
Xu Man.

128
00:07:36,887 --> 00:07:39,268
Sorry. I missed your seminar yesterday.

129
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:40,584
No worries.

130
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:42,083
It's a shame you missed it.

131
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,584
It was great.

132
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:45,667
Xu Man, stop it.

133
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:47,426
I know.

134
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:54,542
Did you go out with Hai Nuo and her grandma yesterday?

135
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,667
Yes, I took your advice.

136
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:59,167
I accepted my half-time break

137
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:02,250
and spent the day relaxing in Kinmen.

138
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,900
So, did you unlock any achievements?

139
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,287
No achievements unlocked.

140
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:13,092
I wasted a whole day doing nothing.

141
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:21,384
Did you feel anything special?

142
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:28,842
When I'm with Li Hai Nuo and her grandma,

143
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:32,509
- Red light, green light.
- There was a moment...

144
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:37,500
I felt like I was back in my childhood on a family trip.

145
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,360
Family?

146
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,000
What kind of family?

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,799
Sister? Wife?

148
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:48,718
Or lover?

149
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:52,334
Da Wu, I tried calling you, but you didn't pick up.

150
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:57,577
Did you take your dad's blue shirt?

151
00:08:57,577 --> 00:08:59,799
I'm going into your room to look for it.

152
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:23,592
Lovers aren't family, okay?

153
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:27,125
You've been asking me questions since I came in.

154
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,167
It's my turn now.

155
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,608
- What do you want to ask?
- Come on.

156
00:09:30,608 --> 00:09:32,728
Try this.

157
00:09:32,728 --> 00:09:35,151
The inspiration you two gave me.

158
00:09:35,151 --> 00:09:38,999
58-degree Kinmen sorghum paired with orange and lemon.

159
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:43,335
A stormy brew of tender, uncertain affection.

160
00:09:43,335 --> 00:09:45,329
A stormy brew of affection?

161
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:47,342
With the love of romance.

162
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:54,759
- Gosh, it's sour.
- Gosh, it's sour.

163
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,175
- It's sweet, too.
- It's sweet, too.

164
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:01,687
So, this is how you see the two of us?

165
00:10:01,687 --> 00:10:04,141
Based on my observation,

166
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:07,560
this drink seems to describe love as being like a storm,

167
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,695
unpredictable and intense.

168
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:12,786
Some people get lost in it without realizing.

169
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:18,967
Some become insecure and some stand firm in the storm.

170
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:20,999
What do you mean?

171
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:22,999
So, which one am I?

172
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:26,050
Which one am I?

173
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:28,799
Who knows?

174
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:44,842
Some people get lost in it without realizing.

175
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,467
Some become insecure

176
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:56,426
and some stand firm in the storm.

177
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:58,999
[Li Hao Nuo...]

178
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:03,709
Li Hai Nuo vows to become

179
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:07,226
a marine biologist, an illustrator,

180
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,867
and publish a book before turning 30.

181
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:12,799
Also...

182
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:16,300
What?

183
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:19,999
Also, make 10 million dollars

184
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:23,467
to travel the world with Chen Da Wu.

185
00:12:28,893 --> 00:12:31,384
So, are you going to make it happen?

186
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:33,867
Make 10 million dollars?

187
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:36,443
Come on. No way.

188
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:39,467
I was too ambitious. That's hilarious.

189
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,434
You aren't going to just laugh it off, are you?

190
00:12:45,434 --> 00:12:48,794
0If it's unrealistic, of course I'll laugh it off.

191
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:50,250
What else can I do?

192
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,125
I might as well write a new one.

193
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,728
Something more practical.

194
00:12:53,728 --> 00:12:57,217
At least I won't be embarrassed when I'm older.

195
00:12:57,217 --> 00:12:59,384
Come on.

196
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:03,800
There's still time to achieve these dreams.

197
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:09,169
I know you gave up graduate school because of your grandma,

198
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:12,799
but I'll support you in achieving your dream.

199
00:13:14,136 --> 00:13:17,175
Those aren't my dreams anymore.

200
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,009
What about being an illustrator?

201
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:22,042
I'll just go with the flow.

202
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:24,210
Publishing a book isn't that important anymore.

203
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:28,467
The most important thing is that I enjoy drawing.

204
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:33,842
What about traveling the world with Chen Da Wu?

205
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:39,167
Traveling the world...

206
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,834
If I had that much money,

207
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:43,197
the first thing I'd do is pay off the mortgage for the guesthouse.

208
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,334
No.

209
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:45,834
I mean...

210
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:48,883
With Chen Da Wu. Those four words.

211
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:01,883
Chen Da Wu.

212
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:07,209
No matter if you're in Kinmen or abroad,

213
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:08,560
from childhood to now,

214
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,193
I've always grown up with you, Chen Da Wu.

215
00:14:11,193 --> 00:14:12,500
Our bond over all these years

216
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,925
has never changed because of anyone or anything, right?

217
00:14:19,685 --> 00:14:21,377
Hai Nuo.

218
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:24,551
I'll support you in achieving all your dreams.

219
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:27,592
Will you do the same for me?

220
00:14:30,226 --> 00:14:32,175
Of course.

221
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,799
Good.

222
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:17,999
Everyone, attention, please.

223
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:21,934
Village Chief is speaking.

224
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:24,226
The garbage truck is about to leave.

225
00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:26,065
Please...

226
00:15:26,065 --> 00:15:27,933
Hey!

227
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:28,959
Didn't you just get home from school?

228
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:29,999
Where are you going now?

229
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:31,551
I'm going to help Xiao Guang with his homework.

230
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:34,667
Your grades are slipping and you're still worried about him?

231
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,334
I just didn't read the questions carefully.

232
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:37,999
I'll do better next time.

233
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:39,799
- Bye.
- Hey.

234
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:46,967
[Ice]

235
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,711
Ma'am, one bowl of roasted wheat flour ice cream.

236
00:15:49,711 --> 00:15:52,209
Okay.

237
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:53,876
You should eat more, too.

238
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:56,231
This is your favorite, isn't it? Here.

239
00:15:56,231 --> 00:15:57,883
Here.

240
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,867
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

241
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:05,375
Ms. Li Hai Nuo.

242
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,799
My brain is frozen now.

243
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:11,412
I don't care. You've got to rub it for me.

244
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:13,883
All right.

245
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:18,377
Chen Da Wu.

246
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,467
Aren't you supposed to be studying?

247
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:20,610
Why are you here eating ice cream with me?

248
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,528
Won't your dad be mad?

249
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:25,467
Don't worry, I've got it covered.

250
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,537
Miss, excuse me. Could you take a photo for us?

251
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:31,634
- Sure.
- Thank you.

252
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:33,221
All right. Come on.

253
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:34,966
Let's take a photo. Ready?

254
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:38,718
One, two, three.

255
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,259
Mom, weren't you going dancing?

256
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,925
I'm going now.

257
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:16,459
Son.

258
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:20,867
Didn't you keep all your high school stuff

259
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:23,553
in a shoebox untouched?

260
00:17:23,553 --> 00:17:26,800
Mom, what are you trying to say?

261
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:33,933
So?

262
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:36,467
You and Hai Nuo...

263
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:42,751
After all that traveling abroad,

264
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:45,292
are you back to square one?

265
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:48,999
I had to go out there to find out where my heart is.

266
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:50,527
I finally understand that

267
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,834
the person who makes me feel most at ease

268
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:55,634
is the one I should cherish the most.

269
00:17:57,834 --> 00:17:59,375
I even told your dad

270
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,169
that we should find someone for you to marry.

271
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:03,794
Mom, no need.

272
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:05,035
I'm good.

273
00:18:05,035 --> 00:18:06,243
Okay, I understand.

274
00:18:06,243 --> 00:18:08,883
I'll tell him not to arrange anything.

275
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:12,169
Mom.

276
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:16,527
Please don't tell Dad about this.

277
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:18,999
I don't want him to overthink it.

278
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:20,353
Okay?

279
00:18:20,353 --> 00:18:24,999
All right. I'm off to dance.

280
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:26,799
Go ahead.

281
00:18:36,801 --> 00:18:38,320
Grandma, you can leave it there.

282
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,695
I'll take care of it later.

283
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:41,799
It's fine. I'll do it.

284
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:44,528
Nuo Nuo.

285
00:18:44,528 --> 00:18:47,276
When Yin Mo goes to film the reality show,

286
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:49,999
he won't be staying here anymore, right?

287
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:52,592
He'll be staying with the production crew.

288
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,634
I've gotten used to seeing him every day.

289
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:03,278
After spending time together, I've grown attached to him.

290
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:05,592
I really don't want to see him go.

291
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,619
Ever since he came,

292
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:13,342
something new has been happening every day.

293
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:18,209
Good thing we didn't close the guesthouse.

294
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:20,999
Otherwise, we'll miss out on such a wonderful connection.

295
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:24,417
That's why I said you can't close the guesthouse.

296
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:26,933
Isn't it like having another family member?

297
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,759
It's not us taking care of him.

298
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,626
He has always been there for us.

299
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:32,751
It feels like I've got another grandson.

300
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:35,009
A very handsome grandson.

301
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:39,834
Maybe one day, I'll take you to visit the set.

302
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:41,799
We'll see.

303
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:45,230
Go make breakfast.

304
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,342
I'll fold the clothes.

305
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,883
- Go.
- Okay.

306
00:20:01,476 --> 00:20:03,083
Breakfast is ready.

307
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,250
Grandma, breakfast is ready.

308
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,209
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

309
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,753
Yin Mo, look.

310
00:20:09,753 --> 00:20:11,549
I've patched it up for you.

311
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:14,375
Torn clothes bring bad luck and can affect your career.

312
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,292
You're a superstar. You should dress nicely.

313
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:20,017
Grandma, that's my shirt.

314
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:22,368
Why did you use my shirt to patch up his pants?

315
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:24,547
Didn't you throw it away?

316
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:26,250
I didn't throw it away. I wear it for picking oysters.

317
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,000
It's okay, Grandma. I like it a lot.

318
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,459
I'll wear these pants for the reality show.

319
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:33,693
Wearing torn pants on the show isn't good.

320
00:20:33,693 --> 00:20:36,329
He has a thing for worn-out stuff. Take it apart.

321
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:37,619
No way. I'm going to wear it.

322
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:39,125
Don't wear it. Wear something new.

323
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,533
You patched it up, so it's new now.

324
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:42,334
It's mine. I want to take it apart.

325
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:43,999
- I don't care. I want to wear it.
- Don't wear it.

326
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:47,042
- I'm wearing it.
- I'm taking it apart.
- Don't wear it.

327
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:48,626
- I'm taking it apart.
- I'm wearing it.

328
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:50,384
I'm...

329
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:58,259
- He's mad.
- Well...

330
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:00,537
Don't be mad.

331
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:02,799
If you want to wear it...

332
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:06,792
Then go ahead and wear it.

333
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,235
Come on.

334
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:10,860
- No take-backs.
- Yes, wear it.

335
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,367
I'll wear it then.

336
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:14,134
Okay.

337
00:21:16,678 --> 00:21:19,143
Grandma, are you my grandma or his grandma?

338
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:21,268
Didn't you see his...

339
00:21:21,268 --> 00:21:22,753
It's all the same.

340
00:21:22,753 --> 00:21:24,217
- How's it all the same?
- Don't...

341
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:26,212
- You two are a pair now, aren't you?
- Let's eat.

342
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:28,368
- Didn't you see his smug look?
- Have a seat.

343
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:30,167
Ignore her. Let's eat.

344
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:31,777
Right. Just ignore me.

345
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:32,786
I'm just a stranger.

346
00:21:32,786 --> 00:21:34,292
Have some pancakes.

347
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:35,959
I made them.

348
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,318
We'll eat them ourselves.

349
00:21:37,318 --> 00:21:39,217
She needs to eat less anyway.

350
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:53,334
Hey, Xu Man.

351
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:54,925
You Cai.

352
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,083
Everyone is talking about that reality show

353
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,643
and trying to get on TV.

354
00:22:01,643 --> 00:22:02,967
You're different.

355
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:04,584
You asked me to give you a tour instead.

356
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:05,792
I don't really understand that stuff

357
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:08,375
and I'm not that interested.

358
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,834
Walking your own path with your own style.

359
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:13,426
That's the mark of a true artist.

360
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,209
I've seen your work before and they're really abstract.

361
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:23,761
However, this piece doesn't seem as abstract.

362
00:22:23,761 --> 00:22:25,959
There's a Wind Lion God and a little girl.

363
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:29,652
Is there a story behind it?

364
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:30,999
When I painted this,

365
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:34,009
I remembered how terrified I was of Wind Lion God as a child.

366
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:36,542
It looked so fierce.

367
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:39,125
You're the little girl, right?

368
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,584
I have a vague memory of my childhood.

369
00:22:41,584 --> 00:22:45,157
I only remember my mom often bringing me here to play.

370
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:47,959
So, how long did you stay here?

371
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:49,500
After I graduated from middle school,

372
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,375
my parents got divorced.

373
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,209
I went to Taipei with my dad.

374
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:56,042
Then I went to study in the UK.

375
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,164
You probably still have relatives here, right?

376
00:22:58,164 --> 00:22:59,375
Probably.

377
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:00,966
However, after my dad passed away,

378
00:23:00,966 --> 00:23:02,728
I lost touch with them.

379
00:23:02,728 --> 00:23:03,876
- Let's go.
- Sure.

380
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:05,516
- Come on.
- Do you want me to carry that for you?

381
00:23:05,516 --> 00:23:07,535
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.

382
00:23:07,535 --> 00:23:09,676
All right. Let's start over there.

383
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:13,417
The place we're in right now is called Oucuo.

384
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:14,702
Look at these houses.

385
00:23:14,702 --> 00:23:16,318
Their roofs are flat.

386
00:23:16,318 --> 00:23:18,134
In the past, people here lived by the sea.

387
00:23:18,134 --> 00:23:19,292
Their life was centered around the sea.

388
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:22,125
So, the flat roofs were great for drying the catch.

389
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,669
Even though it's not like that anymore,

390
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,799
this area has been well-preserved.

391
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:31,059
You Cai, do you have more materials on hand?

392
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:32,226
Yes.

393
00:23:32,226 --> 00:23:34,384
I have plenty of interview notes, too.

394
00:23:34,384 --> 00:23:37,428
The elderly locals here

395
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:39,083
are quite old and not in good health.

396
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,167
Some of the stories

397
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:42,967
haven't even been fully told before they passed away.

398
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:48,384
Doing this job now feels like racing against the clock.

399
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,800
Xu Man.

400
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:01,751
What are you doing?

401
00:24:01,751 --> 00:24:03,261
Look.

402
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:05,426
These are some photos I took recently.

403
00:24:07,636 --> 00:24:10,300
Are these buildings?

404
00:24:11,476 --> 00:24:13,561
Do you remember I told you

405
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:17,143
I often dreamed of a mansion when I was a kid?

406
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:19,709
I remember you told me back then

407
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,342
that it was like your secret place.

408
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:27,167
That house always felt so mysterious and peaceful to me.

409
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:29,167
Whenever I felt upset,

410
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:32,417
I would close my eyes and think of that house.

411
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:34,940
It would calm my mind.

412
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,149
Didn't you search for many old houses before

413
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:39,883
and never found that feeling?

414
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:44,718
I used to feel like I was surrounded by fog.

415
00:24:44,718 --> 00:24:48,506
However, after we dealt with those paintings together,

416
00:24:48,506 --> 00:24:50,867
it felt like my senses opened up again

417
00:24:50,867 --> 00:24:54,626
and I started noticing new details.

418
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:59,042
Today, while walking around Oucuo,

419
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:01,799
it feels like my memories are coming back.

420
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:06,834
Have you eaten?

421
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,918
- Yes, I'm full.
- I see.

422
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:10,900
Has your daughter called you recently?

423
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,966
She calls every week.

424
00:25:11,966 --> 00:25:13,667
Every week?

425
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:15,667
Did she say when she's coming back?

426
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:18,259
- During the New Year.
- I see. That's a long time.

427
00:25:18,876 --> 00:25:20,467
You Cai.

428
00:25:22,184 --> 00:25:23,626
You Cai, what are you doing here?

429
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:24,900
I don't usually have much to do,

430
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,834
so I come and chat with these elderly folks.

431
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:30,467
I can learn a lot about Kinmen's stories by talking to them.

432
00:25:34,459 --> 00:25:37,351
Do you know I wrote a book called "Memories of Kinmen"?

433
00:25:37,351 --> 00:25:38,360
I remember.

434
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,494
This man here is the oral narrator,

435
00:25:40,494 --> 00:25:41,999
Mr. Ouyang Guang Xiong.

436
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,999
I know him. He's Mr. Slow.

437
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:46,438
- Mr. Slow.
- I met him last time.

438
00:25:46,438 --> 00:25:47,594
I remember him.

439
00:25:47,594 --> 00:25:49,386
You call him Mr. Slow.

440
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:50,999
He wasn't slow at all back then.

441
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:53,000
He used to be full of life.

442
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,999
However, a few years ago, his daughter passed away

443
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:57,209
and his dementia has gotten worse.

444
00:25:57,209 --> 00:25:59,238
We can't find his family. It's really sad.

445
00:25:59,238 --> 00:26:00,900
The only thing I can do is come

446
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,799
and chat with him whenever I have time.

447
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,718
Take good care of him.

448
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,799
Mr. Slow.

449
00:26:10,626 --> 00:26:12,551
Don't worry.

450
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:14,083
As long as I have time,

451
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,568
I'll come to chat with you more often.

452
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:20,827
And I'll speak slowly.

453
00:26:20,827 --> 00:26:23,967
Let's see if you can remember anything, okay?

454
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:28,634
Slowly.

455
00:26:38,177 --> 00:26:40,867
Go ahead and eat. Don't wait for me.

456
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:43,999
You're working too hard.

457
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:44,999
Look.

458
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:46,999
Every day, you have to

459
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:49,235
water the plants, clean, do the laundry,

460
00:26:49,235 --> 00:26:51,925
and even prepare food for me.

461
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:57,702
Well, don't put so much pressure on yourself.

462
00:26:57,702 --> 00:26:59,573
What pressure do I have?

463
00:26:59,573 --> 00:27:01,209
Well, it's just that...

464
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:03,452
I know

465
00:27:03,452 --> 00:27:05,461
Da Wu sometimes has things on his mind,

466
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:06,476
but he's afraid to tell me.

467
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:07,960
He only tells you.

468
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,933
You also have to deal with my moods.

469
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:16,042
But no matter what, I'm really grateful to you

470
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:19,509
for everything you've done for the family.

471
00:27:21,735 --> 00:27:24,309
You heard what I said to Da Wu this morning, didn't you?

472
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,918
No, I didn't.

473
00:27:25,918 --> 00:27:27,900
Let's eat the noodles.

474
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,867
It's not like what you think. Don't get the wrong idea.

475
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:30,887
I'll explain later.

476
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:33,250
No, I didn't hear anything.

477
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,042
Actually, there are many things

478
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:36,966
that Da Wu doesn't want to talk about.

479
00:27:36,966 --> 00:27:38,210
He must have his reasons.

480
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,634
- No, honey...
- No, listen to me.

481
00:27:39,634 --> 00:27:42,226
He must have his reasons, so I won't ask

482
00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:46,792
to avoid causing you any unnecessary trouble, okay?

483
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:47,999
Let's eat.

484
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,092
Come on. Let's eat.

485
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:53,800
These noodles are still the best.

486
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:57,634
Hurry and eat.

487
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:04,603
Recently, everyone seems to be talking about Bai Yin Mo's reality show.

488
00:28:04,603 --> 00:28:06,125
Are you going to be on it?

489
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:08,193
Mr. Fu Shou did ask me about it,

490
00:28:08,193 --> 00:28:10,669
but I have to go to a reunion with Da Wu.

491
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:12,167
Moreover, after Bai Yin Mo leaves,

492
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:14,799
I'll need to tidy up the guesthouse.

493
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:18,800
What you need to deal with is your feelings.

494
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:22,753
Right.

495
00:28:22,753 --> 00:28:25,603
That's the downside of treating guests like family.

496
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:28,943
When you left, it also took me a while to recover.

497
00:28:28,943 --> 00:28:30,434
Come on.

498
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:33,175
I'm not on the same level as him.

499
00:28:33,801 --> 00:28:36,459
However, I think this time,

500
00:28:36,459 --> 00:28:39,676
it's going to take some time to deal with it.

501
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,967
Life goes on though.

502
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:52,626
Who did you draw?

503
00:28:52,626 --> 00:28:53,626
What?

504
00:28:53,626 --> 00:28:56,259
- That one.
- This one?

505
00:28:57,584 --> 00:28:59,292
It's me and my grandma.

506
00:28:59,292 --> 00:29:01,417
Really?

507
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:03,592
Yes, can't you tell?

508
00:29:09,867 --> 00:29:11,342
What's a reality show?

509
00:29:11,342 --> 00:29:12,933
I've never watched one.

510
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:15,375
What is it about?

511
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:18,311
Honestly, I just figured it out recently.

512
00:29:18,311 --> 00:29:20,993
People seem to be used

513
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:23,801
to seeing the polished version of celebrities.

514
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:27,250
They're curious about what celebrities are really like.

515
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:30,768
A reality show is supposed to show everyone

516
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:33,910
the most authentic side of celebrities.

517
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,184
Then you should know

518
00:29:36,184 --> 00:29:38,334
what Bai Yin Mo is like in private.

519
00:29:38,334 --> 00:29:39,410
You know too, don't you?

520
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:43,834
He's quirky, picky and talk in a rush.

521
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,098
He's very impatient.

522
00:29:45,098 --> 00:29:46,933
That doesn't sound good, right?

523
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:48,801
Not good at all.

524
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:50,799
What should we do?

525
00:29:51,434 --> 00:29:53,342
Should we tell him?

526
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:02,799
Hello?

527
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:05,799
I'm running.

528
00:30:15,478 --> 00:30:17,134
What's up?

529
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:22,017
I just discussed it with Xu Man and felt something was off.

530
00:30:22,017 --> 00:30:23,485
You're great at acting,

531
00:30:23,485 --> 00:30:25,999
but reality shows aren't the same as acting.

532
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:27,999
Thank you.

533
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:30,398
So, I looked up some information online.

534
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:31,667
Some reality shows

535
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:34,309
claim to show the true side of human interactions,

536
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:37,048
but what they really want to capture is the dark side of people

537
00:30:37,048 --> 00:30:40,545
by creating situations to capture celebrities in awkward moments.

538
00:30:40,545 --> 00:30:42,799
So, did you come to warn me?

539
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:45,292
After all, I've been pampering you at the guesthouse,

540
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:46,999
making you kind of adorable.

541
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:49,900
What will happen if you go on the reality show, freak out,

542
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,188
and scare all my fellow villagers away?

543
00:30:52,188 --> 00:30:53,711
Wait a minute.

544
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:56,009
Kind of adorable? What do you mean?

545
00:30:56,918 --> 00:30:59,292
After yesterday's moment of relaxation,

546
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:03,209
you became more gentle, like the growth of new life.

547
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:05,634
That's why I said you're kind of adorable.

548
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:09,842
Are you worried I'll freak out because of the news about me before?

549
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,999
So, I came up with some questions.

550
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:19,626
I thought you could use them as a reference before the filming.

551
00:31:19,626 --> 00:31:22,426
I'm really worried about you...

552
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:29,175
Are you listening to me?

553
00:31:30,726 --> 00:31:32,461
You're worried about me.

554
00:31:32,461 --> 00:31:35,083
- I said I came up with some...
- You're worried about me.

555
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,553
- I came up with some questions.
- You're worried about me.

556
00:31:37,553 --> 00:31:40,292
- I said I came up with some questions
- You're worried about me.

557
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:43,042
- For you to...
- You're really worried about me, aren't you?

558
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:45,799
I haven't finished yet.

559
00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:49,434
Wait.

560
00:31:49,434 --> 00:31:51,452
Wait.

561
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:54,042
I haven't finished speaking.

562
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:56,592
Wait. If you run again, I'll leave.

563
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,401
I meant I listed these questions

564
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:03,294
so that you can prepare in advance.

565
00:32:03,294 --> 00:32:04,999
When the production team makes their moves,

566
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:06,883
you won't be caught off guard.

567
00:32:08,452 --> 00:32:10,461
- Okay?
- Ask away.

568
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:13,050
All right. I'll ask now.

569
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:18,999
What kind of situations would make you feel like you're breaking down?

570
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:21,375
What kind of situations would you find annoying?

571
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:23,751
What kind of situations would make you feel scared?

572
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:25,999
Is there anything you're keeping secret?

573
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:28,384
Those are pretty much the questions.

574
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:35,634
If you're so worried, why don't you come with me?

575
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:40,375
I've already promised Da Wu that I'll go to the reunion with him.

576
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,999
I missed the last event, so I can't miss this time.

577
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:46,467
It's fine, I've faced all my challenges alone all along.

578
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:48,268
Just like these five kilometers now, I'm facing it by myself.

579
00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:49,925
I'm used to it.

580
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,925
All right. I'll run with you.

581
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,577
What's wrong with you?

582
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:22,401
Honey, can we talk?

583
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:24,626
No, Shun Hua asked me to go to his restaurant

584
00:33:24,626 --> 00:33:26,085
to check his fish tanks.

585
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:27,511
I'll go with you.

586
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:28,626
No, I walk there.

587
00:33:28,626 --> 00:33:31,175
- It's a way to get some exercise.
- Then let's talk while we walk.

588
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:33,999
What do you want?

589
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:36,627
What are you trying to say?

590
00:33:36,627 --> 00:33:37,735
We've been married for over 30 years.

591
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:39,834
I've never kept anything from you.

592
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:42,485
I want to talk to you about Da Wu.

593
00:33:42,485 --> 00:33:43,768
I've already told you.

594
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:46,626
Don't tell me about it.

595
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:48,202
No.

596
00:33:48,202 --> 00:33:51,050
This time, I really need to talk to you.

597
00:33:56,819 --> 00:33:58,167
Shun Hua is really something.

598
00:33:58,167 --> 00:33:59,594
He left the fan downstairs on

599
00:33:59,594 --> 00:34:01,925
and there are several bags of trash in the back.

600
00:34:03,852 --> 00:34:05,551
Honey.

601
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:08,300
What is it?

602
00:34:10,702 --> 00:34:11,801
Nothing.

603
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:12,999
I'm going to take care of the stuff in the back.

604
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:14,570
Okay.

605
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,718
- Do you need help?
- No.

606
00:34:45,718 --> 00:34:46,966
Da Wu.

607
00:34:46,966 --> 00:34:48,726
I've been wanting to ask you something.

608
00:34:48,726 --> 00:34:51,900
What's your relationship with Hai Nuo?

609
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,000
Why?

610
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,792
When I passed by the barbershop,

611
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:59,384
I saw Ms. Shu Man, Hai Nuo, and Bai Yin Mo together.

612
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,999
So?

613
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:06,925
Aren't you worried?

614
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:10,588
Worried about what? What's there to worry about?

615
00:35:10,588 --> 00:35:12,883
Hai Nuo's happiness is what matters most.

616
00:35:15,054 --> 00:35:16,962
But what's so special about Bai Yin Mo?

617
00:35:16,962 --> 00:35:18,342
He's just a tourist from Taipei.

618
00:35:18,342 --> 00:35:20,711
He probably couldn't make it in Taipei.

619
00:35:20,711 --> 00:35:23,243
That's why he's hiding in Kinmen.

620
00:35:23,243 --> 00:35:24,652
How could he possibly measure up to you?

621
00:35:24,652 --> 00:35:26,801
You don't need to worry about me.

622
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:29,426
Worry about yourself. You're about to lose again.

623
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:48,500
We've arrived at my secret hideout.

624
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,167
Whether I'm in a good mood or a bad mood,

625
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:51,535
I always come here

626
00:35:51,535 --> 00:35:55,867
to listen to the sea, look at the stars, and feel the breeze.

627
00:35:55,867 --> 00:35:57,009
Sometimes, in the morning,

628
00:35:57,009 --> 00:35:59,509
I even come here to catch sea urchins.

629
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,801
What am I?

630
00:36:02,801 --> 00:36:05,068
Sea urchin?

631
00:36:05,068 --> 00:36:06,976
I caught you here to set you free.

632
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:08,799
No way.

633
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:15,384
How is it? It feels nice, right?

634
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:23,467
Do you have your own secret hideout, too?

635
00:36:28,984 --> 00:36:31,026
Not really.

636
00:36:31,026 --> 00:36:32,768
It's okay.

637
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:36,799
I'll lend you my secret hideout just for one day.

638
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:05,551
You asked me a question this afternoon, right?

639
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:10,259
Do you want to know the answer?

640
00:37:11,601 --> 00:37:12,898
Are you going to tell me?

641
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,518
Are you ready?

642
00:37:14,518 --> 00:37:16,342
Go ahead. I'm listening.

643
00:37:17,645 --> 00:37:19,799
I hate the dark.

644
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:28,384
I'm also scared

645
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:33,125
of being separated from people who once walked through the darkness

646
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,799
with me.

647
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:38,351
What breaks me is that

648
00:37:38,351 --> 00:37:41,042
once I leave the guesthouse tomorrow morning,

649
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:43,360
we'll go back to our own lives,

650
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,384
living in different worlds.

651
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:51,175
My secret...

652
00:37:54,999 --> 00:37:57,551
My secret is that I found a home here.

653
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:10,999
Anyway, Kinmen and Taipei are so close.

654
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:13,134
You're always welcome to come back.

655
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:26,800
Usually,

656
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,718
aren't we supposed to kiss after a heartfelt confession?

657
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:41,634
That's usually how it goes in dramas.

658
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:45,799
So?

659
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:51,799
So...

660
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,799
Well,

661
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:58,009
let's face each other on the count of three.

662
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:06,799
One.

663
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:10,129
Two.

664
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:11,799
- Three. - Three.

665
00:39:15,877 --> 00:39:17,375
You're so ugly.

666
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:18,636
You're the ugly one.

667
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:20,386
You're super ugly. That face you just made...

668
00:39:20,386 --> 00:39:21,726
I've never seen you look so ugly.

669
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:22,769
- You're the ugliest.
- You're the ugly one.

670
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:24,967
That was really ugly.

671
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,967
It's Da Wu.

672
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:12,334
Have a seat.

673
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:13,645
What do you want to talk about?

674
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:15,799
Anxiety and insecurity?

675
00:41:22,584 --> 00:41:24,259
So?

676
00:41:24,259 --> 00:41:26,880
Have you ever gone through the three stages of love?

677
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,967
Missed opportunities, regret, and compromise?

678
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:33,799
Maybe about 20 times.

679
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:36,967
But it has all been in the dramas.

680
00:41:38,586 --> 00:41:40,626
No real-life experience?

681
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:42,417
I've been too busy to miss out on anything.

682
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,250
What about you?

683
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,967
Do you have any real experience?

684
00:41:50,702 --> 00:41:55,509
There was a time when dreams felt out of reach for me.

685
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,999
However, deep down, I still had hope.

686
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:04,334
So, I started lying to myself.

687
00:42:04,334 --> 00:42:09,092
I even dated someone I didn't really love.

688
00:42:10,335 --> 00:42:14,799
That's because you can't forget your first love.

689
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:19,967
Your first love is irreplaceable.

690
00:42:34,459 --> 00:42:36,050
Yes.

691
00:42:38,217 --> 00:42:42,584
I've always remembered those little moments,

692
00:42:42,584 --> 00:42:47,209
the heartfelt feelings, and the pure joy.

693
00:42:47,209 --> 00:42:49,134
That's why I came back.

694
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:54,292
Hearing that,

695
00:42:54,292 --> 00:42:57,375
I'm starting to feel a little jealous of you.

696
00:42:57,375 --> 00:43:00,083
I came here for a break,

697
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:03,250
but you came back to give it your all

698
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,125
to rewrite your missed opportunities,

699
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,799
regrets, and compromises.

700
00:43:12,042 --> 00:43:16,467
That's why I was always afraid of making more mistakes overseas.

701
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,799
I slammed on the brakes to avoid more regrets.

702
00:43:26,584 --> 00:43:28,551
All right. I get it.

703
00:43:30,753 --> 00:43:33,175
So, that's your anxiety and insecurity.

704
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,876
I can't help but wonder

705
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:44,999
what's on the mind of someone who's immersed in it

706
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:46,799
yet feels nothing.

707
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,217
Tell me about it.

708
00:43:50,867 --> 00:43:53,744
The passion that had once been extinguished in my life

709
00:43:53,744 --> 00:43:56,768
was unexpectedly reignited.

710
00:43:56,768 --> 00:44:00,693
Looking at that tiny spark now, I feel both surprised

711
00:44:00,693 --> 00:44:02,551
and conflicted.

712
00:44:03,535 --> 00:44:07,384
Also, thank you for the reminder.

713
00:44:07,999 --> 00:44:10,042
I definitely won't let myself go through

714
00:44:10,042 --> 00:44:12,300
your kind of three-stage journey.

715
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:15,334
All right then.

716
00:44:15,334 --> 00:44:16,925
As long as you understand.
