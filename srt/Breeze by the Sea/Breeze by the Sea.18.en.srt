♫ You are like the sea ♫

00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:15,709
♫ Every single day ♫

3
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:19,000
♫ You keep waiting ♫

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,500
♫ No matter if I come or not ♫

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,709
♫ A sudden gust of wind ♫

6
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:28,209
♫ Messed up my hairstyle ♫

7
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:31,876
♫ But it brought us together ♫

8
00:00:31,876 --> 00:00:38,999

00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:50,999
♫ Why did I lose my smile? ♫

♫ What I want the most ♫

19
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:17,799

[Breeze by the Sea]

21
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:45,334
Hey.

22
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:47,351
I'm going to learn square dancing from the village chief's wife.

23
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:49,592
Do you want to join me?

24
00:01:50,702 --> 00:01:52,867
You can go alone.

25
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,268
Are you sure?

26
00:01:54,268 --> 00:01:56,175
My dancing is hilarious.

27
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:04,558
Would you like to join me for a drink with Mr. Fu Shou?

28
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:10,383
Okay, well...

29
00:02:10,383 --> 00:02:12,058
Do you think...

30
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,798
Aren't you coming?

31
00:02:14,798 --> 00:02:16,598
No.

32
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:21,558
Then what will I talk about with Mr. Fu Shou?

33
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:37,031
Let me do the cooking.

34
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,392
Okay.

35
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,433
I'll get some work done.

36
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:40,433
Let me know when you're done.

37
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:42,025
Okay.

38
00:03:19,317 --> 00:03:21,150
What?

39
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:30,508
Hello, this is Sea Breeze Guesthouse.

40
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:34,598
I'll connect you to the AI booking assistant.

41
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:42,864
Sorry, but we don't have any rooms available right now.

42
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:45,849
To express our deepest apologies,

43
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:50,517
we will now play a classic song for our valued guest.

44
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:57,724
What are you doing?

45
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:12,882
Grandpa, we'll wait for Dr. Chen to park his car.

46
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:16,550
He'll check your blood pressure and blood sugar later.

47
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,598
Today, I'll teach you all how to draw.

48
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,598
Xu Man.

49
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:28,266
Let's go.

50
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:31,508
Man Man and I...

51
00:04:31,508 --> 00:04:34,724
Man Man's drawing...

52
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:37,765
- Drawing...
- Right.

53
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:40,682
He probably wants to see the painting you did before.

54
00:04:48,865 --> 00:04:51,598
Do you like this painting?

55
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:56,931
I was going to add some color before giving it to you.

56
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:59,517
If you like it, I can put it up for you later.

57
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:03,641
Man Man.

58
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:07,598
Grandpa.

59
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:10,183
Man Man.

60
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:12,598
Grandpa.

61
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:22,517
Let's go.

62
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:37,299
Hey, look.

63
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:38,924
I've been driving slower lately,

64
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:42,798
and there are fewer small rocks scraping off the paint,

65
00:05:42,798 --> 00:05:45,141
so you don't need to keep fixing it.

66
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,425
By the way, I remember there's still a spot at the back of the car

67
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:51,014
where we could add a design.

68
00:05:51,014 --> 00:05:52,756
Next time, teach me

69
00:05:52,756 --> 00:05:54,517
and we can do it together.

70
00:05:58,717 --> 00:06:01,174
My agent helped me apply

71
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:05,598
to stay at the International Art Village in Paris for a while.

72
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:08,598
I'm leaving tomorrow.

73
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:11,839
No way.

74
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,675
Are you kidding me?

75
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:15,350
It's true.

76
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:21,397
This is such an important matter.

77
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:23,433
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

78
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:28,341
I was going to leave without saying goodbye.

79
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:30,591
I'm really afraid of farewells.

80
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:34,598
Sometimes, I get too emotional and dramatic.

81
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:50,990
When someone goes abroad to pursue something,

82
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,391
don't people usually congratulate them?

83
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:13,016
Congratulations.

84
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,377
What time are you
leaving tomorrow?

85
00:07:18,377 --> 00:07:19,946
I'll see you off.

86
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,598
You know I'm not used to saying goodbye.

87
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:07,433
You're back, so I'm back, too.

88
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:15,099
Let's eat.

89
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:17,808
Thank you.

90
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:37,008
There can't be any other candidate, right?

91
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:39,174
Not necessarily.

92
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:41,341
Of course, it has to be me.

93
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:45,308
I'm the one who chose the nickname Little Bean Sprout.

94
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:50,808
Are you in such a hurry to be her godfather?

95
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:56,207
This is the first time in my life

96
00:08:56,207 --> 00:08:58,598
I've ever fought to be a godfather.

97
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:01,223
Godfather.

98
00:09:01,223 --> 00:09:02,475
Do you want to see your goddaughter?

99
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,350
Sure. Let's go.

100
00:09:06,798 --> 00:09:09,308
We'll be right back.

101
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:17,732
Your daughter is really adorable.

102
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:20,008
Look at her nose.

103
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:21,924
It's exactly like yours.

104
00:09:21,924 --> 00:09:24,924
Of course. Look who gave birth to her.

105
00:09:24,924 --> 00:09:27,174
Look at how much hair she has.

106
00:09:27,174 --> 00:09:29,216
When she's a bit older,

107
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:31,798
I'll give her the same hairstyle as yours.

108
00:09:31,798 --> 00:09:34,974
Sure. The curlier the better.

109
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:37,341
Shun Hua, it's about time.

110
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:38,684
I'm going to meet someone.

111
00:09:38,684 --> 00:09:39,732
Who?

112
00:09:39,732 --> 00:09:41,174
I'll tell you later.

113
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:42,798
Take care.

114
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:45,174
Say goodbye to your godfather.

115
00:09:45,174 --> 00:09:48,598
Your goddaughter is really adorable.

116
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:53,558
I'll get going.

117
00:10:02,758 --> 00:10:05,933
Little Bean Sprout, your godmother is here to see you.

118
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,808
Grandma.

119
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:52,599
Lately,

120
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:56,724
you must have been really worried about me.

121
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:06,350
Today,

122
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:11,225
I'm here

123
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:17,225
to tell you that...

124
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:30,598
A little princess

125
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:33,598
has arrived in our village

126
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:37,350
and I'm her godmother.

127
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:45,641
It's a shame you couldn't see her come into this world.

128
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:50,974
I know...

129
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:59,391
I know you were looking forward to it, too.

130
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:14,517
I know that

131
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,599
you're with my parents now,

132
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:27,598
so I don't need to worry about you anymore.

133
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:38,517
Today, I came to tell you

134
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:42,133
I'll be fine.

135
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:45,058
You don't need to worry about me either.

136
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:01,350
Because I'm not alone anymore.

137
00:14:07,717 --> 00:14:09,475
Grandma.

138
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:13,599
You take care too, okay?

139
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,766
I'll really, really miss you.

140
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:28,598
And I'll keep moving forward.

141
00:15:34,223 --> 00:15:35,974
Grandma.

142
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:38,641
Goodbye.

143
00:15:43,758 --> 00:15:45,732
Attention, passengers.

144
00:15:45,732 --> 00:15:49,966
Passengers for flight A1C26

145
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:52,008
the plane is about to take off.

146
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:57,682
Please proceed to Gate 12 if you have yet to board.

147
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:07,183
Xu Man.

148
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,891
Where are you going?

149
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:20,383
Let me check.

150
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:22,141
Kaohsiung.

151
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,133
How do you not know where you're going?

152
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:31,659
Didn't you buy the ticket?

153
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:35,484
I bought it in a rush.

154
00:16:35,484 --> 00:16:39,891
It's a ticket to enter the boarding area.

155
00:17:08,508 --> 00:17:12,466
Well, I left the key to my studio in the usual spot.

156
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,924
If you need it,

157
00:17:14,924 --> 00:17:16,758
feel free to use it.

158
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:18,466
Don't be shy.

159
00:17:18,466 --> 00:17:20,641
It'll just go to waste if it stays there.

160
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:25,558
Okay.

161
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:30,258
Attention, passengers.

162
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:36,008
- Flight A1C26 is about to take off.
- I'm going to board now.

163
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:38,717
Please proceed to Gate 12 if you have yet to board.

164
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:40,598
Xu Man.

165
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:49,598
If you don't make

166
00:17:50,216 --> 00:17:53,133
new friends in Paris,

167
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:56,598
you can call me at night.

168
00:17:57,258 --> 00:17:59,258
We can video call,

169
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:01,308
have some drinks,

170
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:06,058
and talk like before.

171
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:09,598
It'll be morning for you though.

172
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,849
Right. There's a time difference.

173
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:15,008
But that's fine.

174
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:17,798
I can get used to waking up early

175
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:20,598
and drinking in the morning.

176
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:23,642
You're a doctor.

177
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:26,598
Wouldn't drinking so early be bad?

178
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,517
But with you gone,

179
00:18:37,675 --> 00:18:39,598
I'll feel out of place.

180
00:18:42,675 --> 00:18:45,599
When we had instant noodles on the car roof,

181
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:49,598
I only congratulated you.

182
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:53,517
I forgot to tell you

183
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:57,599
I'll miss you a lot.

184
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:15,266
Have a safe journey.

185
00:19:16,216 --> 00:19:18,682
I can't wait to see your new work in Paris.

186
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:23,599
Okay.

187
00:19:28,258 --> 00:19:29,692
Take care.

188
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:31,598
Make sure to look after yourself.

189
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:26,216
I brought the mosquito coil up for you.

190
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:28,141
Where should I put it?

191
00:20:29,464 --> 00:20:31,931
Just put it on the table.

192
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,891
Thank you.

193
00:20:50,931 --> 00:20:53,183
What story are you working on?

194
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,391
I'll share it with you when I'm done.

195
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:05,099
I see.

196
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,798
Tomorrow, I'm visiting Shun Hua and You Cai

197
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:11,289
for some field research.

198
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:13,099
Do you want to come along?

199
00:21:15,216 --> 00:21:17,341
You go ahead. I have things to do.

200
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:18,798
I won't bother you then. Get some rest.

201
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:20,849
- Good night.
- Good night.

202
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:36,391
Acting cool won't help.

203
00:22:05,882 --> 00:22:08,517
What do you want me to see?

204
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:10,141
Up there.

205
00:22:11,383 --> 00:22:13,517
Do I need to go up?

206
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,091
What is this?

207
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:25,798
A gecko.

208
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:30,174
My grandma says geckos represent protection and wealth.

209
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:31,924
It's a good thing.

210
00:22:31,924 --> 00:22:33,425
Does it just catch mosquitoes?

211
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:35,008
How could it have so much meaning?

212
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,508
Catching mosquitoes is good, too.

213
00:22:37,508 --> 00:22:39,598
That way, you won't need mosquito coils.

214
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:44,633
How funny.

215
00:22:44,633 --> 00:22:46,391
How funny.

216
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,258
That little gecko has grown so big.

217
00:22:59,258 --> 00:23:02,225
Maybe we should take it out for a walk tomorrow.

218
00:23:09,591 --> 00:23:12,308
Now what? Acting cute won't help either.

219
00:23:15,383 --> 00:23:18,550
We'll see tomorrow.

220
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,225
Good night.

221
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:29,766
You said this would work.

222
00:23:38,841 --> 00:23:43,422
[A Month Later]

223
00:23:50,466 --> 00:23:54,225
I don't need to worry about those small rocks anymore.

224
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:00,174
But that doesn't mean you can drive fast.

225
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:03,141
I don't want to keep fixing the paint all the time.

226
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:08,933
You gave up your dreams.

227
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,099
Do you have any regrets?

228
00:24:14,924 --> 00:24:17,808
That depends on how you define dreams.

229
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,133
Maybe dreams aren't just

230
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:24,016
about creative breakthroughs,

231
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:28,798
but also about sharing a drink and conversations

232
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:31,724
with people you connect with.

233
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:46,598
Should we find time

234
00:24:47,508 --> 00:24:51,266
to paint the back of the car?

235
00:24:58,091 --> 00:25:01,133
Excuse me, is anyone here?

236
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:04,383
Hi, welcome to Sea Breeze Guesthouse.

237
00:25:04,383 --> 00:25:07,133
Are you the guests who booked for two days?

238
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:10,641
- Yes.
- Okay. Just a moment.

239
00:25:13,206 --> 00:25:14,282
Look...

240
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:15,466
That's sorghum.

241
00:25:15,466 --> 00:25:17,299
You can use it to make a broom.

242
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:19,258
I see. That's quite unique.

243
00:25:19,258 --> 00:25:21,133
It's quite special.

244
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:23,299
Could you take a photo for me?

245
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:24,902
Sure. Over there. It's prettier.

246
00:25:24,902 --> 00:25:28,091
- All right. Make it look nice.
- Come on.

247
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:30,216
Breakfast here is at seven o'clock.

248
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:32,600
If you'd like to change it, just let me know.

249
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,425
- Okay, thank you.
- Look here.

250
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:37,508
Smile. Perfect.

251
00:25:37,508 --> 00:25:39,008
Is this your first time in Kinmen?

252
00:25:39,008 --> 00:25:40,798
Yes, it is.

253
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:41,966
Is there anything fun to do here?

254
00:25:41,966 --> 00:25:44,882
Any must-see spots or restaurants?

255
00:25:44,882 --> 00:25:47,882
For must-try restaurants, I recommend Xinda Temple Restaurant.

256
00:25:47,882 --> 00:25:50,216
But they recently switched to a reservation system.

257
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:53,174
If you'd like to go, I can make a reservation for you.

258
00:25:53,174 --> 00:25:57,798
In the afternoon, you can head to AKIO for coffee

259
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:00,091
and hear the owner share about Kinmen's history.

260
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,133
He's really good at storytelling.

261
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:04,133
Here, have some tea.

262
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:07,225
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

263
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,508
What you're doing is wonderful.

264
00:26:11,508 --> 00:26:14,598
Running a guesthouse together seems so romantic.

265
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:17,258
The boss isn't here.

266
00:26:17,258 --> 00:26:19,425
We're just friends helping out.

267
00:26:19,425 --> 00:26:22,682
You two are a couple, right?

268
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:25,508
We're good friends.

269
00:26:25,508 --> 00:26:29,798
Good friends who can drink and chat together.

270
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:31,799
I see.

271
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:36,849
More like soulmates.

272
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:43,466
Da Wu.

273
00:26:43,466 --> 00:26:46,599
Nothing much. I just changed my daughter's diaper.

274
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,598
I'm trying to be a good dad.

275
00:26:52,216 --> 00:26:53,425
Lunchtime?

276
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:54,798
Two people?

277
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:57,841
Okay. Bye.

278
00:26:57,841 --> 00:27:00,258
Honey, Da Wu just called and said

279
00:27:00,258 --> 00:27:02,341
two people from the guesthouse are coming for lunch.

280
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:03,799
I'll go prepare the ingredients.

281
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,798
I'll leave our daughter to you.

282
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:06,798
I told you.

283
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:08,008
I can handle it by myself.

284
00:27:08,008 --> 00:27:09,841
Go on and take care of your work.

285
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:12,798
I want to spend every second with my two precious girls.

286
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,091
Hurry up and go.

287
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,225
I'll get going.

288
00:27:33,758 --> 00:27:37,383
This is the village chief speaking.

289
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:39,618
We hope that our villagers can all ride the wind

290
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:40,799
- and head toward their dreams.
- Hi.

291
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,841
- Two Americanos.
- Even when facing difficulties,

292
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:44,798
even when encountering obstacles,

293
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:45,841
as long as you stay true to your heart,

294
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:48,550
victory will be yours in the end.

295
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,599
All right. Enough with the nonsense.

296
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:56,174
Master.

297
00:27:56,174 --> 00:28:00,600
Why do Mr. Fu Shou and his wife sound so excited today?

298
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,133
Because today is the day.

299
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:05,133
Right. It's today.

300
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:06,216
Exactly.

301
00:28:06,216 --> 00:28:09,049
The most important thing is

302
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:11,216
don't forget to tune in

303
00:28:11,216 --> 00:28:13,798
to the live broadcast of the press conference later.

304
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:15,258
- If...
- If you don't know where to watch it,

305
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:16,798
check the announcement in our group.

306
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:18,799
That's all for now.

307
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,849
That's all for now.

308
00:28:22,425 --> 00:28:24,598
Do you have any thoughts?

309
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,974
Can I recreate the only painting I've ever done in my life?

310
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:33,798
No drawing a bunch of "ZZZ" this time.

311
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:35,599
Are you really that tired?

312
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:39,183
Let me think about it.

313
00:28:40,924 --> 00:28:44,216
Maybe we should help Hai Nuo customize her truck, too.

314
00:28:44,216 --> 00:28:46,765
What do you think?

315
00:28:46,765 --> 00:28:47,798
Sure.

316
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:52,641
I remember she mentioned that she wanted to repaint her truck.

317
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,008
Let's surprise her with it.

318
00:28:56,008 --> 00:28:57,841
It sounds good.

319
00:28:57,841 --> 00:29:00,841
What do you think about painting it blue?

320
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:02,699
Blue?

321
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,451
Blue is nice.

322
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,641
Because the guesthouse...

323
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:15,008
I know you can't make it. It's okay.

324
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:18,216
I'll go over for dinner after I'm done here.

325
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:19,317
Okay.

326
00:29:19,317 --> 00:29:22,599
Mom, make sure to add some meatballs for me.

327
00:29:23,258 --> 00:29:24,933
- Bye.
- Boss.

328
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:30,798
Okay.

329
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:33,798
Really? But I didn't invite him.

330
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:35,598
- It's fine.
- Yin Mo.

331
00:29:38,174 --> 00:29:39,299
Director Bai.

332
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:41,798
Director White.

333
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:43,798
- It has been a while.
- Yes, it has been a while.

334
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:47,466
You look handsome today.

335
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:49,058
Not as handsome as you.

336
00:29:49,765 --> 00:29:50,841
My whole family is here.

337
00:29:50,841 --> 00:29:51,924
My parents.

338
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:53,799
My two sisters came all the way from Canada

339
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:56,258
because they're huge fans of yours.

340
00:29:56,258 --> 00:29:58,091
Yes, we love your movies.

341
00:29:58,091 --> 00:29:59,717
Your acting is amazing.

342
00:29:59,717 --> 00:30:02,133
- Thank you.
- Xiao Guang, take a photo for us.

343
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,849
Come on.

344
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,029
Okay, three, two, one.

345
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:09,699
- Okay.
- Thank you.

346
00:30:09,699 --> 00:30:12,508
Xiao Guang, can you show my parents their seats?

347
00:30:12,508 --> 00:30:15,924
- But we didn't prepare...
- Let them sit in the front row.

348
00:30:15,924 --> 00:30:18,350
All right. Ma'am, please follow me.

349
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:22,598
Congratulations.

350
00:30:23,966 --> 00:30:25,550
Here's the thing.

351
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,717
Being a director doesn't pay well,

352
00:30:28,717 --> 00:30:32,133
so I'm thinking of switching back to acting.

353
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:34,915
Do you have any roles in your movie that would suit me?

354
00:30:34,915 --> 00:30:36,299
I'm open to anything.

355
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:38,717
Even minor roles are fine.

356
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:40,758
- This movie...
- To all our guests,

357
00:30:40,758 --> 00:30:42,841
the event is about to start.

358
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,633
If you haven't taken your seats, please do so quickly.

359
00:30:46,633 --> 00:30:48,758
We'll keep in touch.

360
00:30:48,758 --> 00:30:51,341
Definitely.

361
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:53,717
I've lost weight, right?

362
00:30:53,717 --> 00:30:55,598
- Yes.
- I've successfully slimmed down.

363
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,070
[Breeze By the Sea]

364
00:31:27,798 --> 00:31:31,049
Thank you to the talented Wang Yue Shan for her amazing performance.

365
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:33,341
She's a rising star promoted by Xinghai Films

366
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:37,008
and she played a significant role in this movie.

367
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:39,717
Please look forward to it.

368
00:31:39,717 --> 00:31:41,308
Thank you.

369
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:48,798
Hello, everyone. I'm today's host.

370
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:50,798
I'm also the producer of this movie.

371
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:52,466
My name is Xue Meng Li.

372
00:31:52,466 --> 00:31:56,008
First, I'd like to thank all the journalists and guests

373
00:31:56,008 --> 00:31:57,930
for attending our press conference.

374
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:01,675
Now, I'd like to introduce a very important person.

375
00:32:01,675 --> 00:32:03,299
He's the star of today.

376
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:06,798
He's also the director and screenwriter of this movie

377
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:09,425
and the general manager of Xinghai Films.

378
00:32:09,425 --> 00:32:13,891
Let's give a warm welcome to Mr. Bai Yin Mo.

379
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:20,014
Hello, everyone from the media.

380
00:32:20,014 --> 00:32:21,732
I'm Bai Yin Mo.

381
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:24,299
Yin Mo, I heard that the inspiration for this movie

382
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:27,798
came from your time shooting a reality show in Kinmen.

383
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:30,633
That was the lowest point in your life.

384
00:32:30,633 --> 00:32:32,841
Can you share with us

385
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:35,183
what happened back then?

386
00:32:38,341 --> 00:32:39,798
A year ago,

387
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:42,966
this hand of mine

388
00:32:42,966 --> 00:32:45,341
caused quite a bit of trouble,

389
00:32:45,341 --> 00:32:48,882
which led to all my endorsements and jobs being canceled.

390
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:51,258
My manager at the time

391
00:32:51,258 --> 00:32:52,966
sent me to Kinmen

392
00:32:52,966 --> 00:32:55,416
to keep me out of trouble.

393
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:57,798
Nobody expected that

394
00:32:57,798 --> 00:33:01,091
during the lowest point in my life,

395
00:33:01,091 --> 00:33:05,308
I'd receive so much warmth and inspiration.

396
00:33:06,216 --> 00:33:10,567
Son, I love you!

397
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:11,957
I'll make more money.

398
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:14,717
In the future, I'll buy you as many TVs as you want.

399
00:33:14,717 --> 00:33:16,633
- Bro.
- Bro.

400
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:18,841
Bros forever.

401
00:33:18,841 --> 00:33:21,306
Resting is just for the sake of resting.

402
00:33:21,306 --> 00:33:24,598
Sometimes, you should relax without any purpose...

403
00:33:26,508 --> 00:33:28,675
- Okay.
- Yes.

404
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:30,891
And enjoy doing nothing.

405
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:35,141
What do these English words mean?

406
00:33:36,174 --> 00:33:38,133
It means I'll be back.

407
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:39,882
Okay.

408
00:33:39,882 --> 00:33:41,849
I'll be waiting for your return.

409
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:45,717
My manager at the time

410
00:33:45,717 --> 00:33:47,758
was really pitiful.

411
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:50,798
I quit the reality show midway

412
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:52,882
which caused her company to shut down

413
00:33:52,882 --> 00:33:55,517
and she had to survive on nothing for an entire year.

414
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:58,675
Yes.

415
00:33:58,675 --> 00:34:01,133
But luckily, Yin Mo values old ties

416
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:03,798
and had the courage to bring me back,

417
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:07,724
giving me a chance to start over.

418
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:12,808
Lily has been nurturing me since I was in high school.

419
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:17,091
She's like family to me.

420
00:34:17,091 --> 00:34:21,091
Conflicts happen in families,

421
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:24,113
but in the end, family is family.

422
00:34:24,113 --> 00:34:27,791
We share joys and weather storms together.

423
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:29,598
You know what I mean.

424
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:39,798
That year was really tough for you.

425
00:34:39,798 --> 00:34:43,798
However, it also transformed you into a creator.

426
00:34:43,798 --> 00:34:48,008
Can you share your story with everyone?

427
00:34:48,008 --> 00:34:50,882
My movie tells the story

428
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:53,550
of a lost sea urchin

429
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,508
who is redeemed by a starfish.

430
00:34:55,508 --> 00:34:58,074
I know it sounds fantastical and absurd,

431
00:34:58,074 --> 00:35:00,598
but it's also deeply moving.

432
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,798
Yin Mo, there's a group of your good friends

433
00:35:04,798 --> 00:35:07,008
who want to share some words with you.

434
00:35:07,008 --> 00:35:08,849
Let's take a look.

435
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:13,383
Is it connected?

436
00:35:13,383 --> 00:35:14,966
It has started.

437
00:35:14,966 --> 00:35:16,891
- It has started.
- Really?

438
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:24,174
Hello to all our friends in Taipei.

439
00:35:24,174 --> 00:35:27,832
I'm Chen Fu Shou, the village chief of Sea Breeze Village.

440
00:35:27,832 --> 00:35:29,008
Today,

441
00:35:29,008 --> 00:35:32,299
on behalf of the villagers of Sea Breeze Village,

442
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:37,598
we have something important to share with you all!

443
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,717
Hello, everyone. My name is Cai You Cai.

444
00:35:41,717 --> 00:35:44,798
Last year, an unusual breeze came from who knows where

445
00:35:44,798 --> 00:35:47,216
brought Mr. Bai Yin Mo to our village.

446
00:35:47,216 --> 00:35:50,924
In our village, every resident has their own style.

447
00:35:50,924 --> 00:35:52,924
My son, for example, is modern

448
00:35:52,924 --> 00:35:56,766
and I have a touch of artistic elegance.

449
00:35:58,798 --> 00:36:00,425
I'm like a warm breeze.

450
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:03,391
I'm an invigorating strong breeze.

451
00:36:05,924 --> 00:36:07,633
Some say I'm like a swift breeze.

452
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:10,808
I might just be a refreshing breeze.

453
00:36:13,508 --> 00:36:14,924
Some are like a cheerful spring breeze.

454
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:17,682
He's an unruly breeze.

455
00:36:18,882 --> 00:36:20,798
I'm the local grandmotherly breeze.

456
00:36:20,798 --> 00:36:23,598
I'm the fresh breeze from outside.

457
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:27,466
I heard that our good friend, Mr. Bai Yin Mo,

458
00:36:27,466 --> 00:36:28,799
wrote a new story.

459
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:31,882
He's going to bring out the bonds, longing,

460
00:36:31,882 --> 00:36:35,299
optimism, resilience,

461
00:36:35,299 --> 00:36:37,174
- and...
- You Cai.

462
00:36:37,174 --> 00:36:39,633
Get to the point.

463
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:44,183
The villagers here are all very happy and grateful.

464
00:36:45,508 --> 00:36:48,174
Now, let's all say it together.

465
00:36:48,174 --> 00:36:51,798
Best wishes for Breeze By the Sea!

466
00:36:51,798 --> 00:36:56,598
May the movie be a great success!

467
00:37:07,466 --> 00:37:08,882
Such adorable friends.

468
00:37:08,882 --> 00:37:11,299
Will they be in the movie, too?

469
00:37:11,299 --> 00:37:13,798
You'll have to watch the movie to find out.

470
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:14,798
All right.

471
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:16,341
To wrap up this press conference,

472
00:37:16,341 --> 00:37:17,341
Yin Mo,

473
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:20,798
you have a little surprise, right?

474
00:37:20,798 --> 00:37:21,798
Yes.

475
00:37:21,798 --> 00:37:24,049
My movie, Breeze By the Sea,

476
00:37:24,049 --> 00:37:27,966
is a collaboration with Li Hai Nuo, a very famous illustrator from Kinmen.

477
00:37:27,966 --> 00:37:32,141
Let's give a warm round of applause to welcome Li Hai Nuo.

478
00:37:41,174 --> 00:37:43,141
Say hello to everyone.

479
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:48,798
Ms. Li Hai Nuo's illustrations

480
00:37:48,798 --> 00:37:52,725
have captured some of the most important moments of my life.

481
00:37:52,725 --> 00:37:56,475
Do you have anything you'd like to share with everyone?

482
00:38:00,517 --> 00:38:02,933
Hello, everyone. I'm Li Hai Nuo.

483
00:38:11,383 --> 00:38:15,966
I feel deeply honored to have the opportunity

484
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:19,633
to be part of this work with Yin Mo.

485
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:21,684
Actually,

486
00:38:21,684 --> 00:38:24,508
when I first read the script,

487
00:38:24,508 --> 00:38:26,633
I was really moved.

488
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:30,717
So, I decided to draw what I felt at that moment.

489
00:38:30,717 --> 00:38:34,841
That led to this unexpected collaboration.

490
00:38:34,841 --> 00:38:36,798
Did it also lead to your marriage?

491
00:38:36,798 --> 00:38:38,798
You two are together now, right?

492
00:38:38,798 --> 00:38:40,008
Aren't you planning to get married?

493
00:38:40,008 --> 00:38:42,717
Is this your love story?

494
00:38:42,717 --> 00:38:44,798
- Well...
- All your questions just now

495
00:38:44,798 --> 00:38:48,174
will be answered in Li Hai Nuo's animated illustrations.

496
00:38:48,174 --> 00:38:49,891
Okay, thank you.

497
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:55,799
He was once a star in the sky,

498
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:58,183
but he plunged to the bottom of the sea.

499
00:38:59,091 --> 00:39:04,550
The cold water turned the light into sharp spikes

500
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,841
and no one could get close to him.

501
00:39:06,841 --> 00:39:09,558
The lost and helpless sea urchin

502
00:39:09,558 --> 00:39:12,058
- met the cheerful starfish.
- Bai Yin Mo!

503
00:39:12,798 --> 00:39:14,525
Bai Yin Mo! Mr. Bai Yin Mo!

504
00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:15,798
Bai Yin Mo.

505
00:39:15,798 --> 00:39:17,798
Welcome to Kinmen.

506
00:39:17,798 --> 00:39:18,798
How funny.

507
00:39:18,798 --> 00:39:21,882
The sea urchin's long spikes stabbed the starfish.

508
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:24,798
Looks like you spent your budget on oil and salt.

509
00:39:24,798 --> 00:39:26,174
Are you trying to send your guests to dialysis?

510
00:39:26,174 --> 00:39:28,008
I need something light, please.

511
00:39:28,008 --> 00:39:29,383
Fine. Starve then.

512
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:32,258
However, the starfish was fearless

513
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:35,099
and dragged the sea urchin out of the corner.

514
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:44,758
It's okay.

515
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:46,598
Let's go home.

516
00:39:51,591 --> 00:39:54,341
The sea urchin silently put away its spikes

517
00:39:54,341 --> 00:39:57,598
and he began to feel the beating of his heart.

518
00:39:58,591 --> 00:40:00,133
Bro!

519
00:40:00,133 --> 00:40:02,049
It's all right. I'm here.

520
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:04,475
It's okay, bro. I'm here.

521
00:40:07,924 --> 00:40:09,008
It's okay. Your grandma is snoring.

522
00:40:09,008 --> 00:40:11,641
It's really loud. Didn't you hear?

523
00:40:12,798 --> 00:40:15,133
Don't cry.

524
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:18,675
The starfish continues to wrap the sea urchin with a sense of security.

525
00:40:18,675 --> 00:40:23,425
The sea urchin is no longer afraid and the starfish is no longer lonely.

526
00:40:23,425 --> 00:40:24,717
They cling tightly to each other.

527
00:40:24,717 --> 00:40:27,308
Sea Breeze Village, the people here,

528
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,550
and you...

529
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,682
I'll only hold on to the best memories.

530
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:36,008
If a starfish is with you,

531
00:40:36,008 --> 00:40:38,508
what's there to be afraid of?

532
00:40:38,508 --> 00:40:40,341
A sudden storm

533
00:40:40,341 --> 00:40:43,049
separated the sea urchin and starfish.

534
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:46,798
They were seriously injured and unable to move.

535
00:40:46,798 --> 00:40:48,214
They were worried about each other.

536
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:49,216
I'll help take care of her, too.

537
00:40:49,216 --> 00:40:52,475
But they had no strength to move toward each other.

538
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:56,266
I need some time to cool down.

539
00:40:58,798 --> 00:41:00,849
I'll put it away.

540
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:05,383
The sea urchin

541
00:41:05,383 --> 00:41:09,216
bravely walks toward the pristine light

542
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,641
with its initial longing.

543
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:16,798
I don't want to be the same person as before.

544
00:41:16,798 --> 00:41:20,008
I will no longer hold onto my resentment toward you.

545
00:41:20,008 --> 00:41:22,141
It's time for me to move on.

546
00:41:31,798 --> 00:41:36,466
This time, the sea urchin carries its reborn radiance,

547
00:41:36,466 --> 00:41:40,558
gently illuminating the starfish in the darkness.

548
00:41:47,675 --> 00:41:49,258
You sent me so many messages.

549
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:51,266
What do you want?

550
00:41:53,258 --> 00:41:55,598
I'm feeling a bit lost in life.

551
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:58,174
Are you willing to join me

552
00:41:58,174 --> 00:42:00,350
on a journey to rediscover my direction?

553
00:42:03,466 --> 00:42:05,008
Don't think acting pitiful will help.

554
00:42:05,008 --> 00:42:07,183
But you still came up, didn't you?

555
00:42:09,633 --> 00:42:11,350
Hey.

556
00:42:15,216 --> 00:42:17,766
I heard there will be a UFO tonight.

557
00:42:21,591 --> 00:42:23,591
I saw it on the news.

558
00:42:23,591 --> 00:42:25,598
Do you want to watch it together?

559
00:42:50,049 --> 00:42:51,798
UFO? Seriously?

560
00:42:51,798 --> 00:42:54,058
Unidentified flying object.

561
00:42:54,798 --> 00:42:56,517
Do you see that?

562
00:42:57,216 --> 00:42:59,266
- That's a plane.
- A plane.

563
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:10,717
If you're cold, just keep it on.

564
00:43:10,717 --> 00:43:13,099
No need to take it off for me.

565
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,350
Why did you say I'm really famous?

566
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,475
I don't have any major works yet.

567
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:38,383
Because after you become my wife,

568
00:43:38,383 --> 00:43:40,598
you'll be really famous.

569
00:43:42,341 --> 00:43:43,633
When?

570
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:45,598
When?

571
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:50,732
Are you two really getting married?

572
00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:53,598
Please focus on watching the video.

573
00:43:55,798 --> 00:43:58,915
I told you. You can't hold that.

574
00:43:58,915 --> 00:44:03,183
During the reality show, didn't they teach you to lower the mic?

575
00:44:06,508 --> 00:44:08,216
Did I ever say I wanted to marry you?

576
00:44:08,216 --> 00:44:09,798
No?

577
00:44:09,798 --> 00:44:12,016
What were you drawing then?
