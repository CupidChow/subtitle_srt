OST TITLE

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,000
♫ You're like a sea ♫

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,451
♫ Every single day ♫

4
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:19,100
♫ You keep waiting ♫

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,384
♫ No matter if I come or not ♫

6
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:24,509
♫ Suddenly, a breeze blows♫

7
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:28,109
♫ Messed up my hairstyle ♫

8
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,676
♫ But it brought us together ♫

9
00:00:31,676 --> 00:00:39,076
♫ I realized I love this version of me ♫

10
00:00:39,076 --> 00:00:44,399
♫ Only you remind me of myself ♫

11
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,899
♫ The one who used to love smiling ♫

12
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:50,999
♫ Why did I lose my smile? ♫

13
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:53,509
♫ Unable to find a way out ♫

14
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:56,918
♫ I stand by the sea, feeling the breeze ♫

15
00:00:56,918 --> 00:01:05,942
♫ Only you, I remembered what I want ♫

16
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:11,459
♫ I finally learned that I think too much ♫

17
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:18,009
♫ I really want to go to the beach with you to feel the breeze ♫

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,699
[Breeze by the Sea]

19
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:33,225
Bai Yin Mo, who recently declined reality show appearances

20
00:01:33,225 --> 00:01:35,209
and faced allegations of abandoning his mom,

21
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:36,800
is now facing a major reversal.

22
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,225
His mom has come forward to unveil

23
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:42,418
a shocking truth about his acting career.

24
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:45,034
I gave all the money Yin Mo had given me

25
00:01:45,034 --> 00:01:48,668
to his stepdad for investment.

26
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:51,500
Later, the business failed

27
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,983
and even the two houses he bought for me were lost.

28
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,484
A video in which Bai Yin Mo's mom recounts her story

29
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:00,899
triggered outrage and criticism from netizens.

30
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,762
They voiced their strong disapproval

31
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:07,051
of such inhumane behavior on social media.

32
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:09,000
Some netizens even edited her photo

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,999
and made her look like a vampire.

34
00:02:26,043 --> 00:02:27,842
Yin Mo.

35
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:30,384
Why are you here?

36
00:02:37,126 --> 00:02:39,900
Have a seat.

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,125
I'll get you some water.

38
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:06,942
Sorry.

39
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:09,066
I don't have any other drinks.

40
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:10,800
It's fine.

41
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,375
I took it upon myself to help you again,

42
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:22,000
but this time, it will work for sure.

43
00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:26,499
They won't criticize you anymore.

44
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:31,768
Lily told me that your acting offers and endorsements

45
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:34,009
are coming back to you.

46
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:41,899
Do you think I should be happy?

47
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:45,618
Did I say something wrong?

48
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:49,209
- Or...
- No.

49
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,966
When I see so many people insulting my mom,

50
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:54,242
do you think I'd be happy?

51
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:57,776
I'd rather they were attacking me.

52
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:02,834
It doesn't matter.

53
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:04,799
Anyway...

54
00:04:19,294 --> 00:04:21,999
I really don't mind.

55
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:26,667
My life has already hit rock bottom anyway.

56
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,009
But you're different.

57
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:32,319
You can make a comeback.

58
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,042
Everyone will sympathize with you.

59
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:39,999
I don't care about the sympathy of others.

60
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:45,043
Today,

61
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:48,692
I'm going to say everything I've kept inside for 20 years.

62
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:02,810
In the past, you took my money to fulfill your love.

63
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,326
You turned the house I gave you into a beautiful home.

64
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:12,500
But did you ever leave a place for me?

65
00:05:13,768 --> 00:05:15,209
You didn't.

66
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:19,909
During holidays and festivals,

67
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:23,009
I always hoped you'd invite me to spend them together.

68
00:05:23,983 --> 00:05:26,334
Did you?

69
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:27,809
You didn't.

70
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,942
I also hoped you'd celebrate my birthday with me.

71
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:34,678
I also wanted to taste the food you made.

72
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:36,592
Did you?

73
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:43,050
I went from disappointment to despair,

74
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,459
from longing to numbness.

75
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:52,527
The word "family" became the scariest word to me.

76
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:56,227
In the past, I never told you anything because...

77
00:05:56,227 --> 00:05:58,867
I believed that if I kept giving you money,

78
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:03,310
buying houses for you, and doing everything perfectly,

79
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,503
I'd earn the right to resent you.

80
00:06:06,503 --> 00:06:09,511
I could hate your heartlessness and selfishness.

81
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:11,646
I could...

82
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:13,776
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:17,809
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:22,084 --> 00:06:24,150
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:37,699
However, after going through so much,

86
00:06:39,326 --> 00:06:42,009
I don't want to be the same person as before.

87
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,476
It's time for me to move on.

88
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:50,376
I will no longer hold onto my resentment toward you.

89
00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:56,899
It doesn't matter if you've helped my career or not.

90
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:02,267
It's your thought that counts.

91
00:07:10,768 --> 00:07:12,699
All right.

92
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,167
I understand.

93
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:30,625
That's all I have to say.

94
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:31,833
I'm so hungry.

95
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,042
Is there anything to eat?

96
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:44,102
Okay.

97
00:07:44,102 --> 00:07:47,125
Let me see what we have to eat.

99
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:57,867
I have dumplings.

100
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:00,117
I'll add some cabbage for you, okay?

101
00:08:02,701 --> 00:08:04,801
There are also your favorite meatballs.

102
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:06,834
Shall I add a few more?

103
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,799
Of course.

104
00:08:12,126 --> 00:08:14,678
Wait for me.

105
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:17,392
I'll cook something for you.

Hai Nuo.

115
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:15,234
Tang Mi, what are you doing here?

116
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:22,050
Here, this is for you.

117
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,352
Thank you. By the way, this is for you.

118
00:09:25,352 --> 00:09:27,868
Thank you. That's so kind of you.

119
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,618
I'll go put it down.

120
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:37,192
By the way, what brings you to Kinmen so suddenly?

121
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:40,701
After the reality show incident,

122
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:43,125
I decided to leave that uncomfortable environment

123
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,142
and pursue what I want to do.

124
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:49,000
That makes sense.

125
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,867
After the reality show,

126
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:53,359
you must have been under a lot of pressure.

127
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:58,400
But why did you choose Kinmen?

128
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:06,084
After seeing how Yin Mo changed for the better

129
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:08,134
since he came here,

130
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:12,767
I've made up my mind to start afresh here.

131
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:15,645
I want to truly feel what life is all about,

132
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:20,001
go back to my old days of filming, create freely,

133
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:22,042
and share my experiences and discoveries

134
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:24,359
with more people.

135
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:29,967
What will you start with?

136
00:10:34,018 --> 00:10:35,942
Ever since I was a child,

137
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:38,092
I've dreamed of opening a café.

138
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:43,042
I plan to start with a local café, learn step by step,

139
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,909
- We're here.
- And document my journey as I go.

140
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,460
Hai Nuo, you brought a guest here for coffee?

141
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,459
You Cai.

142
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:54,599
You met during the reality show.

143
00:10:56,435 --> 00:10:58,742
Hello, I'm Tang Mi.

144
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,668
Sorry. I didn't recognize you.

145
00:11:00,668 --> 00:11:01,799
Welcome. Come on in.

146
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,734
Okay.

147
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:05,509
Thank you.

148
00:11:06,294 --> 00:11:09,276
Hai Nuo, why don't you take Ms. Tang to sit in the back?

149
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:10,661
It's more private and no one will disturb you.

150
00:11:10,661 --> 00:11:14,876
You Cai, I brought Tang Mi here today to meet you.

151
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:17,184
To meet me? Why?

152
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:19,535
You've been in the coffee business for years.

153
00:11:19,535 --> 00:11:22,292
Have you thought about taking on an apprentice?

154
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:25,327
Me? Take on an apprentice?

155
00:11:25,327 --> 00:11:28,544
Stop joking around! I...

156
00:11:28,544 --> 00:11:32,853
Well, You Cai.

157
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:36,361
I was disrespectful to you during the reality show.

158
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:39,143
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:39,143 --> 00:11:40,983
I'm not joking.

160
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:45,167
I seriously want to learn how to make coffee from you.

161
00:12:03,453 --> 00:12:04,851
Excuse me.

162
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:07,701
Is the owner of the art studio planning to move out?

163
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:10,063
No clue, we're just following orders.

164
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,025
I see. Thank you.

165
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:28,734
The past is like expired nail polish.

166
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:32,418
It dries out and goes bad.

167
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,900
What needs to be thrown away should be thrown away.

168
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,016
I won't hold on to it.

169
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:40,192
I only care about our future.

170
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:46,661
Shun Hua?

171
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:50,551
Weren't you supposed to stay in Taipei for two days?

172
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:54,720
A supplier changed their schedule, so I came back early.

173
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,687
Have you been standing here for a long time?

174
00:12:57,687 --> 00:12:59,619
I just got here.

175
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:02,234
I'll tidy up the room first.

176
00:13:09,193 --> 00:13:10,753
Da Wu, why are you sitting here?

177
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:12,595
Where's Xu Man?

178
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:15,909
Xu Man has left.

179
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:18,150
Left? Where did she go?

180
00:13:19,554 --> 00:13:22,420
Maybe she has fulfilled her wishes.

181
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,451
What do you mean?

182
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:50,669
So many things have happened during this time

183
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:53,035
and I didn't even know.

184
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:56,386
I haven't taken the time to really care about Xu Man.

185
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:58,176
It has been days now.

186
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:00,403
After taking your grandma to Taipei, I came to find her,

187
00:14:00,403 --> 00:14:02,909
but she was already gone.

188
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:06,442
I hope she won't leave without saying anything.

189
00:14:06,442 --> 00:14:09,150
However, with her personality...

190
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:12,583
Yes.

191
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:18,775
We're really lucky to have met such a special friend.

192
00:14:22,142 --> 00:14:25,051
But how could she just leave like that?

193
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:28,417
I still have so much to share with her.

194
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,883
She even said she would teach me how to paint.

195
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:35,100
Now, there's no chance.

196
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,586
Ms. Xu, we'll take these paintings now.

197
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:42,335
All right. Thank you.

198
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:45,267
- Xu Man.
- Xu Man, you're here.

199
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:48,867
I thought you weren't around.

200
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,084
Where are you moving to?

201
00:14:51,084 --> 00:14:54,043
I'm not moving anywhere.

202
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:57,427
I went to Taipei for a meeting with my agent.

203
00:14:57,427 --> 00:15:00,134
So, where are those paintings going?

204
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:01,734
They're being sent for an exhibition.

205
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,933
After it's done, they'll be returned.

206
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:06,294
I see.

207
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:07,536
Da Wu was saying that

208
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:09,268
he couldn't find you for the past few days.

209
00:15:09,268 --> 00:15:11,899
He was afraid you had left without a word.

210
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:13,699
Really?

211
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:19,117
Well, didn't I accompany you to visit your grandpa before?

212
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:22,042
I just wanted to check on you.

213
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:25,687
Thank you.

214
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:28,469
By the way, I'm planning to hold a free clinic soon,

215
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:32,343
but I've been struggling to find the right venue.

216
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:34,800
How about you two go ahead and chat?

217
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,909
I'll catch up with you later.

218
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:38,399
Bye.

219
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:49,738
Do you want some coffee?

220
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:51,799
Sure.

221
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:54,768
I recently discovered

222
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:57,150
that you can add sorghum liquor to coffee.

223
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,292
Do you want to try it?

224
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,959
Sorghum liquor?

225
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,051
Jing Liang.

226
00:16:10,051 --> 00:16:12,668
I went to the academic office at your school and asked.

227
00:16:12,668 --> 00:16:14,586
The transfer exam brochure

228
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:17,110
should be released between April and June.

229
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,611
- In July and August...
- Dad.

230
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't worry, I've checked everything.

231
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:25,734
That's good then.

232
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,867
Since you've checked,

233
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:29,695
you should start planning your revision schedule now.

234
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,142
- You don't have that long...
- Dad.

235
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:34,313
I know.

236
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:36,367
Okay.

237
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:38,721
I'm nagging again. Sorry.

238
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:40,875
Dad.

239
00:16:42,594 --> 00:16:44,351
What now?

240
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:51,361
Turns out you're going to Taipei to see your mom.

241
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:52,376
Did you ever consider

242
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:56,310
that she might have plans and not be at home?

243
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,403
But why isn't she in this home?

244
00:16:58,403 --> 00:17:01,377
I wish my dad would stop treating me like an idiot!

245
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:07,235
I hate him!

246
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:10,834
Life can't always be perfect.

247
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:14,300
This is something I only learned after becoming a father.

248
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,993
- Does it still hurt?
- No, it doesn't anymore.

249
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:19,469
Do you want to stand up and move around?

250
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:23,428
You've made me into a warrior in life.

251
00:17:23,428 --> 00:17:25,452
Despite the wounds along the way,

252
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:27,586
these healing scars have become

253
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:31,118
the medals of my fatherhood.

254
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:33,735
I specifically learned a few dishes from Ms. Shu Man

255
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:34,761
to cook for you.

256
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:36,799
They're all your favorites.

257
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:40,494
I'm really happy that you were born to be my son.

258
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:46,042
Son, I don't think you're an idiot!

259
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,867
You're better than me!

260
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,502
You're more handsome than me!

261
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:54,059
I hope you live more freely and happier than I do!

262
00:17:54,059 --> 00:18:00,462
I love you!

263
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:02,551
Thank you.

264
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:21,799
There's no need for thanks among family.

265
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:37,461
He's still sleeping in.

266
00:18:37,461 --> 00:18:40,143
Are you okay for tonight?

267
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:43,377
Okay, I'll get everything ready

268
00:18:43,377 --> 00:18:45,476
and head over to your place later.

269
00:18:45,476 --> 00:18:47,759
Okay.

270
00:19:30,311 --> 00:19:32,718
This isn't mine.

271
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:45,551
Welcome.

272
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:49,092
Miss, is there anything I can help you with?

273
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:51,643
My friend gave me this before.

274
00:19:51,643 --> 00:19:53,026
I'd like to buy it as a gift.

275
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,621
Can you tell me more about it?

276
00:19:54,621 --> 00:19:55,900
Miss, you really know your stuff.

277
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,535
I highly recommend this, too.

278
00:19:57,535 --> 00:20:00,011
It's perfect for anyone.

279
00:20:00,011 --> 00:20:03,318
It has a new 7 plus 2 formula with 9 ingredients.

280
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:06,059
Apart from the easily absorbed small molecule collagen,

281
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:07,867
it also contains vitamin C,

282
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:10,351
newly added probiotics, and iron.

283
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:13,017
Plus, it has no unusual scent at all.

284
00:20:13,017 --> 00:20:16,226
Most importantly, it's small and easy to swallow.

285
00:20:16,226 --> 00:20:17,735
Small and easy to swallow?

286
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:19,933
Giving two bottles shows more sincerity.

287
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:21,250
All right. Thank you.

288
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,009
You're welcome.

289
00:20:26,577 --> 00:20:30,026
- Hai Nuo.
- Hey, let's sit over there.

290
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:31,834
Just two coffees, right?

291
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:33,999
I'll also have two egg buns.

292
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,426
All right. Please wait a moment.

293
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:37,568
Thank you.

294
00:20:37,568 --> 00:20:39,309
Right.

295
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:40,459
This is for you.

296
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:42,092
A gift?

297
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:43,999
Isn't that a bit too much?

298
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:46,819
Cai Zhen gave this to me when she went to Taipei.

299
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:49,586
Now that you're going to Taipei, I'll give you the same.

300
00:20:49,586 --> 00:20:51,384
I've heard about this product.

301
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,509
It provides nine nutrients all at once,

302
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:56,217
including easy-to-absorb collagen

303
00:20:56,217 --> 00:20:59,042
and a lot of vitamin C,

304
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:02,377
as well as newly added probiotics and iron.

305
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:05,243
Plus, it's small and easy to swallow.

306
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:07,494
I bet you'll be really busy in Taipei,

307
00:21:07,494 --> 00:21:09,469
so you can take this to keep yourself nourished.

308
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,794
Thanks for your concern.

309
00:21:11,794 --> 00:21:13,634
You're welcome.

310
00:21:14,794 --> 00:21:17,209
- Here it is.
- Here's your food.

311
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,718
Thank you.

312
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:08,801
Why did she take that bag of men's clothes

313
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:11,092
to Xu Man's studio?

314
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26,059
This is how men should be.

315
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:27,967
He's more handsome than you.

316
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:29,834
I can't compare to him.

317
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:32,125
I'm practically falling for him.

318
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,419
You're exaggerating.

319
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,268
I never thought Zhi Ting could be like this.

320
00:22:37,268 --> 00:22:38,761
I'm happy for her.

321
00:22:38,761 --> 00:22:40,966
I truly hope she's happy.

322
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:42,660
Let's go grab some food.

323
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,925
We'll give her some space.

324
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:50,925
Shun Hua is calling me.

325
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,167
- Hello, Shun Hua.
- Hello.

326
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,553
Da Wu.

327
00:22:58,553 --> 00:23:00,528
I've developed some new dishes.

328
00:23:00,528 --> 00:23:02,318
Do you want to come and try them?

329
00:23:02,318 --> 00:23:04,461
I can't leave right now.

330
00:23:04,461 --> 00:23:06,426
You can't leave?

331
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:11,335
You're not drunk at Xu Man's studio, are you?

332
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:12,669
Of course not.

333
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:13,720
I'm at home.

334
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,799
You're at home?

335
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:19,217
Okay. Forget it then.

336
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,518
He almost found out.

337
00:23:23,518 --> 00:23:24,645
That was close.

338
00:23:24,645 --> 00:23:26,759
Let's go.

339
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:30,368
That was scary.

340
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,092
Yes.

341
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:38,309
You all helped Zhi Ting cover for him

342
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:40,799
and let that guy make a fool of me?

343
00:23:42,494 --> 00:23:44,592
I don't care who you are.

344
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:48,175
I'm going to make you pay today.

345
00:24:36,544 --> 00:24:38,210
Zhi Ting?

346
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,634
Shun Hua?

347
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:56,243
Shun Hua.

348
00:24:56,243 --> 00:24:59,009
Zhi Ting has made a video for you.

349
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:04,026
It's a gift for the 8th anniversary of knowing you.

350
00:25:04,026 --> 00:25:06,561
It was supposed to be a surprise.

351
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:08,720
Anyway, the video is basically

352
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,050
what Zhi Ting wants to say to you.

353
00:25:13,276 --> 00:25:15,403
Wait, no.

354
00:25:15,403 --> 00:25:18,800
It's actually what Shun Hua wants to say to you.

355
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:22,685
Well, two Shun Huas?

356
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:23,693
How do I put this?

357
00:25:23,693 --> 00:25:28,860
Those are the words Fang Shun Hua wants to say to Ye Zhi Ting.

358
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,867
Right, Fang Shun Hua to Ye Zhi Ting.

359
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:34,893
Words I want to say to you?

360
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:36,551
This is actually a bit complicated.

361
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:40,925
Never mind, you'll get it once you watch the video.

362
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,259
I, Fang Shun Hua, am very happy.

363
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:55,999
Eight years ago today,

364
00:25:55,999 --> 00:26:01,259
I met a very ordinary girl, Ye Zhi Ting.

365
00:26:01,966 --> 00:26:03,551
She was being bullied.

366
00:26:03,551 --> 00:26:06,799
I, Fang Shun Hua, heroically saved her.

367
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:10,125
Even though I ended up in the hospital,

368
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,918
I never regretted it.

369
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:14,768
I had no complaints.

370
00:26:14,768 --> 00:26:17,068
I, Fang Shun Hua, may seem ordinary,

371
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:19,925
but deep down, I'm a solid, dependable guy.

372
00:26:21,368 --> 00:26:23,327
Ye Zhi Ting.

373
00:26:23,327 --> 00:26:26,768
You left me and went to Taipei.

374
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:32,184
I could have ignored you or never forgiven you.

375
00:26:32,184 --> 00:26:36,592
However, I'm just that amazing and kind.

376
00:26:38,476 --> 00:26:43,335
Ye Zhi Ting, you'd better watch yourself from now on.

377
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,193
Because if I ever leave you,

378
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:47,592
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

379
00:26:52,384 --> 00:26:54,050
So...

380
00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:57,077
that day in the bathroom,

381
00:26:57,077 --> 00:26:59,967
you weren't talking to another man.

382
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:04,999
So, I'm not an expired product to you.

383
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:07,687
I'm not getting thrown away.

384
00:27:07,687 --> 00:27:11,360
She was probably just practicing that day.

385
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,110
Fang Shun Hua.

386
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,494
I want to be your hand cream.

387
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:19,017
Even if your skin is cracked,

388
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:20,943
even if you grow old,

389
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:23,259
I'll always be there.

390
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:30,900
The past is like expired nail polish.

391
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,092
It dries out and goes bad.

392
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,426
What needs to be thrown away should be thrown away.

393
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:41,384
I won't hold on to it.

394
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:45,634
I only care about our future.

395
00:27:47,728 --> 00:27:51,217
Fang Shun Hua, I love you.

396
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:54,461
This feels a bit too cheesy.

397
00:27:54,461 --> 00:27:57,654
I'll go remove my makeup.

398
00:27:57,654 --> 00:27:58,999
Wait.

399
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:00,568
You've already done your makeup

400
00:28:00,568 --> 00:28:02,059
and the lead is here.

401
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:04,110
Isn't there still a part left to record?

402
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,900
Why don't you do it live?

403
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,094
Zhi Ting, you can do it.

404
00:28:09,094 --> 00:28:11,467
- Go for it.
- You can do it.

405
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:25,868
I used to say you smelled like fish

406
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:28,799
and dressed like a thug.

407
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:32,603
I said you weren't gentle or considerate enough.

408
00:28:32,603 --> 00:28:35,495
You weren't attentive enough.

409
00:28:35,495 --> 00:28:38,883
I pointed out so many of your flaws.

410
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,801
Maybe when life is too comfortable,

411
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:48,426
people tend to lose themselves and become greedy.

412
00:28:53,235 --> 00:28:55,092
I forgot

413
00:28:57,744 --> 00:28:59,735
during my toughest times,

414
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:02,634
you were the one who helped me up.

415
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:06,344
No matter what happened,

416
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,009
you stood by me,

417
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:11,509
shared my burdens, and always worried about me.

418
00:29:13,537 --> 00:29:16,302
Someone said that loving someone

419
00:29:16,302 --> 00:29:19,217
means becoming like them.

420
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:23,134
So, from now on, I want to smell like fish, too.

421
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:26,834
I don't want to just be in the front.

422
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:29,551
I want to join you in the kitchen.

423
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:34,759
And most importantly...

424
00:29:35,768 --> 00:29:37,768
Zhi Ting, you can do it.

425
00:29:37,768 --> 00:29:39,925
Come on. You can do it.

426
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,799
Will you marry me?

427
00:30:01,577 --> 00:30:04,384
I'll run the restaurant well.

428
00:30:05,202 --> 00:30:07,300
I'll take care of you.

429
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:10,083
Wait.

430
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:15,092
Are you just imitating me or are you seriously asking?

431
00:30:19,395 --> 00:30:21,799
Will you?

432
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,799
Yes, I do.

433
00:30:34,627 --> 00:30:37,800
I do.

434
00:30:39,943 --> 00:30:42,967
I want to attend the wedding!

435
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,500
Congratulations!

436
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,384
Time to drink! Let's celebrate!

437
00:31:21,584 --> 00:31:24,627
- It smells so good.
- Dad.

438
00:31:24,627 --> 00:31:26,702
- Instant noodles?
- Yes, do you want some?

439
00:31:26,702 --> 00:31:28,768
I haven't had it in a long time. Give me some.

440
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,334
- Instant noodles?
- Yes.

441
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:32,834
Braised pork flavor, right?

442
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:36,184
- Do you want some?
- Sure.

443
00:31:36,184 --> 00:31:37,561
I'll make one for each of you.

444
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:38,577
- Okay.
- Okay.

445
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:40,426
Give me a minute.

446
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:45,083
Dad, Mom.

447
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:47,309
I have something to tell you.

448
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:50,092
Zhi Ting proposed to Shun Hua.

449
00:31:50,092 --> 00:31:51,382
- Really?
- Yes.

450
00:31:51,382 --> 00:31:52,514
That's great.

451
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:54,794
You know, the happiest thing for me as the village chief

452
00:31:54,794 --> 00:31:57,634
is hearing about happy events in our neighborhood.

453
00:31:58,368 --> 00:32:00,834
That's wonderful.

454
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:04,842
I wonder when it'll be our turn to host a wedding.

455
00:32:09,544 --> 00:32:11,645
Dad, Mom, listen.

456
00:32:11,645 --> 00:32:13,720
Hai Nuo and I are good friends now.

457
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,419
I've done my best, so I have no regrets.

458
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:18,711
I'll live a better life in the future.

459
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:21,151
So, please don't worry about me.

460
00:32:21,151 --> 00:32:23,799
Have faith in me, okay?

461
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:28,834
Dad.

462
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:29,999
This isn't your fault.

463
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:32,999
Are you blaming yourself again?

464
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:36,176
I'm not. Why would I blame myself?

465
00:32:36,176 --> 00:32:38,327
I've wanted to tell you both for a while,

466
00:32:38,327 --> 00:32:41,009
but seeing how much you expect from me,

467
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:44,042
I didn't know how to say it.

468
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:46,711
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

469
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:49,368
We shouldn't force things.

470
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:51,645
Let everything happen naturally.

471
00:32:51,645 --> 00:32:52,660
Okay.

472
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,134
As your parents,

473
00:32:54,134 --> 00:32:55,999
we'll always support you unconditionally.

474
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:59,217
We hope to always be on your side.

475
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:01,925
Thank you, Mom.

476
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:04,867
It's just one failed confession.

477
00:33:04,867 --> 00:33:06,577
It's not the end of the world.

478
00:33:06,577 --> 00:33:09,143
There are so many great things waiting for me.

479
00:33:09,143 --> 00:33:11,867
- Exactly.
- Just like this bowl of instant noodles.

480
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:13,678
It has been waiting for me to eat it.

481
00:33:13,678 --> 00:33:15,868
Good. That's the right attitude.

482
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,017
Let's eat.

483
00:33:17,017 --> 00:33:18,050
Let's dig in.

484
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,799
Okay.

485
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:24,285
This is the authentic flavor. Nice.

486
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:26,452
- It smells great.
- It smells good.

487
00:33:26,452 --> 00:33:29,842
After so many years, this taste is still great.

488
00:33:33,151 --> 00:33:35,592
It brings back memories.

489
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:39,976
Drink the soup.

490
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,092
It's delicious.

491
00:33:43,434 --> 00:33:45,551
It smells so good.

492
00:33:51,351 --> 00:33:52,568
It's tasty.

493
00:33:52,568 --> 00:33:55,050
It tastes just like when we were younger.

494
00:34:03,151 --> 00:34:05,300
Grandma, I'm...

495
00:34:25,827 --> 00:34:27,551
Grandma.

496
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:39,800
Why are you sleeping here again?

497
00:34:47,678 --> 00:34:52,677
[Bai Yin Mo has made a comeback...]

498
00:36:31,553 --> 00:36:34,603
This is the village chief speaking.

499
00:36:34,603 --> 00:36:38,645
Good morning, everyone.

500
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:42,377
Today, Dr. Chen Da Wu

501
00:36:42,377 --> 00:36:46,867
and our artist, Ms. Xu Man,

502
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:50,801
will join forces to hold a community health check

503
00:36:50,801 --> 00:36:54,235
and art workshop.

504
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:58,318
We hope everyone will actively participate

505
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:00,768
and bring their elderly family members

506
00:37:00,768 --> 00:37:05,028
to take part in this event that promotes health.

507
00:37:05,028 --> 00:37:07,568
We're home.

508
00:37:07,568 --> 00:37:09,702
We're home, baby.

509
00:37:09,702 --> 00:37:11,943
I'll cook something delicious for you later.

510
00:37:11,943 --> 00:37:14,799
I mean, for your mom to eat.

511
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,834
Tang Mi, come down for a moment.

512
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:20,799
Okay.

513
00:37:22,594 --> 00:37:24,901
Master, I've replaced everything.

514
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:27,193
We need to order more light bulbs.

515
00:37:27,193 --> 00:37:30,577
We can also double-check all the supplies in a bit

516
00:37:30,577 --> 00:37:32,461
to see what else we need to restock.

517
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:33,967
Good idea.

518
00:37:33,967 --> 00:37:35,933
The new coffee beans.

519
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:39,259
Today, you can try doing everything alone.

520
00:37:40,627 --> 00:37:42,718
Okay.

521
00:38:03,002 --> 00:38:05,300
You look confident.

522
00:38:10,993 --> 00:38:12,925
It's not bad.

523
00:38:15,268 --> 00:38:17,900
But every time you make it, the taste...

524
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,976
It gets a little better than the last time.

525
00:38:20,976 --> 00:38:22,834
Dad, you're back!

526
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,834
- Yue Shan.
- I'll help you with that.

527
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:25,834
It's heavy. Be careful.

528
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:26,976
Grandma, Dad is home.

529
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:28,487
Mom.

530
00:38:28,487 --> 00:38:29,801
- Have a seat.
- It's hot.

531
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:32,676
- I got it.
- Be careful. Have a seat.

532
00:38:35,594 --> 00:38:36,867
Come on. Sit down.

533
00:38:36,867 --> 00:38:38,900
Sit down and eat.

534
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,259
You probably haven't had our seasonal oyster soup in ages.

535
00:38:41,259 --> 00:38:44,151
I picked these oysters this morning. Here.

536
00:38:44,151 --> 00:38:46,302
Thank you, Mom.

537
00:38:46,302 --> 00:38:48,153
- Have some pie.
- Okay.

538
00:38:48,153 --> 00:38:50,461
Savory and sweet ones.

539
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,151
All right. Thank you.

540
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:53,176
There are sweet ones, too.

541
00:38:53,176 --> 00:38:55,191
Okay, thank you.

542
00:38:55,191 --> 00:38:56,685
Have some egg pancakes, too.

543
00:38:56,685 --> 00:38:57,999
That's too much.

544
00:38:57,999 --> 00:39:00,342
- Let's eat.
- Eat slowly.

545
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:08,984
There's an extra dish today.

546
00:39:08,984 --> 00:39:11,579
It's a treat from the guesthouse.

547
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,461
Is this fresh-caught?

548
00:39:13,461 --> 00:39:14,801
- Yes.
- Can I take a photo of it?

549
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:16,967
Sure.

550
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:18,693
Can you take a photo of us with it too?

551
00:39:18,693 --> 00:39:20,867
Sure.

552
00:39:20,867 --> 00:39:22,645
Okay, one, two, three.

553
00:39:22,645 --> 00:39:25,127
One more. One, two, three.

554
00:39:25,127 --> 00:39:28,834
I saw a cute grandma online, but I haven't seen her around.

555
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:30,799
She went on a trip.

556
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:33,799
Let me see.

557
00:39:34,695 --> 00:39:38,428
Hai Nuo, I heard there's a great art studio nearby.

558
00:39:38,428 --> 00:39:40,520
As art students, we'd like to take a look at the artworks.

559
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,153
I heard they serve cocktails there, too.

560
00:39:42,153 --> 00:39:43,976
Do you know where it is?

561
00:39:43,976 --> 00:39:45,368
That's Xu Man's studio.

562
00:39:45,368 --> 00:39:46,621
I'll give you the address later.

563
00:39:46,621 --> 00:39:48,077
Can you take us there?

564
00:39:48,077 --> 00:39:49,077
I have things to do later.

565
00:39:49,077 --> 00:39:50,143
I can call a car for you.

566
00:39:50,143 --> 00:39:52,017
Please take us there.

567
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:54,842
You're familiar with the place. Just take us there.

568
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,509
All right. I'll arrange it.

569
00:39:59,966 --> 00:40:01,900
Granny.

570
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,083
I'll jot that down for you.

571
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,360
Dr. Chen can check it for you in a bit.

572
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,134
Yan Ting.

573
00:40:06,134 --> 00:40:07,125
Come here

574
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:08,799
All right.

575
00:40:09,636 --> 00:40:11,601
When you draw blood from the elderly later,

576
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:13,059
be gentle, okay?

577
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:14,801
Make sure they don't feel any discomfort.

578
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:16,711
Don't worry. Their veins are finer.

579
00:40:16,711 --> 00:40:19,009
I'll use the thinnest needle.

580
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:28,276
Xu Man, this painting is so unique.

581
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:31,800
I'm really curious about your creative inspiration at the time.

582
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:36,834
At the time, I just wanted to break free from the past

583
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,342
to give myself a fresh start.

584
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:43,842
All right.

585
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:46,702
What about this one?

586
00:40:46,702 --> 00:40:49,794
Was it because you were feeling sleepy?

587
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:53,175
That was the artist's intention.

588
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,786
I was just joking.

589
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,753
Seriously? You were just sleepy?

590
00:40:57,753 --> 00:40:59,050
It wasn't me.

591
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,009
It was your son.

592
00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:03,883
Da Wu?

593
00:41:05,761 --> 00:41:07,285
He stayed the night with you?

594
00:41:07,285 --> 00:41:08,900
No.

595
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,900
Don't get the wrong idea.

596
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,627
Miss, this part isn't...

597
00:41:12,627 --> 00:41:14,676
Okay. Coming.

598
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,799
Mom, stop saying random things.

599
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:25,509
A fresh start.

600
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,368
We're here.

601
00:41:34,368 --> 00:41:36,634
Just tell them you're my guests.

602
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,735
I have other things to do.

603
00:41:39,735 --> 00:41:41,134
Let me know when you're done.

604
00:41:41,134 --> 00:41:42,677
- I'll come pick you guys up.
- Okay.

605
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:44,634
Bye-bye.

606
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:06,050
You Cai.

607
00:42:07,184 --> 00:42:09,419
What are you doing?

608
00:42:09,419 --> 00:42:10,867
Jing Liang's birthday is coming up.

609
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:13,327
He said he wants to celebrate it in Kinmen this year.

610
00:42:13,327 --> 00:42:15,702
I'll prepare some of his favorite kimchi first.

611
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,603
You must be so happy you can't even sleep, right?

612
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:21,245
Well, his mom told me that back in Taipei,

613
00:42:21,245 --> 00:42:23,452
he once cried and begged to come back to Kinmen.

614
00:42:23,452 --> 00:42:25,900
Can you imagine how satisfying it felt to hear that?

615
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,669
Your male ego must be feeling pretty great.

616
00:42:28,669 --> 00:42:31,318
His mom also mentioned that while he's there,

617
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:32,544
he wouldn't tell her anything.

618
00:42:32,544 --> 00:42:34,443
No matter how much she asked, she couldn't get anything out of him.

619
00:42:34,443 --> 00:42:35,586
He just kept sulking all day.

620
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,900
Eventually, she called me for help.

621
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,292
Isn't that funny?

622
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:40,384
Did you give her any advice?

623
00:42:40,384 --> 00:42:41,643
Of course.

624
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,834
I told her everything about what Jing Liang likes to eat,

625
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:47,652
the music he enjoys, and the games he loves to play.

626
00:42:47,652 --> 00:42:49,042
Guess what my ex-wife said?

627
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:51,502
She said she felt really discouraged.

628
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:52,918
Discouraged?

629
00:42:52,918 --> 00:42:54,763
Was she not in awe of you?

630
00:42:54,763 --> 00:42:57,050
I don't need her admiration anymore.

631
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,401
You just want Jing Liang to be happy in Taipei, right?

632
00:42:59,401 --> 00:43:01,834
Yes, that's my only wish.

633
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:04,720
By the way, you're here for the coffee, right?

634
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,925
- Yes.
- Here.

635
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,687
You Cai.

636
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,335
Last year, when you let your ex-wife take Jing Liang away,

637
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:14,827
we were all really surprised.

638
00:43:14,827 --> 00:43:17,594
When Jing Liang decided to go with his mom to Taipei,

639
00:43:17,594 --> 00:43:20,327
I felt abandoned.

640
00:43:20,327 --> 00:43:23,603
That was more painful than signing the divorce papers.

641
00:43:23,603 --> 00:43:26,050
Why didn't you tell us?

642
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,158
Pride, I guess.

643
00:43:27,158 --> 00:43:30,092
I didn't want to bother anyone with my problems.

644
00:43:30,966 --> 00:43:34,151
What made you change your mind?

645
00:43:34,151 --> 00:43:35,461
At that time,

646
00:43:35,461 --> 00:43:38,101
I met someone who was also going through a tough time.

647
00:43:38,101 --> 00:43:39,933
His situation was similar to mine.

648
00:43:39,933 --> 00:43:43,300
But he chose to set his loved one free.

649
00:43:44,753 --> 00:43:48,504
That really struck a chord with me.

650
00:43:48,504 --> 00:43:51,643
So, I figured if I really love Jing Liang,

651
00:43:51,643 --> 00:43:53,799
I should learn to let go.
