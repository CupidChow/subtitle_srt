1
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,146
The 35th GFA Awards Ceremony is about to begin

2
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:16,516
we can see that many reporters and spectators have gathered.

3
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,751
They are all looking forward to

4
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,886
the entrance of shortlisted actors.

5
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,921
Why didn't Bai Yin Mo come with you?

6
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,423
Is it true that he got mad on set?

7
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,624
Didn't he plan to show up today?

8
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,259
Is he not confident about winning the award?

9
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,039
- It's Bai Yin Mo.
- This movie was shortlisted for the Popularity Award.

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,706
I'm looking forward to this.

11
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,012
Bai Yin Mo is so handsome.

12
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,314
When does this movie comes out?

13
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,311
So, how does it feel to be nominated for "Best Newcomer"?

14
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,514
Honestly, I never thought I'd be standing here

15
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,949
and I want to thank the judges.

16
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,558
Is Yin Mo not here yet?

17
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,326
I've been calling, but he's not picking up.

18
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,357
Yin Mo.

19
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,827
Happy Birthday.

20
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,134
It's been a while. You moved without saying a word.

21
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,539
I had no idea you've become so frugal.

22
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,640
You aren't living in the mansion I gave you

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,643
and you came to live in a place like this instead?

24
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,145
Didn't I send you money?

25
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,966
Stop sending me money.

26
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,948
I have a stable job now.

27
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:31,217
You finally have a stable job!

28
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,786
After Dad passed away, all you ever did was tell me to go out and make money...

29
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,088
Where did all the money go?

30
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,389
Where's your boyfriend?

31
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,094
Today is the last time I'm seeing you.

32
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,129
From now on,

33
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,297
my mom is dead!

34
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,837
Bai Yin Mo didn't show up.

35
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,972
Seems like something went wrong again.

36
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,785
Why didn't Bai Yin Mo come with you?

37
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,086
We just wrapped up filming.

38
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,221
He should be on his way.

39
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,922
In your recent collaboration,

40
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,624
the director is also a seasoned actor.

41
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:48,728
It's been said that Bai Yin Mo had a clash with the director on set.

42
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,563
It wasn't really a clash.

43
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,632
It was more like a heated discussion.

44
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,933
So, it was a clash? Right?

45
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,802
Sorry, the interview is over.

46
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,737
Sorry. Thank you, thank you.

47
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,172
Thanks, everyone. Thanks.

48
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:03,109
Reporters just want to stir things up. Think before you speak next time.

49
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,477
Excuse me, where's Yin Mo?

50
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,478
He's almost here.

51
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,600
Hello?

52
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,271
Now, let's turn our attention to a major headline

53
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,606
from the entertainment industry.

54
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,041
Famous actor Bai Yin Mo

55
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,077
was driving to the Golden Awards ceremony.

56
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,713
He is suspected to be emotionally unstable and speeding.

57
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:44,217
The entire incident was captured by witnesses.

58
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:48,954
Bai Yin Mo has been taken to the police station for questioning.

59
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,537
♫ Through the crowded, bustling streets ♫

60
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:08,408
♫ Who will I say goodnight to greet? ♫

61
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,810
♫ The vulnerability I long to embrace ♫

62
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,646
♫ Is buried deep inside ♫

63
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,383
♫ Under the moon's radiant glow, dreams surge and swell ♫

64
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,886
♫ Waiting for a reason to run wild ♫

65
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,954
♫ Can you walk with me for a while ♫

66
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:26,191
♫ Without a word to tell ♫

67
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,862
♫ Follow the neon lights into the night ♫

68
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:33,166
♫ I try to find you every night ♫

69
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:38,037
♫ What must I do to see through that distant line? ♫

70
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:42,942
♫ I want to feel the wind full force ♫

71
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:46,045
♫ My lonely soul begins to shake ♫

72
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:50,983
♫ What can we trust to forever endure? ♫

73
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:55,688
♫ I want to bring my freedom forth, and take your hand ♫

74
00:05:55,688 --> 00:06:01,160
♫ When the warmth finally seeps into every memory's corner ♫

75
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:09,501
♫ The past was never wrong, having us is enough forever ♫

76
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,304
These are huge!

77
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,200
Hey, Boss.

78
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,301
Still sleeping?

79
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,270
No, I'm on set.

80
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,105
Mi is filming today.

81
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,407
Where's the driver?

82
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,942
Hasn't Hai Nuo gone yet?

83
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,377
No way.

84
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,078
She's super responsible.

85
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,915
Do you want me to record it on set to prove it?

86
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,249
No, I...

87
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,518
I'll call Hai Nuo now.

88
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,571
Nuo Nuo.

89
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,943
Nuo Nuo.

90
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,144
Nuo Nuo.

91
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:05,517
Nuo Nuo.

92
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,488
Nuo Nuo.

93
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,456
Your phone ringing.

94
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,425
Okay, I'm coming.

95
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,240
What's wrong?

96
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,808
Xiao Guang called several times.

97
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,343
No idea what's so urgent.

98
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,444
Here we go again...

99
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,982
Hey, Hai Nuo, where are you?

100
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,751
Bai Yin Mo is already at the airport.

101
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,152
Right now?

102
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,721
Didn't you say he'd arrive tomorrow?

103
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,956
No, it's today!

104
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:47,693
Never mind, just hurry and pick him up at the airport.

105
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,996
He's waiting for you. Please... Please, right now.

106
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,031
Okay, got it.

107
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,099
All right, all right, bye.

108
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,133
What's wrong?

109
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,868
The superstar who booked the whole place has already arrived.

110
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,936
I'm going to the airport to pick him up now.

111
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,037
What about the lunch?

112
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:58,905
We don't have any ingredients.

113
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,140
I'll take him to Xin Da Temple for lunch.

114
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,041
Okay, okay.

115
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,385
Dude, what are you doing?

116
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,056
Wait.

117
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,858
Excuse me, are you Bai Yin Mo?

118
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:57,830
Yo yo, dude. That's the guy we've been talking about all day.

119
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,368
I'm a huge fan, Mr. Bai. What are you doing here?

120
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:06,072
I never thought I'd see him in my life.

121
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,374
I don't think he understands English.

122
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:13,412
I really like your performance in "Day of Slaughter".

123
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:17,116
"I'm not killing you today because you're not worth it."

124
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,118
Come on, next line.

125
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,120
Come on, say it!

126
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:28,427
You're only fit to be slowly tortured to death by me.

127
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,662
Oh my God.

128
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,434
- Where are you going? We'll give you a ride.
- I have a driver.

129
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,569
Bai Yin Mo.

130
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,673
Bai Yin Mo! Mr. Bai Yin Mo!

131
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,774
Bai Yin Mo.

132
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,849
Hello, Mr. Bai Yin Mo.

133
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,950
Welcome to Kinmen.

134
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,463
Hey.

135
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,070
Mr. Bai, my name is Li Hai Nuo.

136
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,204
I run the guesthouse.

137
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,873
If you have any questions, just ask me.

138
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,415
- Is your car a port a-potty?
- Porta-potty?

139
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,616
Do you need to use the toilet?

140
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,117
I can take you to a gas station.

141
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,252
It stinks.

142
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,887
Stinks?

143
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,823
I'm already wearing jacket. Are you talking about the car?

144
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,324
Sorry, you arrived a day early.

145
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,060
I didn't have time to arrange a car.

146
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,428
I just came back from collecting oysters.

147
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,296
And didn't even have time to make deliveries before coming here.

148
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:40,398
That's rich, I came right on time.

149
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,469
On time.

150
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,247
Mr. Bai, you're staying in Kinmen for two weeks.

151
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,483
If you need anything...

152
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,285
Just let me know, like...

153
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,254
Just give me a clock.

154
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,623
All right, a clock.

155
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,196
I heard it's your first time in Kinmen.

156
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,431
So, the place we're going to is Sea Breeze Village.

157
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:16,936
- I'll give you a special introduction.
- Is the green light here just for awkward small talk?

158
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,371
Awkward small talk?

159
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,440
Mr. Bai, you sure like to speak in circles.

160
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,775
Then why don't you drive straight ahead!?

161
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,718
We're here.

162
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,700
What are you doing?

163
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,437
I'm delivering... No, we're having a meal here today

164
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,471
and delivering goods at the same time.

165
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:04,182
Come on, superstar. After you.

166
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,685
Grandma.

167
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,387
As long as that superstar comes here,

168
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,122
takes some pics, and posts them online.

169
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,291
Then this place will become a check-in hotspot.

170
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,628
In the future, we'll be swamped just hosting his fans.

171
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,230
Sea Breeze Village is about to hit it big.

172
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,941
This is the most popular and famous restaurant in Kinmen.

173
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,011
Do you want me to take a photo for you?

174
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,513
For me? For you guys, not me.

175
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,915
All right, let's talk about the budget.

176
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,053
Don't worry. This meal is on the guesthouse.

177
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,322
All the fresh ingredients are within the budget.

178
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,657
We guarantee you'll be satisfied

179
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,326
I meant, this will involve my image rights.

180
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,828
It's for commercial use.

181
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,529
The budget might be a bit high.

182
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,664
Is it okay with you?

183
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,636
Then forget the photos, let's eat.

184
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,373
Charging a fee just to take a photo...

185
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,576
Checking in with photos is normal. Influencers do it all the time.

186
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,978
Superstar sure have a lot of demands...

187
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,646
Shun Hua, Zhi Ting.

188
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,948
We have guests.

189
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,219
Hai Nuo.

190
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,286
Just a second.

191
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,892
What's wrong?

192
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,695
I can't leave right now, the bathroom door is broken.

193
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,030
Zhi Ting is stuck inside, and I can't find a locksmith.

194
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,199
I have to handle it myself.

195
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,634
I've been telling you.

196
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,437
The door lock was broken, and I told you to fix it,

197
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,673
but you keep putting it off.

198
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,108
It used to open with just a twist.

199
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:40,880
It wasn't that badly broken! I said I would handle it!

200
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,282
All right, you guys stay busy, I'll take care of it.

201
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,589
Everything is okay, just hold on.

202
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,201
Have a seat.

203
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,274
Was that necessary?

204
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:29,054
Looks like you spent your budget on oil and salt.

205
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,756
Eating too much oil makes you fat.

206
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,591
Eating too much salt causes bloating.

207
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,294
Are you trying to send your guests to dialysis?

208
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,797
I need something light, please.

209
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,402
All right, something light.

210
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,570
Coming right up.

211
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,213
The superstar wants something light.

212
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:58,283
Guess I'll have to bring out my signature dish.

213
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,097
Here!

214
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,932
It's light, right?

215
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,868
It's called sand worms.

216
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,636
They live in sandy beach holes by the sea.

217
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,471
They're very hard to dig up and rare.

218
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,808
Mr. Bai, you're really lucky today

219
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,477
I don't eat worms.

220
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,645
It doesn't look like a worm.

221
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,680
It looks like mushrooms.

222
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,316
What did you said this dish is called?

223
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,153
- Sand worms.
- I don't eat worms.

224
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,487
Then it's not a worm.

225
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,555
Take it away.

226
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,895
All right, I'll have to spare no expense

227
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,864
and bring out my secret weapon.

228
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,301
I'm counting on you.

229
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,135
Here.

230
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,907
It's called Buddha's Hand. It might look ugly,

231
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,375
but it's delicious.

232
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,746
Have you ever seen a Buddha with hands like this?

233
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,849
It's called Buddha's Hand, but its scientific name is goose neck barnacle.

234
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,251
I don't eat protected species.

235
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,753
It's actually not a protected species.

236
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,621
It's type of crustacean.

237
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:14,059
And, Mr. Bai, we specially boiled it for you.

238
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,194
Very light.

239
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,262
And it's a very rare dish.

240
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,231
It doesn't look light.

241
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,399
Take it away.

242
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,072
All right.

243
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,644
Can't even tell protected species from crustaceans.

244
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,880
Talking about Buddha's Hand?

245
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,181
That really ticks me off.

246
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,151
Fine, starve then!

247
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,620
That superstar might be difficult to get along with.

248
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,991
Even if I have to choke myself, I'll hold it in.

249
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,660
But you don't have to choke yourself.

250
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,597
All right, I won't choke myself, I'll just smile.

251
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,199
Smile until it creeps him out.

252
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,810
Mr. Bai, you didn't eat anything earlier.

253
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,278
You must be hungry, right?

254
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,118
Phone.

255
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,286
Hello?

256
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,621
Hai Nuo.

257
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,323
Has Bai Yin Mo arrived?

258
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,662
Yeah.

259
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,830
Then, then, then...

260
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,168
Can you bring him over to Uncle You Tsai's place?

261
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,269
I can do that.

262
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,071
Thank you, Hai Nuo.

263
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,740
You're my favorite! I'll wait for you!

264
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,476
I mean, I can ask him for you.

265
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:41,914
He's coming, he's coming.

266
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,650
Today is my day.

267
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,552
Hello? Hello?

268
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,293
Mr. Bai you heard all that, right?

269
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,594
I didn't hear anything.

270
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,265
Well... That girl just now...

271
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,201
She's your biggest fan.

272
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:06,304
You're the only person she idolizes, so...

273
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,342
Mr. Bai, you're hungry right?

274
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,577
There's some food over there.

275
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,311
Do you want to go?

276
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,978
- Please come in.
- Welcome, welcome.

277
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,379
Welcome to AKIO.

278
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,047
Please, come in, come in.

279
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,282
Hello。

280
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,417
I'm the leader of the Bai Yin Mo Fan Club of Kinmen.

281
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,752
I'm Wang Yue Shan.

282
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,320
Can I have your autograph?

283
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,690
This little kid really likes you.

284
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,192
You're really popular.

285
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,727
I've like you for a long time.

286
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,029
Please, this way.

287
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,163
Thank you.

288
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,932
Now that you're in Kinmen, if you want to drink some coffee,

289
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,166
you should definitely come to my place.

290
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,203
I roast all the beans myself.

291
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,938
Does that make me an OG fan or what? Right?

292
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,140
And also, one special thing about this place is...

293
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,241
I'm really knowledgeable

294
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,977
about the history and culture of Kinmen.

295
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:21,346
I offer guided tours for guests.

296
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,682
You're not quite like your character, huh?

297
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,685
Go pour a glass of water for the guest!

298
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,888
The space upstairs is more open, and the lighting is better, too.

299
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,089
I know you're an artist, right?

300
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,958
Don't just see me as a café owner.

301
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,493
Actually, I'm also an artist.

302
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,895
It's just that we express ourselves differently.

303
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,230
I enjoy writing in my spare time.

304
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,364
This is a book I wrote.

305
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,099
I want to give it to you since it's our first meeting.

306
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,635
Don't you think you're talking a bit too much?

307
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,803
Go get yourself a glass of water.

308
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,672
I'm here to eat, thank you.

309
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,414
- You Tsai...
- It's okay, it's okay

310
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,882
I'll go get a glass of water.

311
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:13,465
Mr. Bai, people from Kinmen are just a bit more enthusiastic.

312
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,568
But your tone just now was slightly impolite, don't you think?

313
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,904
I've already patiently let him finish speaking.

314
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,806
Is that not polite enough?

315
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,179
Uncle You Tsai was just trying to be nice.

316
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,481
- He just wanted you to understand...
- I'm here to eat, not to make friends.

317
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,585
Menu, please.

318
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,956
Sure, just a moment.

319
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,512
The guesthouse is right next door.

320
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,649
Grab my luggage.

321
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,735
Why can't I seem to remember...?

322
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,537
Is there something you need?

323
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:29,441
I've been trying to remember, but I've forgotten again.

324
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:32,277
Forgotten how to get home?

325
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,779
The owner of the guesthouse is right behind you.

326
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,082
Go inside and make a call to ask your family to pick you up.

327
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,817
Grandma, why are you standing here?

328
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,487
This is Hong Xiao Guang's boss, Bai Yin Mo.

329
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:43,822
He's our guest.

330
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,191
Yes, yes. Bai Yin Mo.

331
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,193
Oh dear, I tried to remember but still forgot.

332
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,662
Mr. Bai, welcome to our guesthouse.

333
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,331
- Please come in.
- Why are you just standing here for no reason?!

334
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,399
Want me to help you?

335
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,668
No need, you lead the way.

336
00:23:56,668 --> 00:24:00,071
Mr. Bai, your room is on the second floor of the back building.

337
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,072
Can you show me the way?

338
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,275
I'll lead the way, I'll lead the way.

339
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,276
This way, please.

340
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,343
What's so heavy?

341
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,612
Take care of yourself.

342
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,385
Yin Mo, I know that in the past two years,

343
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:51,122
you've been doing projects you don't really enjoy.

344
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,825
You've made quite a lot money for the company.

345
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,861
But do you know how many endorsements you lost

346
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,729
because of that punch?

347
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,865
And how much the company has to pay in penalties?

348
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,608
You've had too many negative headlines lately.

349
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,376
I've arranged a reality show for you.

350
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:13,512
I know, I know.

351
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,947
You didn't like this type of show.

352
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:20,651
But this is the only way to restore your image.

353
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,926
Right now, the paparazzi in Taipei are keeping an eye on you.

354
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,328
The reality show is on an island.

355
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,898
Why don't you go experience it first,

356
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,967
then decide whether to accept it?

357
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,669
Just think of it as a vacation.

358
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,939
Go ahead and get there early to relax.

359
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,708
Get back to your best state.

360
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:01,058
Let me know when you're ready to leave.

361
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,176
Have you reach the guesthouse?

362
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,511
How's it over there?

363
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,454
It's great.

364
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:30,855
It's so quiet there.

365
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,457
You should be able to get some good sleep.

366
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,820
Today really wore me out.

367
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,190
Have some tea.

368
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,992
Hello? What's up Xiao Guang?

369
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,728
Hey, Hai Nuo, my boss wants to go to Kinmen.

370
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,730
He wants to book the entire guesthouse for two weeks.

371
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,398
Is that possible?

372
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,600
Your boss? Who?

373
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,002
That super star?

374
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:20,372
Yes, that super star, Bai Yin Mo.

375
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:23,308
Book the whole place for two weeks?

376
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:30,081
Let me think about it... I think we're fully booked.

377
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,850
Fully booked? No...

378
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,218
I can't trust anyone else.

379
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:34,386
You are the only person I can trust.

380
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,187
Hai Nuo, you have to help me.

381
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,123
Of course, I'll help you.

382
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,825
But the price to book the whole place...

383
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,926
That's not a problem.

384
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,195
Our budget is three times your usual rate.

385
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:48,732
But you must make sure to take very, very good care of him.

386
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:54,539
All right then, transfer the deposit to my account.

387
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,375
Xiao Guang, right? Let me talk to him.

388
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,077
Hey, Xiao Guang.

389
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,612
It's your uncle.

390
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,147
Uncle.

391
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,181
You...

392
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,150
You're finally bringing that super star over.

393
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,685
He wants to book the whole place

394
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,686
I'll tell you this,

395
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,088
make sure to tell Hai Nuo later.

396
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,856
He's arriving tomorrow.

397
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,192
The day after tomorrow? Okay.

398
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:18,596
I'll make sure everyone comes out to warmly welcome him.

399
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,236
Dear villagers!

400
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:34,706
This is Village Chief speaking.

401
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:39,544
A superstar has arrived in our Sea Breeze Village.

402
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:45,183
Let's make sure to give him a warm welcome.

403
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:48,853
Let him leaves with a great impression.

404
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:54,659
That way, he'll bring more superstars to Sea Breeze Village.

405
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:59,230
Now, I'm going to play a beautiful song

406
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:04,168
to warmly welcome this superstar.

407
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,543
Zhi Ting, today's goods are super fresh!

408
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,645
I'll make some raw marinated crab for you tonight with sorghum liquor.

409
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,747
Sounds good!

410
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,916
Oh, I also want to eat some stir fried oysters.

411
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,618
Everyone, line up quickly. Quick!

412
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:25,190
Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four.

413
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,225
Hey, Tsai Jing Liang.

414
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,960
Your packed meal. Don't forget.

415
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,499
Take care.

416
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,511
Welcome back to "543".

417
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,946
I'm Shan.

418
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,414
In today's episode, I'm going to show you

419
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,849
what it's like to start a school day with me.

420
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,617
Grandma, I running late! I'm skipping breakfast!

421
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,085
The milk is ready.

422
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,420
Right, right, right

423
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,290
I forgot the hot milk I have to drink every morning.

424
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,358
Must you film yourself drinking milk?

425
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,759
Are you going to film yourself in the bathroom, too?

426
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,127
Slow down a bit.

427
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:04,229
You didn't finish it again!

428
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,397
Hey, your lunchbox, young lady!

429
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:07,565
I'm going to hide your phone.

430
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,033
Let's see if you'll be late.

431
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,634
Seriously...

432
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,213
Thank you.

433
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:27,752
How much for this, boss?

434
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,321
Just buy a bit more vegetables.

435
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,656
Grandma.

436
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,457
The clock!

437
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,431
290, this one's good.

438
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,566
This one? You sure? He's a man...

439
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,737
Nuo Nuo.

440
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,138
You told me yesterday...

441
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:51,376
That superstar was caught up in a lot of negative news recently.

442
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,177
He was heavily criticized.

443
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:54,745
Yeah.

444
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:58,983
So, he's probably here to rest.

445
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,351
Let's not ask too much,

446
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:03,855
just pretend we don't know everything.

447
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,223
I'm good at that.

448
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,625
Just like when Grandma sneaks money into my purse,

449
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,060
I always act like I don't know.

450
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,864
Act your age.

451
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,610
What's up?

452
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,391
Transfer it.

453
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,131
Good morning.

454
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:48,933
What happened to his face?

455
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:51,069
Got bitten by mosquitoes so badly.

456
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,236
There are mosquito coils in the drawer.

457
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,805
Why didn't you light one?

458
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,175
Mosquito coils... Why didn't you mention it?

459
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,578
You didn't ask.

460
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,550
Your clock.

461
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,424
A traditional Kinmen breakfast,

462
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,893
specially prepared for you.

463
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,162
I don't eat this stuff.

464
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,630
Then what do you eat?

465
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,367
Broccoli, boiled egg, black coffee.

466
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,435
And I'm currently doing the "168" intermittent fasting

467
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,870
I have my own eating routine.

468
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,205
Please don't make decisions for me.

469
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,674
Didn't Hong Xiao Guang tell you?

470
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,675
No, he didn't.

471
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,709
Besides, I asked you in the car yesterday

472
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:35,213
if you had any specific dietary requirements.

473
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:38,282
You didn't mention anything special.

474
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:39,584
Skipping breakfast leaves you with no energy.

475
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,018
Let me make you something else.

476
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,319
No need. I didn't sleep at all last night,

477
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,754
and I'm full of energy.

478
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,112
What's going on today?

479
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:17,288
Tsai Jing Liang!

480
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:20,424
Standing in the middle of the road is dangerous.

481
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,438
Let me tell you something.

482
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,174
Other people blindly worship idols,

483
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,643
but in my eyes, there are no superstars.

484
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,079
There only good people and bad people.

485
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,414
Even if you're a superstar, it's no big deal.

486
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,753
Jing Liang!

487
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,695
Why did you come to Kinmen?

488
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:02,165
For sightseeing.

489
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,169
You think I haven't seen the news?

490
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:09,574
A student like you, skipping school,

491
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,042
what are you doing here?

492
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,377
Doesn't your dad care about you?

493
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:18,883
My dad's so annoying, right?

494
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,785
Just like you.

495
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,087
Annoying like me?

496
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:26,924
Why do people here like to strike up conversations so much?

497
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,326
Can't you just be quiet for a moment?

498
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,733
Forget it

499
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,601
Mr. Bai.

500
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,605
What is it now?

501
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,310
I'm sorry I talked too much just now

502
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,478
and annoyed you.

503
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,048
I apologize.

504
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:54,384
If you don't want to be disturbed,

505
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:58,422
you can go rest over there.

506
00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:59,991
The breeze is nice and cool.

507
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,225
The view is also beautiful.

508
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,865
Go to class now.

509
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,023
Nuo Nuo, help Mr. Bai get the mosquito coil out.

510
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,418
Bitter melon again...

511
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,454
If you won't eat it, give it to me.

512
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,696
That's a lot.

513
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,904
Where did you go today?

514
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,640
Be careful, or you'll get a warning for being late.

515
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,311
I was thinking about my mom, so I went to Jiangong Island,

516
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,847
and then I ran into a bummer.

517
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,748
Who?

518
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,287
Just someone unimportant.

519
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,562
Hey, Mr. Bai.

520
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:53,497
The tide's in, and I'm stuck on this island.

521
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,266
Send a boat to pick me up.

522
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,768
The tide's in?

523
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,537
You're at Jiangong Island?

524
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,605
A boat?

525
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,641
You need to call the Coast Guard.

526
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,576
Then call the Coast Guard.

527
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,678
But that would be wasting public resources.

528
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,347
It wouldn't look good if it made the news.

529
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,449
Then find another boat.

530
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:14,985
All right, then. Enjoy the sea breeze for a bit.

531
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:19,824
Hold on, I'll see if there's a boat available to come get you.

532
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:24,027
Hurry up.

533
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,318
Thanks.

534
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:59,530
Have we met before?

535
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,032
Did we have some kind of disagreement?

536
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:05,002
Why do I feel like you're trying to drive me away?

537
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,271
Mr. Bai, there might be a misunderstanding.

538
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,006
Yesterday, she came to pick me up

539
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,509
in a stinky, beat-up car.

540
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,244
Then took me to some weird restaurant,

541
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,579
served me disgusting food,

542
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,681
and she's raising mosquitoes in my room.

543
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:18,682
And that brat just now,

544
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,384
you set that up too, didn't you?

545
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:23,354
Sending me to that awful place.

546
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,956
Mr. Bai, you're overthinking this.

547
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:29,093
I don't have the ability to plan all these things.

548
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,661
And raising mosquitoes in advance? Come on...

549
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:31,929
Exactly.

550
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:36,700
Everyone in Sea Breeze Village is happy to have you here.

551
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,868
Wait here for a moment.

552
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,108
Mr. Bai.

553
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,278
The mosquito coil is ready for you.

554
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:52,450
As for the car, I'm sorry it made you uncomfortable.

555
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,186
The restaurant genuinely wanted to welcome you.

556
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:58,222
The dishes they served are Kinmen specialties.

557
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,591
If all these arrangements didn't satisfy you,

558
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,560
I sincerely apologize.

559
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,429
We genuinely welcome you to be here.

560
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,070
Grandma prepared some porridge, which is milder.

561
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,772
Maybe you could try it.

562
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,673
No need.

563
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:21,445
Grandma!

564
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:24,114
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

565
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,449
How can you be fine?

566
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,518
Falling is the worst for old folks. Come on.

567
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,954
I'm sorry.

568
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,021
Here, let me help you.

569
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,156
I'll be fine after sitting down for a moment.

570
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,891
Come on.

571
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,227
Here, sit here for a moment.

572
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,862
I'll be fine after sitting down.

573
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:40,030
What's wrong with you?

574
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,165
What's wrong?

575
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,433
Don't you think you should apologize for hitting someone?

576
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,368
- I already did.
- When?

577
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:47,170
- I said it.
- When did you say it?

578
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,675
- It doesn't matter, I'm fine.
- That's not the point!

579
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,712
Please don't touch the guesthouse's equipment.

580
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,413
Don't touch the guesthouse's equipment!

581
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:59,482
Now, you can hear my apology!

582
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,452
I'll fix it now.

583
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,773
It's broken...

584
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,311
I'll buy a new one.

585
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,015
It's not just a tape.

586
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,651
Don't think money can solve everything.

587
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,719
Then how do you want to resolve this?

588
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,721
Let's start with your manners.

589
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,024
Is this how your parents raised you?

590
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,392
What did you say?

591
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:45,362
I said, didn't your parents teach you any manners?

592
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:48,933
Exactly! You're so well-mannered!

593
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,501
Your grandma raised you so well.

594
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:51,835
My mom didn't teach me anything.

595
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:52,970
Fine, I'll teach you now.

596
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,605
Apologize to my grandma first, then to me

597
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:57,173
because you broke my tape!
