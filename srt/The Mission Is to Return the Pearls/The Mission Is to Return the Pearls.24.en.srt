1
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,560
Young Master

2
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,880
Go ahead, don't worry.

3
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,720
We'll take care of Kana.

4
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,360
She'll be fine.

5
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,840
Thank you for your help.

6
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,000
Hepu is still unsettled.

7
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,080
I can't leave for now.

8
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,880
General Wang will escort the Tribute Pearl
back to the capital.

9
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,800
Up on Meiling,

10
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,840
someone should be able to help you.

11
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,320
No need.

12
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,280
Too many people will only agitate her.

13
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,280
Take Jian Jia and Li Zhong

14
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,960
and come back safely.

15
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,400
You stay safe too.

16
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
I promise you.

17
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,520
I'll return safe and sound.

18
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,240
Zhang Ji

19
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,560
Come out here!

20
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,920
I know it's you.

21
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,280
Stop pretending to be mysterious.

22
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,080
Zhang Ji

23
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
Husband

24
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,200
You're no fun at all.

25
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,280
I wanted to play a bit longer.

26
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,360
Let Jian Jia go.

27
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,640
I know I'm the one you're after.

28
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,600
I'm right here.

29
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,800
You think I'll let her go just because you say so?

30
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,240
That's boring.

31
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,560
If you play a game with me,

32
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,760
and you win,

33
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,400
I'll let her go.

34
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,320
How about it?

35
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,440
What are you up to?

36
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,480
Catch!

37
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,160
Zhang Ji

38
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,600
You know I can't fight.

39
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,320
How do you know if you haven't tried?

40
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,040
Husband

41
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,720
Take this!

42
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,120
Wait!

43
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,440
I told you I can't do martial arts.

44
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,280
What are you doing?

45
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,440
You were fighting just fine earlier.

46
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,840
Keep going.

47
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Isn't this fun?

48
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,800
Why are you dodging?

49
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,600
Keep going.

50
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,480
Young Master

51
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,760
No, please!

52
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,720
Come on, let's go see.

53
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,680
Zhang Ji

54
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,200
Zhang Ji

55
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,720
Why?

56
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,120
Why?

57
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,600
I...

58
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,680
There's something I've never understood.

59
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,440
It's that

60
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,800
even before I met you,

61
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,080
why

62
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,280
was there so much hatred in your eyes?

63
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,720
I, Zhang Ji,

64
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,320
greeted Li Ling.

65
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,240
Why is it you?

66
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,280
What are you, really?

67
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,840
Don't think I don't know.

68
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,360
Then why did you do this?

69
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,080
I...

70
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,040
I have nowhere left to go.

71
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,960
The only thing I can think of

72
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,120
is

73
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,440
to die in your arms.

74
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,520
Zhang Ji

75
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,880
Zhang Ji

76
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,600
Actually,

77
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,240
after Miss Zhang Ji took me from prison,

78
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,320
she never mistreated me.

79
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,600
She's very lonely.

80
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,560
And in pain.

81
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,240
I think

82
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,000
she saw you as her only lifeline.

83
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,280
Young Master

84
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,040
I don't know what to say.

85
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,880
Come and see.

86
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,600
These

87
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,880
are the families

88
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,480
of the heroes who hid the pearls.

89
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,240
Meng Chang's worries were justified.

90
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,920
The truth was never hidden.

91
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,240
Word got out long ago.

92
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,760
Zhang Ji knew

93
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,080
you promised those heroes

94
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,440
to keep their families safe.

95
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,640
She also said

96
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,040
her husband

97
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,320
must keep his word.

98
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,920
Miss Zhang Ji may have killed,

99
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,760
but

100
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,280
she never harmed the innocent.

101
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,320
You...

102
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,080
Me...

103
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,920
Do we have a choice?

104
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,720
We're married now.

105
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,400
At least we'll live a bit longer.

106
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,520
You're my wife.

107
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,720
Caring for you

108
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,480
and helping you

109
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,600
is my duty as your husband.

110
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,760
A servant can't serve two masters.

111
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
So he accepts my status now.

112
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,040
Husband

113
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,640
Long time no see.

114
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,240
Miss Zhang

115
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,120
Please behave yourself.

116
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,760
Yes.

117
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
All my hatred for Zhang Ji

118
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,760
came from my past life.

119
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,280
But in this life,

120
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,720
she never hurt me.

121
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,720
You...

122
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Are you really leaving?

123
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,400
I've lived here so long.

124
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,680
Like a caged bird,

125
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,520
never seeing the sky.

126
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,040
The endless sea and unknown lands

127
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,240
are what I truly long for.

128
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,840
Alright.

129
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,080
As long as you're happy.

130
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,120
By the way,

131
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,720
I haven't wished you a happy marriage yet.

132
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,480
The things to hand over

133
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,480
are in my room.

134
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,240
Remember to pick them up.

135
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,040
Well,

136
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
I wish you

137
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,240
smooth sailing.

138
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,720
Mm.

139
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,120
If

140
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,640
I had met you first,

141
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,280
would things be different?

142
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,240
You don't have to answer.

143
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,520
I know.

144
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,040
You're a good person.

145
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,440
Be good to Rong'er.

146
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Wanru

147
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,600
Hurry up!

148
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,280
We still need to go shopping at sea.

149
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,520
Coming!

150
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,800
Meeting you

151
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,160
makes me truly happy.

152
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,840
It's my good fortune.

153
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,600
Farewell.

154
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,680
Meng Chang

155
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,680
They're all wonderful women.

156
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,720
It's normal for men to have many wives.

157
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,240
Why didn't you keep them here?

158
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,640
What about Kana?

159
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,440
She set her sights on the sea trade route.

160
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,440
She wants to earn more money.

161
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,680
And as for Wanru,

162
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,920
she doesn't want to rely on men her whole life.

163
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,920
She can make her own way.

164
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,480
Alright.

165
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,120
Now that your personal matters are settled,

166
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,400
it's time to get to work.

167
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,080
Ah.

168
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,840
His Majesty has issued a decree.

169
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,800
Follow Heaven's will.

170
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,040
IMPERIAL EDICT

171
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,440
Hereby,

172
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,640
Li Ling of the Hepu Li family pearl house

173
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,560
together with Hepu's governor Meng Chang,

174
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,160
shall improve Hepu's shellfish

175
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,480
living conditions.

176
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,320
Restore pearl production within three years.

177
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,120
RESTORE THE PEARLS OF HEPU

178
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,360
Let the Southern Pearl grace the world again.

179
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,080
Li Ling

180
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,160
Receive the decree.

181
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,080
Li Ling, your humble subject,

182
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,120
accepts the decree.

183
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,040
Li Ling,

184
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,720
the matter of the Southern Pearl

185
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,560
is of great importance to the court.

186
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,200
If the shellfish migrate,

187
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,880
they can't produce Tribute Pearl quality.

188
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,640
So,

189
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,640
His Majesty commands

190
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,000
you must restore the pearls to Hepu.

191
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,000
Do you know what this is called?

192
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,760
Fulfilling the pearl restoration order.

193
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,240
Li Ling

194
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,040
Didn't I tell you to keep Shao Wanru and Kana?

195
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,520
How did you promise me?

196
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,080
A fierce wife at home—

197
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,160
I'd better take my leave first.

198
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,720
You dare run away?

199
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,320
Sorry for the spectacle.

200
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,520
Stop!

201
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,600
You, stop right there!

202
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,560
Rong'er

203
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,760
Don't always grab a knife.

204
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,560
You dare run again?

205
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,160
You—

206
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,880
We agreed

207
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,440
to keep Shao Wanru and Kana, right?

208
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,640
I couldn't make them stay.

209
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,720
How did you promise me?

210
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,320
Don't be so hasty.

211
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,080
Stop!

212
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,320
Don't throw—

213
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,200
Please, don't throw it!

214
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,040
Stop!

215
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,080
THE END
