1
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,440
Ah

2
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,680
This foreign hairpin

3
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,880
is really uncomfortable.

4
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,560
The grain transport ship

5
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,320
will arrive in Hepu tomorrow.

6
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,320
If Ka Na has already resolved

7
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,680
the grain issue in Nanjun,

8
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,720
then the grain I brought back this time

9
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,040
will be enough for Hepu's needs for several years.

10
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
That's wonderful.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,480
This way, Hepu's food crisis

12
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
can be resolved.

13
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,240
Zhang He wanted to use grain

14
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,720
to control the price of pearls,

15
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,160
but his scheme will collapse on its own.

16
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,480
Oh, by the way, Rong'er,

17
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,600
I only asked you to go to Jiaozhi for grain,

18
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,480
so why did you

19
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,920
come back as a Pearl Envoy?

20
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,280
In Jiaozhi,

21
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,240
I found that the nobles and merchants there

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,320
are very interested in this maritime trade route.

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
So they want me to act as an envoy

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,360
to truly open up this trade route.

25
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,600
Maritime trade route.

26
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,360
Sir,

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,920
when we were drifting at sea before,

28
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,240
Li Ling told me about it.

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,640
Hey, Rong'er,

30
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,400
do you think

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,240
if all these goods could be

32
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,240
shipped out by sea,

33
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,640
just like

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,800
the migration of sea shells,

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,280
then

36
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,240
we could set up

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,200
a network like the Li family's in the Central Plains,

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,040
with trade routes reaching everywhere.

39
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,160
Sounds like

40
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,440
it could work.

41
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,400
If we can sail farther,

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,880
then all the boasts I made to Ka Na

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,800
could actually come true.

44
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,960
Things like silk,

45
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,560
porcelain, and cotton could all be sold.

46
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
We could make a lot of money.

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,240
If Ka Na finds out

48
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,040
you were just bragging and tricked her,

49
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,840
she

50
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,640
would definitely hang you over the sea to feed the fish.

51
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,360
Just don't tell her, don't tell her.

52
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,240
Maritime trade route.

53
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,040
Ah

54
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,080
If we open up maritime trade,

55
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,840
we might really be able to establish

56
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,040
a Maritime Silk Road.

57
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,640
Sir,

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,960
let's set aside the maritime trade route for now.

59
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,680
There's a more serious problem now.

60
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,040
Have you noticed

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,960
that through this Pearl God Festival,

62
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,280
although many sea shells were brought in from other counties,

63
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,360
which can produce pearls,

64
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,600
the quality

65
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,560
is much worse than before.

66
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,880
It's far from

67
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,280
the quality of Southern Pearls we used to offer as tribute.

68
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
Do you think it's possible

69
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,680
that only in Hepu

70
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,080
can these sea shells produce the best Southern Pearls?

71
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,360
Fool!

72
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,760
If you hadn't killed Wang Cheng

73
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,920
so recklessly,

74
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,760
today

75
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,440
I wouldn't be so humiliated before Meng Chang.

76
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,000
How could I be in such a sorry state?

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,720
Ah

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,200
So we still have grain in hand.

79
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,320
We can still hold Meng Chang in check.

80
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,480
But Jiaozhi's grain ships

81
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,840
will arrive at the port tomorrow.

82
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,560
Once the ships arrive,

83
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Meng Chang will send heavy guards.

84
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,520
The refugee problem

85
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,160
will be resolved soon.

86
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,560
All our arrangements

87
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,200
will be wasted.

88
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,080
This is all thanks to your dear husband.

89
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,560
Back then,

90
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,080
I

91
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,120
should have killed him in prison.

92
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,640
Father,

93
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,440
Compared to Li Ling,

94
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,840
I think there's something else

95
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,080
that might need attention.

96
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,040
Speak.

97
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,080
The female general beside Meng Chang

98
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,640
hasn't been seen for a long time.

99
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
What?

100
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,800
Tell the people at Meiling

101
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,800
to guard the pass for me.

102
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,800
If anything happens,

103
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,880
report immediately.

104
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,200
Did you hear me?

105
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,240
Yes.

106
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,520
I don't care about your Pearl God Festival,

107
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,600
win or lose.

108
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,000
Keep a close eye on Li Ling.

109
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,520
I need time

110
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,520
to bring my private troops into the city.

111
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,720
Understand?

112
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,360
Yes.

113
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,000
I also want to settle things with Li Ling

114
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,200
once and for all.

115
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,280
Meng Chang,

116
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,680
Li Ling,

117
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,800
I want you to know

118
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,800
that I, Zhang He,

119
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,840
am the true ruler of Hepu.

120
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,240
None of you will leave alive.

121
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,640
No one will leave alive.

122
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,640
My own bed is still the most comfortable.

123
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,360
Li Ling,

124
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,800
do you know how much we earned today?

125
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
So much, I can't even count it.

126
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,720
Your method of taking half and compensating half

127
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,760
not only didn't lose, but made a profit.

128
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,440
We were supposed to lose,

129
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,000
but after your move,

130
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,120
regardless of the outcome,

131
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,840
I won everything.

132
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,800
Was this your plan all along?

133
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,320
Ha, no.

134
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,000
You're just too clever.

135
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,080
I want to have a child like you,

136
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,760
smart and capable.

137
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,480
Don't be impulsive.

138
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,040
Don't let money cloud your mind.

139
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,600
Hey, listen to me.

140
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,360
I still have Jia Rong'er.

141
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,360
Fainted.

142
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,640
He fainted.

143
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
I'm so angry.

144
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,040
Ah!

145
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,000
Sister,

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,800
See, I told you so.

147
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,640
This method definitely won't work.

148
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,400
Li Gongzi isn't that kind of person.

149
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,920
If I weren't afraid I'd never return from Jiaozhi,

150
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,920
I wouldn't have agreed to her.

151
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,600
I hereby announce

152
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,680
the Pearl God Festival's

153
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,240
final contest

154
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,000
begins now.

155
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,560
Husband, please go first.

156
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,120
How about this:

157
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,880
Let's decide the winner with one shell.

158
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,800
How about it?

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,440
You can play however you want today.

160
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,600
I'll accompany you to the end.

161
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,680
You truly have extraordinary abilities.

162
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,800
So you also value this shell.

163
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,680
Then I'll let you have it.

164
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,640
If you like it,

165
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,320
I'll give it to you.

166
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,160
Then I'll accept it.

167
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,200
Come.

168
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,600
Get ready to open the shell.

169
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,880
This is

170
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,880
This must be the finest pearl found in recent years.

171
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,720
Golden Pearl

172
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,480
It's a Golden Pearl.

173
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,160
It could easily be called the king of Tribute Pearls.

174
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,640
I've never seen such a fine pearl.

175
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,960
This shape,

176
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,360
this luster,

177
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,200
My husband,

178
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,400
Thank you for letting me win.

179
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,240
The outcome is decided.

180
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,720
Miss Zhang,

181
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

182
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,040
Can you possibly reveal

183
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,240
a pearl better than this one?

184
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,120
Just admit defeat to your wife.

185
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,280
The Pearl God title always goes to your family anyway.

186
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
That's right.

187
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,000
Exactly.

188
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,600
Young Master Li,

189
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,640
It's your turn.

190
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,840
Please open the shell.

191
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,280
Wow

192
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,400
It's a divine pearl.

193
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,480
I've never seen such a beautiful pearl.

194
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,560
So beautiful.

195
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,040
Purple is the most precious.

196
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
Its glow is natural.

197
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,840
Purple is the most precious.

198
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Its glow is natural.

199
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,400
We meet again.

200
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,880
Pearl King

201
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:54,600
Pearl God

202
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,840
Everyone, disperse.

203
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,280
Ah, my good son-in-law.

204
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,680
You are the very first in history

205
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,200
Pearl God.

206
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,000
Ah!

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,760
What nonsense Pearl God!

208
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,240
It's just a way to exploit the people.

209
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,880
Today, in the name of Pearl God,

210
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,960
I will destroy this Pearl God's hall.

211
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,640
Li Ling

212
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,920
What are you doing?

213
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,520
Li Ling, you're courting death!

214
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,680
Guards!

215
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,920
Cut him down!

216
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,520
All unrelated people

217
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,600
must leave at once.

218
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,000
It's Lord Meng.

219
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,960
There is an imperial decree.

220
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Kneel.

221
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,720
Obey Heaven and follow the times.

222
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,200
Imperial edict issued.

223
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,080
Hereby,

224
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,200
I have heard of strange events in Hepu.

225
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,320
Rumors have spread

226
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,680
that Hepu pearls do not go beyond Meiling.

227
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,200
If they do, they turn to dust.

228
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,800
Some even say

229
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,440
it's the will of the sea god.

230
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,480
Such words are utterly absurd.

231
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,240
Meng Chang is now appointed envoy.

232
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,000
Commander of the Imperial Guard, Wang Qiang,

233
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,800
will escort the Tribute Pearls to the capital.

234
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,360
Zhang He, Prefect of Hepu, has failed in his duties.

235
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,720
He colluded with powerful families,

236
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,960
formed factions for personal gain,

237
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,320
deceived superiors and subordinates,

238
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,760
and harmed the people.

239
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,080
Upon receipt of this decree,

240
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,680
he is stripped of his office,

241
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,480
and escorted to the capital for trial.

242
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,080
Meng Chang will temporarily assume the position of Hepu Prefect.

243
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,640
By imperial command.

244
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,360
Everyone else, withdraw.

245
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,880
Zhang He receives the decree.

246
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,760
Zhang He

247
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,320
receives the decree.

248
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,920
What is it?

249
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,280
Are you defying the imperial decree?
