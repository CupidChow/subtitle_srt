1
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,960
Minister Meng

2
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,360
History is written by the victors.

3
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,440
But there is one thing I don't understand.

4
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,360
Please enlighten me.

5
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,160
You want to ask

6
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,800
why the powerful clans in the capital

7
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,680
didn't protect you this time?

8
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,240
That's because they couldn't protect themselves.

9
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,560
When you hunted down the refugees,

10
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,720
and resorted to extreme measures to hide the pearls,

11
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,600
forcing them to cross Meiling Pass,

12
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,920
and deliver the pearls to the capital,

13
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,920
in fact,

14
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,880
at Meiling Pass,

15
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,000
Minister Meng and Young Master Li

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,920
had already noticed something was wrong.

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,280
To avoid alerting you,

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,120
we deliberately didn't expose you.

19
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,720
Instead, we let the pearls reach the capital.

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,080
Once the pearls arrived,

21
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,760
whichever influential clan

22
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,200
received the tribute pearls,

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,880
would be linked to you, Zhang He,

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,520
with ties that couldn't be denied.

25
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,840
Following this trail,

26
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,880
all your accomplices in the capital

27
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,920
have been rounded up.

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,880
Including your son, who was a hostage,

29
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,360
he has also been thrown into the imperial prison.

30
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,200
My son is innocent!

31
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,480
Why did you arrest my son?

32
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,520
Ah!

33
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,440
Release my son!

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,480
Meng Chang!

35
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,360
Zhang He!

36
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,720
Then go to the capital

37
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,920
and report the clans' crimes to the Emperor.

38
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,000
Meng Chang!

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,920
Arrest me,

40
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,640
but let my son go!

41
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,040
My son did nothing wrong!

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,480
Why did you arrest my son?

43
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,120
Release my son!

44
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,760
Release my son!

45
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,320
Meng Chang!

46
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,880
Do you really think you've won?

47
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,480
You're too naive.

48
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,520
Far too naive.

49
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,360
Guards!

50
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,400
Surround them!

51
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,040
Cut them down!

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,600
Prepare to die!

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,400
You too,

54
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,600
and all of you,

55
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,240
none of you will survive!

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,760
Where are my men?

57
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,920
Where are they?

58
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,320
If you mean your private soldiers,

59
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,480
they've all been captured.

60
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,080
Did you think we did nothing these past three days?

61
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,720
We knew you stationed your men outside the city.

62
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,600
Li Ling helped us stall for three days,

63
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,560
just enough time for me to bring troops from the capital.

64
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,800
The Emperor gave me special permission

65
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,240
to bring a unit of Imperial Guards.

66
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,040
Your rabble

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,760
was no match for us.

68
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,040
Impossible!

69
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,320
Impossible!

70
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,240
General Wang!

71
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,200
No need to waste words with him.

72
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,960
Arrest him for trial.

73
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,880
Go!

74
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,520
Father!

75
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,040
You go first.

76
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,080
Protect Minister Meng.

77
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,360
The rest of you, pursue them!

78
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,360
Let's go too.

79
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,760
Follow me.

80
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,280
Why are you here?

81
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,720
Hurry!

82
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,560
Quick, quick!

83
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,080
Sister Rong'er,

84
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,240
what should we do now?

85
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,120
Don't you have a kitchen knife?

86
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,520
Oh, right!

87
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,440
Kana

88
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,960
Sister

89
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,520
Kana

90
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,280
Sister

91
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,080
Sister

92
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,960
Kana

93
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,280
Kana

94
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,520
Kana

95
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,040
Hurry

96
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,960
Kana

97
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,200
Kana

98
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,000
How is it?

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,600
So unlucky

100
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,560
It was so hard to earn money

101
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,480
Why am I about to die?

102
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,160
No way

103
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,520
Li Ling

104
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,200
I haven't had a child with you yet

105
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,720
Kana

106
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Don't fall asleep

107
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,240
Kana

108
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,760
Kana

109
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,240
Wake up

110
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,600
I'm thinking about having a child with you

111
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,080
Kana

112
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,120
Kana

113
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,640
Kana

114
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,240
So you didn't come back for my mother

115
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,080
What right do you have to mention your mother?

116
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,720
You couldn't handle Li Ling

117
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,400
You couldn't kill Li Wenshun

118
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,920
You couldn't become the Pearl Deity

119
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,600
You lost completely

120
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,360
All you did was kill Wang Cheng

121
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,840
And left this mess for today

122
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,360
Tell me

123
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
What right do you have

124
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,760
to have your mother's ancestral tablet placed up there?

125
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Now that we have the pearls

126
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,160
We'll use them

127
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,600
to reorganize in the capital

128
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,600
Maybe

129
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,560
we can save your brother

130
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
Let's go

131
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,160
Father

132
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,720
What are you so dissatisfied with me about?

133
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,360
I'm your daughter too

134
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,000
For you

135
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,200
For my brother

136
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,440
For the whole Zhang family

137
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,960
I've done so much

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,960
What exactly are you unhappy about?

139
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,440
That so-called brother of mine

140
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,800
I've never even met him

141
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,280
He's just a hostage

142
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,560
He's useless to the Zhang family

143
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,800
He does nothing

144
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,720
and still gets your favor

145
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,320
But what about me?

146
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,240
I've risked my life

147
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,960
What have I gotten?

148
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,280
Enough!

149
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,160
You're not worthy to be compared to my son

150
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,160
You're so useless

151
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,480
Just like your mother

152
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,200
You're nothing but a lowborn

153
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,280
You

154
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,680
Don't you dare insult my mother

155
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,000
Don't talk about my mother

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,760
I won't let you insult my mother

157
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,120
Ungrateful child

158
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,720
Ungrateful child

159
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,600
Father

160
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,760
Father

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,960
Mother

162
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,880
Mother

163
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,960
Mother

164
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,720
I'll go fetch your ancestral tablet now

165
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
I'll go right away

166
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,200
Mother,

167
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,360
I have finally brought your ancestral tablet

168
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,520
into the Zhang family’s ancestral hall.

169
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,080
But as your daughter,

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,440
in this vast world,

171
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,360
I still don’t know where to go.

172
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,720
Doctor

173
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,720
How is Miss Kana now?

174
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,280
If we can't calm her down,

175
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,920
I'm afraid

176
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,440
there's nothing more I can do.

177
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,320
Calm down.

178
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,200
Settle down.

179
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,560
anesthetic powder

180
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,320
By the way,

181
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,360
General Wang

182
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,440
Where's the anesthetic powder?

183
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:50,960
Oh.

184
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,680
I have it.

185
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,120
Doctor

186
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,920
This is the anesthetic powder.

187
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,840
It can help her calm down.

188
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,120
Alright.

189
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,920
Li Ling

190
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,840
We've finally made it through the storm.

191
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,720
Kana will be fine.

192
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,880
That's right.

193
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,760
Young Master

194
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,600
Don't worry.

195
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,000
We must believe

196
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,240
that Kana will pull through.

197
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,280
How is Kana doing?

198
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,400
It's not very optimistic.

199
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,960
But I believe

200
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,840
good fortune will protect Kana.

201
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,320
Prefect's residence

202
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,000
We've finished the sweep.

203
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,800
We found Zhang He's body.

204
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,720
However,

205
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,200
we didn't find the maid you mentioned.

206
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,360
No trace of Jianjia.

207
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,360
Nor did we find the Pearl King.

208
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,520
Zhang He is dead.

209
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,560
Hmm.

210
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,280
What about the Pearl King?

211
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,960
She was probably taken by Zhang Ji.

212
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,280
And Zhang Ji?

213
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,640
We didn't find Zhang Ji either.

214
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,080
She must have escaped.

215
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,160
Jianjia

216
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,280
was definitely taken by Zhang Ji.

217
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,720
Any pearl I've touched,

218
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,920
no matter where it is,

219
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,200
I can always find it.

220
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,600
Mei Ridge
