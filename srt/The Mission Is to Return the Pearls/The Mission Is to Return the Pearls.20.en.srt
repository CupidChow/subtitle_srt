1
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,480
Southern pearls are truly rare treasures.

2
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,920
One pearl can be worth a hundred thousand coins.

3
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,920
So many of them.

4
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,600
This is just what the powerful aristocratic families

5
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,240
divide among themselves in a single year.

6
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,200
All of this

7
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,920
is a crime punishable by execution of nine generations of a family.

8
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,360
But without solid evidence,

9
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,120
these pearls

10
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,800
are completely useless.

11
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,120
Li Ling,

12
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,640
do you truly have a way

13
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,200
to track these pearls?

14
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,920
Any pearl I've touched,

15
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,120
no matter where it is,

16
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,400
I can find it.

17
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,360
As long as they end up in the hands of the aristocratic families,

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,920
I can

19
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,640
expose each and every one of them.

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,760
Is it really that miraculous?

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,440
Please trust me, sir.

22
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,560
Alright.

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,280
When these pearls

24
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,720
arrive in the capital,

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,600
it will be the day

26
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,000
the aristocratic families are brought down.

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,560
But Li Ling,

28
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,600
you must go with Wang Qiang yourself.

29
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,480
When I return to Hepu,

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,920
all debts

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,720
will be settled.

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,400
Father,

33
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,480
we received a letter from the capital.

34
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,880
It says the tribute pearls have arrived.

35
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,960
Since the goods

36
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,960
have been delivered,

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,280
the Pearl Deity Contest

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,520
can now begin.

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,960
Yes.

40
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,760
Alright, next.

41
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,280
Imperial Guards.

42
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,320
Present.

43
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,200
What's this about exchanging pearls for porridge?

44
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,720
Zhang He gave the order.

45
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,320
The refugees from the southern region have nothing else.

46
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,120
They only have many pearls.

47
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,920
So he made them all

48
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,720
exchange pearls for porridge.

49
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,520
Or go to the grain shops to trade pearls for food.

50
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,640
But the prices are outrageous.

51
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,080
Ten pearls for a bowl of porridge.

52
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,000
A thousand pearls can't buy a sack of grain.

53
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,000
Hepu is currently short on food supplies.

54
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,800
Zhang He's actions

55
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,280
I can't say he's entirely wrong.

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,360
By the way,

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,680
didn't Zhang He also set up

58
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,560
a rule that the Pearl Deity Contest's results

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,520
would affect the price of pearl shells?

60
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,360
I think he did.

61
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,000
Li Ling,

62
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,080
can you really stop Zhang He?

63
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,400
Let's go.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,600
Today,

65
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,800
envoys from eight regions have come to Hepu.

66
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,320
All gathered together.

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,520
The first Pearl Deity in history will be decided.

68
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,160
I hereby announce

69
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,800
the Pearl Deity Contest

70
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,880
begins now.

71
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,040
Hepu, Southern Pearl House.

72
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,280
Zhang Ji.

73
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,280
Linhe, Longyang Pearl House.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,040
Lu Yi.

75
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,080
Jiuzhen, Qingtian Pearl House.

76
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,320
Liu Fugui.

77
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,600
Gaoliang, Fengxian Pearl House.

78
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,280
Li Xiang.

79
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,640
Wuping, Qilin Pearl House.

80
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,200
Guo Youshi.

81
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,880
Xinchang Qianhui Pearl House

82
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,880
Zhu Wei

83
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,640
Southern Prefecture Lingyun Pearl House

84
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,240
Shao Wanru

85
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,320
Shao Wanru

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,800
It really is her.

87
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,160
Who is she?

88
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
She was once at the Hua House

89
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,360
the brightest pearl.

90
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,480
Top courtesan.

91
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,360
I didn't expect her to become the Pearl Envoy of Southern Prefecture.

92
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:54,920
Shao Wanru, Shao Wanru.

93
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,160
The last prefecture, Jiaozhi.

94
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,840
The envoy hasn't arrived yet.

95
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,320
They will arrive soon.

96
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,320
The Pearl Deity Contest will use a lottery

97
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,400
to decide the matchups.

98
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,760
There are eight lots with four characters each.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,040
Those who draw the same number

100
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,120
will compete against each other.

101
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,480
Pearl Envoys, please come forward to draw lots.

102
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,760
If the Jiaozhi envoy doesn't arrive in time,

103
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,800
it will be considered a forfeit.

104
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,840
You Han people hold this grand pearl event,

105
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,360
how can you leave out us maritime merchants?

106
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,280
Exactly.

107
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,240
Master Zhang.

108
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,160
Long time no see.

109
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Miss Kana.

110
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,840
I thought

111
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,960
you had stopped doing business in Hepu.

112
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,560
Master Zhang, you must be joking.

113
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,880
A profitable business like this,

114
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,360
why would I ever quit?

115
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,800
Seeing today's grand occasion,

116
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,240
I came up with a way for everyone here

117
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,680
to make money.

118
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,000
I wonder if any of you

119
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,040
are interested in playing along?

120
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,720
Oh?

121
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,040
Let's hear it.

122
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,400
Why not place a bet before we begin?

123
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Everyone can make a wager.

124
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,840
If you guess wrong,

125
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,960
the losers

126
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,440
I, Kana,

127
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,120
will cover half your losses.

128
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,200
If you win,

129
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,920
I want seventy percent.

130
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,160
Seventy percent?

131
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,160
What do we get to earn then?

132
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,320
That's right.

133
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,440
Hey.

134
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,280
If you lose, I'll pay half for you.

135
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,040
Master Zhang.

136
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,840
This deal

137
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,040
might be worth doing.

138
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,960
Miss Kana is generous with her money.

139
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,120
As an official,

140
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,320
how could I object?

141
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,840
However,

142
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
if things go as Miss Kana says,

143
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,920
if we lose,

144
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,040
that would be a huge amount.

145
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,800
Master Zhang,

146
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,360
Do you still have concerns?

147
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,320
Alright.

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,280
I agree.

149
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,360
Tomorrow at three quarters past noon,

150
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,920
the Pearl Deity Contest

151
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,600
will officially begin.

152
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,240
Everything is arranged.

153
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,160
All preparations are complete.

154
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,280
But why

155
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,640
does this Pearl Deity Contest

156
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,520
not seem to be going

157
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,240
as we planned?

158
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,280
You mean,

159
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,280
it's going too smoothly?

160
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,360
Meng Chang hasn't tried to interfere again.

161
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,840
Nan County

162
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,600
even sent a courtesan as their pearl envoy.

163
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,280
Even the maritime merchants got involved.

164
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
On the surface,

165
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,280
they all seem to support the Pearl Deity Contest.

166
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,000
But they have no reason to help me.

167
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,800
No matter what they're planning,

168
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,840
once the contest begins,

169
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,000
the shellfish sources we've chosen

170
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,160
will surely rise in price.

171
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
Then, Nan County's pearls

172
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,440
will drop in value.

173
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,240
Food prices will also go up.

174
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,160
By then, the pearls they hold

175
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,920
will be worthless.

176
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,920
Hmm.

177
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,880
Let's squeeze those pearl households in Nan County dry.

178
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,240
Make it impossible for them to survive in Hepu.

179
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,360
Then,

180
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,240
they'll have to cross Meiling.

181
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,200
Goods

182
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,160
will keep flowing

183
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,880
out in secret.

184
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,920
Yesterday,

185
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,120
ten pearls could buy a bowl of porridge.

186
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:01,920
But today,

187
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,040
why does it cost twenty?

188
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,640
Hepu has always lacked food.

189
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,800
Now it's not just you people from Nan County,

190
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,240
many villages in Hepu are also hungry.

191
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,960
Everyone's come here.

192
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,760
If you don't want it, leave.

193
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,680
Go back.

194
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,880
Eat your pearls.

195
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:14,800
Then I...

196
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,320
I'd rather buy grain instead.

197
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,480
Grain now costs a thousand coins per dan.

198
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,120
Do you think

199
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,840
you can still afford this porridge?

200
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,080
It's all thanks to Master Zhang He.

201
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,280
Then I...

202
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,080
Should I...

203
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,520
Then I'll have a bowl.

204
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,120
In a few days,

205
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,520
everything will return to normal.

206
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,160
Not only that,

207
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,720
it'll be even better

208
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,800
than before.

209
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,880
You've changed.

210
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,280
Haven't you changed too?

211
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,720
Before coming to Hepu,

212
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,520
you went to Nan County first, didn't you?

213
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,040
You gave all the grain to Master Li.

214
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,440
Without taking a single coin.

215
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,360
Not only that,

216
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,240
that jerk

217
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,160
gave me another money-losing idea.

218
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,560
Ever since I met him,

219
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,040
I haven't made any money.

220
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,840
But you agreed.

221
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,040
That means

222
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,240
what he asked you to do

223
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,400
is also what you wanted.

224
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,880
Yes, yes.

225
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,600
You Han people really love your principles.

226
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,800
But this time, I emptied my pockets

227
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,480
to buy him some time.

228
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,400
I just don't know if it'll be enough.

229
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,000
The young master has never broken his word.

230
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,240
Don't worry.

231
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,960
Since he said so,

232
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,680
he'll definitely return in time.

233
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,960
Today's contest

234
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,200
allows each person to choose

235
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
only one source of shellfish.

236
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,840
The contest is divided into four categories.

237
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,280
The type will be decided by rolling pearls on a tray.

238
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,040
That will determine the challenge.

239
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,280
First round, number one draws.

240
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,200
Pearl or no pearl.

241
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,280
The first round

242
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,440
begins now.
