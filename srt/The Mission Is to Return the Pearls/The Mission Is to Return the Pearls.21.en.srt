1
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,800
Step back, step back.

2
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,400
Step back, step back.

3
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,280
Line up.

4
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,320
Everyone, line up properly.

5
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,520
Line up.

6
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,840
Betting starts now.

7
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,560
I bet on number three.

8
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,640
I bet on number two.

9
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,920
I bet on number three.

10
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,760
I'm all in.

11
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,600
Bets are final.

12
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,120
First round of competition.

13
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,920
Begins now.

14
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,360
Shao Wanru versus Liu Fugui.

15
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,160
Start choosing shells.

16
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,600
When did you come back?

17
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,760
Just got back.

18
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,400
I went home, changed clothes, and took a bath.

19
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,360
Then hurried over.

20
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,400
You’re already competing.

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,320
Good thing I made it in time.

22
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,840
Thanks to Young Master.

23
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,280
Otherwise, Wanru would’ve lost this time.

24
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,600
She probably would’ve lost.

25
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,000
No need to worry.

26
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,440
I’ll win back whatever you lose.

27
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,440
Oh.

28
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,560
Young Master looks so relaxed.

29
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,600
I guess things in the capital went well.

30
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,960
Can you hurry up?

31
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,000
Picking a husband here.

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,160
Darn it.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,360
Did I break any rules?

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,360
No.

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,560
Four.

36
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,040
Two.

37
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,480
Eight.

38
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,640
Two.

39
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,840
One.

40
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,280
Chosen.

41
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,160
Reveal.

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,840
Shao Wanru can not only guess if there are pearls,

43
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,240
but even the exact number.

44
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,080
She gets it exactly right.

45
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,440
She’s simply

46
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,920
amazing.

47
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,280
Nan County.

48
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,000
Lingyun Pearl House, Shao Wanru.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,840
Wins.

50
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,800
Did you really come back?

51
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,840
So, how’s Hepu lately?

52
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,000
Hepu’s grain

53
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,600
is running out.

54
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,480
Even if people have pearls now,

55
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,760
they can’t exchange them for grain.

56
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,840
If this continues,

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,760
even winning the Pearl God Tournament

58
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,920
I’m afraid

59
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,920
it won’t help.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,960
You sea merchants

61
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,600
can’t you bring grain from Jiaozhi?

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,480
Ship grain over?

63
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,200
You need to go to Jiaozhi.

64
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,040
No idea how things are with Rong’er now.

65
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,960
Hey, you rascal.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,800
I’ve been looking for you.

67
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,920
Why are you here?

68
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,680
No.

69
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,320
Where are you going?

70
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
Don’t ask, there’s a surprise.

71
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,000
You could at least tell me first!

72
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,560
You’ve heard, right?

73
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,000
Shells from Linxia Village

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,200
all produce pearls.

75
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,880
Prices have skyrocketed.

76
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,920
Qingtian Village is in trouble.

77
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,000
No one wants their shells anymore.

78
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,920
Hey, what are you doing?

79
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,560
What?

80
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,120
You dragged me here just for this?

81
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,440
Patience is a virtue.

82
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,160
Just wait.

83
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:00,920
I...

84
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,760
If the Jiaozhi Pearl Envoy doesn’t arrive soon,

85
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,880
then Zhang Ji

86
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,240
will win by default.

87
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,920
She’s getting off easy.

88
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,240
Hey.

89
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,240
The Jiaozhi Pearl Envoy hasn’t arrived.

90
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,360
I announce

91
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,880
Nanguo Pearl House, Zhang Ji

92
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,840
The Jiaozhi Pearl Envoy is here.

93
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,000
Who said the Jiaozhi Pearl Envoy isn’t here?

94
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,640
Hey, here we go again.

95
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,800
Jiaozhi Pearl Envoy

96
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,280
Li Family Pearl Guild

97
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,520
Jia Rong'er

98
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,440
Jia Rong'er

99
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,000
Have you forgotten

100
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,960
you're still wanted on the arrest warrant.

101
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,240
Guards,

102
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,400
arrest them.

103
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,400
Official Zhang

104
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,440
Long time no see.

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,360
And who might you be?

106
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,160
My voice...

107
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,360
Sir,

108
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,440
don't you remember?

109
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,080
Li Ling

110
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,880
Now everyone's here.

111
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Official Zhang

112
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,120
Oh dear.

113
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,160
Official Meng has arrived.

114
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,560
What brings you here?

115
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,600
I heard

116
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,640
there's a wanted criminal at the Pearl God Tournament.

117
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,680
I was worried you might be short-handed,

118
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,240
so I came to help.

119
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,520
Do you need assistance?

120
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,320
Ah,

121
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,000
it's just one fugitive.

122
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,440
No need to trouble yourself, Official Meng.

123
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,840
What crimes have these two committed?

124
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,440
Nothing much,

125
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,800
just murder,

126
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,080
robbery,

127
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,000
and fleeing from justice.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,200
Escaping arrest.

129
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,880
You're referring to

130
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,960
the Wang Cheng case of the Wang Family Pearl Guild, right?

131
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,760
Oh.

132
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,800
Official Meng,

133
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,760
do you

134
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,000
know this alleged murderer?

135
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,760
The Wang Cheng case was a major case in Hepu these past two years.

136
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,240
But after reviewing the files,

137
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,080
I found

138
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,280
there's no solid evidence.

139
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,400
Just because they were rivals,

140
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,800
and argued before Wang Cheng died,

141
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,320
Li Ling had a dispute with him,

142
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,520
doesn't make him guilty.

143
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,360
Isn't that a bit hasty?

144
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,000
If the biggest beneficiary

145
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,040
is the prime suspect,

146
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,320
then may I ask,

147
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,920
after Wang Cheng's death,

148
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,120
the Wang Family Pearl Guild was renamed the Nanguo Pearl Guild,

149
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,160
and all its assets went under the Prefecture's control.

150
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,480
So the biggest beneficiary

151
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,760
should be you, Official Zhang,

152
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,920
and your daughter, Zhang Ji.

153
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,120
So does that mean

154
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,440
the two of you

155
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,080
are the most likely culprits?

156
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,400
Then, Official Meng,

157
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,440
if Li Ling isn't the murderer,

158
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
why did he flee in fear?

159
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,200
When he returned to Hepu,

160
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,680
he kept himself hidden,

161
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,880
never showing his true face.

162
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,640
Replying to Official Meng,

163
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,680
I was in prison at the time,

164
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,160
subjected to torture,

165
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,320
and seriously injured.

166
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,320
They forced me, in that condition,

167
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,400
to marry Zhang Ji.

168
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,040
If I had consummated the marriage that day,

169
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,440
with my injuries,

170
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,840
I would have died for sure.

171
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,120
So I escaped.

172
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,400
I didn't expect that the next day,

173
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,480
Official Zhang

174
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,840
issued an arrest warrant.

175
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,160
I was inexperienced,

176
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,840
and afraid.

177
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,520
So I ran.

178
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,400
I didn't dare come back.

179
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,600
Even if I did,

180
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,920
I couldn't show my face.

181
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,040
That's

182
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,000
the whole story.

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,880
Official Meng,

184
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,720
so, Official Meng,

185
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
when you reviewed the files,

186
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,720
did you find

187
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,280
who really killed Wang Cheng?

188
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,920
Who is the true culprit?

189
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,200
The murderer who killed Wang Cheng

190
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,680
is still unknown.

191
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,240
But it is certainly not Li Ling.

192
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,600
I have reviewed the case files

193
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,600
and questioned the coroner who examined the body.

194
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,240
Wang Cheng was killed by having his neck forcefully twisted.

195
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,600
After that,

196
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,840
he was hung from the beam.

197
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,640
It was made to look like a suicide.

198
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,320
But Li Ling is just a simple traveling merchant.

199
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,040
He is not strong enough to harm anyone.

200
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,360
He absolutely lacks such strength.

201
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,840
As for Wang Cheng,

202
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,800
he died in his own room.

203
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,560
That day, Wang Cheng had an argument with Li Ling.

204
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,400
Everyone in the Wang family

205
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,760
already considered Li Ling an enemy.

206
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,000
How could Li Ling

207
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,480
enter Wang Cheng's room unnoticed?

208
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,080
Official Zhang,

209
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,040
do you not know

210
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,800
that the Han Dynasty Legal Code states

211
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,560
if there is any doubt,

212
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,000
one must not convict rashly?

213
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,280
Official Meng,

214
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,680
according to what you said,

215
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,840
I

216
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,000
will thoroughly reinvestigate this case.

217
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,760
The real murderer of Wang Cheng

218
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,880
must be pursued further.

219
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,360
They will be brought to justice.

220
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,320
Of course.

221
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,560
Husband,

222
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,200
it's been a long time.

223
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
Miss Zhang,

224
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,760
please behave yourself.

225
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,240
You lowly maid,

226
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,320
did you not announce the master's return?

227
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,000
This maid

228
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,800
spread rumors that day.

229
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,600
I kept her by my side as a warning.

230
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,760
What,

231
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,800
Miss Jia, do you have a problem with that?

232
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,960
You—

233
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,840
Ronger,

234
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,440
it's not the right time yet.

235
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,480
Official Zhang

236
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,120
I am the Jiaozhi Pearl Envoy.

237
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,040
Do I qualify to enter the Pearl God Tournament?

238
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,760
Of course, no problem.

239
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,160
Wait.

240
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,920
I withdraw.

241
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,720
I concede.

242
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,720
How dare you!

243
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,440
The Pearl God Tournament

244
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,800
is not child's play.

245
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,960
I thought the Pearl God Tournament

246
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,600
was just a simple bet.

247
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,320
I didn't expect it to be so complicated.

248
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,960
I concede.

249
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,920
Boss Zhu

250
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,480
You're really unfair.

251
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,520
I've lost everything.

252
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,800
That's right.

253
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,120
Are you all working together

254
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,080
to cheat us out of our silver?

255
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,080
Yes, losing money.

256
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,640
Losing money, losing money!

257
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,680
Quiet, all of you!

258
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,920
Anyone else wants to withdraw?

259
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,680
Step forward now.

260
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,440
Fengxian Pearl House

261
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,120
requests Official Zhang

262
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,160
to allow us to withdraw.

263
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,000
I concede as well.

264
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,600
Withdraw.

265
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,400
Longyang Pearl House also withdraws.

266
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,600
Approved.

267
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
Anyone else?

268
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,880
Official Zhang

269
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,800
The capital for Li Pearl House

270
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,040
comes from the Li family.

271
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,200
Lingyun Pearl House and Li Pearl House

272
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,600
are both owned by Li Ling.

273
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,280
So the two of us request

274
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,200
that Lingyun Pearl House and Li Pearl House

275
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,200
be merged for this Pearl God Tournament

276
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,160
into one.

277
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,080
Li Ling will act as the Pearl Envoy

278
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,240
to complete the competition.

279
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,680
Jiaozhi Li Pearl House

280
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,440
agrees.

281
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,280
Alright, approved.

282
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,080
Proceed with this change.

283
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,160
Let's continue.

284
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,640
Wait a moment.

285
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,400
Official Zhang

286
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,320
What is it now?

287
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,360
Since I've defended myself for so long

288
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,480
and am proven innocent,

289
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,840
shouldn't Li Pearl House

290
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,640
be unsealed now?

291
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,760
Approved.

292
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,520
Also,

293
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,200
I've been working hard outside for so long.

294
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,680
Shouldn't I go back

295
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,000
and recover a bit?

296
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,320
So I can compete in my best condition.

297
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,120
To show respect for the Pearl God Tournament

298
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,960
and for you, Official Zhang.

299
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,160
Li Ling, are you

300
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,800
trying to cause trouble for me?

301
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,440
Official Zhang,

302
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,920
my match with Zhang Ji

303
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,760
is the decisive battle for the Pearl God.

304
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,400
If it's rushed,

305
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,280
it won't convince anyone.

306
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,320
Don't you agree,

307
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,360
Official Meng?

308
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,840
Yes, Official Zhang.

309
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,440
The ownership of the Pearl God is important.

310
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,920
I think we should be cautious.

311
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,520
Alright.

312
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,200
Three days from now,

313
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,040
one battle will decide the Pearl God.

314
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,320
Hurry up and follow!
