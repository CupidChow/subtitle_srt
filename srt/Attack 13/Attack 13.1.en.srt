1
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:22,083
You want to awaken the dead?

2
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,500
ONE WEEK EARLIER

3
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:30,958
SIRIRAT PRACHASUN SCHOOL

4
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,458
PHRANAKORN PITTAYAKOM SCHOOL

5
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,458
Don't leave yet. We need to talk.

6
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,833
Can't even handle a bit of water?

7
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,333
You're some rich bitch, aren't you?

8
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,208
Swallow it!

9
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,958
Come on. Swallow it all down.

10
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,333
Your family's rich.

11
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,625
Why can't you give me money?

12
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,125
You won't give me money,
then just keep drinking!

13
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,583
Why? You gonna die from a little water?

14
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,208
Faker, swallow it!

15
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,291
Just wait…

16
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,000
Tonight, I'll have my dad bring it.

17
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,583
You better.

18
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,208
You've bailed too many times!

19
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,125
Yah!

20
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,083
Are you alright? Are you alright?

21
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,875
I have some tea to spill.

22
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,000
Spill it!

23
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,041
Yah said she was sick.

24
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,416
Liar.

25
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:52,333
Her dad hasn’t wired the money,
so she skipped school

26
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,041
because she’s too scared to face you.

27
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:01,125
This evening at the gym, take her there.

28
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,916
For now, you’ll make up
for messing up in the game.

29
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,000
Let go!

30
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:13,916
Let go.

31
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,125
Let go.

32
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,333
Teacher's here!

33
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,916
Class, we have a new student today.

34
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,416
Introduce yourself.

35
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,416
I'm Jindahra. You can call me Jin.

36
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,416
I transferred
from a sports school in the North.

37
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,375
My mom got a job here,
so I moved with her.

38
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,041
She’s joining mid-semester,

39
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,541
so let’s help her settle in quickly.

40
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:57,041
Wait. Jin? The volleyball captain?

41
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,416
I think I saw your interview on TV.

42
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,791
‪-Is that her?
‪-Wow, the volleyball captain.

43
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,916
Jin, take the seat next to Orasa.

44
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,166
‪Hey, are we even gonna concentrate today?

45
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,083
What did the coach
call you in to talk about?

46
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,583
Nothing much.

47
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,666
He just said he wants me to train harder,

48
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,791
so that I can compete in the next match.

49
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,125
What's wrong?

50
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,291
Is something up?

51
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,416
Once you're on the team,
just keep a low profile, okay?

52
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,083
I’m just…

53
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,750
worried if…

54
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,750
Jin, remember me? Hong.

55
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:01,833
We were in middle school together.

56
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,541
Hong?

57
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,916
It's been ages. You’re studying here?

58
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Mind if I sit?

59
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:07,916
Go ahead.

60
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,916
How have you been?

61
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,500
Same old. You?

62
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,500
I’m good. And…

63
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,166
I just stepped in dog shit.

64
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,125
Take your shoe off. I’ll wipe it.

65
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,125
Give me one more day.

66
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,000
My dad said--

67
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,500
Get up.

68
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,083
I said get up.

69
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,916
Let’s have a match.

70
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,541
If I lose, I’ll take her place.

71
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,541
But if you lose, you stop all of this.

72
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,000
You!

73
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,041
You!

74
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,250
Enough already!

75
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,250
What’s going on here?

76
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,250
Have nothing better to do than fight?

77
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,708
Bussaba, wait up.

78
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,750
How does it taste?

79
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:29,958
Good.

80
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,708
I’ll cover this meal.
Consider it a welcome for Jin.

81
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,083
Didn’t you just pay your dorm fees?

82
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,833
Let me pay instead.

83
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:40,750
Nah.

84
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,625
If you’re paying,
it should be more expensive.

85
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,791
Be serious. Do you have any money?

86
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,750
Did your part-time job pay you already?

87
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,583
Just got my rent money.

88
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,083
Hey, you shouldn't…

89
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,041
Come on. We finally meet again.
Let me treat you.

90
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,708
You two were friends before?

91
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,166
Snitch on me that I'm taking money again,

92
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,416
you’re dead!

93
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,625
<i>We went to the same middle school.</i>

94
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,208
Hong!

95
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,791
What the fuck!

96
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,208
<i>This girl bullied me all the time.</i>

97
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,750
One day, I fought back.

98
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,666
Then the bully didn’t dare again.

99
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,083
- You!
- Oh, this bitch!

100
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,625
Hearing about you and Hong

101
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,500
kinda makes me wanna get back at Bussaba.

102
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,000
There are so many of us.

103
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,125
Why can’t we take her on?

104
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,583
When you fought back,
she stopped bullying you, right?

105
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,000
Tell me about Bussaba.

106
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,416
Why isn't she afraid of anyone?

107
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
She even pulled that shit in the gym.

108
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,458
She’s a year above us.

109
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,583
She’s always been awful, but not this bad.

110
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,625
Then she dropped out for a year.

111
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,958
From what I heard…

112
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,250
she got an abortion.

113
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,708
When she came back,
dunno what got into her,

114
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,041
but she’s worse than ever.

115
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,916
Probably have nothing left to lose,

116
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,958
already had an abortion.

117
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,833
Sucks for us.
We’re stuck in the same class.

118
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,791
And she’s our team captain.

119
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,250
Do the teachers know?

120
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah, and so what?

121
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,291
She’s pretty, smart,

122
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,958
and always leads the team to victory.

123
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,791
She’s the teachers' favorite.

124
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,583
Gotta go to the bathroom.

125
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,208
Wanna use this? I’m done.

126
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,125
You’re in Grade 12, right?

127
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,333
Are you new here?

128
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,583
Yeah, first day.

129
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,000
Jin.

130
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,375
Stay away from him.

131
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,083
That's Gunn, Bussaba's boyfriend.

132
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,750
If she knew, you'd be screwed.

133
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,083
I'm hungry.

134
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,583
What'd you like?

135
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,875
I don't know. Let's see.

136
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:02,916
Let's see.

137
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,166
‪I'm hungry.

138
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,625
We need to talk.

139
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,791
At the rooftop.

140
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,166
I'll catch up.

141
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,250
Just spit it out.

142
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,375
Yesterday, the coach called me in.

143
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,000
He said one more problem,
he’ll revoke my uni quota.

144
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,458
And he doesn’t care who started it.

145
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,416
So? If you're not over it,

146
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,916
wanna fight and settle this?

147
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,333
Once we leave here, consider it done.

148
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,541
Hey!

149
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,666
You feel pain, bitch?

150
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,250
You better kill me, Jin.

151
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,791
If I make it out of here…

152
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:30,708
TODAY, 2.10 P.M.

153
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,958
ALREADY SENT IT. WHY MORE?

154
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,791
I'M STARTING TO HAVE
A FETISH WITH YOUR LEGS

155
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,500
SO, WHEN WILL YOU COME TO SEE ME?

156
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,875
SEND A PHOTO OF YOUR FACE FIRST

157
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,000
WHERE AND WHEN?

158
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,083
<i>Jin.</i>

159
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,291
Huh?

160
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,458
<i>Hello? I asked how</i>
<i>your talk went with Bussaba. So?</i>

161
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:18,958
<i>What'cha doing?</i>

162
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,000
She called a truce

163
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,541
because she didn't want
to lose her university quota.

164
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,000
Fine by me. I don’t need drama either.

165
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,625
<i>Damn, that chat’s totally one-sided.</i>

166
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,458
<i>Is that the Discord guy?</i>

167
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,541
COME, I WANNA SEE U
I CAN SEND YOU A PIC OF MY THIGH

168
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,166
We just like vinyls, that’s all.

169
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,458
He doesn't think of me like that.

170
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,833
FORGET THE MOLE
WANNA SEE YOUR FACEEEEE

171
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,166
What’s up?

172
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,875
I took a tutoring gig.

173
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,791
I don't wanna take Yah's money anymore.

174
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,708
And today’s the first session.

175
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,458
Can you come with me?

176
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,041
I don’t wanna go alone. I’m scared.

177
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,041
What about your friends?

178
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,791
No idea. They disappeared.

179
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,250
Why not ask your boyfriend?

180
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,791
I caught him chatting with someone else.

181
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,250
Now we’re fighting.

182
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,583
I’ve got no one else.

183
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:21,666
Hey.

184
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,750
The kid you're tutoring lives here?

185
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,875
Yeah, that building over there.

186
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,166
Go in by yourself.

187
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,375
What? Ditching me now?

188
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:43,000
If the house isn’t sketchy,
and the parents are fine,

189
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,125
I won’t bother you next time.

190
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:49,916
Hello? Yes.

191
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,583
Oh, I’m here.

192
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,250
Going in now. Yes.

193
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:55,875
Okay.

194
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,250
Yeah, I’m here.

195
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,458
Alright, heading in.

196
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:09,375
Come!

197
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:27,625
Let's go.

198
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:34,541
Come in. Come in!

199
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,000
Come on in.

200
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:39,625
Come here.

201
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,166
Let me go!

202
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:11,708
Let go!

203
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:27,791
Where are you going?

204
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,708
You tried to prostitute me?

205
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,791
Is this how you wanna play?

206
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:10,875
Where’s your proof?

207
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:23,666
Are you guys gonna back me up?

208
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,291
This bitch started the fight with me.

209
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:52,375
Why are you standing there?
Go buy me a new one.

210
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,500
<i>Hello? What’s up, Jin?</i>

211
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:01,708
Mom, I wanna transfer schools.

212
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,875
<i>Transfer? You just got there.</i>

213
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,458
It happened again.

214
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:09,583
Worse this time. I can’t take it.

215
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,958
<i>You’re a big girl now.</i>
<i>You can’t keep running away.</i>

216
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,041
<i>I’ll talk to your teacher</i>
<i>when I’m done with work.</i>

217
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:34,708
YOU FREE?

218
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:39,541
Go!

219
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,083
Pass it, pass it.

220
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,083
- Awesome!
- Sick move!

221
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,916
- That was great.
- Nice one. Okay.

222
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,375
Keep playing, guys.

223
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:58,666
- Well played.
- Okay.

224
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:19,750
Oh?

225
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:23,500
Didn't even look at my face?

226
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,583
Here, wipe it off.

227
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:32,625
Oh, come on!

228
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:33,833
What?

229
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:36,375
I don't have practice today.

230
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:38,500
Wanna go see a movie?
The one you wanted to watch.

231
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,208
My treat.

232
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:44,041
I can't today.

233
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,416
Gotta run an errand for my mom.

234
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:48,416
What is it?

235
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,208
Can I come? I can go back by myself.

236
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,666
Maybe next time.

237
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,291
Promise. I'll go with you.

238
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:03,166
Not secretly meeting another girl, right?

239
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:10,291
I only have you.

240
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,958
Who else would I want?

241
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:24,291
Stop it. People might see.

242
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,208
Come on. I'll walk you to your dorm.

243
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,208
I'M HERE. WHERE ARE YOU?

244
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:50,333
TBH, I WANNA MEET YOU
BUT I’M SCARED YOU’LL HIT AND RUN

245
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,750
WE GO TO THE SAME SCHOOL
WHY THE NERVES?

246
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,625
'COURSE I'M GENUINE

247
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,750
You’re fucking with a girl from school?

248
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:22,958
You don’t give a damn about me?

249
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:25,125
If no one screenshotted the chat to me,

250
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,041
how'd I know what you said about me?

251
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,458
You’re with me ‘cause I pay for you!
‘Cause I was easy!

252
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:30,875
‘Cause you pitied me!

253
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,708
What a saint you are, huh?

254
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:35,208
If you’re so good,
tell me who’s your side hoe.

255
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,666
Who is she?

256
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,375
Who?! Tell me now!

257
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:39,416
Fuck!

258
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,583
What side hoe? Huh?

259
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,583
And who the hell are you? My wife?

260
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:50,125
Don’t tell me you thought
we’d get married and have kids.

261
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,958
That’s dumb as hell.

262
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:56,708
Once we graduate,
we won’t even know each other.

263
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,125
So, you never loved me.

264
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:21,750
Shit!

265
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:42,416
Hey! Hey!

266
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:47,333
You deserve to die, Gunn!

267
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:49,125
What the hell?!

268
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:51,000
Let me go!

269
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:53,500
Let go!

270
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,125
Drop dead, fucker!

271
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:03,958
Let me go!

272
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,208
Move, Bussaba!

273
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:10,000
Bussaba, stop!

274
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:14,791
<i>You made a name for the school,</i>

275
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,875
<i>but this is an attempted murder.</i>

276
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,750
<i>Just leave. Don’t make this harder for us.</i>

277
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,708
NAME: BUSSABA CHAUM
BORN: 13 MARCH, 2006; DIED: 13 MARCH, 2025

278
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:19,083
Can't forward it.
I got it from my connection.

279
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:20,333
This is all you get.

280
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,083
Knowing she hanged herself is enough.

281
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,750
I don’t see why they had to show me.

282
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,166
The clip's haunting me.

283
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:29,916
What’s wrong?

284
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,416
I have a migraine.

285
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,500
Can I leave early?

286
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,166
I’ll take you home.

287
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,500
Jin has to stay as team rep.

288
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:41,500
Just tell the teacher for us.

289
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:42,916
Let me know when you get home.

290
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:52,625
Hey, no way.

291
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:54,625
Stay here with me.

292
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,750
VOLLEYBALL CLUB
PHRANAKORN PITTAYAKOM SCHOOL

293
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,916
No way that coffin just fell on its own.

294
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:24,791
Maybe it wasn’t placed right
or something hit it.

295
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:28,916
I know you’re trying to comfort Jin.

296
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,583
Could you make it sound more convincing?

297
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:38,625
No… People always say they hear things,

298
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:39,916
that they smell incense and stuff,

299
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,083
but I could never sense anything.

300
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:46,250
When I was a baby,
I had colic. Like, I cried nonstop

301
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:48,625
until I was five or six months old.

302
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:52,458
Mom had some ritual done
and fed me something weird.

303
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:54,916
Maybe my ghost radar is busted.

304
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,541
Shit, that’s even creepier.

305
00:36:57,625 --> 00:37:01,416
When a ghost comes,
you’d be a sitting duck.

306
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,291
Oh, enough, guys!

307
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:06,041
We’re here to help Jin not feel scared,

308
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:08,166
but now we’re scaring ourselves.

309
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,625
Go to sleep, alright?

310
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:10,833
Don’t overthink it.

311
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:25,416
Here, let's hold hands for comfort.

312
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:27,791
Wake me up if anything happens.

313
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:09,208
Jin.

314
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:11,625
Jin.

315
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:13,750
Jin.

316
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:17,541
Jin.

317
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,375
Orn, Orn, Orn!

318
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:54,333
Orn.

319
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,458
What's wrong, Orn?

320
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:57,625
Nightmare?

321
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,583
No, it wasn't a dream. It was her.

322
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:03,458
Bussaba hung herself right here.

323
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:10,000
There's nothing.

324
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,041
Jin.

325
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:49,208
It's your duty.

326
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:51,666
If not you, then who else will?

327
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,958
Oh?

328
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,416
If anyone can do it, why don't you, huh?

329
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,333
There's no way I'm touching these things.

330
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:00,708
Do you need me to call the principal?

331
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:05,416
Fine! At most, I'll quit!

332
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:11,166
You girls clear the court
and start practicing.

333
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,208
Don't say I'm abusing the elderly,

334
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:14,416
but this has gone too far.

335
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,958
I need to report this to the principal.

336
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:25,416
What are these things, Auntie?

337
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,583
A spirit summoning ritual.

338
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,166
Summon for what?

339
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:35,166
To kill who they hold grudges against.

340
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:37,333
This is wicked stuff.

341
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:39,833
Burnt like this,

342
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,750
It means they succeeded.

343
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:44,875
In three days…

344
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:48,666
the spirit will hunt its victims.

345
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,166
The first two days…

346
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,333
it will haunt them
until they can't take it.

347
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:58,041
By the third day,

348
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:01,666
it will attack to kill.

349
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:05,458
Even ordaining won't save them.

350
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:14,166
Don't know how good this shaman is.

351
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,125
<i>If they're an expert, then it's fine.</i>

352
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:18,000
<i>But it'll be bad if it's a rookie</i>

353
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:20,291
<i>because it'll be uncontrollable.</i>

354
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:21,583
<i>Why is uncontrollable bad, Auntie?</i>

355
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:24,916
<i>It's like releasing</i>
<i>a rabid dog to attack whoever.</i>

356
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:27,500
Next.

357
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,625
Here, keep going.

358
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:02,583
Yah!

359
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:05,791
Yah, Yah, Yah!

360
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:06,875
Leave me alone.

361
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:08,708
Yah. Yah.

362
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,583
Yah. Yah.

363
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:13,583
Yah.

364
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:15,000
Yah, what's wrong?

365
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:17,000
Yah, Yah, Yah!

366
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:21,458
You! You! You!

367
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:24,166
- Come on, bitch!
- Yah!

368
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,250
Get off! Get off!

369
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:29,250
What's wrong with you?!

370
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:54,083
If you don't believe me,
why bother asking?

371
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:58,541
I said I wasn't hallucinating.

372
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:03,583
The lady janitor
said that the first two days,

373
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:06,041
the ghost will haunt us relentlessly.

374
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:08,875
Or is this the first day?

375
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:13,291
It happened like I said, right?

376
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:18,000
I think it's nothing.

377
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,041
But you totally overreacted.

378
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,250
It made all of us paranoid.

379
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:58,208
DIE

380
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:10,666
DIE IN AGONY

381
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:16,083
GUNN

382
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:40,041
Shit!

383
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:51,666
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

384
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,291
Get up, get up.

385
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,083
Get up.

386
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:26,875
It's locked.

387
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:28,666
How do you open this?!

388
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,208
Shit, who locked it? Open it!

389
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:38,791
Open it! Open it!

390
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:40,958
- Hurry up!
- Open it!

391
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:14,208
- Really? You got attacked too?
- Yeah.

392
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,375
See, I told you.

393
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,083
Bussaba really came back.

394
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:20,375
Where are we going?

395
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:21,916
To see a shaman.

396
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,291
<i>My dad has arranged it.</i>

397
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:52,916
Someone really awakened the dead.

398
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:56,625
This is no ordinary ghost.

399
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,625
It is very vicious.

400
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,416
What did you do to make it so vengeful?

401
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:10,500
No one did anything to her, Master.

402
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:12,958
She's already crazy.

403
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:14,958
She just became worse as a spirit.

404
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:16,750
Is there any solution?

405
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,625
Hand me the sacred dagger.

406
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:09,791
Master! Master!

407
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:18,833
Master! Master!

408
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:26,250
Master!

409
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:30,166
Find the spirit summoner.

410
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:35,375
Cover him and the occult item
with vile water.

411
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:37,250
Or just kill him.

412
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:39,625
You must do it within three days.

413
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:43,333
Or all of you will die.

414
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:47,500
Give them the vile water.

415
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:53,083
What is vile water?

416
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:54,041
Piss.

417
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:56,291
It's not his piss.

418
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:57,625
He has diabetes.

419
00:49:57,708 --> 00:50:00,875
It's a virgin's urine
that has been blessed.

420
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:13,250
That was terrifying.

421
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,083
Yeah.

422
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,083
Guys…

423
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:34,833
Who do you think
summoned Bussaba's spirit?

424
00:50:40,625 --> 00:50:43,791
Tomorrow after the exam,
come stay at my place.

425
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,750
Strength in number and all.

426
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:49,375
We'll figure
something out once things settle.

427
00:50:54,666 --> 00:50:55,916
Could it be Mew and Mind?

428
00:50:57,958 --> 00:51:01,041
You couldn't tell.
Those two hated Bussaba's guts.

429
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:04,958
They acted as her lackeys,
hoping she would bully them less.

430
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:10,750
Or maybe…

431
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,041
Coach?

432
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:26,208
Bussaba hooking up with the coach
is old news at school.

433
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,375
No worries about Gunn getting mad.

434
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:35,125
I think Bussaba’s dad is more suspicious.

435
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,875
He didn’t even show up
to his daughter's funeral.

436
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:39,666
Isn't that kinda strange?

437
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:42,500
Bussaba once told me…

438
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:45,916
her dad dabbles in dark magic.

439
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:49,458
Maybe he brought
her back to do his bidding.

440
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:52,708
What kind of father would do that?

441
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:56,875
A shitty person would go that far.

442
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:59,333
I took Bussaba home once.

443
00:52:00,541 --> 00:52:02,041
Her dad was black-out drunk.

444
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:05,416
Every time he was,
he'd beat her like a dog.

445
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:10,916
That’s why she ran away
to live in the dorm.

446
00:52:23,375 --> 00:52:25,875
Strange things happened
at the funeral, right?

447
00:52:25,958 --> 00:52:27,375
The next morning,

448
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:30,250
ritual items were found
under the basketball hoop.

449
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,791
That means the ritual
must’ve happened that night.

450
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:40,000
And Bussaba’s dad wasn’t at the funeral

451
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:42,333
because he was performing
the ritual in the gym.

452
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:47,583
That night…
Yah and Hong weren’t there either.

453
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:53,041
I have a migraine. Can I leave early?

454
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:54,500
I'll take you home.

455
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,000
<i>Are we so scared of ghosts</i>

456
00:52:58,666 --> 00:52:59,958
that we’re turning on each other?

457
00:53:00,041 --> 00:53:01,500
I wasn’t at the funeral either.

458
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,166
Where were you?

459
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:04,958
The hospital.

460
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:06,375
After she stabbed me.

461
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:08,000
My wound was about to heal,

462
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:12,583
but it suddenly reopened for no reason.

463
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:15,583
- A coincidence, huh?
- And you just happened to get a migraine?

464
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:16,875
Calm down.

465
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:20,125
Pointing fingers won’t get us anywhere.

466
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:25,416
After the exam tomorrow,
let’s search Bussaba’s house.

467
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,208
See if we can find anything on her dad.

468
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:30,375
If not, we move on to the coach.

469
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,208
I'm sorry.

470
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:57,958
I didn’t think things would get this bad.

471
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:12,708
Let's meet in front of the exam room.

472
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:19,833
Hurry up. We’re gonna be late.

473
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,541
Did someone move
into Bussaba’s room, Auntie?

474
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:37,500
Not yet. The teacher
told me to clear it out.

475
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:39,250
They couldn’t contact her parents.

476
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:41,041
Why don’t you go in?

477
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,875
I heard weird noises in there.

478
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,458
I'm scared, you know.

479
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:49,791
Want me to go in and do it?

480
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:17,500
INCORRECT PIN

481
00:56:41,125 --> 00:56:42,833
MYSTERY PERSON

482
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:54,375
FOR THE EXAM
BRINGS LUCK FOR STUDYING AND COMPETITIONS

483
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:12,458
DO YOU KNOW BUSSABA'S DEAD?

484
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:14,916
TYPING…

485
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:21,708
It’s exam time. Where is she?

486
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,083
I’ll call her.

487
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:25,000
Yeah.

488
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:30,958
Everyone, get to the exam room now.

489
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:33,833
Do you know what time it is?

490
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:37,208
Go.

491
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:47,541
TYPING…

492
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,250
CAN WE TALK?

493
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:01,041
Girl! You done packing?

494
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:02,250
Almost.

495
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:59,708
It's all over. Why don't you fuck off?!

496
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,000
ALL OF YOU MUST DIE!

497
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:42,541
I'm sorry, Auntie.

498
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,041
I haven’t got my exam paper.

499
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:48,458
- What’s going on?
- Where have you been?

500
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:51,208
Hey, quiet! Quiet down!

501
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:52,375
Everyone, quiet down!

502
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:57,250
I know you're all shaken
by the sudden loss of a friend,

503
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:58,666
and with the stress of exams,

504
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:01,291
it’s easy to start seeing things.

505
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:03,833
- Seeing things?
- What are you talking about?

506
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:05,791
- Quiet, quiet.
- I saw her, clear as day!

507
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:08,041
Calm down. Quiet, please.

508
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:10,875
Calm down. Calm down. Sit down. Calm down.

509
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:12,041
Coach.

510
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:13,958
Hold on a sec.

511
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:16,041
What?

512
01:01:16,625 --> 01:01:20,416
You know someone
conjured Bussaba's spirit, don’t you?

513
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,500
What?

514
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,333
What we saw wasn’t mass hysteria.

515
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,416
If Bussaba came back,

516
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,625
it’d be because she’s worried
about the exam.

517
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:34,083
Why are you two singling me out?

518
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,083
Let’s be real.

519
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:38,458
I think you’re the one who did it.

520
01:01:39,666 --> 01:01:40,875
You might’ve loved her so much

521
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:42,625
- and couldn’t let her go!
- Stop!

522
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:43,708
That’s nonsense.

523
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:46,916
You and Bussaba had an affair.
Everyone knows.

524
01:02:10,666 --> 01:02:13,291
Everybody knows? Darn…

525
01:02:15,291 --> 01:02:16,541
The girl was asking for it.

526
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:18,125
What was I supposed to do?

527
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,333
At first, sure,
I had to use a little force.

528
01:02:22,416 --> 01:02:27,166
But after that? It got easy.

529
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,541
She said she wanted to be a quota athlete.

530
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:36,750
I made that happen for her. So what?

531
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:39,416
And if I really did bring her back…

532
01:02:40,458 --> 01:02:41,750
it wouldn’t be out of love.

533
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,875
I just couldn’t get enough of her.

534
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:47,750
- What the hell are you saying?!
- Shut up, bastard!

535
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:50,666
I know you want her too.

536
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,041
Huh? Huh?

537
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:57,708
What?

538
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:01,333
Who wanna suck this, huh?

539
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:15,041
Shit!

540
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,500
- What the hell! Stop. Stop!
- Stop this! Stop!

541
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:19,833
Are you insane?

542
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:22,791
Stop! Stop!

543
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:29,750
Shit!

544
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:39,083
Go! Go!

545
01:03:40,791 --> 01:03:42,416
- Come on.
- Hurry.

546
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:57,125
Here it is.

547
01:04:19,166 --> 01:04:20,583
It won’t open. We’ll break it down.

548
01:04:25,541 --> 01:04:26,833
Hey, this window.

549
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:55,666
When she was alive, he beat her.

550
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:58,041
Now she’s dead,

551
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:02,250
he still raised
her spirit for his obsession.

552
01:05:07,916 --> 01:05:10,541
These items must be
what he used to summon her.

553
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:14,208
We'll tear it all down.

554
01:05:45,416 --> 01:05:46,583
Hey!

555
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,666
You fuckers!

556
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,500
You’re screwing with my shit!

557
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:07,833
The fuck's wrong with you?!

558
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:19,833
What is this shit?!

559
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:38,375
Where are you going?

560
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:49,291
Put the knife down!

561
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:50,708
No! Stay back!

562
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:11,583
Jin!

563
01:07:13,208 --> 01:07:14,208
The voodoo doll!

564
01:07:16,583 --> 01:07:18,833
Jin, pour it now!

565
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:20,041
Do it!

566
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:21,125
Now!

567
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:40,583
What the fuck?

568
01:07:59,041 --> 01:07:59,875
Shit!

569
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:04,291
SERVING THE PEOPLE

570
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:16,583
Why didn’t you go back
to the dorm with Hong?

571
01:08:18,458 --> 01:08:20,291
I still have something to attend to.

572
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:22,791
It’s not over yet?

573
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:26,166
We did everything the shaman told us.

574
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,791
And the summoner is dead.

575
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:35,500
It's probably nothing.

576
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,625
I’ll tell you tomorrow.

577
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:39,625
Yah, come home, dear.

578
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:14,416
So, is this done?

579
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,083
Master said you guys did great,
really handled it.

580
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,375
Give it to me.

581
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:42,916
I’ll perform the spirit-sending ritual.

582
01:09:46,666 --> 01:09:48,750
Is the curse finally broken?

583
01:10:01,166 --> 01:10:03,666
You should make merit for her,

584
01:10:04,541 --> 01:10:06,541
so the ghost won’t hold a grudge.

585
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:29,833
May Bussaba and her father forgive us

586
01:10:31,416 --> 01:10:33,958
and refrain from holding grudges.

587
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:37,416
Sathu.

588
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:57,166
Bussaba's father
is really the worst of the worst.

589
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:04,208
Addicted to booze and gambling,
his wife left,

590
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:08,250
he sold the house, and rented from others.

591
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:12,375
Bussaba was left
to deal with all the crap.

592
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:19,208
Shit!

593
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:21,541
What?

594
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:23,000
It past the third night.

595
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:26,375
We’re safe! We made it!

596
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:31,000
It's such a relieve.

597
01:11:46,416 --> 01:11:47,625
My phone’s missing.

598
01:11:48,625 --> 01:11:51,250
I might have left it by the tree.

599
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:52,666
I’ll go with you.

600
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:55,625
It’s fine. I’ll be right back.

601
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:58,125
Okay, I'll wait in the car.

602
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,416
What is this and this?

603
01:12:31,916 --> 01:12:34,083
This is <i>Wan Phra-Ta-ba,</i>

604
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:37,250
to prevent ghosts and repel evil spirits.

605
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:39,125
This one is <i>Bia Kae,</i>

606
01:12:40,708 --> 01:12:42,583
to neutralize evil power.

607
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:48,291
What about this one?

608
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:51,541
Good eye, kiddo.

609
01:12:52,166 --> 01:12:54,750
This is called <i>Wild Boar Vomit.</i>

610
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:57,625
People might think
it’s just a lump of dirt,

611
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:01,125
but it’s actually
a rare and valuable item.

612
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:03,250
The best for protecting against ghosts.

613
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:09,166
<i>Find the spirit summoner. Cover him</i>

614
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,166
<i>and the occult item with vile water.</i>

615
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:13,625
<i>These items must be</i>
<i>what he used to summon her.</i>

616
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:20,541
I’ll give you these three
at a special price.

617
01:13:21,791 --> 01:13:24,833
It’s almost midnight. I might miss my bus.

618
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:33,083
11.58 P.M.

619
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:53,583
Even if you’re a lousy shaman,

620
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:57,041
you still lie pretty well.

621
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:40,541
Hello?

622
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:44,333
<i>How… did…</i>

623
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:47,541
Huh? What did you say?

624
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:52,375
<i>How did Bussaba die?</i>

625
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:54,708
Shit!

626
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:19,916
Shit!

627
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:21,666
Shit!

628
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:26,375
Shit, the lock!

629
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:31,583
Let me go!

630
01:15:33,833 --> 01:15:34,666
Let me go!

631
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:44,041
Let go… Fuck!

632
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,000
No!

633
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:48,708
Shit! No!

634
01:15:54,208 --> 01:15:55,791
Fuck!

635
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:03,291
Gunn?

636
01:16:07,208 --> 01:16:08,041
Gunn.

637
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,750
Gunn. Gunn, are you okay? Gunn?

638
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:15,083
Gunn!

639
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:19,333
Open the door, Gunn. Can you open it?

640
01:16:19,416 --> 01:16:20,875
Gunn.

641
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:24,208
Gunn.

642
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:26,250
Open the door!

643
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:27,666
Can you open it, Gunn?

644
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:36,958
Gunn! Look out!

645
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:47,166
Come on!

646
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:57,208
Watch out!

647
01:17:18,416 --> 01:17:21,041
- Gunn! Gunn!
- No! No!

648
01:17:21,125 --> 01:17:23,625
No! No!

649
01:17:25,666 --> 01:17:26,666
No!

650
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,250
Gunn!

651
01:17:28,916 --> 01:17:30,500
No! No! No!

652
01:17:30,583 --> 01:17:31,416
No!

653
01:17:32,416 --> 01:17:33,708
No!

654
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,666
IT’S NOT OVER. MEET AT BUSSABA’S

655
01:19:19,666 --> 01:19:23,125
HONG

656
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,041
Hong, what is it?

657
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:30,541
<i>Orn. The curse isn’t over yet.</i>

658
01:19:30,625 --> 01:19:31,458
What?

659
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:36,583
PRAYER

660
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,333
<i>Yah.</i>

661
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:00,416
<i>Yah.</i>

662
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,250
Orn?

663
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,125
IT’S NOT OVER. MEET AT BUSSABA’S

664
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:49,791
Orn?

665
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:56,833
Orn?

666
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,166
Shit!

667
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:27,208
Shit!

668
01:21:33,625 --> 01:21:35,041
It already past midnight.

669
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:23,916
<i>Yah.</i>

670
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:39,625
DAY 3

671
01:23:23,041 --> 01:23:23,916
Mom!

672
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,083
Mom!

673
01:23:34,125 --> 01:23:35,333
Yah?

674
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:38,666
What's going on, Yah?

675
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,000
What was that noise?

676
01:23:44,791 --> 01:23:46,750
Yah, what's that noise?

677
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:47,875
Yah.

678
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:48,833
Are you okay, Yah?

679
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Yah!

680
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:52,791
Yah! Yah!

681
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,958
Mom, help me! It hurts!

682
01:23:56,625 --> 01:23:58,541
Yah, what's going on? Yah?

683
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:01,333
Mom, help me!

684
01:24:04,958 --> 01:24:06,083
Yah!

685
01:24:10,416 --> 01:24:11,791
Yah!

686
01:24:13,583 --> 01:24:14,541
Yah!

687
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:18,916
Yah! Yah!

688
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,083
Yah! Yah!

689
01:24:52,166 --> 01:24:54,458
Jin texted us to meet
at Bussaba’s house, didn’t she?

690
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:58,625
I know how to stop the curse.

691
01:24:59,416 --> 01:25:01,833
I already talked to Jin
before I called you.

692
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:06,833
All of this started with Bussaba’s death.

693
01:25:08,041 --> 01:25:10,666
To stop Bussaba,
we must return to where it started,

694
01:25:12,125 --> 01:25:14,333
where she took her life.

695
01:25:53,708 --> 01:25:55,375
<i>Bussaba's father…</i>

696
01:25:56,583 --> 01:25:58,666
<i>He sold the house and rented from others.</i>

697
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:00,291
Just got my rent money.

698
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:02,333
<i>Someone really awakened the dead.</i>

699
01:26:03,041 --> 01:26:05,833
<i>This is no ordinary ghost.</i>

700
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:08,458
<i>Jin.</i>

701
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:10,125
The voodoo doll!

702
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:11,333
Pour it!

703
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:19,875
Use incense and blood to call Bussaba.

704
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:22,208
Call her for what?

705
01:26:24,916 --> 01:26:25,750
I think…

706
01:26:27,958 --> 01:26:29,500
If we apologize nicely,

707
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:32,000
she might forgive us.

708
01:26:33,958 --> 01:26:35,625
I think we should wait for the others.

709
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,833
AT THE GYM YET?
ME AND HONG ARE HERE

710
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:51,000
Shit.

711
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:54,250
No one’s coming.

712
01:26:55,791 --> 01:26:56,833
Everyone’s dead already.

713
01:26:58,416 --> 01:26:59,750
But you just told me…

714
01:26:59,833 --> 01:27:01,916
There are only two of us left!

715
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,041
No way.

716
01:27:04,666 --> 01:27:06,333
If we sit around,
we're just waiting to die.

717
01:27:07,041 --> 01:27:09,833
I think doing what we can
is better, right?

718
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:27,125
You… You told me that…

719
01:27:28,125 --> 01:27:29,500
you can’t see ghosts.

720
01:27:32,333 --> 01:27:34,333
That’s why we need your blood.

721
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:36,583
What if she comes and kills us?

722
01:27:37,333 --> 01:27:39,166
You've never done anything to her.

723
01:27:39,916 --> 01:27:40,916
Why are you so scared?

724
01:28:35,041 --> 01:28:36,166
Bussaba.

725
01:28:38,041 --> 01:28:39,250
Come out and talk to us.

726
01:28:50,541 --> 01:28:53,625
Bussaba, please come out.

727
01:28:54,333 --> 01:28:59,791
I represent Jin, Gunn, and Yah,

728
01:29:00,791 --> 01:29:02,750
and we apologize for killing you.

729
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:05,250
We didn’t mean to.

730
01:29:07,458 --> 01:29:08,541
You guys?

731
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:17,125
Is your brain rotting?

732
01:29:17,875 --> 01:29:20,458
It's this clear,
and you still ask me if it's me?

733
01:29:23,708 --> 01:29:24,708
What do you want from me?

734
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:31,958
I got disqualified from uni quota.

735
01:29:32,041 --> 01:29:34,875
The coach took my name off!
You took my boyfriend!

736
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:37,333
You took everything from me, Jin!

737
01:29:37,416 --> 01:29:38,750
What are you gonna do about it?

738
01:29:38,833 --> 01:29:41,250
You attacked me. Can't I swing back?

739
01:29:50,458 --> 01:29:52,166
I’m giving you one last chance.

740
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:55,291
Go tell the coach you set me up,

741
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:57,416
and stop flirting with my boyfriend.

742
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,541
Otherwise, I’ll kill you.

743
01:29:59,625 --> 01:30:01,208
You'll die.

744
01:30:01,291 --> 01:30:03,916
Your life is fucked,
and you're still threatening me?

745
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,583
You're so smart, huh?!

746
01:30:08,458 --> 01:30:10,625
Enough!

747
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:11,750
Let me go!

748
01:30:11,833 --> 01:30:13,250
I said, let me go!

749
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:17,166
You're so damn crazy.

750
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:18,791
You cheated on me.

751
01:30:19,375 --> 01:30:21,458
You got the guts to look me in the face?

752
01:30:24,583 --> 01:30:28,041
And you? How many times
did you fuck your coach?

753
01:30:28,875 --> 01:30:31,208
How pathetic you are.

754
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,208
Jin!

755
01:30:42,041 --> 01:30:43,041
Let go!

756
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:51,708
Watch out.

757
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:00,333
- Let me go.
- She aimed to kill.

758
01:31:00,416 --> 01:31:02,291
How could we let her go?

759
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:04,958
Let me go!

760
01:31:06,666 --> 01:31:07,666
Let me go.

761
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:10,000
Now I'm done.

762
01:31:10,958 --> 01:31:14,333
I’m really done.
I won’t mess with you anymore.

763
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:16,416
Just let me go.

764
01:31:18,041 --> 01:31:18,916
Are you sure?

765
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,166
You’re not going
to attack us again, are you?

766
01:31:24,041 --> 01:31:25,708
I have nothing left.

767
01:31:27,458 --> 01:31:29,333
I just want my life.

768
01:31:29,416 --> 01:31:32,333
You can’t even give me that?

769
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:52,041
I'll take you with me!

770
01:31:52,125 --> 01:31:52,958
Let go!

771
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:54,416
Let her go!

772
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:20,666
Shit!

773
01:32:45,583 --> 01:32:49,583
She ruined our lives when she lived.

774
01:32:51,208 --> 01:32:52,458
Now she’s dead…

775
01:32:55,208 --> 01:32:57,458
how can we let her destroy our future?

776
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:17,791
‪One, two…

777
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:20,208
- One, two…
- <i>It really was an accident,</i>

778
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:23,000
- One, two…
- <i>we had to stage her death.</i>

779
01:33:24,375 --> 01:33:25,458
Now!

780
01:33:32,916 --> 01:33:35,125
<i>We didn’t mean to keep it from you, okay?</i>

781
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:37,166
<i>You were working part-time that night.</i>

782
01:33:38,125 --> 01:33:40,125
The less people know, the better.

783
01:33:41,291 --> 01:33:42,833
You understand, right?

784
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:49,083
No wonder Bussaba was so vengeful.

785
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:51,958
She was killed by her ex and your gang.

786
01:33:53,458 --> 01:33:56,125
We didn’t mean for it to happen.

787
01:33:58,625 --> 01:34:01,000
When you staged it to look like a suicide,

788
01:34:01,083 --> 01:34:02,333
that wasn’t on purpose either?

789
01:34:03,166 --> 01:34:04,708
Yeah, we were wrong!

790
01:34:04,791 --> 01:34:06,083
What else could we do?

791
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:15,500
I think Bussaba must know by now.

792
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:19,333
Once she’s ready, she’ll come out.

793
01:34:20,458 --> 01:34:25,875
Hong, where did you learn
how to summon ghosts?

794
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:14,416
Finally met you.

795
01:36:03,291 --> 01:36:04,458
Why did you do this?

796
01:36:09,208 --> 01:36:11,875
And why did you awake Bussaba's spirt?

797
01:36:13,875 --> 01:36:15,708
So she can bully you again?

798
01:36:16,416 --> 01:36:18,083
She’s dead. Can’t you just let her go?

799
01:36:20,791 --> 01:36:22,291
Because I loved her.

800
01:36:24,125 --> 01:36:25,416
Why not?

801
01:36:30,708 --> 01:36:34,625
Oh wow, you’re really good.

802
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:38,083
You act like you’re the victim.

803
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:41,041
Though you did push
someone off a building.

804
01:36:41,666 --> 01:36:42,875
Did you forget?

805
01:36:42,958 --> 01:36:43,875
It was an accident.

806
01:36:43,958 --> 01:36:45,833
An accident you deliberately kept secret!

807
01:36:45,916 --> 01:36:47,500
What kind of accident is that?

808
01:37:02,166 --> 01:37:04,125
N.M.P.

809
01:37:04,208 --> 01:37:05,541
<i>She bullied you too.</i>

810
01:37:06,833 --> 01:37:09,666
When she died,
everyone secretly felt relieved.

811
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:19,541
But I'm not!

812
01:37:26,166 --> 01:37:27,791
When she was gone…

813
01:37:28,541 --> 01:37:29,375
<i>I…</i>

814
01:37:32,833 --> 01:37:33,833
<i>I felt…</i>

815
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,250
<i>so lonely, I wanted to die.</i>

816
01:37:39,166 --> 01:37:40,833
When I met Bussaba…

817
01:37:42,958 --> 01:37:43,791
Damn…

818
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:47,666
You killed the one I loved again.

819
01:37:53,041 --> 01:37:54,208
I said, get up.

820
01:37:58,666 --> 01:37:59,708
Get up.

821
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:02,166
I said, get up.

822
01:38:05,625 --> 01:38:06,791
But everything will be alright.

823
01:38:17,666 --> 01:38:20,291
You want to awake the dead?

824
01:38:26,666 --> 01:38:27,583
You crazy bitch!

825
01:39:20,916 --> 01:39:23,041
Where’s the object
that you summoned her with?

826
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:26,000
Tell me or I'll kill you.

827
01:39:56,666 --> 01:39:58,875
You want to make sure
that Bussaba's reborn?

828
01:40:01,375 --> 01:40:02,708
Don’t worry.

829
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:07,666
I’ll take your body!

830
01:40:36,708 --> 01:40:37,791
Hello, Mom?

831
01:40:42,291 --> 01:40:45,041
You don’t need to come.
I’ve cleared it all up.

832
01:41:02,125 --> 01:41:03,708
I just stepped in dog shit.

833
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:49,250
