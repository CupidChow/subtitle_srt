[Roommate Byeong Yeon]

That would be terrible.
[Just thinking about it is horrible]

926
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:08,270
[In Yeop] So I told her that...

It's been a long time.
[They arrived at Yonsei University]

Once Hye Won and Bo Yoon get in the car,

- It was up there.
- It's there. It's there. It's there.

937
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,340
In my opinion, since the umbrella scene was in the front there...

938
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,960
- Ah, the umbrella scene...
- Wait, isn't that them over there?

He can't contact us from the plane.
[Worried 22]

1384
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:58,870
[Lunch time ends as worry about Bo Gum arises]

1385
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:04,830
[One hour later]
[Boryeong Base Camp]

1386
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:14,200
[Team Moonlight arrives first]

1387
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:20,170
Did Bo Gum Oppa really not come yet?

1388
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:23,160
What if he's already here hanging out with the others?

1389
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,500
Already friendly with everyone, right?

1390
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,790
Keeps on hanging out with the other teams.

1391
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:31,130
- Not hanging out with us.
- I could imagine he would do that.

1392
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:34,240
[As they walk on talking about Bo Gum...]

1393
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:37,910
Is there really the cabin?
[Finds something]

1394
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,770
- There, it must be over there.
- Oh my goodness.

1395
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:43,060
I think we're the first ones here.

1396
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,820
There are a lot of tables over there.
[This place lies in wait for the three teams]

1397
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:46,240
- And a lot of chairs, too.
- Why are there so many?

1398
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,760
Are we going to sit on that side or this side? That side would be better, right?

1399
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,650
- Let's go to that side.
- Let's go to the very end over there.
- Nice.

1400
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:53,430
Oppa, the end over there.

1401
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:57,280
It's nice that we came in first.
[Shy Team Moonlight]

1402
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,510
Yes, we've arrived.
[takes the corner seat]

1403
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:02,800
Are we going to sleep here, Director?

1404
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,670
Are we going to sleep here, Director?

1405
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,650
[Park Bo Gum, the last teammate, shows up]

1406
01:07:16,850 --> 01:07:18,830
- What's this?
- What the heck!

1407
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:29,350
♫ Our shining friendship ♫

1408
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:32,610
♫ If we’re together ♫

1409
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:38,560
♫ In our youth ♫

1410
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,430
♫ Will always be here ♫

1411
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:48,480
♫ Oh happy day ♫

1412
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:54,270
♫ We make the way nobody goes ♫
