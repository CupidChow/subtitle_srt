Hello.

161
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,080
Hello. Welcome to DanBam!

162
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,380
[Greeting guests in the middle of talking]
Hello. Welcome to DanBam.

163
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,920
Tell us the order before you go.

164
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,710
She left in the middle of telling us the order.

165
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,210
I think we can just keep making the dishes.

166
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,520
A steak is out!

167
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,100
- A steak is out.
- Oh, okay.

168
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,290
Oh, hello!
[Suddenly turns around]

169
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,850
One flat-iron steak and...
[Quickly takes the guest's order first]

170
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,530
One flat iron steak?

171
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,950
One flat iron steak.
[Guests keep coming...]

172
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,600
[And the orders keep piling up...]

173
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,920
A flat iron steak?

174
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,880
A steak─

175
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,770
A steak is out...

176
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,870
[The unserved steaks keep piling up as well]

177
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,030
What do we do about the steaks?

178
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,300
There are two steaks done just hanging out here.

179
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,420
Oh, really? That won't do!

180
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,210
It's really hectic for her as well.

181
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,380
Nara– but seriously, serving by yourself is really hard.

182
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,910
[Other teams have two people in charge of taking orders and serving]

183
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,150
By chance– did you order a steak?
[Nara is struggling to handle it on her own]

184
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,780
I feel like Nara is going to make a mistake at this rate...

185
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,240
[Joo Young] Kyung Soo, if you have some spare time, you need to go help Nara.

186
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,560
I don't know where... I don't know where I need to go.

187
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,600
- You can ask Nara.
- Table 4...

188
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,500
[First, stepping out with the steaks]

189
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,800
- Hello, did you order a steak?
- Oh, yes!

190
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,250
- Did you order one?
- Yes.

191
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,370
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.
[Completes the delivery successfully]

192
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,130
- Excuse me...
- We–

193
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,480
- Is this supposed to be a set?
- Did you order–

194
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,300
- We ordered this, but we received two of them.
- We ordered one gambas and one steak.

195
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,510
Oh, really?

196
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,610
Then we'll give you this for free.

197
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,910
- You can just enjoy them all. Enjoy!
- Thank you.
[Unintentionally gave away one gambas for free]

198
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,460
What do we do?

199
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,550
One table received two gambas.

200
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,780
- What?
- And didn't get their order of steak.

201
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,660
- So I told them to just keep the extra gambas.
- Oh no.

202
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,460
You did well. You did well.

203
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,430
Gosh!

204
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,970
There is so much to do.
[Nara is getting dizzy going back and forth between taking orders and serving]

205
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,320
Joo Young, can you take this out there?

206
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,340
- Yeah, I'll go out there.
- Nara is overwhelmed right now.

207
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,700
[Joo Young came out to serve the gambas on Nara's behalf]

208
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,580
Where do we need to serve the gambas?

209
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,000
We just need to serve gambas to Table 9.

210
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,790
Not that table, but Table 9.

211
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,090
Oh...

212
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,010
What, what, what?

213
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,420
We need to find this number 9,

214
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,270
but I didn't write down the number 9 for the ones who sat down.

215
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,750
- What are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.

216
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,760
What are you talking about? Where do I go?

217
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,420
[The table numbers are already set]

218
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,420
[Nara gave table numbers based on the order in which guests ordered food]

219
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,030
[The numbers don't match]

220
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,790
I got confused. Sorry!

221
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,510
Wait a moment. They should be...
[Finding the customer with a number nine ticket given by Nara]

222
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,930
[Completely losing her mind]

223
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,020
By any chance...
[Timidly]

224
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,760
We're really sorry, but did anyone order a gambas and a beer?
[Public announcement]

225
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,210
We're really sorry, but did anyone order a gambas and a beer?

226
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,820
- Me!
- Gambas and–
- Did you order them both?

227
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,190
- Got it.
- We're sorry!
[Relieved]

228
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,680
What do we do?

229
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,160
On the order receipt, you need to write down the table number.

230
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,800
Oh, okay.

231
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,240
[While Nara is reorganizing the order receipts...]

232
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,790
Oh, okay. Then you can eat these together.

233
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,260
Enjoy!
[The gambas was served successfully]

234
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,270
Table four, six, seven...
[The order numbers are mixed up]

235
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,550
[The boss, who's been silently watching Nara in that state]

236
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,690
Looks like I'll have to step in.

237
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,360
Since she didn't write down the table numbers.
[Torch is off]

238
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,430
[Seo Joon] I think we should have two people in charge of the serving.

239
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,710
I'll just help out with serving.

240
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,300
Hey, Nara.

241
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,220
I'll help you.

242
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,440
- So, are these the orders that need to go out?
- Yeah.
[1. Understand the order status]

243
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,700
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...
[Verify the table number]

244
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,750
First, send out the order for Table 7,

245
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,540
then after organizing it, we can start taking each one off at a time here.
[3. Reset the order by table number]

246
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,080
- We need a total of five steaks!
- Five steaks!
[4. Deliver orders to the kitchen]

247
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,910
- Here, here. We're so sorry!
- We're sorry for the food coming out so late.
[5. Serve quickly]

248
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,190
- It's our first time, so...
- It looks good.

249
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,990
What an honor...

250
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,660
One, two, three!

251
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,160
[6. Friendly fan service]

252
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,280
- Oh, thank you!
- Thank you. Please enjoy your food.

253
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,560
I'm so excited.
[After returning from taking care of the urgent orders first...]

254
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,560
[The boss feels relieved]

255
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,750
[But Nara's eyes are trembling]

256
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,150
I'm sorry.

257
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,510
- No, no, no!
- No, no! It's your first time. How would you know–

258
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,200
You did well.

259
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,850
No, Noona! No! Don't you ever think that way.

260
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,550
It wasn't possible for you to handle the serving all by yourself in the first place.

261
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,170
Right.

262
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,070
Hey, Nara. You can slow down a bit.

263
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,580
- Oppa, I'm sorry...
- Take your time.

264
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,040
No, it's okay to make mistakes with this.

265
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,490
Don't look so timid.

266
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,890
Just enjoy it! Enjoy it, enjoy it! It's okay.
[Seo Joon warmly comforts like the real Sae Ro Yi]

267
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,660
It's because we just didn't prepare enough for this. Don't worry too much about it.

268
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,800
Do you want me to help?
[Nara tries to pick herself up again]

269
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,800
- It's okay, I'll go. I'll try to figure it out.
- Okay.

270
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,200
[Looking around]

271
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,580
- This is Table 9, right?
- Yes.

272
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,770
I'm so sorry! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

273
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,980
I'm sorry. This is my first time. I'm really sorry.

274
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food!

275
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,010
Please enjoy your meal.
[After five apologies, Nara leaves]

276
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,970
- (It's okay but) She's so apologetic.
- She is.

277
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,830
This looks really good.

278
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,750
Yeah! It looks so good!

279
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,070
She ran away... after saying sorry.

280
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,470
It's delicious!

281
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,940
The flat iron steak?

282
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,480
[The older gentleman tastes the steak]

283
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,910
Wow, this steak is really good.

284
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,090
This is the real deal.

285
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,020
Wow, we would have been missing out if we didn't try this before we left.

286
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,860
[Finished taking care of the backed-up orders]

[Meanwhile, the Noodle Master Bo Gum is going around amongst the guests]

288
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,240
- Are you enjoying the food?
- Yeah.

289
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,710
Our food is taking too long to come out.

290

- What did you order?
- We ordered spicy noodles, and─

291
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,430
You ordered spicy noodles?

292
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,240
- And a Full Moon jeon.
- Really? We're sorry. We're sorry!

293
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,400
Hey! They said that they didn't receive their spicy noodles and Full Moon jeon!

294

- Really?
- Oh no!
[They have an emergency here too]

295
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,640
- Yoo Jung, that table didn't get their Full Moon jeon.
- What!

296
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,230
- They didn't get it.
- Hurry– yeah.
- They didn't receive it?

- Here is your Full Moon jeon.
- Thank you.

305
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,530
It's really good. You can eat this with the young radish kimchi. Enjoy!

Thank you!

[Yum!]

308
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,580
- It's good, right?
- Because they put bacon in it.

309
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,060
We should make it like this when we eat it at home.

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,390
Bacon?

312
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,170
- Oh, they made it really well!
- Is it good?

313
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,410
[While Moonlight Dongdong and DanBam are recovering from their order mistakes...]

314
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,990
Are you all right? You're tired, aren't you?

315
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,230
It's fun for me.
[Magic Food Land is peaceful by themselves]

316

- Is it fun?
- Yeah, it's really fun.

317
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,730
I wonder which team has the most business?
[Leisurely checking on other teams success]

318
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,680
I think it's about the same for everyone.

319
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,650
It seems like everyone is getting an order from each team.

320
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,590
I probably would want to try something from each team as well.

321
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,590
Kimchi... Did we order the kimchi jeon?

But why is it not coming out?

324
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,660
We ordered the kimchi jeon.

325
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,220
It doesn't look like anyone got it yet.
[Moonlight Dongdong's spicy noodles]
[DanBam's gambas]

326
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,200

- Oh, you're probably right.
[Only Annara's food is missing]

327
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,360
- By any chance...
- Yes?

328
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,090
A while ago, we ordered kimchi jeon and soondae makchang...

329
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,100
- Soondae makchang?
- Yes.

330
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,830

- Who?
- That, that table!
[Surprised baby birds]

335
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,420
- Really?
- Where?

336
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,850
Where? What! That can't be right!

337
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,680
Hurry, hurry!

338
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,130
Give them something on the house in the meantime.

339
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,630
Then let's slice some watermelon.

340
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,860
Oh, that's a good idea.

341
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,160
Let's slice four.

342
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,550
Should I cut it like this?
[Watermelon on the house]

343
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,090
- Did something not come out yet?
- Yeah.

344
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,490
Your kimchi jeon and soondae makchang didn't come out yet?

345
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,150
We're really sorry. What, what... What can we get you in addition?
[Gives them some watermelon as apology]

346
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,610
Oh, no. It's fine.

347
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,060
We're sorry.

Wow, that's a lot of food.

353
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,920
Since we're sending this out late, I'm giving them more.

[Hop, hop]

355
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,190
This is your Soonmakheeji!

356

357
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,260

[Meanwhile, a guest is eating alone at Table 4]

372

You're not lonely by yourself?

373
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,500
- It's lonely, but sitting by myself can actually be a good thing.
- Oh really?
[Jinyoung suddenly joins]

374
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,620

[Glances over]

385
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,250
But isn't he being a bit too much and burdensome?

386
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,320
- He might want to eat by himself.
- Oppa, he might want to eat by himself.

00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,980
[Yoo Jung] Can I serve this... potato jeon?

1365
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,320
The last potato jeon?

1366
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,980
[Of course]

1367
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,670
I think it will feel worthwhile.

1368

[Yoo Jung personally goes to serve the final noodles and Half Moon jeon]

1369

[With Yoo Jung's serving the last table, Moonlight Dongdong closes the kitchen]

1373

[Nod]

Hello, we're DanBam.
[Kyung Soo does the last serving for DanBam]

1378
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:24,140
This is our last steak,

1379
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,910
and because you guys are our last guests, we filled the plate with a lot of food.

1380
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,940
I've been making this all day,

and this is the last one.

1382

All right. Enjoy your meal.

1383

[DanBam's kitchen closes as well]

1384

[Sung Eun also finished making her last fried chicken]

1385
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:40,350
Hey, it would be okay to give this to the kids first, right?

1386
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:44,570
Really? It's for the kids? Then I should have given them more...

1387
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:46,390
[In Yeop] Your chicken is here.

1388
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:47,270

My head hurts so much.

1392
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:58,300
Why is she like that?

1393
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:02,220
[Can't take their eyes off of In Yeop]

1394

Oh man, I... I'm... I'm so nervous!

1395
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,740
Man, he's so handsome.

1396
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,620
Wow...

1397
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:12,290
To be able to eat such sacred food...

1398
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:14,400
Sacred?
[Giggling]

1399

[Taking a bite out of the sacred chicken]

[Then moves on to the sacred Half Moon jeon]

1401

Is it good?

1402
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:31,230
- Try this.
- Oh, thank you.

1403
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:33,410
This is spicy kimchi noodles.

1404
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:35,660
[Bo Gum brought the last kimchi spicy noodles for free]

1405

- It's good!
- That's good to hear.

[Preserving their last memory with a celebratory photo]

[Kyung Soo is taking photos for Team Magic]

[Under the night sky, which has gone completely dark...]

- You all did a really, really great job.

wrote down their reviews on the food and left them there.

1471
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,050
[Reviews full of affection and care]

1472
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:01,270
I think this is for Team Magic: "The fried chicken is the best!"

1473
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:03,050
Yeah. I agree.

1474

- Yeah, I agree.
- You have to acknowledge that's true.

1475
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,760
Regarding the Half Moon jeon from Moonlight Dongdong:

1476
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,170
"It's made with potatoes, and it's crispy, and the portion was generous."
[It's ours!]

1477
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:15,140
"They were really friendly and courteous."

[Pleased]

1479
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:23,000
"The fried chicken and the flat iron steak were the best I've tasted in my life."

1480
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,410
That's right. I agree.
[Agreed]

1481
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:29,240
"The gambas was really a work of art."

1482
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,590
"It was the tastiest thing I've ever eaten."

1483
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,230
- Wow.
- That's really high praise.

1484
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:37,290
"If you decide to sell this, I would be willing to buy and eat it with my own money."

1485
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:43,150
The gambas was made using the recipe that Joo Young uses to make it at home.

1486
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:45,860
- I just tried making it the way I usually do.
- It was good.

1487
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,880
"It's my first trip as a 20-year-old.

[Heartwarming]

1491
01:02:58,210 --> 01:03:01,020
As we had talked about before, the profits from the three teams

1492
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:06,140
will be donated under the name of Young Actors' Retreat to an organization that helps small business owners.

1493
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:10,990
[The long yet short 2 nights and 3 days spent at the Young Actors' Retreat]

[Each team goes around sharing their thoughts from the retreat]

1495
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:17,110
I'm pretty sure that getting the actors for a drama together

1496
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:22,140
to go on a trip like this and make memories together

1497
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:26,740
won't be a common occurrence in my acting career.

1498
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:31,930
I hope we get the chance for all of us to get together again.

1499
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:34,100
I think I'm going to miss everyone.

1500

Thank you.

1501
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:46,900
When we started this, I wondered, "Does this actually make sense? Will this work?"

1502
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:51,790
But then I kept getting immersed in it.

1503
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:56,310
Seeing myself becoming the owner of a food truck...

1504
01:03:56,310 --> 01:04:00,450
It was really confusing for me. I felt like my worlds were getting mixed up.

1505
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:03,090
I agree.
[Able to relate well]

1506
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:08,840
Because I was able to have a good time on a good day with good people,

1507
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,370
I think it was such a good moment for me.

1508
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:13,250
I think it was such a great time.

1509
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:19,590
And I'm so grateful to you, Director, for making this time possible for us.

1510
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:25,120
[Soo Bin] On the first day we all met, we were together in our original teams.

1511
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,320
Have you been well, Oppa?

1512
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:34,470
[The Retreat began with them reminiscing of shared good memories after meeting each other after a long time apart]

1513
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:38,980
[Then the 15 Young Actors met together]

1514
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:45,280
- Seeing all the sunbae actors gathered in one place...
- We were together awkwardly.

1515
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,660
Ah, this is really awkward.
[Although the start was awkward]

1516
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:52,300
You didn't say that wasn't allowed!
[They broke the ice with their new teams]

1517
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:55,030
I think that we were able to display some teamwork.

1518
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:59,830
I had so much fun the entire 2 nights and 3 days, and I'm still sad that it's coming to an end.

1519
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:05,700
Because it seems like all my fellow actors tried their best to enjoy themselves.

1520
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,140
Yes, it was fun for me as well.

1521
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,840
I think I'm going back, having laughed so much.

1522
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,130
At least for me, I feel like this retreat was a healing time,

1523
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:20,560
and I think I'm returning with a lot more energy and laughter, so it was meaningful and enjoyable.

1524
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:23,440
[They made new memories together]

1525
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,090
If you speak casually to me, I'll also speak casually to you.
[Slowly began to build new friendships]

1526
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:30,500
As time passed, I started getting comfortable and enjoying it.

1527
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:34,780
I feel like I'm returning having made good relationships.

1528
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:38,600
There's no other way to describe it other than that it was great.

1529
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,530
The past 2 nights and 3 days have been like a present to me.

1530
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:45,460
I was happy to be with the actors

1531
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:50,100
that really match the words "Young Actors."

1532
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:54,710
The first retreat of my life was perfect.

1533
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:58,200
Will Season 2... be possible?

1534
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,810
I would definitely participate.

1535
01:05:59,810 --> 01:06:01,580
Wouldn't it be better to mix up the members a bit for the photo?

1536
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:05,150
- Let's mix up and take it.
- Yeah, let's mix it up.
[The final item on the retreat agenda to preserve these memories]

1537
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:06,800
Mix up! Mix it up!

1538
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,650
- Come over here!
- Mix it up randomly!

1539
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:11,160
- Mix up!
- Come here.

1540
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:19,260

1541
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:23,210
Youth is now!

1542
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:27,570
