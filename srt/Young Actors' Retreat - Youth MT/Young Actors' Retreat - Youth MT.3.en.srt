00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,430
So you're really gentle and nice, but...
 [Can't hear]

613
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,280
- She says she knows what she means.
- No, no, it's okay.
[Hurt]

614
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,030
- To me, you know...
- Oh, I see.

615
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,510
I was a rookie, but you were a sunbaenim I've only seen on TV...

616
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,560
He is hurt.

617
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,520
No, no. What I mean...
[Hurt]

618
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,500
I must have made a lot of mistakes...

619
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:46,290
[Chang Wook] - I just did my best to be nice, since they were younger friends.
- No, no.

620
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,010
A very nice and comfortable sunbaenim.

621
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,510
- Since it was so comfortable...
- She said, "I think I know what you mean, though."

622
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,040
I was fine with what Nara said, but

623
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,100
I was more hurt when you said you think you know.

624
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,000
She didn't say, "I'm fine with it, though." But said, "I think I know what you mean, though."

625
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,390
[Peace breaker]

626
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,780
[In the meantime, while Team Nalwoochoban's peace was breaking apart...]

627
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,580
No one here has ever seen a ghost, right?
[Team Cheongbaji starts the engine on scary stories]

628
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,060
I've seen a ghost before.

629
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,880
Yoo Jung said she has seen one before.

630
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,290
Tell us about that story.

631
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,670
It was while I was filming a historical drama.
 [Youth Horror Story: "The Filming Set" by Yoo Jung]

632
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,410
It was when I was shooting the drama "Moon Embracing the Sun."

633
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,420
There are shaman ladies that come out on the drama.

634
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,490
[Yoo Jung] On that day, I was leaving after the shooting.

635
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,110
On the other side...

636
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,830
really far out on the other side...

637
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,610
there were three ladies

638
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:37,980
who play the shaman roles standing.

639
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,230
[Focuses]

640
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,530
"They must've come to do the shooting."

641
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,420
"I'll go say hi later," was what I thought,

642
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,190
but they were not there when I went.

643
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,390
[Gulp]

644
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,360
Later I was told that the shaman ladies were not scheduled for a shoot that day.

645
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,490
[Later she was told that the shaman ladies were not scheduled for a shoot that day]

646
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,530
[Grasps]

647
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,370
You're scared, too, Hyung?

648
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,460
You're not scared, are you?

649
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,200
It's not that. The seat belt keeps wrapping around my neck. Why is it like this?

650
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,820
I have a scary story about a car.

651
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,040
There are so many of those, like the one about the freeway...

652
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,330
- What's it about?
- The freeway one is really famous.

653
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,930
- You don't know the freeway story?
- No, I don't know.

654
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,360
This one is a true story.

655
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,260
[A true story?]

656
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,470
[Bo Gum] Supposedly, a man was going through a tunnel when the car kept shutting down.

657
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:30,260
He was wondering why the car kept shutting down, and it was in the middle of the night.

658
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,410
Then suddenly, thudding noises started coming from the car.

659
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,180
Then suddenly, thudding noises started coming from the car.

660
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,870
[Eyes shaking]

661
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,150
He was so scared,

662
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:43,400
he was like, "No, no!" and drove away as quickly as he could.

663
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,000
He's really selling it!

664
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,800
You're doing an excellent job!

665
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,600
[Bo Gum] So he dropped off the car at an auto shop.

666
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,010
The auto shop owner said, "There were so many handprints on the car."

667
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,590
And the car owner asked, "What do you mean"?

668
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,840
[In suspense]

669
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,730
But apparently, the handprints were on the inside of the car.

670
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,230
[What!]

671
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,340
They had tried to wipe down the handprints from the outside, but couldn't wipe them.

672
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,930
Because the handprints were made from the inside.

673
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:12,530
But how do you know that's a true story?

674
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:16,090
It has been passed down by word of mouth...

675
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,220
That's what people say.

676
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,970
[Meanwhile, Team Danmuji...]

677
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,730
My wife...

678
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,860
after we got married...

679
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,760
[Kyung Ho] It was the first time living with another person.

680
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,640
On a summer night,

681
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,310
something felt wrong, so I opened my eyes,

682
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:37,410
and my wife was just standing next to the bed like this.

683
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,520
Stop! Stop, stop!

684
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,690
- Who?
- My wife.

685
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,400
Oh, your wife.

686
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,130
[Kyung Ho] But it could be a sleeping habit I didn't know about, you know?

687
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,920
I was so scared.

688
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,070
I was like, "Honey! It's me!"

689
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,060
What's wrong?

690
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,540
[Kyung Ho] But she stood absolutely still, and she was holding something in her hand.

691
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,730
- In pitch darkness... Yeah.
- Like this?

692
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,610
Yeah. She's standing there like this. How scary is that?

693
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,040
I was thinking, does she have a sleepwalking problem?

694
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,140
So I was like, "Honey! What's wrong?"

695
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,100
[So... why was she like that?]

696
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,790
A mosquito.

697
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,660
It turned out she was holding a bug spray to kill the mosquito.

698
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,080
A mosquito. A mosquito.
[A completely unexpected turnaround]

699
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,050
- I'm going crazy.
- Oh, Sunbaenim.

700
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,370
She couldn't turn on the light because the mosquito would fly away and hide.

701
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,470
She was in that position to catch the mosquito?

702
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,380
Turns out that what she was holding was a bug spray.

703
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,020
You must have been pretty scared.

704
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:32,810
[Soon, the three cars enter a narrow road]

705
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,680
Oh, we must have arrived.

706
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,520
It's so dark...

707
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,750
[What's up...]

708
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,120
I have a feeling it's going to be difficult.
 [...with this place?]

709
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,840
Man, we came to a strange place...

710
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:47,000
Oh, no, what is this? I really don't like this type of stuff...

711
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,900
I'm scared.

712
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:55,850
[But what exactly is this place that they've come to?]

713
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,110
Gosh!

714
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,790
I'm so scared!

715
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,930
I just got out of the car, and it's so scary!

716
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:09,240
- What is this?
- What the... there is a school here!
- Ah, what is this?

717
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,400
- This is crazy.
- Man, that school...

718
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,590
- It's an abandoned school...
- It looks like a Middle School.
[Just looking at it gives you the chills]

719
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,740
Ah, what is this?
[Just looking at it gives you the chills]

720
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,850
It's bigger in scale than I expected.
[A deserted school]

721
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,560
I mean, what is this!
[A deserted school]

722
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,050
- And why are there tents?
- Tents?

723
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,060
Are they telling us to sleep here?

724
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,740
Hey, no way...
[Two tents are set up in front of the closed school]

725
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,020
- Sleeping outdoors?
- There's no way!
[Two tents are set up in front of the closed school]

726
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,400
- If something goes wrong, do we have to sleep here?
- In the tents?

727
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,730
What are those tents?

728
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:33,370
I know, right?

729
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,570
My goodness, there are actually sleeping bags in the tents!

730
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,780
- Wait, really?
- There are two or three sleeping bags in each tent.
- Don't joke around like that.

731
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,060
It's probably for the production staff to sleep there...

732
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,510
Each team has five members, right?

733
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:46,640
I think they have two tents, one for female members and one for male members.

734
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,410
- Whoa!
- What is that!

735
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,350
[The thing that scared everyone is...]

736
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,130
- That startled me!
- What? What happened?
 [The thing that scared everyone is...]

737
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,610
Someone's outside!

738
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,910
That startled me.

739
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,590
It's just a member of our staff. It's okay.

740
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,830
It's not a bad person.

741
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,570
- It's okay.
- My heart is still racing.
[Everyone is disturbed by an abandoned school in the middle of the night]

742
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,430
That was really scary.

743
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,440
[Gulp]

744
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,020
[Chang Wook] Kyung Soo, you already look nervous.

745
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,470
Well, a school is a bit too much.

746
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,160
A school is a bit too much?

747
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,510
The highlight of a summer retreat. It's bravery training time.

748
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:21,120
[Ah...]

749
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,160
One member from each team will go as a representative.

750
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,840
- What?
- It's just one person?

751
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,090
- Just one person?
- Just one.

752
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:32,950
So, based on the order in which they finish the training, the ranking of the team will be decided.

753
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:36,670
- So there's a ranking.
- Based on the ranking, there will be a penalty for the team in last place.

754
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,870
- Man, we really can't get a penalty for this one.
- Right.

755
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,250
As long as it's not this place...

756
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,780
- [Kyung Soo] No... I think they're going to tell us to sleep there.
- Yeah, I think so.

757
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,010
The other teams will choose who will represent your team.

758
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,270
I see.

759
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,690
[Yoo Jung] Choose someone on the other team who will be helpful to us.

760
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,950
So we should choose someone who, we think, will take the longest.

761
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:59,030
[Chang Wook] It won't feel good being chosen.

762
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,290
Can we get together and discuss this?

763
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,410
Yes, of course!

764
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:06,050
But I feel bad about choosing someone for this.

765
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,900
But they said there are 5 sleeping bags inside.
[The direction for choosing: Team Cheongbaji > Team Danmuji > Team Nalwoochoban]

766
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:14,950
[Yoo Jung] Since we don't know each member very well, why don't we share information about our team members?

767
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,210
How is Hae Won?

768
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,220
I think she'll do pretty well.

769
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,400
Oh, really?

770
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,450
[Bo Gum] Should we just pick Park Seo Joon Hyungnim?

771
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:24,720
I think he'll do everything unfazed.

772
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,940
- That's true.
- It would be scary.

773
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,410
[Sung Eun] But personally, I really want to see Dong Yeon's reaction.

774
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,570
- Because he'll be really funny?
- Yeah, I think he'll be really funny.

775
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,790
I think his reactions will be funny, but I also think he'll do well.

776
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:39,360
But even so, we can just do better and get first place!

777
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,190
As long as we don't get last place, it's okay.

778
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:45,120
I think sleeping in those tents is the worst team penalty.

779
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,840
[Kyung Ho] From what I can tell, the girls are pretty strong opponents.

780
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,890
What about choosing between Chang Wook or Jinyoung?

781
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,120
- Do you think Jinyoung Oppa gets scared easily?
- I think so.

782
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,930
A long time ago, Jinyoung gave up during a bravery training because he was so scared.

783
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,470
- But aren't you being a bit heartless, choosing him knowing that?
- What to do, it's so cruel.

784
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,410
That's a bit...

785
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,090
We can't let people slide with things like that here.

786
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,750
Yeah, but we still don't know exactly what the penalty is...

787
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,400
- If we go easy on them, we might get the penalty.
- True.

788
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,010
It's one of these two. Jinyoung or Chang Wook.

789
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,570
What should we do?

790
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,010
[Team Nalwoochoban is also deep in serious discussion]

791
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,770
I don't think Yoo Jung will be scared.

792
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,640
From what I can tell, Yoo Jung has a strong competitive spirit.

793
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,480
- Even if she gets scared
- She really seems that way?

794
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,790
it seems like she'll do well.

795
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:30,630
For Joo Young...You can just tell she wouldn't get scared.

796
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,290
What about Sung Eun?

797
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,450
I think Sung Eun will just get angry.

798
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,070
What about Park Bo Gum?

799
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,870
[Chang Wook] Well, it hasn't been that long since Bo Gum returned from military service.

800
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:42,090
- He'll probably have that... yeah.
- His military training...

801
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:46,450
- So, I don't know about him.
- Oh, really?

802
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,070
On the other hand,

803
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,930
In Yeop is pretty low on energy right now.

804
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,190
Is there a correlation between this and energy level, Oppa?

805
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,690
It hasn't been that long since he finished his last project.

806
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,780
- So should we...
- In Yeop. Let's pick In Yeop.

807
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,730
Okay. We're all set.
 [After a logical(?) analysis, they chose In Yeop]

808
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,570
I guess that team has already chosen.

809
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,540
But we've been so focused on this that we forgot that we could be chosen as well.

810
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,290
It doesn't feel like it's going to be me.

811
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,180
Why is my heart suddenly pounding?

812
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,590
I think they're going to pick either Bo Gum or Yoo Jung.

813
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,110
At least, that's what I think.

814
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,480
[What are we going to do about this?]

815
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,600
Did Team Cheongbaji decide who will go for Team Danmuji?

816
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,890
Yes, we decided that...

817
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,810
Hae Won...

818
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,740
might be good,

819
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,930
or Soo Bin Unni...

820
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:39,200
We'll choose the actor Kwak Dong Yeon.

821
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,680
[Relieved]

822
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,510
We shouldn't be laughing right now.
[Unhappy]

823
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,200
[Everybody's anticipating Dong Yeon's Bravery Training]

824
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,290
We shouldn't be laughing right now.

825
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,290
Dong Yeon, you're quick. I noticed you were quick earlier.

826
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,440
Yeah, I'll get scared more quickly than anyone else...

827
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,800
He said, he'll get scared faster than anyone else.
[Looking forward to it more than anyone else]

828
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,080
But I... I'll go through this like my life depends on it and win it.

829
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,930
He might say that, but I don't think he'll be good.

830
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:06,520
Okay then. Did Team Danmuji choose a representative?

831
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,170
Yes, we chose... one, two, three!

832
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,420
Ji Chang Wook.

833
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,330
- Oh, great!
- No.
 [Team Leader Ji is flustered]

834
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,460
- It's okay, that's fine.
- Wow, that's great!

835
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,410
As for me...
 [And the remaining four team members are happy]

836
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:21,980
First of all, my team members are relieved that they weren't picked.

837
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,910
We were just relieved that we weren't chosen!

838
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,240
It's great!

839
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:30,870
[Dong Yeon] I met Sunbaenim outside the restroom earlier, and there was a small bug on his shoulder.

840
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,370
[Wait, wait!]

841
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,070
I saw it, too!

842
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,880
- He was making such a fuss for just a bug landing on his shoulder.
- I want to say something.

843
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,760
It was definitely not small at all!

844
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,690
There was this huge fly that literally searched my body.

845
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:47,380
Sunbaenim, on your shoulder!
[A fly is searching(?) Chang Wook's body]

846
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,570
Sunbaenim, there's another one on your arm!

847
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,260
There's another one!

848
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,410
On my arm, my arm!

849
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:55,200
- What's wrong with you?
- I really hate bugs.

850
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,440
I'm a bit scared of bugs.

851
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,860
- Sunbaenim spun three times in one second.
- Good job.

852
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,190
After seeing that, we thought, ahh...

853
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,490
Please tell us which member of Team Cheongbaji you chose.

854
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,220
Okay, for us...

855
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,050
Whoever gets chosen, I wish you good luck.

856
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,260
We chose...

857
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,640
[Gesturing politely with two hands]

858
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,430
We're sorry.

859
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,050
- Me?
- Yes.

860
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,470
Me?

861
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,080
[They chose Hwang In Yeop]

862
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,000
[Staff] Weren't you both in the same "The Sound of Magic" team?

863
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,380
But we're not right now.

864
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,150
Sunbaenim, we're in the same room... W-Why? Why?

865
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:33,870
[Chang Wook] Everyone else on Team Cheongbaji seems pretty tough.

866
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,420
Oh, really?
 [Tough, tough, tough, tough]

867
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,980
Compared to everyone else, In Yeop looks pretty weak.

868
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,400
[Tough, weak, tough, tough, tough]

869
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,330
So for this mission, we're going to time each person.

870
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:49,650
[Complete the passcode using numbers hidden within the school]

871

[Use the passcode to open the locked staff room and return with the mission item]

872
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,510
The rankings will be decided based on how quickly you bring back the mission item.

873
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:03,730
If you bring back the wrong item, you will be disqualified, and your team will receive the penalty.

874
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:06,060
I don't think that's going to be easy...

875
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,160
It's a good thing I'm not going.

876
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:12,070
All right, we will proceed in the following order. First, Dong Yeon, then In Yeop, and finally Chang Wook.

877
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:16,070
The two members waiting to go can wait inside the tent.

878
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,000
I'll be back in a flash. Within three minutes.

879
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,740
In three minutes! Okay.

880
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,250
Let's cheer on Dong Yeon.

881
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,100

[The anxious posterior of the first challenger]

- Man, my heart is heavy...
- We'll be watching you.

884
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,120
- Don't worry about it.
- Fighting, fighting, fighting!

885
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,410
Good luck!

886

- Team Cheongbaji, fighting!

00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,810
No way we'll sleep here, right?

890
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,080
No, we won't.

891

Don't worry about it. Don't worry.

892
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,970
Do I look that weak?

893
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:46,070
Our In Yeop Hyung is looking a bit thin, though.

894
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,340
- Yeah, that's true.
- I know

- Fighting, fighting!

That's right...
 [Finally reached the staff room at the end of a difficult journey]

1234
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,330
I can't see anything...

1235
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:01,220
I did it! It's over!

1236
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,270
[I did it! It's over!]

1237
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,060
- It's not over...
- It's not over yet.

1238
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,260
It's just the start...

1239
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,810
All he has to do is find it now.

1240
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:10,660
- The seaweed.
- The seaweed.

1241
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,270
The light...
 [Enters the staff room]

1242
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:16,720
The light isn't on here... The object...

1243
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:21,560
[Now, all he has to do is find the seaweed here...]

1244
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:24,030
The back scratcher's right over there!

1245
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:26,530
You were so close to it.

1246
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:29,100
It was right in front.
 [It was just hanging right there...]

1247
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:32,150
Oh! What is that?
 [But while you're here, you can't see anything]

1248
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:33,490
[A sliding noise]

1249
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,200
Oh, please! I beg you. Give me a moment!

1250
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,130
Don't close the door! Please, don't close the door...

1251
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:42,330
Please, don't close the door...

1252
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:44,580
Please don't close the door?

1253
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:47,610
He can't leave the door behind. He can't let go of it.

1254
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:49,940
Oh, please! Don't close it.

1255
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,000
I beg you! Don't close the door...

1256
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,390
I think this is it...

1257
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:55,020
I think this is it...

1258
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,940
This is it.

1259
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,710
Or is it not?

1260
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,140
This is right.

1261
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,640
He's just grabbing something in front of him and is coming back.

1262
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,270
He looks like he's bringing back something else, right? Yeah, I think he's bringing back something else.

1263
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:10,610
Don't do it, please. Don't do it. No, really.

1264
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:13,790
[Will the object in his hand be the right one?]

1265
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:17,730
You've worked hard.
[In Yeop finally escaped from the abandoned school]

1266
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:19,780
- Wait, is that right?
- Oh! It is seaweed!

1267
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:20,850
Is it really seaweed?

1268
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:22,690
Isn't that seaweed?
[Please...]

1269
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:24,530
- Come here.
- Isn't this seaweed?

1270
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:25,900
[The thing that In Yeop brought back in his hand was...]

1271
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,010
Isn't the thing I brought back seaweed?
 [Seaweed!]

1272
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:28,530
He's right!
[Seaweed!]

1273
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:30,740
- He brought back seaweed!
- Is that seaweed?

1274
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,400
[In Yeop, Mission Success!]

1275
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,470
- Is this right?
- Whoa, it is seaweed!

1276
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:38,770
[A splendid feat achieved by overcoming his fears]

1277
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:41,570
I'm done for.
[In Yeop's final record was 9 minutes and 31 seconds]

1278
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:43,910
You did well!
 [In Yeop's final record was 9 minutes and 31 seconds]

1279
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:47,520
- It's so scary in there...
- Are you all right?

1280
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,230
It's so scary.
[Returns to his seat to the cheers of his fellow Team Cheongbaji members]

1281
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:50,400
Hyung, you were so cute.

1282
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,100
- What?
- Really cute. Absolutely.

1283
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,520
- We were all cracking up.
- What?

1284
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,080
We were laughing so hard.

1285
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,340
Oh, really?

1286
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:59,160
[He's still dealing with the after-effects of the abandoned school]

1287
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,270
You were awesome. And cute.

1288
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:03,830
- What?
- You were cute.

1289
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:06,490
Why couldn't I add or subtract properly in there?

1290
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:08,880
[Team Cheongbaji is currently in the first place]

1291
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,980
[Meanwhile, having waited in the tent and unaware of what's to come...]

1292
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:15,110
- What is it?
- It's an easy one.
 [The last challenger Chang Wook naively picks his mission object]

1293
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:19,080
A leek?
[The object that Chang Wook needs to bring back is a leek]

1294
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,880
Fighting!

1295
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,350
He seems like he's not afraid at all.

1296
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:24,440
- I know, right?
- It looks like we picked the wrong person.

1297
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,940
He might do well.
 [Worried that he might do too well]

1298
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,380
Challenge started!

1299
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,050
[Team Nalwoochoban's Chang Wook takes off]

1300
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:32,840
Fighting!
[Team Leader, fighting!]

1301
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:37,850
[He enters the water faucets area briskly]

1302
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:43,840
[He tries turning on all of the faucets...]

1303
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:49,210
Whoa!

1304
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:51,140
God... man... that scared me! Whoa!

1305
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:54,000
Oh, God... man... that scared me...

1306
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,620
Okay. Here it is.

1307
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:01,460
Four...

1308
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,600
The water doesn't come out.

1309
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,700
Four...

1310
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,800
Four, four, four? Four?

1311
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:12,700
What's four?
 [Not really paying close attention to the ghost's hint]

1312
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,330
The one where the water comes out...

1313
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:16,190
[But instead, he completely focuses on the faucets]

1314
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:18,050
[Did he not understand what I said?]

1315
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:20,170
The ghost is a bit flustered.

1316
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:22,520
The ghost is staring at him wistfully.

1317
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,430
It's four?
 [And with that, Chang Wook leaves...]

1318
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,380
Where do I have to go?
 [And with that, Chang Wook leaves...]

1319
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,440
Four?
 [He finally left...]

1320
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,900
The ghost is really going through a lot today.

1321
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,630
Four?
 [He enters the abandoned school]

1322
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:38,810
What's that? Someone's sitting there...

1323
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:39,940
Oh, this is that.

1324
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,770
Oh, God! You scared me!

1325
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:44,500
Oh, God! You scared me!

1326
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,210
But he's not getting that scared.

1327
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:48,330
He's really not getting that scared.

1328
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:52,270
Oh... What is this?
 [Chang Wook, who really doesn't get scared easily...]

1329
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:54,610
Whoa. Wow. What's that? You scared me.

1330
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,380
[Obtains the second number quickly]

1331
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:00,820
That startled me.
 [Unfazed]

1332
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:03,310
- What! He didn't get scared!
- Wow! Really!

1333
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:06,380
How does he not get scared by that?

1334
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,200
Ah, it's 4.
 [And calmly figures out the last number]

1335
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,690
Four one four.

1336
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:11,220
The staff room.

1337
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:14,380
[Arrives at the staff room within four minutes]

1338
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:16,700
[Once he opens the lock, it's the last course]

1339
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,520
I can't see it.

1340
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:25,610
[He spends a while struggling with the lock...]

1341
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:28,300
Oh, is this how you're supposed to open it?

1342
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:33,180
At this rate, he's going to waste a lot of time...

1343
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,180
I think we're in big trouble right now.

1344
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:38,240
- He did everything so well, but he got stuck there.
- I know, at the lock.

1345
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,820
He's pretty brave, though.
 [He has got a lot of bravery, but his eyesight is weak]

1346
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:44,310
I can't see anything
 [He has got a lot of bravery, but his eyesight is weak]

1347
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:47,700
[And time kept passing without much success...]

1348
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,040
Aigoo, why is this not working?

1349
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,200
[Time's over!]

1350
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,260
You've been disqualified. Please come out.

1351
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:57,660
[Disillusioned...]

1352
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:00,100
- Oppa, you really weren't scared at all!
- Yeah, you were really brave.

1353
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:03,460
More importantly, I couldn't see any of the passcodes.

1354
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:07,030
- Oh, in there? Because it was so dark?
- It was so dark.

1355
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:08,940
[The final results for the bravery training]

1356
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:12,640
Hwang In Yeop brought his item in 9 minutes 31 seconds.

1357
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,000
[A valuable victory earned by facing his fears]

1358
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,710
Daebak.

1359
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:23,290
Ji Chang Wook and Kwak Dong Yeon were both disqualified.

1360
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:25,130
They did well. They did really well.

1361
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:27,040
I know, right? They did really well.

1362
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,510
So we prepared a battle among team leaders.

1363
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:31,050
A battle among team leaders?

1364
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,790
The team leaders will go in and...

1365
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:35,480
[Do we have to do it again...]
[Eyes shaking]

1366
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,090
The team that brings back the exemption voucher will win.

1367
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:41,480
Yoo Jung, you can do it!

1368
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,430
But shouldn't we be exempt since we won?

1369
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:45,040
- Is our team exempt from this?
- Are we exempt from this?

1370
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,390
- Yes. Because your team won, you are already exempt from the penalty.
- It's okay, it's okay!

1371
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,530
It's okay, it's okay!

1372
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:51,660
Oh, man. I was really...

1373
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:54,820
The Team Leaders' Battle will take place
[A Team Leaders' battle without Team Cheongbaji, which is already exempt]

1374
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:58,210
[With an upgraded level of scariness in the bathhouse]

1375
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:01,830
[The team that loses here...]

1376
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:06,090
[will face a very scary penalty!]

1377
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:08,530
[Potential last-place teams, Danmuji and Nalwoochoban]

1378
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:14,760
[What will be the results of the final battle?]

1379
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:22,960
[The next episode]
Whoa! You scared me!
[The horror is not over yet]

1380
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:26,640
Whoa! No! God! Stop it!

1381
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,800
This is why I said I don't do variety shows!

1382
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,930
[Which team will be in last place at the end of the bravery training?]
