So, what have you done so far?

161
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,760
- First, Seo Joon Oppa came to find us in the morning.
- Right.

162
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,000
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, we were hiding.

163
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,160
- You were hiding in Itaewon?
- Well, we weren't really hiding. We were out in the open.

- Oh, tomorrow?
- Yes.

168
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,660
But why is Kyung Soo Oppa not saying anything?

169
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,300
My arm hurts right now.
[His arm hurts from holding the phone]

Oh, that reminds me of when we had our production press conference...

187
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,270
- where the actors aren't good at finding the cameras...
- Right, right!

- Ji Chang Wook.
- Yes?

- Me?

[My idea is funny even to me]
[Curious | Can't wait]

Oh, my gosh, that's such a good idea!

["Red Team" with blue wristbands]

It probably doesn't matter.

Are there any games where we need to yell our team names quickly?

If so, we should make our team name short, like two syllables.

Because... Those members were born in the 80s.

00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,490
So, the three teams will compete for points.

929
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:41,650
Based on your team's final standings, your dinner menu will change.

930
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:44,970

[2nd place | 1st place | 3rd place]

935

946
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,830
That's inhumane.

947
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:26,760
- At this rate, we just have to avoid getting third place.
- Seriously.

- Danmuji!
- Just do "A Different Kind of Man"!

1069
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,110
What's left again?

1070
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,390
Just do "A Different Kind of Man"!
[Turns out Choi Sung Eun is competitive]

- What's left?
- Just do "A Different Kind of Man"!

1072
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:02,330
What do we do!
[Nearly in tears]

1073
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:04,650
They're done! Nalwoochoban!
[Team Nalwoochoban gets another turn!]

[With that, will the first win go to Team Nalwoochoban?]

1081

[Staff] We're really sorry, but...

1082
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,740
Why? It's not right?

1083
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,910
[Staff] You said "The Secret Garden" instead of "Painter of the Wind."
[Baram versus Bimil]

1084
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,120

[Depressed]

[For some reason, Yoo Jung is also surprised]

["The Secret Garden" that Jinyoung just mentioned...]

[The correct title was "Painter of the Wind"]

1090

What was the title of the drama that Actress Moon Geun Young starred in?

1091
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:40,430
"The... The... Secret..."

1092
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:41,870
I was in that drama. Why can't I remember it?

1093
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:43,720
You were in it?

1094
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,530
- The one where Actress Moon Geun Young came out...
- "The Secret Garden."
[Butts in]

1095
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,940
"The Secret Garden."
[Proud of himself after spreading the wrong answer]

[Forgot to include "The First Shop of..." in Coffee Prince]
(Lit. Korean title)

1108

Director!
[Time out!]

1125
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,960
Why was our answer incorrect?

1126
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,370
[Staff] You didn't tell us which number shop of "Coffee Prince" it was.

1127
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,500
- [Staff] All you said was "Coffee Prince."
- But obviously–

1128
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:59,460
But obviously, of course, we were talking about the main shop.
- Of course! Obviously!

1129
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,360
The main shop is usually the first shop, isn't it?
[Quickly latching onto the ridiculous logic]

1130
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,930
Of course, we were talking about the main shop.
[Wasn't expecting that]

1131
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:05,610
But specifying that it's the first shop is important.

1132
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:07,270
[Nearly falling over in laughter]

1133
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:10,620

[Just a happy-go-lucky guy]

[And a guy who doesn't know how to give up]

1136
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:18,720
I can understand that it would be wrong if we said, "The Boryeong Shop of Coffee Prince"...

1137
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,410
- That's right.
- But w-who gives a separate title for the first shop...?

1138
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,700
Do they even have a branch there?

1139
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,000
I'll give you the next question.

1140

[And Kyung Soo is speechless at Dong Yeon's comment]

[I envy your sense of humor...]

- "Annarasumanara" (abracadabra)

is a phrase used for magic.

1145

Give an example of other magical incantations.

1146

Danmuji! "Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo"!

Is it wrong?
[Sunbae, not again...!]

1153
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,340
- What incantations are there, again?
- Do 'open sesame.'

1154
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,880
Can't we do "Open Sesame"?

1155
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,050
- Also...
- I'll do 'suri-suri-masuri.'

1156
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,410
Can't we also do "Hoi"?

1157
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,900
- "Hoi" from the cartoon Dooly!
- Oh yeah!

1158
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,850
[Under Jinyoung's leadership, each member is assigned an incantation]

Nalwoochoban!
[Team Nalwoochoban goes for it immediately]

1160

- "Abracadabra"!
- "Wingardium Leviosa"!

- "Open Sesame"!
- "Hoi"!

"Suri-suri-masuri"!

1163
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,480
- Wait a second. "Hoi"?
- Hoi!

1164
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,530
Yes, "Hoi"! It's when Dooly uses magic!

1165
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:22,140
[After getting their first win, will Team Nalwoochoban get their second straight victory?]

1166
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,580
Okay, that is correct!
[Team Nalwoochoban gets it right for the second straight time]

1167
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:27,630
Okay, that is correct!
[Jinyoung was key to their second consecutive victory]

1168
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:29,270
Oh, my God, what's up with us!

1169
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:30,730
What's up with us!

1170
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,690
Awesome!

What... wow.

1173
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,860
I really don't know anything.
[Leader of Team Danmuji is depressed]

1174
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,170
What about "Abracadabra"...

1175
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:45,040
[Surprised while not paying attention]

1176
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,900
They got it right while we were discussing.
[Team Cheongbaji is feeling a bit blue, too]

1177
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,890
"Hoi" was amazing.
[On the other hand, Team Nalwoochoban's leader is happy]

1178
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,340
Wow, you guys are so good!

1179
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,200
These two are ridiculous!

1180
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,200
I didn't realize we had such aces on our team.

1181
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:02,060
"Although the weather is gloomy and it's our first time meeting, it's nice to meet you."

1182
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,280
Okay, so now I'll give the third prompt.

1183
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,880
Give the name of an artist and the name of one of their works.

1184
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,750
An artist and their work?

[Huddled together]

1187
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:15,180
Hold on, I know a lot of names.
[None of the teams attempt right away, but gather together to discuss]

1188
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,480
[Very prudent]

1189
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,580
Say Korean art.
[Focusing more on Korean art]

1190

(Lit. "The Great Map of the East Land" map of Korea)

1192
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,330
No, no. Someone can argue, saying that's not an artwork.

1193
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:26,310
[Is someone talking about me?]

1194
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,450
- I can only think of people like Renoir.
- Monet!
[Team Cheongbaji is in the middle of a serious discussion]

- Klimt's "The Kiss"!

1196
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,930
Klimt's "The Kiss"!

1197
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:36,200
What was I supposed to do again?

1198
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,010
- How could you forget!
- Wait, what was mine again?
[Even though they've discussed it, some forget right away]

1199
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:40,200
Wait, what was mine again?

1200
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,610
Nalwoochoban!

1201

- Cheongbaji!
[They immediately try to say it's wrong...]

1208
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:03,470
It's correct...

1209
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,600
That's correct!
