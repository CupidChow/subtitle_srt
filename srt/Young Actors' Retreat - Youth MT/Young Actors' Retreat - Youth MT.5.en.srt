00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,140
- Ten.
- It's ten per team.

157
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,360
[White Team: Ji Chang Wook & Choi Sung Eun vs.
Black Team: Ryu Kyung Soo & Chae Soo Bin]

158
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,130
- But you're free to place them however you like.
- You can place them wherever you want.

159
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,450
How do you want to place the pieces?

160
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,680
Should we have one of the pieces in the front?

161
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,920
- 4, 3, 3.
- 4, 4, 2?
[Black Team's strategy - Placing one piece in front]

162
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,100
- How about we split them like this and this?
- Okay.

163
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,320
Why are you making a work of art with this?

164
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,440
Excuse me, are you an expert?
[White Team's strategy - an artistic(?) placement?]

165
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,490
Would it be better to do this or this?
[White Team goes first]

166
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,220
That's okay. Yes, that works.
 [Player Choi Sung Eun takes the initiative]

167
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,290
Over here?
 [Aiming for the black piece in the middle]

168
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,030
[Chang Wook] Shouldn't we aim for the pieces that are closer to the edge?

169
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,770
- I want to try this one first.
- Okay, sure.

170
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,790
[And the results of Sung Eun's first attack...]

171
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,400
That's great.

172
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,570
That's great.
[The white piece goes out]

173
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,360
Amazing!
[Good job, Choi Sung Eun]

174
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,920
We'll give you 7 points for artistry.

175
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,260
- That was a very high-level technique.
- What should I do?

176
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,060
- That was difficult to do.
- We'll give you 7 points for artistry.
 [High five]

177
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,130
- Yes, that was a difficult technique.
- Wow, it survived that?

178
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,480
- Are we going for that one?
- Are we going for it?
[Black Team's first player is Soo Bin]

179
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,690
Are we going for that one? Are we going for it?

180
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,960
- She moved too soon.
- She's going for the save play.
 [Player Chae Soo Bin is even moving her position]

181
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,900
[The scenario she's hoping for]

182
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,770
[Focused]

183
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,560
[Nervous]

184
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,940
- Yes!
- Wow!

185
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,240
Wow!
[Cleanly clears it]

186
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,360
She's amazing.

187
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,190
Sung Eun, let's hit this one.

188
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,130
- Please show us that technique once again.
- Me?

189
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,520
Yes, please.
 [Black Team's ace, Chae Soo Bin]

190
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,270
You're pretty good.

191
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,100
Sung Eun, let's hit this one and knock this one out.

192
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,310
I guess I really have no talent when it comes to games...

193
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,130
[With her confidence greatly diminished, how will Sung Eun's second attack turn out?]

194
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,930
This one is a bit...

195
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,700
Whoa!
[This time, she succeeds]

196
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,360
Whoa!

197
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,140
Everyone's pretty good at this.

198
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,640
This one would be too hard.
 [Kyung Soo is surveying the board for an opportunity to counter-attack]

199
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,070
[Target]

200
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,020
What are you doing?

201
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,300
What are you doing?

202
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,150
What are you doing?
 [Grabs him by the collar]

203
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,090
What are you doing?
 [Not my business]

204
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,960
You were so free-spirited with that one.

205
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,080
[Free]

206
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,760
Right, that stone...
[Free]

207
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,690
It was just flying free.

208
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,150
It was set free.
 [The story of setting a piece free]

209
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,030
True, it was set free.
[While everyone is laughing, Chang Wook is busy practicing]

210
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,560
Oh! Okay, okay.

211
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,670
Oh! Okay, okay.
[Freedom]

212
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,580
They match.
[Booing silently]

213
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,540
This is not a game of sending your pieces off the board, right?

214
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,280
Only sending my own pieces flying.
[This wasn't supposed to happen...]

215
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,420
[Kyung Soo's turn]

216
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,850
Just slightly, without hitting anything.

217
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,170
- How do you do that?
- Oops.

218
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,780
- What's this?
- What is that?

219
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,610
[Lets him off the hook because at least he didn't send it flying]

220
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,760
[Chang Wook] Should we go for a strategy to enter into their midst to create some confusion?

221
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,790
Okay, I'll try to infiltrate their forces.

222
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,890
Ah, of course.
[Determined]

223
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,050
That's very experienced of you.

224
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,980
[This guy...]

225
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,330
My path is...
[Freedom, once again]

226
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,570
[Burst out laughing]

227
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,340
[Snicker]

228
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,720
- That was exactly my chosen path.
- This is great!
[Freedom, rather than infiltration]

229
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,730
I think it's better to be defensive than offensive.

230
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,630
Who is going first?
 [At that moment, Soo Bin gets up nonchalantly]

231
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,790
Just pull mine down.

232
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,950
- What the...
- It was so clean.

233
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,520
Why am I so bad at this?
 [Ace Soo Bin succeeds in her surprise attack]

234
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,580
She's really good at this.

235
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,950
[Current score is 5:8 in favor of the black team]

236
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,840
[Dong Yeon] You should try using your ring finger,

237
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,310
because you seem to have trouble with your thumb.

238
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,360
Try this.

239
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,900
Because it seems like you're having difficulty with your thumb.
 [Having seen enough, the referee gives her a quick coaching lesson]

240
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,820
But is the referee teaching an opposing player?

241
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,250
- Come on, they're so pitiful!
- Is that possible?

242
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,650
I just feel so bad for them.

243
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,810
Why would you be helping the opposing side?
 [A controversy arises regarding the fairness of the referee]

244
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,760
I just felt bad as a fellow human being.
 [Having received the soft-hearted referee's support]

245
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,100
- It's okay. It worked.
- Is it my turn now?
 [Docking, success]

246
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,040
This one is easy, right?

247
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,310
[Worried]

248
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,880
- Man, this really hurts my pride.
- This one isn't too hard, right?

249
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,460
[Soo Bin] You can't hit it too hard.

250
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,210
But you also can't hit it too gently.

251
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,770
You can't hit it too hard.

252
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,080
But you also can't hit it too gently.

253
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,400
She grabbed him by the collar.
 [Grabbing him by his collar, again]

254
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,950
You can't hit it too gently.
 [A tragedy resulting from feeling too much pressure]

255
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,370
You can't hit it too gently.

256
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,310
- I thought I hit it pretty hard.
- This is a bit...

257
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,400
Sunbaenim, if you don't go defensive right now, then Soo Bin Sunbae

258
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,820
- could knock this one out.
- But this one is currently stuck to this one.

259
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,250
[Chang Wook] When I hit this one, looking at it from an engineering perspective,

260
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,110
I think my piece would fly off the board.

261
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,520
Yeah.

262
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,520
This is quantum mechanical physics.

263
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,900
[Kyung Soo] But since we started, he keeps coming up with great strategies,

264
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,980
and yet all his pieces fly off the board.

265
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,240
- Farewell.
- I'll start by infiltrating.
 [Despite the derisive laughter of the black team]

266
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,430
- Infiltration again?
- Do you have to infiltrate? Can't you leave it alone?
 [A second attempt at infiltration]

267
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,400
[Will he succeed in infiltration this time?]

268
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,210
It's a highway to freedom.

269
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,430
It's a highway to freedom.

270
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,690
...to freedom.

271
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,060
[Freedom]

272
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,000
Geez, I really can't do this. I'm sorry.

273
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,230
I'll make the ramen.

274
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,400
Why am I so bad at this?

275
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,640
It's so funny.
 [Expert at setting Go marble pieces free]

276
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,760
All right, let's reassess.

277
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,500
[Due to Chang Wook's performance, the score is 3:7 in favor of the black team]

278
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,240
Come on, try to do well.

279
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,880
- I want to do well too.
- I'm saying this because I feel really bad.

280
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,590
He feels bad for us...

281
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,880
[Considering her plan of action]

282
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,110
That's not a bad choice.

283
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,540
- This one isn't bad?
- Yeah, it's not bad.
 [Coaching her closely]

284
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,000
The referee is too much...

285
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,340
- They're so down right now.
- Whose side are you on?

286
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,370
[Will Dong Yeon's coaching have any effect?]

287
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,880
[Flies off the board]
[Has no effect]

288
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,400
Ah... freedom.

289
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,190
You are looking at the piece when you're hitting it, right?

290
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,060
Or are you hitting it, hoping that it will hit something? I'm really just curious.

291
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,160
You can do it! You can do it!
 [Kyung Soo is aiming to kill two birds with one stone]

292
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,470
You can knock both of them off.

293
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,620
You can do it! You can do it!
[Target: two white pieces]

294
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,990
You can knock both of them off.

295
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,800
[Perfectly strikes Chang Wook]

296
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,200
This was intentionally hitting him.

297
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,270
He must have had a grudge against him.

298
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:44,990
That was really cool just then.

299
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,710
- How did he end up doing that?
- I'm sorry!

300
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,070
It must be pretty hard to control the power of the hit.
 [With his turn just about to come up, Chang Wook]

301
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,910
- The difference in this battle is too overwhelming.
- Don't hit it too hard.
 [is crouching over in intense practice mode]

302
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,570
[No more of my Go marble pieces will be set free...]

303
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,440
This is psychological warfare now.
 [Making little practice motions]

304
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,930
What is this?

305

So, I was like, "Man, I envy you."

Am I not supposed to laugh?

807

[Nara] I mean, I get saying "very."

How does he go flying like that?

957
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,640
Maybe it's saying the word "like"!

- What is it?

969

I did this.
 [These two still don't know their hidden mission]

Oh, it's when she shows her teeth while laughing.

971
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,970
Is it when she waves her hand?

- I think that's what it is.
- What?

973
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,610
I think the taboo action for Chang Wook Sunbaenim is waving hands.

974
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:50,570
Noonim, do you usually enjoy swimming?

975
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:53,520

we'll take a question from you. Do you have any questions you want to ask Kwon Nara?

995
