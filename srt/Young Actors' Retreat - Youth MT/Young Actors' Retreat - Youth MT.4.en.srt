00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,350
They confirmed that the penalty is sleeping in tents there.

152
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,130
Oh, really?

153

[The tents are shaking and seem ready to fly away due to the growing force of the wind]

[Seo Joon stops after seeing something...]

[Feeling sheepish]

167

Which way? This way?
[He cooly goes on his way]

169

[Awkward...]

170
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,890
Was that his reaction just now?
[The people watching are feeling more sheepish]

171

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,590
Wow... he really doesn't get scared.

189
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,440
It's as if he's entered a bathhouse at his own home.

190
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,720
Yeah, it's like he's at a typical bathhouse.

[You're doing great, Team Leader!]

It's such a large space.

194
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,460
Will Kyung Soo be okay?

195
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,680
[No]

196
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,580

Is this also a place I can enter?

206
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,020
[Without hesitation, he opens the bathhouse door]

207
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,110
[Thud, thud, thud, thud, thud!]

[Search machine Park Seo Joon returns proudly]

218

227
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,230

[Why does he suddenly have phlegm?]

310
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,350
- Did he get injured?
- He's groaning.

311
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,740
Did he get hit by the ghost?

312
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,750
S-Someone is passing by. I saw you!

313
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,620
I saw you there!

314
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,170
I saw you, I saw you!

315
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:10,170
Oh, I guess not. I'm sorry.
[Yeah, you saw that there's nobody there]

316
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,410
So, I can go now, right?

317
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,390
I can go, right?

318
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:21,120
[He tries to run away after finding just three tickets]

319

[Reunites with the ghost on the road back]

320
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,060
But gosh, you're so... so scary.

321
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,580
Ryu Kyung Soo...
[AH!]

322
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,530
[Can somehow relate again]

323
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,230
Please go inside the bathhouse. Go inside the bathhouse.

324
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,730
Gosh! I don't want to, really!

325
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,220
No, I don't want to! I don't want to!

[Playing around affectionately]

329
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,110
This is why I said I wasn't going to do variety shows!

330
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,110
This is why I said I wasn't going to...

331
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,540
This is why I said I wasn't going to do variety shows!

332
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,990
[Seriously, even your shouting is funny... ]

333
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,070
Ah! Seriously, I...

334
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,280
[Thankfully, time is up, and the mission ends]

335
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,080
What's your name?

336
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,060
[Silent]

337
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,780
You've really worked hard today.

338
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,570
[He exchanges greetings with the ghosts who had worked hard]

339
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,280
[He returns to his teammates]

340
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,170
You were great.
[Became haggard in such as short duration]

341
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,710
There's a lot! He brought back a lot. Kyung Soo!

342
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,570
There's a lot! He brought back a lot.
[Brought back three tickets]

343
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,660
Kyung Soo, does it hurt a lot?

344
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,230
- Why were you groaning?
- Does it hurt? Are you okay?
- Yes.

345
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,000
I got really scared.
[Enduring his pain to check the exemption tickets]

346
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,010
Ex- "Axemption Ticket?"

347
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,980
[It's unfortunate, but it's a fake]

348
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,440
Axemption ticket...

349
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,810
Axemption ticket?

350
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,350
[Saying harsh words with his eyes]

351
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,550
So, you're telling me that this is fake, right?

352
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,880
What is this?
[Team Danmuji has two real exemption tickets]

353
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,290
[The two remaining tickets have to be real in order to at least have a tie]

354
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,870
- I hope at least one of them is a real one.
- I know, right?

355
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,310
I want to cheer him on.

[Irresistible Kyung Soo makes even other teams cheer for him]

357
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,230
Is it a real exemption ticket?

358
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,360
[One of the two tickets is a real exemption ticket]

359
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,720
Is it a real exemption ticket?

360
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,980
[There is still hope!]

361
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,080
- We just need one more ticket to be real!
- You're the best!

362
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,930
- How many more do we need?
- They got two real ones.

363
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,380
There's only one left?
[Team Danmuji is on the edge of their seats]

364
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,860
- Please be it.
- Let's see what the final note is.
[It's all down to the final ticket now...]

365
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,420
Are we going to end up with a tie?
[Nervous]

366
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,960
Please!

367
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,190
[And the final result is...]

368
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,160
No...

369
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,590
[Dejected]

370
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,850
A "Hooray Ticket"?

371
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,200
Hooray!
[Team Danmuji, hooray!]

372
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,740
[Really happy]

373
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,390
Hooray!

374
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,500
You did well.

375
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,440
But geez, that's a bit too much. What's with a "hooray ticket"?

376
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,050
So does that mean we're sleeping here?

377
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,110
[Nara, Nalwoochoban] Hey, Joo Young, take care of my space.

378
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,880
- Okay, I'll be there first.
- Okay.

379
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,390
Team Nalwoochoban, congratulations on last place!

380
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,280
As you all probably guessed by now,

381
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,420
Ji Chang Wook's team will receive the penalty of...
[The scary punishment that everyone expected is...]

382
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,500
[Are they really going to be sleeping outdoors in the tents?]

383
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,600
making brunch for tomorrow.

384
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,900
[Relieved]

385
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,350
[It's such a relief to find out that it's not sleeping outdoors]

386
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,420
[The other teams are also relieved for them]

387
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,080
Wow, I was so scared! Why did you put up those tents, then?

388
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,200
The tents were part of a sponsorship.

389
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,780
- I see.
- That is pretty important.

390
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,780
Come on. What is this!

391
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,880
We were tricked.
[The staff never said that sleeping outdoors was the penalty]

392
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,450
Yoon Kyung Ho has to say goodbye here because of a prearranged schedule.

393
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,900
You've worked so hard today!

394
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,790
I had wanted to go in there once, but it's too bad.

395
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,240
But it was great being here together with everyone.

396
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,450
All this will be a good memory for me, even the rain.

397
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,530
It was really good to be here.

398
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,550
We also enjoyed being together with you.

399

Thank you!

[After the end of a lively bravery training]

401
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,890
- Hae Won. Was it fun?
- Huh?

402
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,590
Yeah, it was really fun.

403
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,640
They really pack a full schedule for the day.

404
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,990
Is there, by any chance, a hat in that car, in the middle?

405
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,540
- It's on a seat.
- A hat...

406
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,820
- AH!
- What's wrong!

407
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,470
[A giant moth appears]

408
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,790
Whoa! Wait a second! Whoa!

409
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,770
[Appalled]

410
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:25,020
It's gone. That moth was way too big.
[Startled. Close the doors. Failed]

411
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,120
[Try again. Nara was so startled]

412
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,680
It was so big.

413
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,780
It was. I was shocked.
[It was absolutely shocking]

414
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,640
It was this big.

415
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,530
It was this big.
[And one person who got more scared than the others]

416
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,410
I feel a bit embarrassed now.

417
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,610
Sunbae, what was that just before?

418
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,650
- Huh? What?
- I didn't see it.

419
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,590
Sunbaenim is more afraid of bugs than ghosts.

420
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,020
A bug has a physical body.

421
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,340
I didn't see the moth, but because of Sunbaenim I got scared.

422
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,400
Why...??

423
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,840
I was just playing along with everyone else.

424
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,510
God, I have goosebumps!

425
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:59,210
- I really hate it!
- It was so big. It was this big.

426
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,270
But I really am curious how it was for you guys.
[Experienced ones]

427
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,620
Kyung Soo, were you really scared?

428
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,650
Oh, man... they really looked so scary...

429

He says they looked so scary!

430
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,860
[Kyung Soo] Noona, how would it be for you if you were to go somewhere like that by yourself?

431
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,690
I would... I would probably have literally fainted.

432
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,380
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

433
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,490
But the way you were sitting back there, you seemed so tough.

434
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,890
I couldn't choose you because I thought I would be making the wrong choice.

435
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,080
Obviously, I was acting tough.

436
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,360
[Fooled you!]

437
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,530
[Two guys are in tatters]

438
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,010
We've been utterly emptied out.

439
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,110
Geez, seriously.

440
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,810
I mean, it was pretty scary.

441
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,560
- Were you really scared?
- Yes.

442
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,390
[Sigh...]

443
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,140
Do you not believe me?

444
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,890
Yes. Is it really that scary? Really scary?

445
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,770
You have to solve that.
[A quick bravery training session during break time]

446
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,450
[While everyone was in a state of chaos because they were afraid]

447

This person is doing a good job.
[Beaming at the ghost]

They're so good at it.

I couldn't hear anything.
[And with a heart of glass, Hwang In Yeop]

454
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,110
Seriously, I was really...

455
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,630
in a state of panic back then.

456
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,080
