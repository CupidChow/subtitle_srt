Oh, finally, we're done. Done, done!

458

[Team Magic is done preparing the ingredients]

459

[Seo Joon] If you pinch the tail and tug, it falls off.

463
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,550
When you take off the head,

464
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,770
you need to take off at least up to this much.

465
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,650
Doing this makes me feel like...

466
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,350
we're actually running a business like we were in "Itaewon Class."

467
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,850
- [Kyung Soo] How difficult would it have been for the actual characters?
- I know, right.

468
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,330
[Joo Young] Seriously, because we're sitting here peeling shrimp like this...

469
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,250
[Seo Joon] They must have prepped the ingredients like this every day!

470
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,720
I felt like that this morning as well.

471
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,140
This kind of reminds me...of those days.

472
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,400
The three of you would have been doing this every day, with Jo Yi Seo not doing any of it.

473
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,910
Well, Jo Yi Seo...

474
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,890
would say that she's busy running the business.

00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,670
- Should I try tasting it?
- No, no! Don't taste it.

480
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,450
Why, Oppa? Did something go... Did something go wrong?

481
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,290
No, it's going fine.

482
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,890
Your eyes seem to be full of anxiety?

483
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,760
Oh, no, no.

484
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,880
Oh? Oh...

485
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,710
The color looks good, right?

486
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,620
This is ssamjang!
(T/N: A sauce for vegetable wraps made with soybean paste and pepper paste)

487
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,220
He has made ssamjang.

488
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,770
Oh, the color might look like that...

489
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,370
It's definitely ssamjang.
 [No doubt, it gives off a ssamjang visual]

490
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,310
It's not. It's not.
 [What he tried to make]

491
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,310
Ssamjang, ssamjang.
 [Completely different]

492
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:28,190
What is this? It really does look like ssamjang.

493
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,520
I think we're going to have to remake this again.

494
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,580
Really?

495
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,240
But since Bo Hyun is making it, it might not taste very good.
[Chef Baek's prophecy(?) became reality]

496
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,700
I think we're going to have to start over.

[Seo Joon faces a dilemma about what to do]

499
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,160
Let's redo it, then.

500
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,410
Even though we don't have a lot of time, we need to make the sauce and bring it.

501
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,330
You have about one and a half hours left.
 [There's an hour and a half before the pocha opens]

502
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,440
- Okay.
- Okay!

503

Thank you all!
 [The other teams headed to the pocha location]

Let's do it. Let's try making it quickly!

505
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,450
Should we look at the recipe again?
 [Team Itaewon, who were left behind, starts making the sauce again from scratch]

506
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,190
So, this much flour went into it.

507

[Will Seo Joon and Bo Hyun be able to remake the sauce in time?]

It went flying. I'm losing my mind.
[Yoo Jung gets flustered]

What should we name the soondae and intestine stir-fry?

How about "Soonmakheeji" (word play)?

00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,200
- Oh, that sounds like a great idea.
- I like it.

571
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,550

- What is that!
- They're all standing there like DanBam chefs.

We need to sell all 40 servings that we have.

So, we're pretty much set with "Masoolidak," at least.

578
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,220
So, everyone's good with "Masoolidak"?
(T/N: "masool" means magic, and "dak" means chicken)

579
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,530

583
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,430
- What? Why?
- The kimchi... is not well-fermented, so...

584
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,490
We bought well-fermented ones.

585
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,170
Since it's well-fermented kimchi, I think it'll taste good!

Woah.

and maybe after every 25 or 30 minutes,

- I think it would be good if it was just a bit sweeter.

Oh, okay.

772

Right? It looks like the coating doesn't seem to be sticking.

Sunbaenim,

845

the batter is too watery, so...

unlike what I expected,

847

it keeps breaking apart.

848
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,790
Then you need to add more pan-frying powder.

849
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,480
It's because it has been a while since we made the batter.

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,530
Water starts seeping out from the vegetables.

851
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:12,640
I think you'll need to heat up the pan first and then cook the jeon on low heat.

852
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,750
Or else it ends up getting burnt.

- That's true. I think it would be better to make it thinner.
- Please try tasting it.

910
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,740
[Two friendly looking people who arrive with their arms linked]

911
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,060
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

912
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,320

[Nervous]

914
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,830
- Hello!
- Welcome!

915
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,040
[DanBam also gives them a rousing welcome from afar]

916
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,980
Please try our food before you go.

917
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,780
Aren't we also going to try to get customers?

918
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,320
So it's another 6 minutes from now?

919
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,160
6 minutes? Yes, 6 minutes.
 [They're too busy researching the chicken]

920
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,210
- Hello!
- Hello!
 [The guests are first looking through Moonlight Dongdong's menu]

921
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:42,200
[Bo Gum] You can look around and then tell us what you would like to eat.

922
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,960
- I was going to try everything...
- Are you Park Bo Gum?

923
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,340
Daebak. You're so handsome.

924
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,110
Really, you're so good-looking.

925
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,930
Really?

926
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,520
Thank you.
[Thumbs up]

927
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,770
He's really so handsome!
[The lady also gives him a thumbs up]

928
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,300
Welcome to DanBam!

929
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,610
- Hello!
Hello!
 [Next, they walk over to DanBam]

930
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:58,250
- We came after work.
- Welcome, we're team DanBam.

931
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,850
Oh, you came after work!

932
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:06,210
So, we have gambas, and flat iron steak. Those are our two menus.

933
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,910
You should replenish some protein!

934
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,090
Yeah, you should fill up on some protein!
[A trustworthy team]

935
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,900
But you're so handsome. Let me look at you once before I go anywhere.

936
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,050
Thank you.
 [His face is more effective than his words in getting business]

937
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:18,610
Okay!
 [After looking at his handsome face once more]

938
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:21,430
- Hello!
- Hello!
 [They visit Magic Food Land]

939
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,620
- You're so handsome!
- Hello.

940
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:29,840
This is our menu. We have chicken, soondae with intestine, and kimchi jeon. Do you see anything that you would like?

941
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,230
What is "Masoolidak"?

942
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:36,410
[In Yeop] It's fried chicken, but because our drama is about magic,

943
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,580
- that's why we named it "Masoolidak."
- Ah. I watched this drama.

944
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,310
You watched it?
[Thumbs up]

945
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:41,420
- Just a Moment.
- Sure.
[The guests have seen all three pochas]

946
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,700
You can decide at your own pace after thinking about it.

947
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,930
- For now, let's go over there...
- Okay.
 [What should we eat?]

948
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,930
You can order your food comfortably from your seats.

949
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:51,110
If you're with your parents, the shredded potato jeon is probably the best.

950
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:54,340
Right?
 [Their gaze is fixated]

951
00:43:54,950 --> 00:44:00,060
[Which team was able to obtain the hearts of the first guests?]

952
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,810
[Passes on Magic pocha]

953
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,860
[Passes on DanBam pocha]

954
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,090
[Wistful]

955
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:09,870
Oh, you're back to eat here! You can place your order now.
 [They head straight to Moonlight Dongdong]

956
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:13,470
Here, we have refreshing spicy noodles,

957
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:14,920
and we have shredded potato jeon.

958
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,030
What is a Half Moon jeon?

959
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,410
It's when we give only half of the jeon.

960
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,740
- Just half?
- Yes.

961
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,880
- Should we eat a small one?
- Sure.

962
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,040
So, a Half Moon jeon?

963
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,990
So you don't want to eat any noodles?

964
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:26,090
[Considering]

965
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,270
- How about you guys share one together?
- Okay.

966
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,720
So, one spicy noodles,

967
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,340
- and one Half Moon jeon.
- One spicy noodles and one Half Moon jeon.

968
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,180
[Dong Yeon writes up the order]

969
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:36,990
[After receiving the order, he immediately adds the thin noodles to the pot]

970
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:40,560
- He's really so handsome.
- Thank you!
[After receiving the order, he immediately adds the thin noodles to the pot]

971
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,900
[Yoo Jung's shredded potato jeon goes into the frying pan as well]

972
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:51,910
Because I know that an older lady is eating this, I'm even more nervous.

973
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,110
H-How much more...

974
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,500
[Extremely nervous]

975
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,740
So, does that mean the guests can only eat from one pocha's menu?

976
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,180
I don't know.

977
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,870
- Hello!
- Hello!
 [We would like to add an order from DanBam as well]

978
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,060
Please give us these two.

979
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,660
Oh, okay!

980
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,330
[Seo Joon] I think an order came in, so I think you'll need to get ready.

981
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:10,130
Yes, it's nerve-wracking.
 [DanBam also gets their first order]

982
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:12,640
Excuse me...
 [Writing down the orders]

983
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,680
Please take this.

984
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,330
Oh, an order came in.
 [Giving one copy to the guests and the other copy to the kitchen]

985
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:20,750
- One of each.
- One of each!

986
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,080
Since I did the preparations like this,
 [In charge of gambas | In charge of steaks]

987
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,910
- you can just put it in and heat it up.
- Okay.
 [They start preparing the two menus]

988
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:27,740
- I like it.
- You can have a seat here.
 [After the guests finish their orders, they sit down]

989
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,490
Yes, please sit down here.

990
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,540
Oh... what about us?

991
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,920
Our food is good too...

992
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,820
We lost out on the guests.

993
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,460
But the heat is a bit low...
 [DanBam starts preparing the steak]

994
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,130
It is on the highest setting, but...

995
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:46,510
[Starts sizzling despite his worries]

996
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,620
[Meat plus garnish]

997
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,530
[Plus butter]

998
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:53,610
[Intensely focused]

[Park Sae Ro Yi's steak is complete!]

1002
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,210
Oh, my God. What should I do? I feel like I'm on a different planet.

1003
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,610
I know, right. Park Bo Gum is personally making our food.

1004
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:11,470
- We've really hit the jackpot!
- He's not looking over here.

1005
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,600
- He's so focused on cooking.
- True.

1006
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,120
It's such a pretty sight.

[His sights are set solely on the thin noodles]

[one person is becoming the most restless]

1025
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,170
No one is coming over here.

1026

We have chicken.
[Didn't hear anything]

1032
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:20,090

Yeah, that's right.

1061
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:38,920
Is it done?

1062
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,630
It's for that woman over there.
 [How would it taste?]

1063
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,440
Hello!

1064
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,100
- Your delicious spicy noodles are here! Excuse me?
- Bo Gum made this, right?

1065
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,400
Yes, Bo Gum made this.

1066
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,240
- Thank you!
- Thank you for the food!

1067
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,770
I'll enjoy it!

1068
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:53,130
I don't know if it will taste good.

1069
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,750
It looks good!

1070
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,650
The visuals! The visuals are great!

1071
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:01,140
Try it first, and tell me if it doesn't taste good.

1072
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,240
For me, just looking at your face makes it taste good.

1073
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,690
[You're the best]

1074
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:09,290
How did he make this in that food truck?

1075
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:10,710
How in the world are we getting to experience something so great like this?

1076
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:13,610
I know, right. You get to experience all kinds of things after living in this world for a while.
 [Finally, the first guests are trying the spicy noodles]

1077
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:17,990
[His eyes are fixed on them]

1078
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:24,120
[It really needs to taste good this time...]

1079
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,400
Would it be too salty?

1080
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,600
How is it?

1081
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,240
It's not that great?

1082
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,770
It's good! It's tasty.

1083
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:41,390
Ma'am, how is it?

1084
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,650
It's good. The flavor is just right!

1085
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,150
- Really? Seriously?
- Yeah.

1086
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,220
- I really mean it.
- Really?

1087
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:50,600
It's just slightly on the bland side. It's bland.

1088
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,350
It's bland?

1089
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:55,530
They said it's a little bland.

1090
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:58,710
- Maybe more sauce...
- I added quite a bit of sauce, though...

1091
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:02,490
But people's tastes are different, so...

1092
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:05,610
[Becoming serious again after hearing that it's bland]

1093
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:07,530
- Is it good?
- It's good, it's good.

1094
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:08,700
Everything's tasty.

1095
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,610
- It's strangely delicious.
- I'm so happy.
 [For the older lady's tastes, everything's absolutely delicious]

1096
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:14,990
I love Hwang In Yeop the most.
 [The three friends sit down at a table after their orders]

1097
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:17,660
I want to show him.
 [Her wallpaper on her phone screen is a photo of In Yeop]

1098
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,480
I'm really a big fan!

1099
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,040
- Tell him. Tell him that you're a big fan.
- How do I tell him?

1100
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,500
- Tell him for me.
- Okay.

1101
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,020
I feel like I'm about to cry.

1102
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:29,000
Oh, no, what am I going to do!
[While the guest who is In Yeop's major fan is getting teary]

1103
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,450
- Are the stir fry and kimchi jeon almost done?
- Yeah, they are almost ready.

1104
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:34,510
It'll be done in a minute.

1105
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:37,610
[After Hye Eun's coaching, Hae Won's figured it out]

1106
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:41,130
[The kimchi jeon is completed quickly]

1107
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:43,530
[Good job!]

1108
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,350
- I'm improving!
- You're doing great!

1109
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,520
It looks so good!

1110
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,820
I'm getting better at this!

1111
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:53,270
[Hye Eun's soondae and intestine stir-fry is also finished quickly]

1112
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,360
[Abundantly]

1113
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,740
[Filling up the plate with "Soonmakheeji"]

1114
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,420
The soonmak is here.

1115
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:06,430
All right. Got it.

1116
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:10,710
So, the food you ordered is here.

1117
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:14,020
She says she's a big fan of yours.
[Showing her wallpaper is also successful]

1118
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,180
She asked me to tell you for her.

1119
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,950
[Fist bump]

1120
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:19,440
[Overwhelmed]

1121
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,500
Oh, my God, we did this together!

1122
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,880
[Can't even speak]

1123
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,900
- Min Jeong, I'm so happy, I don't know what to do!
- Ow, that hurts...

1124
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,480
Oh, sorry.

1125
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,010
We'll enjoy the food.
 [Barely manages to calm down and takes a bite of "Soonmakheeji"]

1126
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:32,880
- It's good.
- Yeah, it's good!

1127
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:39,850
It's so good!

1128
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:43,790
Today is such a happy day.

1129
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:46,210
[Meanwhile, things are running smoothly for DanBam as well]

1130

[Having a blast]

1131
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:52,120
The torch is fun.

1132
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,690
Is using the torch better?
 [Adding a char flavor]

1133
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,620
[While the CEO is having a blast grilling the steaks]

1134
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,700
[Kyung Soo is setting up the steak garnish]

1135
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,000
Hyung, would three scoops like this be okay?

1136
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,810
Do two and a half scoops.

1137
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,250
[Exactly two and a half scoops]

1138
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,380
Seo Joon Hyung! How many mushrooms?

1139
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,440
Two mushrooms!

1140
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,640
[Adds two mushrooms]

1141
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,570
[Every part of the process underwent after receiving the CEO's confirmation]

1142
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,520
This looks like it's not enough.

1143
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,920
I know, right?

1144
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,810
I think we're going to need to give at least six per order. This is not going to work.

1145
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:26,340
I agree.
 [The plate is too big compared to the amount of food]

1146
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,940
The plate is too big, right?

1147
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,190
How about this? Would this be better?

1148
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,810
- That's better.
- But wouldn't it be a bit weird to scoop up and eat from this?

1149
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:36,560
- No, no, that's better. That's better.
- Okay, then. The gambas will be served in this container.

1150
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,890
We'll use this one.
 [Following the CEO's opinion and changing the container for the gambas]

1151
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:40,680
It looks like more.

[Getting to see Park Sae Ro Yi in person]

1155

It's like I'm watching TV right now.

1156
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:55,600
- It feels like we entered a drama.
- What was that?

1157
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,630
It's like we're in a drama.

I'm enjoying myself even though I'm not looking at my phone.

1160
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,720
There's no need to look at our phones.

1161
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,370
Honestly, there are so many handsome people here that I don't know who to look at.

1162
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:09,000
I know! I can't decide where to look.

1163
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,300
I really want to eat the steak soon! The steak!

1164
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,910
Yeah, I think it will be delicious.

2 gambas and 3 steaks.
 [The steak is being plated]

Oh! It's hot... It's hot.

1167

It's so hot.

1168
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,060
- Man, it's so hot...
- What's wrong?

1169
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,560
I-I think I'm going to... I'm going to need to put on some gloves!

1170
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,260
Kyung Soo, take your time. You could get hurt!

Hey, Kyung Soo. Kyung Soo, Kyung Soo.
[Slowly adding one at a time]

1172

Not like that.
 [The CEO comes over]

1173
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,930
So... you finished cutting it.

1174

From here,

1175

do this, and put it all on at once.

All at once.
 [Using the knife to put it all on at once]

- Okay?
- Got it.

1178

[Pouring until the last drop]

Hey! Kyung Soo, that's way too much sauce!

1184
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:03,540
We'll send it out for now, but next time, just use only a third of this.

1185
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,280
- Got it.
- Just one drizzle.

1186

[Our Kyung Soo is faithful but requires a lot of guidance]

1187

- Take it out together with the gambas, Nara.
- All right.

00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,110
Everything is ready, right? Let's send it out together.
 [Checking the serving time as well]

 [Presenting DanBam's menu for the first time]

1195

Oh, my God.

1196
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:31,950
Thank you.
[How would the guests respond?]

1197
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:34,630
It look like it will taste so good.
 [How would the guests respond?]

[High five of joy]

1202
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:50,180
The gambas didn't get served with the bread just now!

1203
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:52,710
Then give it to them saying that it's on the house.

- The beer is really good.
 [The three friends are in the middle of enjoying their food]

So, usually, we serve bread with gambas, but we forgot to give them to you.

- This one is the best.
- The Soonmak?

1216

It's really good!
- Oh, it's really good? Thank you.

1217

Thank you! Please enjoy the food.

1218
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,900
- They said that soonmak is delicious. They said it's really good.
- Oh, really?

1219
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:40,020
That's a relief!
[The kimchi jeon and "Soonmakheeji" is getting good feedback]

[They try adding frying powder into the batter]

I don't think this is right. The sauce... the batter...

[The cooking wizard has fallen into a dilemma]

- Okay.
- Okay. I got what you're saying.

1228
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:09,550
Then let's do this.

1229
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:12,260
If you're going to coat the chicken in the frying powder, then also dip it in the batter after.

1230
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,250
Then it should work.

1231

After pouring some of this batter
[Oh!]

1232

[Chang Wook] Wow, is making fried chicken this tough?

1244

This is my first time frying chicken.

1245
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:03,020
- What would we have done without you?
- Chicken...

1246
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,560
It's my first time frying chicken.

Welcome!

00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:17,810
- Let's eat intestine.
- Intestine?

1252
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,990
- Would soondae and intestine stir-fry be okay with you?
- Yes, yes.

1253
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:21,820
Soondae and intestine stir-fry and one "Masoolidak".

1254
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:24,620
Oh, Masoolidak? Yeah, the Masoolidak is good.

1255
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,730
Thank you.

It has only been 1 minute and 49 seconds!

1266

- Why is... 6 minutes so long?

I must be so restless right now.

1270
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,880
I wonder if they've learned how to cook.

[While the married couple is waiting, as if worried about a son who has never cooked before]

1272

It's because they're not that fast.

1273
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,150
Just wait.

1274
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:21,460
Wow, they're turning golden!

- Yes.

It might be hot! It could be hot.

1282
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:44,800
You need to serve it with the radish, okay?

1283
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,560
This is the Masoolidak.

[Nervous]

1291
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:13,600
This is because there's too much powder right now.

1292
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,460
Do you think this is happening because the layer of frying powder is too thin?
