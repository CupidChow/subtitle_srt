She's four years younger than me.

Do you know what he said to me before?

535

I was talking to Soo Bin Noona before, and I called her, Noona.

And he was like, "she's a noona"?

So I asked him how old he thought I was,

What do you mean, it's possible!

541
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:48,710
I thought that because your role in "Monstrous" left a deep impression on me.

What are you talking about?
