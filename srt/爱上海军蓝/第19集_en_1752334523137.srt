00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,400
We have arrived at the sea of Qin Xun.

3
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,800
Please gather quickly.

4
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
What are you doing?

5
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,600
Go.

6
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Attention.

7
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,600
The helicopter is ready.

8
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,000
The helicopter is ready to take off.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Long Ballad

10
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,800
The three five five is the time to take off.

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,200
The time to take off.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The Long Ballad

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,000
Right turn, please.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The Long Ballad

16
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The Long Ballad

17
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The Long Ballad

18
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The Long Ballad

19
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,200
Five four, take it back.

20
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes.

21
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,200
What happened just now?

22
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
What sound am I hearing?

23
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,200
Say something.

24
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,000
Report.

25
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
I will continue to develop

26
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,400
targeted training plan.

27
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,200
What training plan?

28
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Is the black ladder too long

29
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,600
or the floor too low?

30
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Or is the wave too big and the ship too loose?

31
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,000
Training after you get on the ship?

32
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
What did you do earlier?

33
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,000
Report.

34
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,000
We have no excuse.

35
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,600
Prepare to add orders immediately.

36
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,400
Whose voice was that just now?

37
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
It was the sound of the ship.

38
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,800
Who?

39
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Say something.

40
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,400
Report.

41
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,400
Come out.

42
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Report, I'm sorry, Brigadier.

43
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
I made a mistake just now.

44
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Not bad.

45
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,800
You didn't find any excuse

46
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,200
and admitted your mistake directly.

47
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Very good.

48
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,200
But I am very disappointed.

49
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Yes.

50
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,200
There are no mistakes in training.

51
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,200
It's just a small ship's reaction.

52
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,800
It can be understood.

53
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,200
But I don't understand.

54
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,600
Because you are a special force member of the Chinese Navy.

55
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
The whole fleet

56
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,400
and the dangerous merchant ships

57
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,800
are all on your shoulder.

58
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,400
A small wave

59
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,800
hooked you up and made you dizzy.

60
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
When the real danger comes,

61
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,200
what do you use to protect others?

62
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,200
What do you use to protect others?

63
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
I don't care if you are dizzy in the cabin

64
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,600
and spit out the guts.

65
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
As long as you hear the combination number,

66
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,400
you have to stand still

67
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,800
and hold your gun.

68
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,800
Understand?

69
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,800
Understand.

70
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't care if you are a South or a North.

71
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Have you ever had experience in going out of the sea?

72
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Or because you didn't have a good rest

73
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,400
for any other reason?

74
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,800
I just emphasize one thing.

75
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,400
Anyone can stand still.

76
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,000
You can't.

77
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,200
You can't.

78
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,600
Do you know

79
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,800
what happened when I was atril?

80
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,600
Do you remember I wasn't sick?

81
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
I can remind you.

82
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,400
When you think

83
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,000
you are like a special force member,

84
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,600
come and ask me for return painting!

85
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,800
Assubmitted!

86
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,920
Take them away.

87
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,440
Yes.

88
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,120
Listen up.

89
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,560
If you're a soldier,

90
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,240
make some noise.

91
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,880
If I hear any more noise,

92
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,320
swim back to me.

93
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,040
Let's go.

94
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,240
Since there are more, tell them all.

95
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,220
You must say something about allowed strangers.

96
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,060
I know you're the filming queen!

97
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,940
You know you're the editor?

98
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,660
My director fondled me as men g camel.

99
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,720
I know he's gonna pose as benim bagel.

100
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,980
You know he's gonna pose like cat sand.

101
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,040
He will pose like cat sand.

102
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,860
I already told you it's on me.

103
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,800
You make me...

104
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,460
a fool, commæ²¹ding me like this,

105
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,780
I can't even stand on our feet.

106
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,760
Just that,

107
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,560
I just changed the delivery order for you.

108
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
Zhong Qing left.

109
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,960
You're not used to it, right?

110
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,760
Look at that little boy.

111
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
Don't worry.

112
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Their protective industry

113
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,160
is slow and fast.

114
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,960
Maybe they'll be back in a few days.

115
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,560
Let's go.

116
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,960
What's wrong?

117
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,960
Are you going to make trouble again?

118
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,960
Mom.

119
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,560
I...

120
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,560
I'm back.

121
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,360
I'm pregnant.

122
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,760
Hurry up.

123
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,560
Don't hold it.

124
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Silly girl.

125
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,160
Let me hold it.

126
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Eat more.

127
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
You need to eat more to be healthy.

128
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,360
Enough.

129
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,560
Don't add more to the baby.

130
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,360
He's just pregnant.

131
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,560
Let him eat by himself.

132
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,160
He has no appetite now.

133
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,760
The less appetite you have, the more you need to eat.

134
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,960
This is called exercise.

135
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,160
You need to eat to be healthy.

136
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,560
You need to eat when you're healthy.

137
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,960
Look at your dad.

138
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,760
He knows he's going to be an old man.

139
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,160
He must be happy.

140
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,360
It's not important to be an old man.

141
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,160
But

142
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,560
my daughter's health is very good.

143
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,760
Eat more.

144
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,960
Eat more.

145
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,160
Okay, mom. I'll eat more.

146
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,960
Sit down.

147
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,560
Yang Yang.

148
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,360
You're pregnant now.

149
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,560
That's double-edged sword.

150
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,160
You need to be careful with everything you do.

151
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
You need to be slow.

152
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,960
Zong Qing is not at home now.

153
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
Tell us what's going on.

154
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,360
Don't worry.

155
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,560
I'll be careful.

156
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Zong Qing is not here.

157
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,360
He's doing the escort mission.

158
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,960
It's his duty as a soldier.

159
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,560
It's also his duty as a soldier.

160
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,760
As a soldier's family,

161
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,960
you need to be prepared for this.

162
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,160
You need to be prepared.

163
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,160
Why are you calling me again?

164
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,960
You can't help me with anything.

165
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,360
Okay, okay.

166
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,560
I won't talk about you.

167
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,760
Dad, mom, it's okay.

168
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
I can understand.

169
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,960
Look.

170
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,160
I know it.

171
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Right.

172
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,160
Let me ask you.

173
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,160
Did you meet the party in the hospital?

174
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
When did you make the appointment for the check-up?

175
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,960
Don't worry. I've made the appointment.

176
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,160
When is the appointment?

177
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Tell me when.

178
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
I'll go with you.

179
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,160
Okay.

180
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,560
This is the important thing.

181
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,960
Okay, okay.

182
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,760
It's important.

183
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,160
Okay.

184
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,960
What's the plan for the next trip?

185
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
You check the location

186
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,960
of the A-Toka

187
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,160
and the route today.

188
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,160
I've made a plan long ago.

189
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,360
It's all in the mobile phone.

190
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,760
I'll take it as I need it.

191
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,960
Okay.

192
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,560
Okay.

193
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,360
Then let's take a break today.

194
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,760
We'll start work at 8 a.m. tomorrow.

195
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,160
Okay.

196
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
I'll put my luggage in first.

197
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,760
Okay.

198
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
I'll go upstairs to check.

199
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,760
Okay.

200
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,160
Okay.

201
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,760
The environment here is very normal.

202
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,160
It's not good for the health condition.

203
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,160
Mr. Han,

204
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,160
why don't you go back to the research center?

205
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,560
Just keep an eye on it.

206
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,160
No need.

207
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,560
No matter where I live,

208
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,960
I can't show up.

209
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,160
I'll have to

210
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,360
bother you to solve most of the problems.

211
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,560
I think it's good here.

212
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,160
It's clean and quiet.

213
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
Tang Xin can live here.

214
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,360
Why can't I?

215
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Put your luggage in.

216
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,760
Do you know why I brought you here?

217
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,560
I know, sir.

218
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,760
This is the highest point in the whole city.

219
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,160
The higher, the higher.

220
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,960
Everyone carried it like this.

221
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,160
I'm sorry, captain.

222
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,960
I let you down.

223
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,360
Li Nan Wang,

224
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
I'm sorry.

225
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
I'm sorry.

226
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
I'm sorry.

227
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
Li Nan Wang,

228
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,960
you never let me down.

229
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,960
I hope you

230
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,360
never let yourself down.

231
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
Sir, captain.

232
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,360
I will definitely bring back our two B-bombs.

233
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,760
I know you can do it.

234
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,960
But you have to be quick.

235
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
Report.

236
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
Captain.

237
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,960
I want to know

238
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,760
how you became so strong step by step.

239
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,560
Am I strong?

240
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,160
Captain, in my heart,

241
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,160
you have always been the strongest and most hardworking

242
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,760
and the most brilliant person.

243
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,560
Including Captain Chen,

244
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,560
Cheng Pai,

245
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
Team Song,

246
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,960
and their representative.

247
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,360
Each of them is a particularly brilliant team member.

248
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,560
Only me,

249
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,760
and the rest of the team,

250
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
and me,

251
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,560
have been dragging everyone's back.

252
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,960
If you are so bad,

253
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,760
why should I recruit you?

254
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,760
Everyone walked over like this.

255
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,360
It's normal to be dizzy, afraid, and afraid.

256
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,560
It's normal.

257
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,960
People are the area of ââblood and flesh.

258
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,560
They will inevitably be wronged.

259
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,160
When I was new,

260
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,560
the squad leader told me,

261
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,560
as long as you can bear the hardest,

262
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,560
the next road will be easy.

263
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
Do you understand?

264
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Yes.

265
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Really?

266
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,960
Don't leave here before you go to bed.

267
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,360
Hold on to me like a nail.

268
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Yes.

269
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,760
I will.

270
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
Sister,

271
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,560
we have been doing this for two days.

272
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,560
The other side has never opened this big night.

273
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,560
The logo only says AutoCard.

274
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,960
Even the full name is not used.

275
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,760
I don't think this is a fake company.

276
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,960
Didn't you check this place?

277
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
Are you sure it's right?

278
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,560
Yes, it's right here.

279
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,560
I don't think it's a fake company.

280
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,760
They are all here.

281
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,560
Let's wait a little longer.

282
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,560
One, two, three.

283
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,560
Four, speed up.

284
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,360
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

285
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,560
Go on.

286
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,360
Eleven, twelve, three, fourteen, fifteen.

287
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,360
Left turn.

288
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
Step on the red line.

289
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,960
Walk on the red line.

290
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,960
Let's hold on to it.

291
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,360
Walk on the red line.

292
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,760
Red line.

293
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
Hurry up.

294
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,560
Ready.

295
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,360
Go.

296
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:30,160
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

297
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,960
Run on the red line.

298
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Hurry up.

299
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,760
Red line.

300
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,160
Go on.

301
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,160
Red line.

302
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,360
Ready.

303
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,760
What are you doing?

304
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,560
Eat. Hurry up.

305
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,960
I'm afraid of vomiting if I eat.

306
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,760
I have to train later.

307
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,760
Hurry up. Don't be so slow.

308
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
Are you all thirsty?

309
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,160
Five, four, seven, eight, nine, ten.

310
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,360
Corinthians.

311
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,960
Right on the limit.

312
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,560
We've worked on it for days.

313
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,360
We never madewining if we just straight from Da Wen.

314
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,160
This company is tendency to close?

315
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,560
Whether it closes or not,

316
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,960
koska much pastime can't be helped.

317
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,360
Then what should we do?

318
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,560
This sincerity

319
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,640
can always move this person who broke the news.

320
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,880
Yes.

321
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,440
Send him an email.

322
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Cafe?

323
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,960
There must be

324
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,600
some special place around the cafe.

325
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,040
Otherwise, they can't

326
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,720
come here to drink coffee.

327
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,080
There is a company called Toca

328
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,920
across the street.

329
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,400
The company must be having some problems.

330
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,920
Do you know this company?

331
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,400
I can go and investigate.

332
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,120
You better keep an eye on the reporters.

333
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,440
I'll ask for other friends to investigate this matter.

334
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,840
There are some needles over there.

335
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,800
Don't touch me.

336
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,960
Don't touch me.

337
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,080
Calm down. Calm down.

338
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,800
Don't be angry.

339
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,680
Don't touch me.

340
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,640
Calm down. Calm down.

341
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,120
You...

342
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,240
You...

343
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,640
Don't touch me.

344
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,920
I told you to get ready earlier.

345
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,280
Look. There are so many people.

346
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,040
Don't touch me.

347
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,400
Mom.

348
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,280
I still can't see clearly.

349
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,320
You can't see clearly?

350
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,120
Let me see.

351
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,600
Here.

352
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,200
Here.

353
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,680
This must be his little head.

354
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,520
Here.

355
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,880
I think it should be his little arm.

356
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,920
Here.

357
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,400
This must be his little butt.

358
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,200
All right.

359
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,240
I don't want to look at it.

360
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,920
It's a cotton bud.

361
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,200
Fine. I won't look at it.

362
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,640
Then,

363
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,480
take a good rest.

364
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,520
I'll get you a cup of juice.

365
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,440
Go.

366
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,360
You should just walk.

367
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,560
I've been in Rome for days

368
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,880
and I've been watchingral ATOKA's company.

369
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,960
But this place has never opened.

370
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,440
No one is in there or moving.

371
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,160
If you have other clues,

372
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,880
please inform me right away.

373
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,000
He went surfing,

374
00:23:44,600 --> 00:24:05,240
but he got lost at the

375
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,320
Music Hall at the ocean.

376
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,480
Really?

377
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,120
As we're tender,

378
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,600
This big figure

379
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,040
Can you say more specifically

380
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,200
When he arrives

381
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,720
You know who it is

382
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,400
I have always been curious about your identity

383
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,160
How do you know so many things

384
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,720
You don't need to know my identity

385
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,440
You should think about it

386
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,920
How to keep an eye on this big figure

387
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,640
Fight for something practical from him

388
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,880
Ok

389
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,120
Hold on

390
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,360
Swallow back

391
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,920
I can't stand this smell

392
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,880
Report

393
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,680
Say

394
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,640
You don't have to accompany me, you can go back

395
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,280
I can

396
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,960
You think i want to accompany you

397
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,760
I'm afraid you have to wipe it on the sword

398
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,880
Think of something else

399
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,120
Go straight

400
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,160
Go straight

401
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,200
Come back

402
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,240
Can it be

403
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,600
Row

404
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,920
It's not good to practice such a little thing

405
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,120
Come ready

406
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,920
Hold it

407
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,400
one

408
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,680
Two

409
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,280
You said you couldn't do it

410
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,400
go

411
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,280
Go

412
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,080
Go straight

413
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,160
Hurry up

414
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,400
Go straight

415
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,800
come back

416
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,880
go

417
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,440
go

418
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:53,920
go

419
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,480
go

420
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,760
Go straight

421
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,840
This is not a line

422
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,760
Go straight

423
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,600
Little red line

424
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,400
come back

425
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:22,100
Look for the

426
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,640
chickens

427
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,120
go

428
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,360
Sir, I'm here to...

429
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,160
Go on.

430
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,000
Yes.

431
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,780
Mr. Han!

432
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,580
Mr. Han!

433
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,560
Mr. Han,

434
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,200
we've moved to another place.

435
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,760
We're moving to Aston Hotel.

436
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,120
You moved to a hotel?

437
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,520
Why the hotel?

438
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,040
Why would I want to move to a hotel?

439
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:01,920
Aston Hotel

440
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,720
is ë´ê°

441
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,820
a Millettle Hotel.

442
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,820
The Aston Hotel is the highest hotel in Rome.

443
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,060
It's not something ordinary people can afford.

444
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,420
Welcome.

445
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,060
Thank you.

446
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,700
Xinjian.

447
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,820
The door is not locked. Come in.

448
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,820
Your room is big.

449
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,620
It's really nice.

450
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,740
What's up?

451
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,860
Do you want to change it?

452
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,700
No, no.

453
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,500
You should live here.

454
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,540
Well,

455
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,700
what are we going to do next?

456
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,180
We can't just wait in the hotel room.

457
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,220
The person who reported it said

458
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,620
when the big figure arrives,

459
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,220
we will know who it is.

460
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,420
He means

461
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,820
we must know him.

462
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,660
Or at least know this person.

463
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:07,900
Okay.

464
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,860
I know what to do.

465
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,020
How is Yilan's training?

466
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,220
She's not a rabbit anymore.

467
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,860
I guess it's time to train her again.

468
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,300
It's not bad.

469
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,060
We should've known it too.

470
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,900
Mr. Han, we are in a hurry.

471
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,100
His room is supposed to...

472
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:55,900
Yeah?

473
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,220
Okay.

474
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,140
Already?

475
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,320
Yeah.

476
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,500
Let's go now.

477
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,260
I'm watching if apertures are available.

478
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,700
Tang Xin is gone for now.

479
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,660
How many floors does Tang Xin live in?

480
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,140
35 floors.

481
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,060
35?

482
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,940
For the next few days,

483
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,900
you must be careful

484
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,940
when you go out.

485
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,580
Tang Xin can't find you.

486
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,820
When we eat,

487
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,260
try to order food in the room

488
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,700
and solve it in the room, okay?

489
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,460
Okay.

490
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,820
Looks like it'll go.

491
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,540
Give me the glasses.

492
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,600
To save yourself.

493
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,820
If you have beef with your externalì´ì 

494
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,620
Let's stop in the middle of the past

495
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,600
I agree

496
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:20,340
I have to finish the

497
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:20,980
Show me

498
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,280
Today is still overthrowing thelands

499
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,140
Right

500
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,720
I'm going to the cafeteria later

501
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,560
That's your workshop

502
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,600
Mi Xiaobai, I will defend.

503
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,040
Procure training

504
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,120
Do the training

505
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,020
Captain

506
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,100
Captain

507
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:54,780
Mi Xiaobai

508
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,920
I am willingness

509
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,280
Do whatever you want

510
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,720
I feel

511
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,600
You've been practicing too hard. Go back and rest.

512
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,800
I'll stand by your side.

513
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:06,960
Yes.

514
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,120
Report.

515
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,760
Come in.

516
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,880
What?

517
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,000
Brigadier,

518
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,760
Yi Nan Wang has something to say.

519
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,680
Go ahead.

520
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,320
Report, Brigadier.

521
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,720
I...

522
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,000
I...

523
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
I'm not going to sail.

524
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,200
You're a special force.

525
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,800
Shouldn't you sail?

526
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,800
What?

527
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,960
You want me to be nervous?

528
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,400
Report.

529
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,480
I want to get the captain's seal.

530
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,040
You only want the captain's seal.

531
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,960
What about yours?

532
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,400
You gave it to me?

533
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
I want it back too.

534
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,840
Take it away.

535
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,440
Who's going to keep it for you?

536
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,880
Thank you, Brigadier.

537
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,800
I'll take it.

538
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,560
Go back to your position.

539
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,280
Yes.

540
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,760
Yes.

541
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,120
Brigadier,

542
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,080
thank you for the apple. It's super sweet.

543
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,960
What's so sweet about it?

544
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,840
Don't think this is a big deal.

545
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,120
And you,

546
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,560
if you try to get in my way again,

547
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,200
I'll have you take it

548
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,520
to the floating ship cruise base.

549
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,600
Yes.

550
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,680
Go.

551
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,000
Commander,

552
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,080
the People's Liberation Army of China,

553
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,040
Navy's escort team,

554
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,560
are ready to go on the escort mission.

555
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,040
All ready.

556
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,720
The captain of the fleet,

557
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,720
the commander of the fleet,

558
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,080
Xu Jianhua,

559
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,480
and the political commissar, Song Guoqing.

560
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,080
Comrades,

561
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,160
the escort mission is very clear.

562
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,440
I won't say more.

563
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,600
Each of you

564
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,280
represents the People's Liberation Army of China,

565
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,280
and the Navy of China.

566
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,280
I'm here

567
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,640
waiting for you to come back safely.

568
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,680
Salute.

569
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,160
Salute.

570
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,040
Salute.

571
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,320
Unit 116.

572
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,200
There's a signal.

573
00:36:59,280 --> 00:36:59,920
Report to medium.

574
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,920
Unit 116 about to leave the bow.

575
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,480
It'll be a night ship soon as it's ready to go.

576
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,600
It'll drive down by four.

577
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:07,920
Report to average.

578
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,280
The right line One degree A upfront to the two tides.

579
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,440
Heading to Hong Kong.

580
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,480
Seven-Cause Cruise ship Freedom.

581
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,280
It's going down by four tides.

582
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,160
I'm not going to eat.

583
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,760
What are you doing?

584
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,760
I'm just looking.

585
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,560
Stop hiding. I saw it.

586
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,160
Drink some.

587
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,760
I want to see it.

588
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
Go and see it.

589
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,760
Here.

590
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,960
I bought this craft pen.

591
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,360
What are you doing?

592
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,760
I'm sending my baby here.

593
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
I'm going to the hospital.

594
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
I'll be back soon.

595
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,960
I'll be back.

596
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
I'll be back.

597
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
I want to see it.

598
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,360
I want to see it.

599
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,760
I want to see it too.

600
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,960
When did you buy it?

601
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,160
It's filled with seawater.

602
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,560
Let me see.

603
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,160
What are you looking at?

604
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,960
It's your foot.

605
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,560
Let me see.

606
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,360
It's your water.

607
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,960
I want to see it.

608
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Go and get me some water.

609
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,960
I want to see it.

610
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,760
It's filled with seawater.

611
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
This is good.

612
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,960
I want to see it.

613
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,360
Thank you.

614
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,560
Thank you.

615
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,560
Chairman, your passport.

616
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,360
It's hot.

617
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,160
It's done.

618
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:24,960
Chairman.

619
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,960
Chairman Han.

620
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,760
Here.

621
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,160
Let's go.

622
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,560
Chairman Han.

623
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,560
Here.

624
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,160
Chairman Han.

625
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,760
When I was observing the reporters,

626
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,960
I accidentally found

627
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,160
Chairman and Mr. Yu Tian.

628
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,560
My dad and my brother?

629
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,560
Where?

630
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,560
In the lobby.

631
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,760
It's obvious that they live in this hotel.

632
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,360
I know why Tang Xin

633
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,760
moved here.

634
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,560
When we go out,

635
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,160
we should be more careful.

636
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,960
So the person who reported the news

637
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,760
is the big guy,

638
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
Han Changzhou from Changzhou Group.

639
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,160
Do you know the room number?

640
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,760
I just followed their elevator

641
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
to the 41st floor.

642
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,960
I didn't dare to follow them too closely.

643
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,160
So I'm afraid

644
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,160
I won't be able to sleep in the room for now.

645
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,960
How about

646
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,360
you go and touch the clouds?

647
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,360
I'm sorry.

648
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,360
I'm sorry.

649
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,360

00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,360
I'm sorry.

00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,360
I'm sorry.

668
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,360
I'm sorry.
