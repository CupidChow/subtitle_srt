1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
To be the one you think is worth it

2
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You can tell secretary Zhou about this

3
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Welcome my friend

4
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hello my friend

5
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hello hello hello

6
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
How are you, I am fine

7
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I am fine

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I am fine

9
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I am fine

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You lost some weight

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You look nice

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Very good very good

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Your father is still there

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah there there

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's been a while since I saw him last time

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Please

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Friend

19
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
William

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Again

21
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We meet again

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Old friend

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sit here and chat

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Please

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
William

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is your favorite tea

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is the tea you like

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I hope you can enjoy it

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Thank you

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Thank you very much

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
William

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What's the good thing about

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Getting us here this time

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You gathered us here in Roman

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Is there something important

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah the scout group

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
They discovered some artifacts

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I've already sent the ship

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To locate that sunken ship

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
They found some cultural relics in the sea

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
They have already started

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Looking for the location of the ship

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Oh yeah

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Trust me

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's not gonna take long

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Before we locate the ship

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This time it's gonna be a jackpot

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I believe there will be good news soon

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Then we can make a big profit

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Very good

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Once the ship is confirmed

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We will immediately go to the prison

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Once we find the location

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Then we will do the salvage immediately

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Happy cooperation

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Mr. Han

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I helped you investigate the thing you asked for

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Atoka Company is run by a few foreigners

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And a Chinese partner

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Chinese

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Then do you know who this Chinese is

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Due to the reason for the company's registration

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And management system

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Can't find a specific name

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm so sorry

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't say that

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You have helped me a lot

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's it

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Any news

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I will call you later, okay

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay, bye

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Bye

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Mr. Han

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What do you think

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Tang Xin first came from China

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Chased my dad and my brother

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Came abroad

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Then I am interested in Atoka Company

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you think Tang Xin came to Luoman this time

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Will there be any findings

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The group reporter has been investigating for so long

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Someone gave him clues

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He will find out sooner or later

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But he chased here

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Want to get news from the chairman

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's hard

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Because he can't get close to the chairman at all

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I am now worried

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Tang Xin has been staring at my dad and my brother

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
One day

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Will be discovered by them

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So during this time

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Be sure to keep an eye on Tang reporter

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If you are really not careful

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Found by my dad and my brother

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hurry up and tell me

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
understood

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Sister Xin

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What do you think

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Meet these foreigners in Hanchangzhou

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Who are they

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It must be some people with business

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's a pity

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Didn't take a picture just now

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Have a chance

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They should still meet

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Go

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The shooting of the day is over

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The results are good

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Comrades

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We started from Wenzhou

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
All the way

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Day and night

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
After Xisha and Lansha

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Today

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We have officially come to our country

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Traditional Jiangyu County

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We are now

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We have officially come to our country

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Traditional Jiangyu County

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Passed by here

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Behind is the sea of ​​Jin

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
In front is Yuan Yang

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Passed by here

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Behind is the homeland of the motherland

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
In front is the peaceful battle

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We are the Chinese Navy's defense force

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We are about to cross the traditional Jiangyu County

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Start the expedition

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Here to the great motherland

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Sincere farewell

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
To the national land

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
To the national flag

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Sincere farewell

139
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
To the great motherland

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Sincere farewell

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's better to give up your life

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
For the people of our country

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Attention

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Ready to cross the traditional Jiangyu County

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Face the flag

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Salute

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The order of the country's mission

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The order of the country's mission

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The order of the country's mission

150
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The order of the country's mission

151
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The order of the country's mission

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Actually, I'm in a very confused state now

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I

154
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I hope Tang Xin can find out something

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I am very worried

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What did they really find out

158
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What do you think i should do

159
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I think

160
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No matter what reporter Tang can find out

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But this matter is basically here

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
For you

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The more you know, the worse you will be

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's go back

165
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
In case your family is uncomfortable in the middle

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Can't go

167
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
At least i have to know

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
My dad and my brother

169
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This time to Luonan

170
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What are you doing

171
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:43,300
Not that

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Hello, Mr. Yu.

173
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Hello.

174
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,040
Hai, I'm in the hotel room.

175
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
Come here.

176
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
Enjoy the meal.

177
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
What's wrong, Xin Qiao?

178
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
We can eat now.

179
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
You will drink

180
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,240
for our successful journey

181
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,080
to the Roman island.

182
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Yeah?

183
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Yeah.

184
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Cheers.

185
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,680
You take a look first.

186
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
Mr. Bai,

187
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,480
Han Changzhou often meets these foreigners

188
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
in Luoman.

189
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,880
Please hand over these photos

190
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
to the police.

191
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Yes.

192
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
Thank you.

193
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
I'm going to the police station

194
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,960
to see if I can find

195
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
any valuable clues.

196
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Okay, I got it.

197
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Dad.

198
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,200
The company called just now

199
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
the underwater archaeological team

200
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
established by the Cultural and Cultural Affairs Bureau

201
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,840
has already

202
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
dug the Danan Sea.

203
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,040
Although we gave up the speedboat,

204
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,720
they will definitely find out

205
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
that we were moved.

206
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,680
They will also report this situation

207
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,920
to the police.

208
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,560
They don't have any evidence.

209
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,680
What will the police do to us?

210
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,440
I remind you

211
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,760
to be as cautious as possible.

212
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
Yes.

213
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Dad.

214
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,760
Yu Hang also came to Luoman.

215
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
What?

216
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,400
He is the one who lives in our hotel.

217
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
Mr. Han,

218
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,240
according to my observation these days,

219
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,200
most of the directors

220
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,760
rarely go out of the room.

221
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,800
It's also difficult to find

222
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
the situation inside.

223
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
Where is Tang?

224
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,720
Tang often goes out.

225
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,240
He has met

226
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,080
the water bar outside the house

227
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,200
to drink coffee and read.

228
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
I know.

229
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
I know.

230
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,080
I really can't go out.

231
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,640
So I can only work hard

232
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
to keep an eye on you.

233
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
I understand.

234
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Mr. Yu Tian.

235
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
Brother.

236
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,840
Why are you in Luoman?

237
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
You didn't inform me.

238
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,640
You didn't

239
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,720
inform us either.

240
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
What?

241
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,280
If I don't knock on the door,

242
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,760
are you not going to

243
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
meet me and dad?

244
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
How can I?

245
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,120
Dr. Meng.

246
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,960
Tang's sand tea risk assessment.

247
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,240
What does it mean?

248
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,720
It means

249
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,800
the baby

250
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,600
has the risk of disease.

251
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,520
It may be caused by

252
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,320
genetic factors.

253
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,080
It may also be caused by

254
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,720
inflammation, drugs, infection

255
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,400
or radiation.

256
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,640
But the sand tea risk assessment

257
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,640
is not 100% accurate.

258
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,280
The health of the couple

259
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,640
may also cause

260
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,840
Tang's syndrome.

261
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,440
You can do a oxygen injection

262
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,960
or a free DNA

263
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,840
to further do a pre-release diagnosis.

264
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,480
To determine if the baby

265
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,760
has any infection or infection.

266
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,320
What if it's abnormal?

267
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,480
From a professional point of view,

268
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,000
if it's a pregnancy

269
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,800
of Tang's syndrome,

270
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,080
we suggest that

271
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,040
pregnant women like you

272
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,680
should stop the pregnancy as soon as possible.

273
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
Mom.

274
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,280
I suddenly remember

275
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,240
that a roommate in the medical school

276
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
was working here.

277
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,560
I want to talk to him.

278
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,080
Look.

279
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,960
Don't run around

280
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,160
if you're pregnant.

281
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,960
I'll go with you.

282
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,000
No need, mom.

283
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,960
Just go back.

284
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,320
I can talk to him alone.

285
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
I'll be back soon.

286
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,240
Call me when you're done.

287
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,760
Okay.

288
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,120
What a kid.

289
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,040
Take this.

290
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,360
I don't want it.

291
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,120
There's water there.

292
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,280
Just go.

293
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,200
Be careful.

294
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,200
What a kid.

295
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,320
Just go.

296
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,040
Okay, I'm leaving.

297
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,560
Hello.

298
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,200
I want to ask

299
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:54,920
where I can make an appointment for a

300
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Okay, wait a minute. I'll wipe it for you.

301
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,440
Dad.

302
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,680
I said I couldn't make an appointment for President Tang.

303
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,920
You two made the appointment

304
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,160
after a long time.

305
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,120
Do you like it?

306
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,760
Dad, come and live with us.

307
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,720
I don't.

308
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,320
Dad.

309
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,360
Come on, sit down.

310
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
How nice it is.

311
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,400
You brat.

312
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,480
Why are you here?

313
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,360
I'm here to talk about business.

314
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,040
Talk about business?

315
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,680
Why don't dad and I know

316
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,720
that you're going to start a business in Luo Man?

317
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,240
Isn't this the preparation for the early stage?

318
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,200
I'm also doing it.

319
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,080
Preparation.

320
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,840
You came with that female reporter, right?

321
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,320
You're amazing, brother.

322
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,640
You can't get over this.

323
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,640
Yes, I came with her.

324
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,520
But I'm mainly here to start a business.

325
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,840
I'll play with her for a few days.

326
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,440
Okay.

327
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,640
Dad, brother.

328
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
Why are you two here?

329
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,800
I'm also accompanying dad to talk about business.

330
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,600
Why don't I know that

331
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,040
our Changzhou Group has a business here?

332
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,520
What business?

333
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,640
Can you tell me?

334
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,880
Maybe I can help you come up with ideas.

335
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,840
Dad wants to set up a

336
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,040
remote sheep hunting mid-range station here.

337
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,200
What do you think?

338
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,560
Any good suggestions?

339
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,040
Tell us.

340
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,160
We can refer to it.

341
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,200
Yes.

342
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,960
In my opinion,

343
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,400
our Changzhou Group should

344
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,000
open a branch company here.

345
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,920
You two are usually busy in China.

346
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,840
I'm a big man.

347
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,720
I can live in Luoman for a long time, right?

348
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,760
I can help you two share the burden.

349
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,960
Don't waste your time.

350
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,840
You don't know this business.

351
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,720
If you don't know, I can learn.

352
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,920
I came here on a high-level.

353
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,000
It's not that easy, right, dad?

354
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,040
Okay, okay, okay.

355
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,680
How about this?

356
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,840
Your brother and I

357
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,200
may have to stay here for a while.

358
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,080
When you're almost done,

359
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,480
we'll go back early.

360
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,000
You see, the three of us have come abroad.

361
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,960
If something happens to the company,

362
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,080
someone has to be there.

363
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,960
Dad is right.

364
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,400
I'm almost done.

365
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,520
I'll go back first.

366
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,120
Okay.

367
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,120
Okay, I won't waste your time

368
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,560
talking about business.

369
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,480
I'll go first.

370
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,200
Okay.

371
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,520
It's still the same.

372
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,480
Be careful.

373
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,840
Mr. Han,

374
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,440
are you unhappy with the chairman?

375
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,360
My dad and my brother

376
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,280
are chasing Tang Xin to Luoman.

377
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,440
If you're worried,

378
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,840
I'll go remind him.

379
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,640
Xiang Bo.

380
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,840
Let me think about you first.

381
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,800
I'll go first.

382
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,560
Okay.

383
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,320
Okay.

384
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,120
Go now.

385
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,960
Okay.

386
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,120
Beyond restбOO code

387
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,240
From first day

388
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,040
We didn't know

389
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,000
how

390
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,420
to marry

391
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,960
Before she wore

392
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,680
Number wasn't 0

393
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,420
Then it is 0

394
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:17,700
But for the whole

395
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,040
Today

396
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,160
If you are all

397
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,280
Happy

398
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
October 1, 2019

399
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,720
is the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China

400
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,920
This year is also the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Navy

401
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
At this moment

402
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,760
We are carrying out escort missions in the ocean

403
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,800
Use actual actions to maintain national dignity

404
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,040
and people's safety

405
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,920
This is the best blessing we can give to our motherland

406
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,680
It is also the best way for us as soldiers to celebrate

407
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,040
it is good

408
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:49,920
it is good

409
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,960
Later we will eat some dumplings

410
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,880
K等我们等会我们就會吃点饺子

411
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,800
and watch the monthly dropout ceremony at Tianmen Square

412
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:55,880
and watch the Military rating ceremony at Tianmen Square

413
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:03,840
good

414
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,040
it is your fortune today

415
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:16,640
Our place

416
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,200
Happyčion

417
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,640
Today is your birthday, my China.

418
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,000
On this unusual day,

419
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,680
I believe every Chinese child will say from the bottom of their heart,

420
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,000
I love you, China.

421
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,600
70 years have passed.

422
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:49,000
The red belt on Tiananmen Square is connected to history and reality.

423
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Congratulations, China.

424
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:06,280
Dad, what do you think of what Yu Hong said?

425
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,080
She said she was here to chase after this girl.

426
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,840
But what is this girl doing here?

427
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,240
I feel that this female reporter

428
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,640
must know a lot about us.

429
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
We should think of a way.

430
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,240
Yes.

431
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,440
How did she know we were here in Lu Man?

432
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,040
Since she knows this,

433
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,240
let's just sit here and wait.

434
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,040
No.

435
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,640
We came here for a reason.

436
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,840
If she really came to investigate us,

437
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,840
then there must be someone around her.

438
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,640
If something happens to her here,

439
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,440
then we will have the biggest suspicion.

440
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,040
How about this?

441
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,640
Let's think of another way.

442
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,840
Let's control her first.

443
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,440
Let's go.

444
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,040
Hello.

445
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,440
Hello.

446
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,640
Coffee again?

447
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,640
Do you want to try our new cocktail?

448
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,240
New cocktail?

449
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,440
Okay.

450
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,240
Please check the menu.

451
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,640
Okay, this one.

452
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,040
Wait a moment please.

453
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,440
Hello.

454
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,440
Little Princess Yang Yang, do you miss me?

455
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,640
When will you come back?

456
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,440
It's good that their escort should be back.

457
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,640
What if Captain Wu can't find you?

458
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,840
He doesn't miss me.

459
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,440
Tang Xin,

460
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,840
do you know what kind of tone you are when you mention Captain Wu?

461
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,040
Aiyuan.

462
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,640
That kind of love failure.

463
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,640
That kind of love failure.

464
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,040
Okay, Zong Qing told me.

465
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,640
He said they were all good.

466
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,640
Zong Qing called you?

467
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,640
When? Where?

468
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,040
Just at the beach.

469
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,840
He hung up without saying anything.

470
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,240
Captain Wu didn't call you?

471
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,440
No, none of them.

472
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,640
I think I'm his

473
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,040
very, very good friend.

474
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,240
Maybe Captain Wu gave up his name.

475
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
It's Zong Qing.

476
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,640
Look, this is my special case.

477
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,840
Speaking of this,

478
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,640
Lan Yang Yang, why do I think you've lost weight?

479
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
What's wrong with you?

480
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,440
Have you been eating well recently?

481
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,240
Wang Yi's cooking is so delicious.

482
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,840
It doesn't make you fat.

483
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,240
Don't mention my mom.

484
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,440
But I'm not anxious yet.

485
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,640
My mom is anxious now.

486
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,840
I want to move back to my house tomorrow.

487
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,240
No, don't think about it.

488
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,640
I don't agree.

489
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,840
Don't worry.

490
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,240
Even if I move back,

491
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,240
my mom can't let me go.

492
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,640
I'll be home on time for three meals a day.

493
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,840
I just want to go home and rest.

494
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,440
What's wrong with you? Are you okay?

495
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,240
Where's Yun Jian?

496
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,440
Did Yun Jian go to work?

497
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,440
Yes, he did.

498
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,640
It went well.

499
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,240
Really?

500
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,840
Yes.

501
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,640
Don't worry. I can take care of myself.

502
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,840
I'm not talking to you. I'm going to sleep.

503
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,840
Okay, then wait for me to go back.

504
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,640
Bye.

505
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
Bye.

506
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,040
Bye.

507
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Bye.

508
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Bye.

509
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Bye.

510
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
Bye.

511
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
Bye.

512
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,840
Don't move.

513
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,040
It hurts. Hang in there.

514
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,440
The car will be here soon.

515
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,840
Go to the hospital for a video.

516
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
It's okay.

517
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,240
Come on, stand here.

518
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
The cake is here.

519
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
Be careful.

520
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,440
This cake is really good.

521
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,040
Dad has been making it all afternoon.

522
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,240
It's good.

523
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,840
The cake is good.

524
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,640
Sir.

525
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,640
Are you ready?

526
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,640
Well...

527
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,440
Tell us a few words today.

528
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,240
We'll talk about it later.

529
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,840
Say a few words.

530
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Okay.

531
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
Don't get up.

532
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Well...

533
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,440
The task of this caretaker is quite difficult.

534
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,240
The birthday party of the group has not been completed.

535
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,040
Today it's finally done.

536
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,440
The conditions on the ship are limited.

537
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,640
I discussed with the captain.

538
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,640
I'll give you a birthday gift later.

539
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,840
As long as it's a birthday,

540
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,040
you don't have to line up today.

541
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,240
Go to the main shipyard

542
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,840
and call your family.

543
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,240
Tell your family that

544
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,640
the army remembers their birthday.

545
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,840
The navy and warships are celebrating their birthday.

546
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
Yes, captain.

547
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,840
Good.

548
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,040
Get ready.

549
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,040
Good.

550
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
Sit down.

551
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,240
Is it Yinan?

552
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,040
He's been to our house for a vacation.

553
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
He's been transferred to the officer, right?

554
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
Yes.

555
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,240
After he's transferred,

556
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,440
ask him to have a bowl of longevity noodles.

557
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,240
In the future,

558
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,640
ask him to celebrate the birthday of the group.

559
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,640
Yes.

560
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
Captain.

561
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,840
Why don't you go to the restaurant?

562
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,640
Report.

563
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
I'll go after I finish writing the diary.

564
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
Congratulations.

565
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
What did you congratulate me for?

566
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Congratulations on being transferred to the officer.

567
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
Thank you, captain.

568
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Hello.

569
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,840
Hello.

570
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
What do you want to drink?

571
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,240
Can you put on a sunset?

572
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,240
Okay.

573
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,440
Please.

574
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,440
Thank you.

575
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,440
Thank you.

576
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
Here.

577
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,440
Drink some hot water.

578
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,440
Thank you.

579
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,440
What did the doctor say?

580
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,440
It's pretty good.

581
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,440
Thank you, doctor.

582
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
Thank you.

583
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
Look.

584
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,440
The clothes I chose for you.

585
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,440
The color is nice.

586
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,440
It's really nice.

587
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,520
I won't leave you one day no matter what

588
00:32:39,540 --> 00:33:00,680
We can Sanshui

589
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,360
Don't worry about us

590
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,960
We exercise on the sea every day

591
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,080
Especially good

592
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,480
And get energy from the wind and rain class all the time

593
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,120
Come on, Lao Dai

594
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,920
Let me drink one

595
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,960
Wish you a big win

596
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,720
This family is good

597
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,280
Beautiful

598
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,240
New camp

599
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,920
You two, you two, stop talking

600
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,520
I won't say it, let him say

601
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,120
Watch

602
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,760
Dad and mom

603
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,440
Except for the late-night snack, everything else is good

604
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,320
You can rest assured

605
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,280
And self-knowledge

606
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:24,840
Go go go

607
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,480
Go go go

608
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,520
Go go go

609
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,320
Go go go

610
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,280
Don't think about it

611
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,480
I really don't

612
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,080
Say a few words

613
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,040
Come on

614
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,800
Come on, don't make me angry

615
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,760
Say a few words

616
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,640
Say a few words

617
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,520
Come on, wear a belt

618
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,560
Say a few words to sister Xin

619
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,160
Prove that you are thinking in a place where no one is

620
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,440
How romantic

621
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,480
I have a cell phone

622
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,320
Why do I use DV

623
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,320
High-definition, big brother

624
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:47,960
Yes

625
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,160
Besides

626
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,800
What do I say

627
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,480
Why should I let you two go

628
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,120
Boring

629
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,920
Go

630
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,320
You two, this one

631
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,040
Come with me

632
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,480
Li Ge

633
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,800
Take this day

634
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,560
Say a few words to your family

635
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,880
Family

636
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,120
Open the door

637
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,040
Chief Wu, what are you doing

638
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,400
I'll take you home for dinner.

639
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,600
If you can't fix it,

640
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,920
you can tell him yourself.

641
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,480
I was in a meeting just now.

642
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,680
I didn't get your call.

643
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,560
Are you unable to call again?

644
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,280
What's the matter?

645
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,680
Why are you suddenly asking me

646
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,960
if I've eaten?

647
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,800
You can't send me food.

648
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,280
You're learning

649
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,600
some fake tricks online again, right?

650
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,360
Stop learning these nonsense.

651
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,200
You know what I want to hear.

652
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
Where have you been again?

653
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,440
I haven't heard from you for days.

654
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,360
Did you go to the meeting again?

655
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,560
Before you leave,

656
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,080
tell me.

657
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,560
Wu Si,

658
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,360
when will you come back?

659
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,880
Tang Xin,

660
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,680
I love you.

661
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,640
Sorry, the number you dialed is not available.

662
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,120
Please redial later.

663
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,000
Sorry.

664
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,600
Please...

665
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,480
I just got an expert report today.

666
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,560
This porcelain is from

667
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,720
Song Dynasty's official warehouse.

668
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,480
The relic price is really high.

669
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,960
Experts have confirmed

670
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
that this porcelain

671
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,400
is a coffin from the Song Dynasty.

672
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,680
It's very expensive.

673
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,480
I'm sorry.

674
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,480
I'm sorry.

675
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
I'm sorry.

676
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,480
I'm sorry.

677
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,480
I'm sorry.

678
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
I'm sorry.

679
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
I'm sorry.

680
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,560
Did you find it

681
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,960
near the sea

682
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,040
where we were looking for the ship?

683
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,080
Is this found near the sea area

684
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,080
of the sinking ship?

685
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Yes.

686
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,680
I suppose it was thrown out of the ship

687
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,680
when it was sinking.

688
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,000
I guess the ship is full of stuff like this.

689
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,560
He speculates that this porcelain

690
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,480
was scattered on the ship.

691
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,080
There must be a lot of similar things on the ship.

692
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,560
After hearing you say that,

693
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,840
I'm very excited.

694
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,960
I'm looking forward to

695
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,600
our scout team

696
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,800
bringing me good news as soon as possible.

697
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,520
We can't wait.

698
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,760
I'm expecting the good news

699
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,240
from the investigation team.

700
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,720
Oh, yeah.

701
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,720
There will be.

702
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
Chairman.

703
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,640
May I have a word with you?

704
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,640
Just say it here.

705
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,680
We've already controlled him.

706
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
Where is he now?

707
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
We found a place temporarily.

708
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,920
Everything is clean, right?

709
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,560
Don't worry. No problem.

710
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,040
But the medicine is a little heavy.

711
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,040
We need to sleep for a while.

712
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,680
We must keep an eye on him.

713
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,200
There can't be any accident.

714
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
I understand.

715
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,200
My friend.

716
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Are you having troubles?

717
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,080
Did we encounter any trouble?

718
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,560
We were

719
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
targeted.

720
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,200
And we were targeted from China to here.

721
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,360
We are being watched

722
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,360
from China all the way here.

723
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,680
How is it possible?

724
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
William.

725
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,520
Don't worry.

726
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,000
We've already controlled this man.

727
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,680
But there's something

728
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,280
that may trouble you.

729
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,920
I don't want this man

730
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,560
to return to China.

731
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,920
Thank you.

732
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,920
Thank you.

733
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
Cheers.

734
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,640
Ms. Tao.

735
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
I'm sorry.

736
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,240
You're home.

737
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,240
I was so worried.

738
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240
I really...

739
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,240
I really...

740
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,240
I really...

741
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,240
I really...

742
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,240
I really...

743
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
I really...

744
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,240
I really...

745
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,240
I really...

746
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,240
I really...

747
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,640
Da Xie. Da Xie.

748
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,240
Mr. Han.

749
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,640
Mr. Han.

750
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Where is this?

751
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
Mr. Han.

752
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,800
You must have been

753
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,080
driving to the sea on a freight train.

754
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,080
A freight train?

755
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,760
Why...

756
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,920
Why would I be on a freight train?

757
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,320
You were drugged in Luoman.

758
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,440
You were kidnapped by a criminal.

759
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,920
You were kidnapped here.

760
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,920
Why did you

761
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,920
come here?

762
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
I wanted to save you.

763
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,920
But I couldn't.

764
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,920
So they tied me up

765
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,440
and brought me here.

766
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,920
Was that the criminal?

767
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
No.

768
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,440
The most dangerous criminal.

769
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,440
He was kidnapped by a criminal.

770
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,440
He was kidnapped by a criminal.

771
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,440
He was kidnapped by a criminal.

772
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,440
He was kidnapped by a criminal.

773
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,440
The most dangerous criminal

774
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
was the criminal, Ma Zai.

775
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
He was responsible for our lives.

776
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,440
Mr. Han.

777
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,960
I know you came to Luoman with me.

778
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,960
What do you want?

779
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,960

I want to see you.

806
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,960
Can you not show romance?

807
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,960
Don't forget the plainness of the night.

808
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:47,960
I see more expectations in your heart.

809
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,960
I really don't understand.

810
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,960
You say love is too vague.

811
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,960
But you give me the answer with your eyes.

812
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,960
I can meet you with all my heart.

813
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:15,960
Thank you for waking up the courage that was once weak.

814
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,960
Let all coincidences become wishes.

815
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,960
Let all the simple things become partners.

816
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,960
Open the light of the years after the past.

817
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,960
People can't separate us.

818
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,960
You are waiting for the warm heart.

819
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:41,960
I will be the one who breaks the silence in memory.

820
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,960
You will be alone in the vast world.

821
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,960
I will be the one who misses you.

822
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,960
I don't want to be hurt.

823
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,960
Let all coincidences become wishes.

824
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,960
Let all the simple things become partners.

825
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,960
Thank you for being by my side.

826
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,960
Let all the simple things become partners.

827
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,960
The bigger the world, the more lonely it is.

828
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,960
Only standing by your side,

829
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:22,960
I feel the warmth in my heart.
