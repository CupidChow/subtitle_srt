1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,200
The end is a never-changing me

2
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

3
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

4
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

5
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

6
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

7
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

8
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

9
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

10
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

11
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

12
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

13
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

14
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

15
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

16
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

18
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

19
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

20
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

21
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

22
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

23
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

24
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

25
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,580
A helplessly stubborn and fearless

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,060
宝贝

27
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,220
Tang Xin

28
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,760
what do you need me to do?

29
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,800
I don't need you to do anything for me

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,880
I just hope

31
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,000
you can choose

32
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,780
what you want to do

33
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,560
Can prevent

34
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,320
I'm not here.

35
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,680
You really want to be my wife?

36
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,600
First line.

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,920
But do you know

38
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,360
what it's like to marry a soldier

39
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,480
who is in the first line?

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,080
I can't know.

41
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
I'll know when I get married.

42
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
But I know at least

43
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,280
that one day,

44
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,480
your choice

45
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,880
will make both of us happy.

46
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,800
We've been together until now.

47
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,320
I haven't made any requests to you.

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,040
I just want a fair marriage.

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,840
And equality is not a trap.

50
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,080
We all love each other.

51
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,680
But we have our own meaning.

52
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,120
But if I insist on making the choice now,

53
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,600
will you marry me?

54
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,360
I'm willing to marry you.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,640
I won't die like this.

56
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,960
Wrap it for you.

57
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,640
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,640
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,640
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,640
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,640
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,640
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,640
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
I'm sorry.

100
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
I'm sorry.

101
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
I'm sorry.

102
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
I'm sorry.

103
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
I'm sorry.

104
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640

109
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
I'm sorry.

110
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
I'm sorry.

111
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
I'm sorry.

112
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,640
I'm sorry.

113
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,640
I'm sorry.

114
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
I'm sorry.

115
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
I'm sorry.

116
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
I'm sorry.

117
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
I'm sorry.

118
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
I'm sorry.

119
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
I'm sorry.

120
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
I'm sorry.

121
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,640
I am sorry.

122
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,640
I'm so sorry.

123
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
I am Jun Shu when I was little.

124
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,640
So I can see the feelings of soldiers and soldiers.

125
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
Wu Si.

126
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,640
I don't need you to do for me anything.

127
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,560
I just hope

128
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,320
you can make the choice you want

129
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,520
and stay in the place you really want.

130
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,640
Thank you for waking up

131
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,000
the courage that used to be me

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,480
Let all coincidences become a wish

133
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,160
Let all simple things become a business

134
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,880
Let the warmth of the years come out

135
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,960
The festival is coming

136
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,920
We remind the general public

137
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,600
to be alert to the safety of

138
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,560
fireworks and other safety issues

139
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,680
and personal property safety

140
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,920
If you receive an unknown call or receive

141
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,840
Which group took this

142
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,800
Xiao Jia's group

143
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
How many days to broadcast

144
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,680
Two days

145
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,280
Let them reshoot

146
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,560
Don't go

147
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,680
Or I will help them re-edit

148
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,720
No, reshoot

149
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,200
Hello, Mr. Tian

150
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,200
Tang Xin, come to my office

151
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,480
Old Tian called me

152
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,360
I'll go over first

153
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,600
I'll talk to them when I find you

154
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,720
Mr. Tian

155
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,800
Sit down

156
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,840
There is such a thing

157
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,040
My national public security department

158
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,120
and the international new organization

159
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,880
close cooperation

160
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,400
From a wanted

161
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,720
cultural and military smuggler

162
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,840
I got a big idea

163
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,920
What clue

164
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,480
The content of the clue has not been disclosed yet

165
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,320
But the last meeting

166
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,600
Notified several official media

167
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,200
Let them prepare for the relevant reports

168
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,120
Did you notify us to report

169
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,640
No

170
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,280
Then why did you call me

171
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,000
I think this case

172
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,200
With the previous investigation

173
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:29,900
That

174
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,720
Old Tian

175
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,320
We have known each other for so many years

176
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:57,640
You are using the

177
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,360
My old friend

178
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,760
How are you

179
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,320
How are you

180
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,480
We meet again

181
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,880
Long time no see

182
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,400
Thank you

183
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,840
Let me show you around

184
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,960
We can talk on our way to the base

185
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,840
He said we go to the base first

186
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,600
Talk as we go

187
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,960
Let's go

188
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,800
There are also islands here

189
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,440
Yes, we have several of them

190
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,200
Around the island

191
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,760
Yes

192
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,000
There are many islands nearby

193
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,240
Are they all soldiers

194
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,280
Are they soldiers, Mr. William

195
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,640
Not only soldiers

196
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,840
All of them have special forces background

197
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,640
All of them are from the special forces

198
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,080
Cool

199
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,200
Mom

200
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,960
Mom

201
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,320
Don't worry

202
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,600
This is my own business with Tang Xin

203
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,800
We can solve it

204
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,200
I'll take you out for dinner first

205
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,440
You take a taxi

206
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
I also know this software

207
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,720
You go to the bathroom

208
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,400
See if there is anything we left behind

209
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,200
it is good

210
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,080
Xiaosi

211
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,400
mom

212
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,880
The things are almost ready

213
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,520
Nothing left

214
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,280
it is good

215
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,720
I suddenly thought

216
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,440
I have a friend who hasn't seen it yet

217
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,680
Then we can't eat together

218
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,760
See you at the airport

219
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,320
Ok

220
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,280
I'm leaving first

221
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,920
mom

222
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,040
Follow me

223
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,360
Be careful

224
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,880
This place is very secluded

225
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,520
It's very hard to notice

226
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,280
This is our residence

227
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,600
Are these two caves our residence

228
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,000
Yes, exactly

229
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,560
Boys

230
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,200
Come in

231
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,000
Satisfied

232
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,200
There is such a big cave on this island

233
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,840
I didn't expect it

234
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,200
I didn't expect the house

235
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,600
Such natural caves here

236
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,600
Oh yeah

237
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,480
I'll check this out

238
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,400
Ok

239
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,440
Come back

240
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,640
This time all stolen

241
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Is it like this

242
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,320
Is this what we pulled out from the scene

243
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,120
Come

244
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He's here.

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What brings you here?

246
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Just a second.

247
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Hey, Alex.

248
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes, boss?

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Where's Johnson?

250
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He took some guys out for training.

251
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay.

252
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Good?

253
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Sorry to bother you.

254
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Where's the Tang family?

255
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Tang family?

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Tang family is here.

257
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Tang.

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Someone's looking for you.

259
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That one.

260
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay, thank you.

261
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Thank you.

262
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay.

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Hello.

264
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You must be Tang Xin's father.

265
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes.

266
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm Wu Si's mother.

267
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Hello.

268
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Hello.

269
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Sorry to bother you.

270
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Have a seat.

271
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Okay.

272
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
This way.

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Captain.

274
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What are you doing?

275
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Have you heard from the patients?

276
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
No, Captain.

277
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I was about to tell them.

278
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I was too excited last time.

279
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's okay.

280
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You didn't say anything wrong.

281
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That's right.

282
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We've been friends for years.

283
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm a good friend.

284
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Sometimes,

285
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
a good friend is a bitter mouth.

286
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Some words are not good to hear.

287
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Why don't you take a look?

288
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's the next batch

289
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
waiting for the departure of the escort ship.

290
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Same formation configuration.

291
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Same escort mission.

292
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Same sea route.

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Same navy uniform.

294
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
One ship after another.

295
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
One army after another.

296
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This is the reason why

297
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
we are so famous

298
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
in the deep blue.

299
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Look at the opposite side.

300
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The opposite side is the city.

301
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Our parents, family, wife and children

302
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
are all there.

303
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The other side is the light of the world.

304
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The other side is the wind and the dew.

305
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You all love to play,

306
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
love to make trouble,

307
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and love to see the world.

308
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
When you become an army,

309
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
the outside world

310
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
will be none of your business.

311
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Do you feel wronged?

312
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Sir,

313
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I don't feel wronged.

314
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Because we are here,

315
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
the other side is the light of the world.

316
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But the world

317
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
may not know that we are here.

318
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Do you feel wronged?

319
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No.

320
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
We know it.

321
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
We know that we are here.

322
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And I know that

323
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I will always be here.

324
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
They are my friends.

325
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
They are my friends.

326
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Mr. Tang,

327
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
do you remember

328
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I went to the dock

329
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
to meet

330
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Wu Si's father

331
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
in 1999?

332
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The day I went to see him,

333
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I didn't expect that

334
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
he followed me secretly.

335
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,920
and I was so excited.

336
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,800
When I got home,

337
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,160
I had a fever.

338
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,840
I kept crying in my dream.

339
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,680
It was so sudden.

340
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,160
I was still a child.

341
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,400
So Wu Si

342
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,280
kept transferring to this job.

343
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,040
In the past few years,

344
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,000
I've been hoping

345
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,840
that someone would be there for Wu Si.

346
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,760
I didn't expect

347
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,720
that your daughter

348
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,120
was your girlfriend.

349
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
So a few days ago,

350
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,560
I went to see Tang Xin.

351
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,440
The child is so nice.

352
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,480
She's so nice.

353
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
She never mentioned

354
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,960
anything bad about Wu Si.

355
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,560
I'm really grateful to Tang Xin

356
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,480
for being so tolerant of Wu Si.

357
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,600
Well,

358
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
I'm a soldier too.

359
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,240
I know

360
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,680
what Wu Si thinks.

361
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,640
I also know

362
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,480
what my daughter thinks.

363
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,680
In fact, it's very simple.

364
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,400
They both have their own persistence.

365
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,120
But the starting point

366
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,840
is to do good for each other.

367
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,800
Yes.

368
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,760
It's just a big step.

369
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,160
Yes.

370
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,880
Then they're both bad.

371
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Just follow it.

372
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,720
You can come back.

373
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,160
Yes.

374
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,400
You said you can't

375
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,360
go around the corner.

376
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,480
I'm relieved

377
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
that you said so.

378
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,600
Mr. Tang,

379
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,560
I'm far away.

380
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,880
I'll leave Wu Si

381
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,960
to you.

382
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,960
I've already

383
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,240
treated her as my own child.

384
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,800
Thank you.

385
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,240
You're doing well in the training.

386
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,600
I heard you got a lot of first place.

387
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,160
What are you laughing at?

388
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,760
Do you know

389
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
why I brought you back?

390
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,240
No, I don't.

391
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,520
Wang Chen was transferred

392
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,040
to the base instructor team.

393
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,520
Cheng Yuan also retired.

394
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,160
Zong Qing was busy leading the team.

395
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,560
When Wang Chen left,

396
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,000
you were the closest person

397
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,680
to Wu Si.

398
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,480
Bringing you back

399
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
is to let you guard the door

400
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,280
for her.

401
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,800
Mr. Tang,

402
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,360
where is the captain going?

403
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,760
The captain has other things

404
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
to consider.

405
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,400
Why is Captain Chen leaving?

406
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,280
I think his injury

407
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,120
has recovered well.

408
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,480
The transfer is decided

409
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,280
by the organization.

410
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,480
Do you need your approval?

411
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,960
No, sir.

412
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
Your teammates

413
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,720
have been with you for almost a year.

414
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,400
You should learn to leave on your own.

415
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,000
Mr. Tang,

416
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,320
I'm afraid I can't do it well.

417
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,200
Look at me.

418
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,040
How old are you?

419
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,600
Sir, I'm 20.

420
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,640
Your captain is 20 years old.

421
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,280
He is a cadet.

422
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,560
Zong Qing is 20 years old.

423
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,120
He represented the National Defense University

424
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,920
in the national competition.

425
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,480
Cheng Yuan is 20 years old.

426
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,880
He was selected to the international sniper competition.

427
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,160
He was the first one to win the Taihe Sword.

428
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,880
When I first joined the team,

429
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,440
I wasn't much older than you.

430
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,080
You were the youngest in the team.

431
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,440
They protected you like they protected their younger brother.

432
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,800
They can't protect you forever.

433
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,520
Soldiers obey orders.

434
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,160
From now on,

435
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,760
you are the sniper who is on the front line.

436
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,000
Do you understand?

437
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,120
Yes, sir!

438
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,520
These two tents,

439
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,040
I prepared them

440
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,440
especially for you.

441
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,880
These two tents

442
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,480
are specially prepared for your father.

443
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,200
I want to apologize for the conditions,

444
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,200
but this is the best we can do on this island.

445
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,400
We can only work together on this island.

446
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,800
William is so thoughtful.

447
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:44,920
Thank you.

448
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,760
My friend.

449
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,600
Always.

450
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,200
William.

451
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,160
Hey, Johnson.

452
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:51,960
Come here.

453
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,600
I thought you were training.

454
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,000
As they say, there is

455
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,480
an honored guest who comes to visit our island.

456
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
Let me introduce you.

457
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,440
This is Mr. Han Changzhou.

458
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,760
He is your real boss.

459
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,840
Please to meet you, sir.

460
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,160
How are you?

461
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,880
My name is Johnson.

462
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,400
I am a security officer here

463
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,640
waiting for your instruction.

464
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,040
This is the security officer of the island, John Han.

465
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,480
Very good.

466
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,480
I saw it on the way.

467
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,800
Your security is very good.

468
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,600
Very in place.

469
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,480
I've seen it along the way.

470
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,400
And well done for your security work.

471
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,920
Appreciate it.

472
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,800
Just such a deserted island.

473
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,080
Do you need so many people?

474
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,480
Mr. Johnson.

475
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,800
I think you have done too much

476
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,400
on such a deserted island.

477
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,960
I get paid for this.

478
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,840
I do my best.

479
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,920
They are sent to the island's house.

480
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,000
Must be treated seriously.

481
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,000
Good.

482
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,840
Okay.

483
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,440
Dad.

484
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,760
You're back.

485
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,400
It's so late.

486
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,320
Why are you here

487
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,600
at this time?

488
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,560
I met Mrs. Wu today.

489
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,320
What did you talk about?

490
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,680
You're old.

491
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,760
What can we talk about?

492
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,080
About the child.

493
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,040
About the past.

494
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,080
About

495
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,680
the 9th and 9th així-ver.

496
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,440
In fact, the two of us

497
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,920
saw her once.

498
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,720
It was Wu Si's dad.

499
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,920
Hey.

500
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,960
It's not easy for a woman.

501
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,260
I wanted to let your mother

502
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,960
to persuade Wu Si's mom.

503
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,960
Who has scared enough with their performance?

504
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,080
You don't even congratulated your daughter.

505
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,320
So...

506
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,640
Was your daughter...

507
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,360
Yes.

508
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,760
They are finally alone.

509
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,280
They didn't bring them.

510
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,920
Okay.

511
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,360
They won't get much credit.

512
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,800
Who are you?

513
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,120
Papas shouldn't look at her.

514
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:55,920
Dad,

515
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,120
It's fate.

516
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,320
Is there nothing to ask me?

517
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,200
I'm sorry.

518
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,160
Peter.

519
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,480
Have you ever thought

520
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
about what Cheng's family

521
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,000
will be like in the future?

522
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,160
Cheng Pai asked me the same question.

523
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,880
He asked me

524
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,440
if I would leave the army

525
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,240
and think about marriage.

526
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,600
Why did you say that?

527
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,240
I said

528
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,280
I should live in the army

529
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,360
till I can't

530
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:12,700
run,

531
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,720
can't jump,

532
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,440
can't jump,

533
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,280
and can't jump

534
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,360
to consider getting married.

535
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,400
I'm back.

536
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,960
Clever.

537
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,320
Captain.

538
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,680
Are you leaving Manchuria?

539
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,080
I know you wouldn't tell me.

540
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,400
Stupid Captain Chen will keep you.

541
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,640
He'll take me even when he's back.

542
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,480
I don't want to leave.

543
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,440
I don't want to let Captain Chen leave.

544
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,880
I don't want you to leave either.

545
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,800
But I know

546
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,400
you're right.

547
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,440
I was right.

548
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,560
Captain.

549
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,520
I'm sorry.

550
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,640
I'm sorry.

551
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,840
If you leave Lanren,

552
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,000
Lanren will miss

553
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,320
a very good captain.

554
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,160
But there will be

555
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,840
a good husband

556
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,360
and a good father.

557
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,280
Don't worry about me.

558
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,920
I promised Captain Chen

559
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,600
that

560
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,680
I would be the best gun

561
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,760
and I wouldn't go anywhere

562
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,760
before I do.

563
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,120
Captain.

564
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,840
Finally done.

565
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,440
You've finally let go of

566
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,480
your burden.

567
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,960
I know you're doing this for me.

568
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,360
What's your next plan?

569
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,000
I want to apply for a new team.

570
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,400
What about after you join the team?

571
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,480
I'm really angry

572
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,440
at you.

573
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,280
Captain.

574
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
If you...

575
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,000
What would you choose?

576
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,320
Stay or leave?

577
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:52,960
Right?

578
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,480
I've been

579
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,560
holding back on this for a long time.

580
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,920
I told you

581
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,160
that soldiers should

582
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,400
obey the needs of the army.

583
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,800
So,

584
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,160
I've never applied for you.

585
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,320
I understand.

586
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,400
Mr. Chen,

587
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,000
when did you come to me in person?

588
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,360
After my hard work,

589
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,880
the superiors have considered

590
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,440
your contribution to this case.

591
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,200
They're willing to fulfill your wish

592
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,840
and let you witness

593
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,800
the end of this case.

594
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,960
Did I hear it right, Mr. Tian?

595
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,320
Thank you, Mr. Tian.

596
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,720
I haven't finished yet.

597
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,080
Tomorrow,

598
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,760
you must gather at the place

599
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,720
as scheduled.

600
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,280
I understand.

601
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,440
Get ready to go home.

602
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:36,920
Okay.

603
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,920
Why don't you eat?

604
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,400
You miss noodles?

605
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,960
You have no appetite.

606
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,440
I'm a living hotel.

607
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,400
I can't forget to say that I have no appetite.

608
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,080
In the past,

609
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,080
everyone was eating in a hurry.

610
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,200
You were eating and I was eating.

611
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,560
Now,

612
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,120
it's not good.

613
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,480
Okay.

614
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,120
I'll force you.

615
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,760
I'll take you.

616
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,560
Okay?

617
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,640
Come on.

618
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,560
I'll have two.

619
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,360
Eat like this?

620
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,080
Come on.

621
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,840
He doesn't eat.

622
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Come on.

623
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,600
Don't add all of them.

624
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,040
It's hard to tell.

625
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,880
If you add all of them,

626
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,760
what will he eat?

627
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,560
Will he eat air?

628
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,960
It's for his health.

629
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,480
Come on.

630
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,040
Eat meat.

631
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,920
Come on.

632
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,400
Have a bite.

633
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,640
Okay?

634
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,880
Eat.

635
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,640
You didn't bring any wine

636
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,000
when you came here.

637
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,000
I'll bring it next time.

638
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,480
It's boring.

639
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,760
Boss.

640
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,880
We found another ship.

641
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,440
It was a merchant ship

642
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,800
in the Southern Song Dynasty.

643
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,880
But

644
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,960
most of the ships

645
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,080
are now

646
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,200
in a mess.

647
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,840
It needs to be cleaned up

648
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
before we can take it.

649
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,040
What do you think

650
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,800
it was?

651
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
We've measured it.

652
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,360
It's 24.2 meters long

653
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,760
and 9.15 meters wide.

654
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,440
It's the same size

655
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,040
as the floating ships

656
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,920
in the Southern Song Dynasty.

657
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,840
What's its location?

658
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,160
It's in the China Sea.

659
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,680
But because

660
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,520
the ship was in the Great Yang River,

661
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,760
the sea level was increased.

662
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,920
So

663
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,080
I'm here to ask you

664
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,400
if we should start digging now.

665
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,200
That's what we do for a living.

666
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,600
That's what we do.

667
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,760
It's such a big boat.

668
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,960
There must be tons of good stuff inside.

669
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,400
Of course, we need to dig it out

670
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,640
as soon as possible.

671
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,160
There must be a lot of good stuff

672
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,800
in such a big ship.

673
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,360
We have to dig it out as soon as possible.

674
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,800
Well,

675
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,160
we'll do it normally

676
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,160
after we clean up

677
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
the sand on the ship.

678
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,480
Okay.

679
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,200
I'll arrange it as soon as possible.

680
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Remember one thing.

681
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,720
Every time you get a batch of goods,

682
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,280
you have to send it here immediately.

683
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,920
Okay.

684
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,840
Yes.

685
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
Captain Liu.

686
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,960
Take two international patrols

687
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,120
to the camp to rest.

688
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,920
Roger that.

689
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,240
Dispatch please.

690
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,240
Director.

691
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
I'm sorry.

692
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,240
I'm sorry.

693
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,240
I'm sorry.

694
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,240
I'm sorry.

695
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
I'm sorry.

696
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,320
The situation on the island is very complicated.

697
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,160
It's already far beyond our expectations.

698
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,720
The current population is not enough.

699
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,200
Han Changzhou and Wei Lian

700
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,600
seem to have made a big mistake.

701
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,960
They invited Gu Yongbin to stay on the island.

702
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,920
According to your analysis,

703
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,120
how many people did Gu Yongbin give?

704
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,920
According to the picture sent back from the drone,

705
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,880
there are still somechampions on the island

706
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,320
and some activities of Gu Yongbin

707
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,880
in the rain forest.

708
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,320
And there are two cave-like caves.

709
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,640
It should be a lot of people.

710
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,240
Director Qu.

711
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,320
We are not good at

712
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,440
sea warfare and island reconnaissance.

713
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,320
Can you ask the superior

714
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,800
to coordinate with the military?

715
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,680
Please ask the military to help us.

716
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,960
I'll ask the superior right away.

717
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,880
We have received a joint battle command

718
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,360
from the public security.

719
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,520
Our team is carrying out a battle mission

720
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,000
according to the superior's order.

721
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,400
The public security department

722
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,680
will be responsible for this operation.

723
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,200
We will be led by the special police

724
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,320
to create a battle plan

725
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,000
and implement the arrest of the group.

726
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,200
Do you understand?

727
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,480
Hello, Mr. Tang.

728
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,040
Hello.

729
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,360
Hello.

730
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:20,920
Hello.

731
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,560
Long time no see.

732
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,320
We have brought the person here.

733
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,360
You can arrange it later.

734
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,320
Okay, no problem.

735
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,640
You came alone?

736
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,880
You?

737
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,680
I came alone too.

738
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,080
Who?

739
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,680
Hello.

740
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,320
We are reporters from Minghuang.

741
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,040
We are Tang Hai.

742
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,200
I'm Tang Xing, the chief editor of Minghuang.

743
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,240
Please.

744
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,680
Xia Nan.

745
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,480
Hello.

746
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,600
Reporters, please come in.

747
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,200
Okay.

748
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,640
Let's go.

749
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
Hello, I'm Tang Hai.

750
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,160
I'm Tang Xin, the chief editor of Minghuang.

751
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,880
I'm Tang Xin.

752
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,640
I'm Tang Xin.

753
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,480
I'm Tang Xin.

754
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,600
The restaurant is on the third floor.

755
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,560
You can eat there if you are hungry.

756
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,680
Okay, thank you.

757
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,200
Okay.

758
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,560
Officer Chen.

759
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,560
Hello.

760
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,120
Tang Jingran.

761
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:56,840
I want to ask

762
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,760
when we can arrive?

763
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,560
I don't know the exact time.

764
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,800
We have to wait for the leader's arrangement.

765
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,520
Then we have to stay here for a few days.

766
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,640
Yes, stay here for a few days.

767
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,680
We will inform you the exact time.

768
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:07,920
Okay?

769
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
Let's go back to the room and have a rest.

770
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,320
Okay, let's go.

771
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,280
Hello, comrades.

772
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,640
I'm Qu Gang, the chief of the Public Security Bureau of Wenzhou.

773
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,160
This is the special police team.

774
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,960
Captain Liu.

775
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,040
These two are from the International Criminal Police Organization.

776
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,960
Thomas and Peter.

777
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,600
I invite you here this time.

778
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,840
You should know the situation, right?

779
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,280
I have already known

780
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,520
the situation of the drone.

781
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,920
Please assign the task to the chief.

782
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,600
Don't worry.

783
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
Before the formal operation,

784
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,440
we need to send people to

785
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,840
conduct a real investigation.

786
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,680
First, we need to roughly understand

787
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,720
the number of people in the army,

788
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,280
the distribution of personnel,

789
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,960
and the situation of the gunfire distribution.

790
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,200
The task of scouting the island

791
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,880
is left to our men's assault team.

792
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,640
Then I'll be polite.

793
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,360
This is a map of the island

794
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,560
based on the pictures taken by the drone.

795
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,280
Please take a look.

796
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,680
Here and here.

797
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,280
There is a port guard respectively.

798
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,080
Each port guard has two mercenaries.

799
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,320
Captain Wu.

800
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,840
The scouting before the operation is very important.

801
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,040
Our scouts

802
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,000
must sneak into the island

803
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,880
without knowing it.

804
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,480
Understood.

805
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,200
Our operation tonight

806
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,080
is a deep-seated operation.

807
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,880
We'll enter the base camp.

808
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,720
When did you come back?

809
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Look, I'm waiting for you to fall asleep.

810
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,520
I'll get you something to eat.

811
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,400
No, Mom.

812
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,280
No.

813
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,800
I just want to lie down with you.

814
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,040
Okay.

815
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,040
Come on.

816
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,960
I'll put it on for you.

817
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,360
You haven't been so clingy to me for a long time.

818
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,760
Since you got married,

819
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,240
you've always been so affectionate.

820
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,840
How long have you not been friends with me?

821
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,240
How long can I be your friend forever?

822
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,440
And have you ever gone away

823
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,760
to try to achieve a goal?

824
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,460
I mean...

825
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,120
and what I achieved

826
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,160
since I was a kid

827
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,440
and one year a long time ago on the field.

828
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,800
ases all depict all the stressful life of you and me.

829
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,960
This is Kai Qi.

830
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,600
It's nice before,

831
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,000
without worries.

832
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,560
What things to meet now

833
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,600
are替 you and Dad

834
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,400
I remember when I was pregnant with you,

835
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,600
the doctor said I was too weak

836
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
and couldn't bear it,

837
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
so I had to take in the sun.

838
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,600
But at that time,

839
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,600
your father always had a big mission.

840
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
My parents

841
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
lived farther away from me.

842
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
I was alone, with a big belly,

843
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,600
running around,

844
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,600
and I was the only one

845
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
in the family.

846
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Later, the army took care of me

847
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,600
and arranged a little soldier for me.

848
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,600
He could help me with the family affairs.

849
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,600
You said I went to the pregnancy check-up.

850
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,600
How could I be embarrassed to let people go with me?

851
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,600
One day, when I went down the stairs,

852
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
I slipped on my feet

853
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
and fell.

854
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
The blood

855
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,600
flowed out of my thigh.

856
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,600
I was so scared

857
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
that I thought

858
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,600
my baby couldn't be kept.

859
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
I was so scared.

860
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
Look.

861
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
Look.

862
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,600
I'm fine now.

863
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
When I was in the pregnancy check-up,

864
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,600
I saw you for the first time.

865
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,600
I was thinking

866
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,600
that my little princess

867
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
was the bravest

868
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
in the world.

869
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
You came to me

870
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
with such a great effort.

871
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,600
I must be brave

872
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
and take good care of you,

873
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,600
love you,

874
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
and give you a good life.

875
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,600
I will do my best

876
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
to make you feel better.

877
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Mom.

878
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
You and my dad

879
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,600
have already taken good care of me.

880
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Thank you, mom.

881
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Silly girl.

882
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Why are you thanking me?

883
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Actually, in my heart,

884
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
I really don't want you to grow up.

885
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,600
But it's necessary

886
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,600
to be a family.

887
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
It's not difficult to be a family.

888
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
What's difficult is

889
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,600
you have to use the information of Qian Bei Bei

890
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
to threaten this family.

891
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
Actually, mom has been

892
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,600
through a lot in her life.

893
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,600
The main thing is that you have your dad.

894
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
No matter how hard I cry,

895
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
I feel sweet.

896
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
I also hope

897
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,600
you and Zhong Qing are like this.

898
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Zhong Qing is a good child.

899
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,600
As a soldier,

900
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
with his limited ability,

901
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
he has done

902
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
his best.

903
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
You didn't see the wrong person.

904
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
You didn't see the wrong person.

905
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
I know.

906
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
If we were in the same position,

907
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
we wouldn't have done better than him.

908
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Your dad is a soldier

909
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,600
who grew up with the overseas navy.

910
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
Mom is a soldier

911
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
who grew up with them.

912
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,600
The people of your generation

913
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,600
were different at that time.

914
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,600
You can only get better and better.

915
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Think about everything when you're better.

916
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Mom will be fine.

917
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
Mom will be fine.

918
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
The red wine tastes very special.

919
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
It's my first time drinking it.

920
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
Where did you taste it?

921
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
It's the first time to taste

922
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,600
such a special red wine.

923
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
Where is it from?

924
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
You can't buy this in the market.

925
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
A friend of mine has its own winery.

926
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
He said that his friend made it himself.

927
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
You can't buy it on the market.

928
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,600
He gives it only to his best friends and colleagues.

929
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,600
And every year you can get like only one box.

930
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
And it is only offered to customers and friends.

931
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,600
Every person has at least one box every year.

932
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
William is so considerate.

933
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,600
It seems that we are really lucky.

934
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,600
It is our honor to taste it.

935
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Come on.

936
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
Go to the tree and touch it.

937
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
You stay here and prepare for safety.

938
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,600
Don't worry.

939
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
Go.

940
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
You know, when I found out that you were coming,

941
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,600
I put on some efforts

942
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,600
and I managed to exchange one of my relics

943
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,600
for ten boxes of this wine.

944
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,600
So drink.

945
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
When I knew you were coming,

946
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
he used a piece of his rare blue flower seed

947
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,600
to exchange it for ten boxes.

948
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
I'm sorry.

949
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,600
I'm sorry.

950
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
I'm sorry.

951
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
I'm sorry.

952
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
I'm sorry.

953
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
I'm sorry.

954
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,600
I'm sorry.

955
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,600
I'm sorry.

956
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,600
I'm sorry.

957
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
I'm sorry.

958
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,600
I'm sorry.

959
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,600
I'm sorry.

960
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
I'm sorry.

961
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,600
That's so rare.
