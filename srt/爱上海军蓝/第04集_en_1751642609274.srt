1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,200
We hug this piece of blue sky

2
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
The end of the good time

3
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,600
is me who never changes

4
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,800
I don't need to endure

5
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,200
the endless anger

6
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,800
I'll be my own friend and opponent

7
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,600
No one is looking at you

8
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,400
I'll be worth it

9
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll be worth it

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,800
I'll be worth it

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,800
Captain

12
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,600
Did I bring the worst ice?

13
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,400
I didn't bring the worst ice

14
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,600
You're not bad at all

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You didn't get put in the right place

16
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,600
Do you know what I liked about you when I picked you?

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,800
You're brave and you're good at it

18
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,400
And you're more than a leader

19
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
You're very lacking in the new soldiers

20
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,800
You've been in the Chenyue for so many years

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
The Chen faction is a sniper

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,000
I can't compare

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,200
They weren't snipers at first

24
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,800
They were one by one

25
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
One step, one foot

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,000
They hit the airfield

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,800
Just a little mistake

28
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,000
But they were all very good

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:39,880
And all swear by our

30
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,600
Actually before I became a Nanren

31
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
You are more capable than everyone in the team.

32
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,600
But

33
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,840
you are not steady enough.

34
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,160
Captain.

35
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,640
I've figured it out.

36
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,920
I'll stay in the blue team

37
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,920
and be a top sniper like Chen.

38
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,400
It's good to have a choice.

39
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,200
But the soldiers have to use their strength.

40
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,960
You have to learn a lot from the blue team.

41
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,240
You have to make up for your shortcomings and develop your strengths.

42
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,080
You have to be steady.

43
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,840
You have to be steady.

44
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,080
You have to be steady.

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,880
Do you understand?

46
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,600
Yes.

47
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,360
Attention.

48
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,040
Ready to fire.

49
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,600
Fire.

50
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,640
Ready to fire!

51
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,080
I'm running towards footage!

52
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,720
Are you surrounded?

53
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,880
Are youволk to me!

54
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,080
Do you think I'm cloudless or spec doing it to see?

55
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,080
I am the one who seems to face you.

56
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,440
Come on.

57
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,640
After you drink water, your body and water surface will become vertical.

58
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,440
Your body will be slightly forward.

59
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,840
Your head will be facing the water surface.

60
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,040
Use your lower jaw to hold the water surface.

61
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,840
Watch them eat.

62
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,240

Low.

86
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,440
Low back.

87
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,440

Kneel.

92
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,040
Forward.

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,560
Yin Deng Wang.

94
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,400
Your buttocks are low.

96
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,000

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,800
Add some gas.

101
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,760
Don't raise your legs.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,640
Hurry up.

103
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,000
Hold on.

104
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,480
Hold on.

105
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,080
Sliding.

106
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,800
Go.

107
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,560
The most important thing in shooting

108
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,840
is four things.

109
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,800
First, the sniper.

110
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,240
Adjust to the most relaxed

111
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,800
and stable posture.

112
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,480
Second, aim.

113
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,120
Adjust the co-arbitrary.

114
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,120
Aim at the mirror.

115
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,920
Don't have shadows.

116
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,920
Third, breathe.

117
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,920
Breathe evenly and steadily with your abdomen.

118
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,360
Fourth, stimulate.

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,920
Evenly and steadily move back.

120
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,360
When the target appears,

121
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,840
turn back and start drawing.

122
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,240
Keep shooting.

123
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,240
Keep switching.

124
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,040
newer.

125
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,340
die earlier every time you die.

126
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,900
How can it be possible for a fresh injury like this?

127
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,700
Hold on, wanted to go to prison.

128
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,500
But you're afraid to die now, right?

129
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,980
Next to me is a friend,

130
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,280
someone I know who I could rely on for magic.

131
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,280
Hurry up!

132
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,240
Ready.

133
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,440
Go!

134
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,160
Hurry up!

135
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,320
Hurry up, Yinan Wang.

136
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,800
Can you do it?

137
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,000
You ate too much snacks, right?

138
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,760
Come on!

139
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,480
Hurry up!

140
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,440
Hurry up, Yinan Wang.

141
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,040
How do I teach you?

142
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,120
You're worse than a dog.

143
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,520
Oh my god.

144
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,840
Use some strength.

145
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
You didn't eat.

146
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,040
Come on!

147
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,320
Hurry up!

148
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,320
Five.

149
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,120
Four.

150
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,760
You're one second faster than last time.

151
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,600
Three.

152
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,720
How do I tell you?

153
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,320
What have you been practicing these days?

154
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,600
You're eating snacks.

155
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,640
You want to stay in the Blue Team?

156
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,080
You're still the best in our team.

157
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,800
Why are you looking at me?

158
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,120
Keep practicing.

159
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,520
I'm waiting for you to win the award.

160
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,080
Yes.

161
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,880
Hurry up!

162
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,520
Sadly, we're not competing.

163
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Sc windy!

164
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,680
Be careful of our luck.

165
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,880
Good!

166
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,760
We are both on our way.

167
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,640
Ben,

168
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,960
don't worry about me.

169
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm fine,

170
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll stay atlas.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,740
that asked you to do this contest.

172
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,360
It's not sea- depreciation

173
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,960
I will give your heart

174
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,240
But it's just a là

175
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,920
Here, take it

176
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
I'm letting you go.

177
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
I've sent the team to the hospital.

178
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Did you see it?

179
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
Yang, don't be like this.

180
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
We're relatives.

181
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
Don't you feel ashamed to be the captain?

182
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
I have to tell the whole team and the whole squad.

183
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Thank you, Captain.

184
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
You're happy?

185
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Did you let him?

186
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
Sir.

187
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,920
He's really a good guy.

188
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
He's very kind and kind.

189
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
He's got a better progress than I thought.

190
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
You're going out to sea on a day off

191
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,920
and you're going to interview that Bazi Mei?

192
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
You're gone.

193
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Who's going to do your job for you?

194
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Don't worry.

195
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
I'll handle it.

196
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,920
If I can make a big hit on the Chinese Internet

197
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,920
on a day off,

198
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
who would it be?

199
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
He's preparing for an interview tomorrow.

200
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,920
Okay.

201
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
I'll tell you.

202
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
I'll look up another one.

203
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
The case of the national underwater cultural relic.

204
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
Really?

205
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Some time ago, I received an anonymous report

206
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
that someone was stealing the cultural relic

207
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,920
from the salt and seawater.

208
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,920
I went out to sea for this last time.

209
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
Tang Xin,

210
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,920
your spirit is precious.

211
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
But this kind of thing

212
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
can't be investigated by us.

213
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
You'd better hand these cases over to the police.

214
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
That person reported it.

215
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,920
But there's no new progress in the investigation.

216
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
So I thought

217
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
if we found the evidence

218
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
and handed it over to the police,

219
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,920
the Chinese Internet would be in full swing.

220
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,920
This is more valuable than the flow of women.

221
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Right, Mr. Jian?

222
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,920
Then I'll leave it to you.

223
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
I promise.

224
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,920
Okay.

225
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,920
You can only try it.

226
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,920
Be careful.

227
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Thank you, Mr. Tian.

228
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,920
Mr. Pan.

229
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
We'll be there soon.

230
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
Let's put on the swimming trunks.

231
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Okay.

232
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,920
Can you do it?

233
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Mr. Tang.

234
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
I'm really grateful for your help.

235
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
If it weren't for you,

236
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,920
I really can't find a way

237
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
to find the truth.

238
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
Don't say thank you anymore.

239
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
You said thank you when you borrowed the boat from me.

240
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
You said thank you when you got on the boat.

241
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Now you say thank you again.

242
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,920
When you find the boat

243
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
and get off the boat,

244
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
will you say thank you again?

245
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
Of course.

246
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
I'm really sincere.

247
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
Okay.

248
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
I've received your sincerity.

249
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
But in fact,

250
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,920
I should thank you.

251
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,920
Thank you for giving me such a chance

252
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,920
to make me a part of the protection of the marine waterway.

253
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
Okay.

254
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
But if I can find the boat today,

255
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
I'll give you and the Changzhou Group

256
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,920
a good show in the column.

257
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
That's good.

258
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,920
But I didn't say I would write it down.

259
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
I want to show the boat to the Changzhou Group.

260
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
Okay.

261
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
The first team, get ready to get off the boat.

262
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,920
Report.

263
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
Zhege Yang, the water-sail motorist is out.

264
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
Report.

265
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,920
Lin Yang, the water-sail motorist is out.

266
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Get off the boat.

267
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,920
The boat is ready.

268
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
The water-sail motorist is out.

269
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,920
The boat is ready.

270
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,920

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920

00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920

00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
The water-sail motorist is out.

283
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
The water-sail motorist is out.

284
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
The water-sail motorist is out.

285
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,920
The water-sail motorist is out.

286
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,920
No No No

287
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
No No

288
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,920
No No

289
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
The water-sail motorist is gone

290
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,920
The water-sail motorist is gone

291
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,920
No No No

292
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,920

293
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,920
The water-sail motorist is gone

294
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
The water-sail motorist is gone

295
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,920
The water-sail motorist is gone

296
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,920
The water-sail motorist is gone

00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
The water-sail motorist is gone

299
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
The water-sail motorist is gone

300
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
The water-sail motorist is gone

301
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
The water-sail motorist is gone

302
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
Let's go

303
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
Let's go

304
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
It's a water-sail motorist

305
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,920
It's a black water-sail motorist

306
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,920
It's a black water-sail motorist

307
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,720
Enough

308
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,040
If you really can't chase it?

309
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,480
You still want to race it up to the top?

310
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:07,880
Look.

311
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,420
Jiang Zijian was excellent in the competition.

312
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,280
There are many good rules.

313
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,560
He doesn't mind to win all of them.

314
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,640
What?

315
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,440
I want to chase fast.

316
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,280
If you want to chase fast,

317
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,600
I will send you shopping resource.

318
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,000
It's off limit,

319
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,360
I earn it.

320
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,200
But be a good student.

321
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,360
I don't know when I willly pass the time.

322
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,920
I want to chase fast till the end.

323
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,600
The speed is so fast,

324
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,480
Please remain in the middle.

325
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,520
I'll see to it.

326
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,840
You gave anything that you need.

327
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,680
He makes a permission to ask for more cash next issue.

328
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,120
Manyis secondary team, prepare the Attraktion.

329
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,880
Sir, the poem,

330
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,680
Mr. Lei tries to show us the way in time.

331
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,360
If you prepare to저

332
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,120
Get in the car

333
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,560
Go

334
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,400
ci...

335
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,160
Stop

336
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,160
Everyone

337
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,040
Stop

338
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
Come on, go!

339
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
Number 8.

340
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,480
Number 8, start counting.

341
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,240
Number 1, 47.

342
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,280
Number 2, 49.

343
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,240
Number 3, 47.

344
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,280
Number 4, 43.

345
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,240
Number 5, 44.

346
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,320
Number 6, 43.

347
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,120
Mr. Han.

348
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
How is it?

349
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
It's good.

350
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
It's good.

351
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
How is it?

352
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,600
We've arrived at the designated sea area.

353
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,480
Get ready to go into the water.

354
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Okay.

355
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,520
Be careful.

356
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,920
Okay, be careful.

357
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,600
I picked these today.

358
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,040
They're very rich in diving experience.

359
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,840
I'll say one last thing.

360
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,480
Once you find a sinking ship,

361
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,640
be sure to protect the relics.

362
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
Don't damage them.

363
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Okay.

364
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,720
Brother Liu, get ready.

365
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
Get ready to go into the water.

366
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,880
I heard that the interview for the Big Smoke Manor has been approved.

367
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,120
But the Brigadier didn't let us mention it.

368
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
It's your mission.

369
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,160
We were all there that day.

370
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,720
Why did you have to mention me?

371
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,480
Is it because of the reporter Tang from White-Tun Bay?

372
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,080
He was also there that day.

373
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,480
Why are you hiding from him?

374
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
I'm not hiding.

375
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,920
I just feel it's meaningless.

376
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
The mission is over.

377
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,680
I'm going to go back to the camp.

378
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
I'll see you later.

379
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Okay.

380
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,840
You don't have to look for me.

381
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,480
What if he just wants to

382
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,080
say thank you in person?

383
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
We're not doing this

384
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,640
to thank someone.

385
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,520
He's just thankful to us

386
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,040
for being okay.

387
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
That's true.

388
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,240
But why do I always feel

389
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,680
that you're so cautious

390
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,760
when you mention this reporter Tang?

391
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,000
What?

392
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,400
Are you afraid that the girl will recognize you

393
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,440
and harass you?

394
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,240
I'm really curious.

395
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,400
Why is he looking for me?

396
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,600
You can ask him directly if you're curious.

397
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
Can he guess it?

398
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
I can't.

399
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,360
He's also the blind date

400
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,720
that the Brigadier introduced to me.

401
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,040
That's great.

402
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,280
It's fate.

403
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,720
Even if it's fate,

404
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,080
I can't say it.

405
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,840
He might say that I'm the one who saved him.

406
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,120
He's like a kid.

407
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,480
He wants to force me to date someone else.

408
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,480
Then you're hiding it now.

409
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,280
What if the blind date is successful in the future?

410
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,600
I still have to talk to him.

411
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,240
It's not that easy.

412
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,660
2 days before

413
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,320
If we have to lose,

414
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,460
I,ển

415
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:41,600
Across the river

416
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,460
Did you know

417
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,300
The lake was filled with alles

418
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,020
Pays down

419
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,940
Come on.

420
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,620
It's coming.

421
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,500
How is it?

422
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,260
No.

423
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,420
No.

424
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,660
No?

425
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,180
Did you find it carefully?

426
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,260
Mr. Tang, don't worry.

427
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,100
We've got the gold.

428
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,180
We won't have any loopholes.

429
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,700
Don't worry.

430
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,980
There are two more coming up.

431
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,820
It's coming.

432
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,460
How is it?

433
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,700
Did you find it?

434
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,260
No.

435
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,500
Well,

436
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
thank you for your hard work.

437
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,940
Let's look for it again, okay?

438
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,220
Look for it carefully this time.

439
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:30,740
Yes.

440
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,060
Yes.

441
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,140
It's been a long journey.

442
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,260
Thank you for your hard work.

443
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,500
Come on.

444
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,460
Come on.

445
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,660
It's coming.

446
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,340
Let's go.

447
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,580
How is it this time?

448
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,980
Still no.

449
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,420
Why is it gone?

450
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,940
Don't worry.

451
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,380
Let's get on the boat first.

452
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,380
Let's take a break.

453
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,260
Is there a problem with the position

454
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,340
of our boat?

455
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,420
Well,

456
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,860
this is the boat.

457
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,860
It's not the boat.

458
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,860
It's the boat.

459
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,860
It's the boat.

460
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,860
It's the boat.

461
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,860
It's the boat.

462
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,540
Well,

463
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,300
I don't understand this.

464
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,180
Secretary Sun,

465
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,660
tell the captain

466
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,620
to go ahead

467
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,780
and let's drive a little further.

468
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,620
Then we'll talk.

469
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,540
Okay, understood.

470
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,620
Don't worry.

471
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,420
I believe

472
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,300
you will find it.

473
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,780
I hope so.

474
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,220
That's right.

475
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,620
Yes.

476
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,300
10926.

477
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,220
Then let's

478
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,980
expand the search range.

479
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,620
Okay.

480
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,420
Hello.

481
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,180
Mr. Han,

482
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,380
Mr. Han and the female reporter

483
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,260
went to Dayanjiao.

484
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,460
They also brought the diving team.

485
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,740
I'm sorry.

486
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,740
I'm sorry.

487
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,740
I'm sorry.

488
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,740
I'm sorry.

489
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,740
I'm sorry.

490
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,740
I'm sorry.

491
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,380
Let them cover it up.

492
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,740
How's it going this time?

493
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,020
Still nothing.

494
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,220
There are all coral reefs below.

495
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,980
Coral reefs?

496
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,380
I went to the sea

497
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,380
you gave me.

498
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,220
But I didn't find anything.

499
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,980
Will the coordinates

500
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,340
you sent be wrong?

501
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,780
Can you send me another one?

502
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,660
Impossible.

503
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,260
Maybe it's the location

504
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,300
of your boat that's different.

505
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,820
After all, the sea

506
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,100
is not the same as the land.

507
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,020
Let's wait.

508
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,000
This is different from last time.

509
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,100
This is it.

510
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,100
This is the one I sent last time.

511
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,880
team leader в

512
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,600
Thanks

513
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,540
Watch Ha well

514
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,340
Seems like it's broken

515
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,160
With

516
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,100
knife

517
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,120
Stay tricky

518
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,280
Died...

519
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,220
What?

520
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
Captain.

521
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,320
Stop looking.

522
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,980
Flying C-Pirates and othersill need more co- latencies.

523
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,960
Stop looking. Phone first while eating.

524
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,100
Yes.

525
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,100
The captain told you not to look.

526
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,100
You are comparing with the captain.

527
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,100
Why do I feel sorry for you?

528
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,100
Get out.

529
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
Don't want to end with me.

530
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,100
Stop arguing.

531
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,100
Cheng Yuan.

532
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,100
Help the instructor and interview me tomorrow.

533
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,100
Yes.

534
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,100
Why didn't you take me with Cheng Yuan?

535
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,100
Take you?

536
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,100
Can you say something nice to me?

537
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
I promise to make you happy.

538
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,100
This is the reason why I don't take you.

539
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,100
I don't want to waste your time.

540
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,100
Eat your meal.

541
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,100
Still don't let me say.

542
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,100
By the way,

543
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,100
what is the purpose of taking Cheng Yuan?

544
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,100
The captain is going to interview him.

545
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,100
Captain.

546
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
The reporter Tang

547
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,100
asked me to interview him tomorrow.

548
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,100
Please look at the situation and tell me.

549
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,100
They have a background.

550
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,100
I can't afford to make trouble.

551
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,100
You should check it yourself.

552
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,100
You should be careful.

553
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,100
Then you can provide me

554
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,100
some information about each other.

555
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,100
Okay?

556
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,100
What does she want to ask?

557
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,100
Who saved her beauty?

558
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,100
If she really asks,

559
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,100
how can I answer?

560
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,100
I'll teach you.

561
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,100
Two words.

562
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,100
Zongqing.

563
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,100
Give me all the gifts.

564
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,100
I'm not afraid.

565
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,100
Eat well, okay?

566
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,100
Okay.

567
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,100
Do you really want to ask?

568
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
I'll answer.

569
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,100
I understand.

570
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,100
You are a big brother.

571
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,100
I can only tell you.

572
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,100
They used to work on

573
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,100
sea fishing.

574
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,100
But the company is developing very fast.

575
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,100
Currently, it is a big company.

576
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,100
This is my new email.

577
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,100
Don't forget to

578
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
clear the things in the original email.

579
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,100
If you keep developing like this,

580
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,100
you should be completely yellow.

581
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,100
Wang Lang.

582
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,100
If you don't have time to interfere,

583
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,100
I have time.

584
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,100
I can interfere.

585
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,100
Old captain.

586
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,100
Xinxin's application to the army

587
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,100
has been reviewed.

588
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,100
I have already told Wu Si.

589
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,100
I asked him to cooperate.

590
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,100
I believe that

591
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,100
they will have a point.

592
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,100
No.

593
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,100
They have a point.

594
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,100
They don't have a emotional foundation.

595
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,100
They are not together.

596
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,100
This is not good.

597
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,100
I...

598
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,100
Wang Lang.

599
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,100
Old captain.

600
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,100
I am picking up Lin Lan and her son.

601
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,100
Lin Lan is here.

602
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,100
I picked her up.

603
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,100
I won't talk to you.

604
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,100
Bye.

605
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,100
Bye.

606
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,100
This time is good.

607
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,100
I don't have to run away.

608
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,100
Are you assured?

609
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,100
I am waiting for you every day.

610
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,100
How can I? I come back every day.

611
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,100
I am waiting for you somewhere else.

612
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
Wang Zeyang.

613
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,100
From now on,

614
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,100
you can count.

615
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,100
Your father will be home in a few days.

616
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,100
I promise.

617
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,100
You are the best in your class in the math class.

618
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,100
Who said that?

619
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,100
I am in the 200th grade.

620
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,100
This is a good thing.

621
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,100
This is a good thing.

622
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,100
Report.

623
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,100
Come in.

624
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,100
Reporter Tang, please.

625
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
Stand up.

626
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,100
Hello, reporter Tang.

627
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
I am Liu Shihua, the instructor of the Blue Team.

628
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,100
Tang Xin.

629
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,100
I am Wu Si, the leader of the Blue Team.

630
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,100
I am Cheng Yuan, the member of the Blue Team.

631
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,100
Sit down.

632
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,100
Okay.

633
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,100
Sit down.

634
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,100
Reporter Tang.

635
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,100
Is the interview funny?

636
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,100
No.

637
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,100
It's very honorable.

638
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,100
This is the introduction of the interview.

639
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,100
You can have a look.

640
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,100
No need.

641
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,100
Just ask me anything.

642
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,100
We will cooperate.

643
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,100
Okay.

644
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,100
First of all, I want to ask you.

645
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,100
The day before yesterday,

646
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,100
you were in the middle of the interview.

647
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,100
How did you get here?

648
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
I was in the middle of the interview.

649
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,100
I want to ask you.

650
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,100
Were the people who participated in the rescue operation

651
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,100
of the Blue Team?

652
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,100
They are all comrades.

653
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,100
We don't divide into teams.

654
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,100
Then I want to ask you.

655
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,100
What is the usual position

656
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,100
and division of the Blue Team?

657
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,100
Life.

658
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,100
I understand.

659
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,100
Okay.

660
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,100
Then I want to ask you.

661
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,100
Did you go to the rescue operation that day

662
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,100
by chance or

663
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,100
did you rush there after receiving orders?

664
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,100
The superior ordered

665
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,100
that the soldiers should always be prepared.

666
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,100
This rescue operation

667
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,100
is a coincidental event.

668
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,100
Then why are you

669
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,100
so timely to arrive at the scene?

670
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,100
Come as soon as you know.

671
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,100
Come as soon as you can.

672
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,100
I want to ask.

673
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,100
Which of the members

674
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,100
participated in the rescue operation that day?

675
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,100
There are members.

676
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,100
Then can I talk to the members alone?

677
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
Sorry, I can't.

678
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,100
No.

679
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,100
Reporter Tang.

680
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,100
You scared us

681
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,100
our lovely comrades.

682
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,100
Captain.

683
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,100
How about

684
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,100
explaining to reporter Tang

685
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,100
the rescue operation

686
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,100
of the Blue Team?

687
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,100
Reporter Tang is on the scene.

688
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,100
Do you need more explanation?

689
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,100
Then

690
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,100
how about

691
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,100
looking at the interview draft of reporter Tang?

692
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,100
No need.

693
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,100
I believe

694
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,100
in reporter Tang's professionalism.

695
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,100
Saving people is the duty of a soldier.

696
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,100
I can answer your question

697
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,100
on behalf of the Blue Team.

698
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,100
But if your interview

699
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,100
is aimed at individuals,

700
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,100
then I'm sorry.

701
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,100
I can't tell you.

702
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,100
Captain Wu.

703
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,100
At first you said

704
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,100
you would cooperate with the interview.

705
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,100
I'm trying to cooperate.

706
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,100
But under the conditions,

707
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,100
you can't ask about the secret.

708
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,100
Okay.

709
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,100
Then I'll ask a question

710
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,100
as the person in charge of the Big Yan.

711
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,100
Who saved me that day?

712
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Tang Yuan.

713
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
Say it.

714
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,100
Captain Cheng.

715
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
You were on the scene that day.

716
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,100
Can you answer my question?

717
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,100
Please answer my question.

718
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Zong...

719
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
What?

720
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,100
In a word,

721
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,100
I haven't asked him his opinion.

722
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,100
I can't answer you now.

723
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,100
Okay.

724
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,100
Then I'll answer

725
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,100
after you ask him his opinion.

726
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,100
I'll go back first.

727
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,100
Ms. Tang.

728
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,100
Do you have any interview requests?

729
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,100
If possible,

730
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
I want to ask you a question.

731
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,100
I have a lot of questions.

732
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,100
I'm not sure if I can answer them all.

733
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,100
I'm afraid that

734
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,100
you can't answer them all.

735
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,100
I'm afraid that

736
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,100
you can't answer them all.

737
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,100
I'm afraid that

738
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,100
you can't answer them all.

739
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
I'm afraid that

740
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,100
I want to ask you a question.

741
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,100
Whether they have

742
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,100
participated in the rescue of the Big Yan,

743
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
I want to talk to them.

744
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,100
Then I need the approval of the superior.

745
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,100
Okay.

746
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,100
Wait for my captain's answer.

747
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,100
Then I'll go first.

748
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,100
Captain.

749
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,100
Ms. Tang.

750
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,100
Is she okay?

751
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,100
I don't care.

752
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,100
Captain Wu.

753
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,100
Don't forget to ask for permission.

754
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,100
I'll wait for your news.

755
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,100
I think

756
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,100
you and Ms. Tang

757
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,100
are quite compatible.

758
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,100
Report.

759
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,100
Come in.

760
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,100
Captain.

761
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,100
Ms. Tang wants to

762
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,100
have an interview with the military camp.

763
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,100
Who?

764
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,100
I didn't say that.

765
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,100
How about this?

766
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
You answer like this.

767
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,100
You say that

768
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,100
the military camp welcomes you to the interview.

769
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
But the army needs to ensure training.

770
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,100
They will arrange a more suitable interview for him.

771
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,100
Yes.

772
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,100
Captain.

773
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,100
I want to ask for permission to go out with me this afternoon.

774
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
I want to meet my girlfriend.

775
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,100
Just meet her.

776
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,100
Why do you want to see me?

777
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,100
Xin Xin.

778
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,100
You were scared of Song Qing, right?

779
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,100
How can a girl like you

780
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,100
still bring interview to improve?

781
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,100
How did your Lan Bai Bai

782
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,100
educate you?

783
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,100
This is called

784
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,100
not preparing for war.

785
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,100
I think you just

786
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,100
met up with B in the army.

787
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,100
You can't find him from the military camp.

788
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,100
You don't know

789
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,100
how hard it is

790
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,100
to find a lonely

791
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,100
roadside player.

792
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,100
Why did I meet up with you today?

793
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,100
I just followed that person

794
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,100
and stirred up the trouble.

795
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,100
It's really hard to get into the camp.

796
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,100
Thank you for being lazy.

797
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,100
Hurry up.

798
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,100
What's wrong?

799
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,100
You can't tell me

800
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,100
about the thing with the big smoke.

801
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,100
I know.

802
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,100
You suddenly said about the big smoke.

803
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,100
Answer the question.

804
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,100
You can't say the winning information.

805
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,100
You can't say anything irrelevant.

806
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,100
You can't say the captain's identity.

807
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,100
Are you satisfied?

808
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,100
Let's go.

809
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,100
Hurry up. I'm late.

810
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,100
Today, I just let you

811
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,100
have a good chat with him.

812
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
I tell you,

813
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,100
as long as there is no one inside,

814
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,100
I will end the battle

815
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,100
with three or two questions.

816
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,100
I'll give you back

817
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,100
your world, okay?

818
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,100
Tang Xin.

819
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,100
Why do you like

820
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,100
the one who opens one mouth

821
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,100
and the one who closes one mouth?

822
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,100
Do you like that one?

823
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
I like him?

824
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,100
Do you like a wooden one?

825
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,100
It's a whole one

826
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,100
without a hole.

827
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,100
It's too ugly.

828
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,100
He is a steel plate.

829
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,100
I'm a two-leafed flow.

830
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,100
A little.

831
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,100
I'm a two-leafed flow.

832
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,100
I'm a two-leafed flow.

833
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,100
I'm a two-leafed flow.

834
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,100
I'm a two-leafed flow.

835
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,100
Tang Ji Zhe.

836
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,100
You compare me

837
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,100
to a bee's egg

838
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,100
and you still surround me.

839
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,100
What do you think

840
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,100
your positioning is?

841
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,100
Why is he here?

842
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,100
I don't know.

843
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,100
Zhang, I'm leaving.

844
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,100
See you at the temple.

845
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,100
Bye.

846
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,100
Bye.

847
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,100
Let me introduce you

848
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,100
to my captain, Wu Si.

849
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,100
This is my cousin, Tang Xin.

850
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,100
What's your name?

851
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,100
I'm Song Qing,

852
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,100
from the Navy.

853
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,100
It seems familiar.

854
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,100
Have we met before?

855
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,100
Yes.

856
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,100
Last time in the fishing village,

857
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,100
I was arrested.

858
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,100
This time, she is my girlfriend's

859
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,100
reporter, Tang Xin.

860
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,100
I'm mistaken.

861
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,100
Yang Yang often talks about you.

862
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,100
What kind of role

863
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,100
do you play in the team?

864
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,100
Do you often

865
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,100
give out very dangerous tasks?

866
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,100
I understand.

867
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,100
It's a secret, right?

868
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,100
Okay, I'll change the question.

869
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,100
You have been

870
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,100
to the big research recently.

871
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,100
Tang Ji Zhe,

872
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,100
don't make it difficult for me.

873
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,100
I didn't accept

874
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,100
the interview task.

875
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,100
I can't answer your question.

876
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,100
I didn't teach you this.

877
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,100
Captain Wu,

878
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,100
you shouldn't

879
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,100
follow him around.

880
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,100
What about Tang Ji Zhe?

881
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,100
He is my best friend.

882
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,100
I have to check on him.

883
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,100
He is my comrade-in-arms.

884
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,100
I have to observe

885
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,100
and check on him.

886
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,100
When will you leave

887
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,100
after you check on him?

888
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,100
When will you leave?

889
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,100
When will I leave?

890
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,100
When will I leave?

891
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,100
When will I leave?

892
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,100
Well,

893
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,100
what should we do now?

894
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,100
Tang Jing,

895
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,100
do you have any activities?

896
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,100
Okay, got it.

897
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,100
Go.

898
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:47,100
Let everything look romantic

899
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:51,100
The dream is also so plain

900
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:57,100
But in your heart, there are more expectations

901
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,100
I really don't understand

902
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:05,100
You say love is too vague

903
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:11,100
But your eyes give me the answer

904
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:18,100
I can exchange all my heart with you

905
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:26,100
Thank you for waking up the courage that was once weak

906
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,100
Let all coincidences become wishes

907
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:33,100
Let all the burdens become partners

908
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,100
Open the light of the years after

909
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:42,100
The blue sea can't separate us

910
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:46,100
Waiting for the heart to warm up

911
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:52,100
Why is my answer in my memory

912
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:56,100
The loneliness of the past time

913
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:00,100
Suddenly the love becomes nostalgic

914
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,100
I don't want to take it back

915
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:11,100
The courage to leave is to let my heart be

916
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,100
Thank you for being by my side

917
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:18,100
The cold snow and the darkness

918
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:22,100
The bigger the world, the more lonely it is

919
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,100
Only standing by your side

920
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:33,100
I feel warm in my heart

921
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,100
Thank you for watching
