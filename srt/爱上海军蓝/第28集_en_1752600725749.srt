1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Attention!

3
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Attention!

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Attention!

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Attention!

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Attention!

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Attention!

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Comrades!

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The men's retreating team has been gathered.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Attention!

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Attention!

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Attention!

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Attention!

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Comrades!

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Comrades!

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The navy special forces

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
have been gathered to kill the army.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Attention!

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Attention!

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Attention!

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Comrades!

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Do you understand the mission?

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes!

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's go!

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Come on!

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Come on!

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's go!

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let's go!

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's go!

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's go!

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's go!

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Let's go!

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The mission is to fight the enemy.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The heavy machine will die.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The soldier who is captured will be killed.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,380
The soldier with the semester

37
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,300
is the hostage who can save the cultivator.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:50,120
Orange eyes can

39
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,560
the 얘기

40
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,840
What's up?

41
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,640
Dongqiu, what?

42
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,040
What?

43
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
He slept at Dalong's place?

44
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,320
He couldn't sleep at the crime scene- cherish house.

45
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,620
Open it, open it, open it

46
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,440
When your father is asleep

47
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,600
You always have to go there

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,780
and take a rest

49
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,440
Don't be too Spy

50
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,680
You are so snel

51
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,880
OK. Why not being in the hospital?

52
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,160
It's ok

53
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,080
Next time, you can turn on this show

54
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,740
If you make that loud noise

55
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,600
You won't wake up

56
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,200
It's okay

57
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,120
I can also understand after seeing the coloured paper

58
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,960
You need to go back to sleep

59
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
I'm used to it.

60
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,200
I can't even tell.

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,760
You're the one

62
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,240
who's always

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,560
on my side.

64
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,960
You've been on my side

65
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,120
for a long time.

66
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
What are you trying to do?

67
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,680
Young people these days

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,960
are always thinking

69
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,240
about what to do.

70
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,200
Your mom and I

71
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,440
don't care about anyone

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,200
except your dad.

73
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,520
Mom,

74
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,440
let me tell you something.

75
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,280
Come on.

76
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,320
Listen carefully.

77
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,200
Don't be scared.

78
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,360
Okay, go ahead.

79
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,800
Wu Si proposed to me.

80
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Did you agree?

81
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
I said

82
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
I'd give him an answer

83
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,440
when he came back from the acting.

84
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,680
So he came back from the acting.

85
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,160
He came back from the acting?

86
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,080
What did you say?

87
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Have you made up your mind?

88
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,160
Mom,

89
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,120
did you and my dad

90
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,840
agree to our marriage?

91
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,920
Your dad

92
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,280
must have said no.

93
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
You run over there

94
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
and tell him

95
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,520
Wu Si proposed to you.

96
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,520
Believe it or not,

97
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,440
he'll sit down

98
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,800
and wake up from his dream.

99
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,040
What about you?

100
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,320
Did you agree?

101
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,120
Me?

102
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,800
Xin Xin,

103
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,600
have you made up your mind?

104
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,480
You're so careless.

105
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,240
Mom, don't be like this.

106
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,480
It's okay.

107
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,360
I'm happy.

108
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,120
Do you remember

109
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,960
when you were little,

110
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,440
you were called parents?

111
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
When?

112
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,080
That time.

113
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,560
When you were in the first grade,

114
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,680
the teacher

115
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
asked you to do

116
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,160
the two-part series.

117
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,560
Little goldfish,

118
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,440
dad is playing basketball

119
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,600
and swimming in the sea.

120
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,720
You're the only one

121
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,240
who got it wrong.

122
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,200
You're right.

123
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,360
Little fish is playing basketball.

124
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,480
Dad is swimming in the sea.

125
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,720
It's reasonable, right?

126
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,080
You're still laughing.

127
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,480
I didn't know that

128
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,880
when I heard that,

129
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,720
I felt

130
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,520
so embarrassed.

131
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,040
Mom,

132
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,680
there's one more thing.

133
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,600
I want to

134
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,480
tell dad about

135
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,160
the proposal this time.

136
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:47,800
Why?

137
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,840
After a while,

138
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,640
he's going to celebrate his birthday.

139
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,440
I want to make this news

140
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,200
a small surprise

141
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,400
for his birthday.

142
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,320
Okay?

143
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,760
Okay.

144
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,760
Okay.

145
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,880
Hello, chairman.

146
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,160
Hello, chairman.

147
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,760
Hello.

148
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,040
There are two things

149
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,400
in today's meeting.

150
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,000
First,

151
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,000
the old chairman

152
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,600
and Mr. Yu Tian

153
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,960
have passed away.

154
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,680
From now on,

155
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,640
I don't want anyone

156
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,280
to mention or discuss

157
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,640
this matter again.

158
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,200
Second,

159
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,320
since we want to reorganize,

160
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,960
the key point

161
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,360
can't be just about the business.

162
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,480
The human resources system

163
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,640
and personnel structure

164
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,720
should also be

165
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,080
the key object of reorganization.

166
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,920
The specific reorganization plan

167
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,200
has been sent to you.

168
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,480
Wait a minute

169
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,680
and take a quick look.

170
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,640
If you have any questions,

171
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,600
please ask them

172
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
and we'll discuss it together.

173
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,120
From now on,

174
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,720
I don't want anyone

175
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,080
in the Changzhou Group

176
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,480
to do anything dirty

177
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,000
in the name of the group.

178
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,440
It's not just about the individual.

179
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,920
It's about

180
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,280
the image of the entire Changzhou Group.

181
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
So I hope everyone

182
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,000
takes this matter

183
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,440
as a key point.

184
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,240
Dad,

185
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,240
let's say goodbye to Yuhang.

186
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,920
Let's go.

187
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Boys,

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,920
attention!

189
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,080
Thank you, officers.

190
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,080
Don't move!

191
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,800
Start the combat.

192
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Comrades, the first team is here.

193
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,640
Please give us instructions.

194
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Our troops will attack L Island in two days.

195
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,280
To ensure that the army can land smoothly,

196
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,800
we order you to enter L Island

197
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,280
and carry out the execution.

198
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,240
Yes.

199
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,440
You only have 48 hours.

200
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,840
You must complete the mission within 48 hours.

201
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,640
Yes.

202
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,360
Come on.

203
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,280
Let's take a look at the location of L Island first.

204
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,960
Let's study the direction of landing.

205
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,920
Tang Xin.

206
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,200
You're discharged?

207
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,160
Yes.

208
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,360
Tang Xin.

209
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,360
You're really something.

210
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,160
You always make a big move.

211
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,760
We're worried about you.

212
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,160
It's nothing. Don't worry.

213
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,560
Tell me.

214
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,240
Who is behind this time?

215
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,040
Let it go.

216
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,400
Don't ask about it

217
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,320
when Tang Xin comes back.

218
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,880
Go to work.

219
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,560
Go.

220
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,760
How's your recovery?

221
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,840
Almost.

222
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,520
When you were hospitalized,

223
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,720
the people in the Public Security Bureau came to me

224
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,920
and asked you to listen to the clues from the public security.

225
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,760
They expressed their gratitude.

226
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,160
How's the rest of the case?

227
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,920
They didn't say anything.

228
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,000
I can't ask them.

229
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,520
But they asked me to tell you

230
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,920
that this case

231
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,240
is for your safety.

232
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,720
Don't participate in this case too much.

233
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,240
If there are valuable clues,

234
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
you should continue to provide them.

235
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,800
I hope I can get a chance to get the clues.

236
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,240
Director Wan.

237
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,640
The hospital doctor of the anesthesia department, Lan Yangyang,

238
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,040
is here to report to you.

239
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,320
Good.

240
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,040
You're so good.

241
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
Please stop.

242
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,760
Let me introduce a new colleague.

243
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,720
Lan Yangyang.

244
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,600
The anesthesiologist of the University of Wenzhou,

245
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,840
Ben Shuang.

246
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,440
He's the new hospital doctor of our department.

247
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,320
Hello, everyone.

248
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,520
My name is Lan Yangyang.

249
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,480
Please take a seat.

250
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,120
Welcome.

251
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,680
Welcome.

252
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,760
Come on.

253
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,280
Stop.

254
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,760
Bring the water.

255
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,320
Yes.

256
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,520
and never allow any team or individual

257
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
to take the risk.

258
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,520
Yes.

259
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,520
Go back to the camp and check the deployment.

260
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,520
If you find any problems, open them immediately.

261
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
Yes.

262
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,520
Report, Commander.

263
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
The first team of the Blue Team

264
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
has successfully landed on the island.

265
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
I got it.

266
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
Go.

267
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Captain,

268
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
if we want to avoid the Blue Team's defense,

269
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
we can only go through this road

270
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,520
to reach the Blue Team's base.

271
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,520
Everyone must be careful when acting.

272
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
The Blue Team will not give up

273
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,520
this smart defense.

274
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
If it's mine,

275
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
I will be here.

276
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
Here.

277
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
Here.

278
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
Captain,

279
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,520
there are six Blue Teams

280
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,520
moving towards the north-west direction.

281
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
The distance is 250 to 300 meters.

282
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Hide. Get ready to go in.

283
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
Go.

284
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Go.

285
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,520
Go.

286
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,520
Go.

287
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
What are you doing, Xiao Chen?

288
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
Mom.

289
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Xiao Chen, what are you doing?

290
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,520
I was just buying groceries.

291
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,520
How could you throw away the equipment?

292
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,520
You can't leave by yourself.

293
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,520
You can't recover

294
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
from your wrongful method.

295
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
It's also possible that

296
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,520
your knee and hip

297
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
may be sprained.

298
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,520
If you do this again,

299
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
you will be in trouble.

300
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
I'm sorry.

301
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,520
I'm sorry.

302
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,520
I'm sorry.

303
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
I'm sorry.

304
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
I'm sorry.

305
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
I'm sorry.

306
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
Your previous reconstruction

307
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,520
was in vain.

308
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
Mom, I just

309
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
wanted to try it.

310
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
It's okay, Mom. I can do it myself.

311
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,520
I've been injured

312
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,520
more than once or twice.

313
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
I can hold on.

314
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
Mom, you know that

315
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
our Blue Team doesn't raise the idle.

316
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,520
If I don't recover as soon as possible,

317
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
I will drag them down.

318
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,520
I understand your feelings.

319
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,520
When you were out of the navy,

320
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
Zi Jian Ya told me

321
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,520
a lot of things about you.

322
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
I know that

323
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,520
you've done a lot of work

324
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,520
for the honor of the military.

325
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
But I'm a doctor.

326
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
I want to tell you

327
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
that you must use

328
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,520
scientific methods to rebuild.

329
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
The more anxious you are,

330
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
the more you will be tired of it.

331
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,520
Mom, I want to try again.

332
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
Just this time.

333
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
No.

334
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
You must

335
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
hold on to this machine.

336
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,520
Come on.

337
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
I'll watch you go.

338
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Come on.

339
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Take it easy.

340
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
Slow down.

341
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
What's the situation?

342
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
There's a military police station ahead.

343
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,520
Everyone, pay attention.

344
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Go to the forest ahead quickly.

345
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
There's a military police station.

346
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
Go to the forest.

347
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
Go.

348
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
Go.

349
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,520
Go.

350
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
Go.

351
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
Go.

352
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,520
Go.

353
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
Go.

354
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
Go.

355
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,520
Go.

356
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,520
Go.

357
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,520
Go.

358
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Go.

359
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Go.

360
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,520
Go.

361
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Go.

362
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,520
Go.

363
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
Be careful.

364
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,520
There's a military police station ahead.

365
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Go.

366
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:06,900
Xiaoliu

367
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,920
Xingyi

368
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,860
NoGHIE Live

369
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,820
Isn't that area out of our guards?

370
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,460
NoGHIE Live

371
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:15,980
Report

372
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,620
Come in

373
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,500
Xiaogu also sneaked in the hunting field

374
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,020
oben

375
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,280
Thevers latch

376
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,580
NoGHIE Live

377
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,620
Theoshe

378
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,420
infiltrated our commanding department.

379
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,020
It's very likely that they'll execute the plan.

380
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,340
Then we'll lure them from there

381
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,020
to this position.

382
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,860
We'll eat them there.

383
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,540
Captain Wu, where are you now?

384
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,740
Today is the seventh day you set off.

385
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,100
It's your girlfriend's birthday soon.

386
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,620
Will you suddenly appear?

387
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,660
I won't.

388
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,180
Forget it.

389
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,900
As long as you're fine,

390
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,020
you can come back and celebrate your birthday.

391
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,660
Hello, Mr. Han.

392
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,260
It's your birthday soon.

393
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,900
How are you planning to celebrate it?

394
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,260
How did you know?

395
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,820
As long as I'm serious,

396
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,500
I'll definitely know.

397
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,060
Can you show me your face?

398
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,540
Let me celebrate your birthday.

399
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
Mr. Han, you're busy.

400
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,500
You won't bother me, right?

401
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,740
I've already booked a table

402
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,180
for my parents to eat at home.

403
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,140
You can invite Auntie Shuru to join us.

404
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,940
I finally managed to get someone

405
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,300
to book this restaurant.

406
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,180
I believe

407
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,140
all of you will like it.

408
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,980
It's mainly because my dad said

409
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,780
he had to cook for me at home.

410
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,940
I've bought everything.

411
00:20:59,180 --> 00:20:59,940
Next time.

412
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,580
Thank you for remembering.

413
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:03,980
Okay.

414
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,860
I won't force you.

415
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,780
Bye.

416
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,860
Bye.

417
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:08,860
Mr. Han,

418
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,980
dieser sunbeam!

419
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,860
Mr. Han.

420
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,380
How are you doing in Beijing?

421
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,140
How about you?

422
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,860
I've beenILY travelling here.

423
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,980
Ihold you.

424
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,580
Four meals a day for three persons.

425
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,700
You can relax at home.

426
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,020
There's a distant post on this island.

427
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,700
It's fostered by a distant wife.

428
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,740
More debts.

429
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,140
The 1st squad is trying to survive.

430
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,380
They may do well.

431
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,500
The first team is left.

432
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,340
The second team is right.

433
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,660
Keep moving forward.

434
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,300
Spanish.

435
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,060
We should see

436
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,580
how everything works.

437
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,540
No.

438
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,500
can be released from the red star.

439
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,380
Do you have any idea?

440
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:05,820
Captain,

441
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,420
should we avoid them or attack them?

442
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,220
Since they are discovered,

443
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,580
let's attack them.

444
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,860
We can't let them

445
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,900
hold our star.

446
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,340
Let's go to that village first.

447
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,060
Let's get ready.

448
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,060
Go.

449
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,740
The red star is found in the village.

450
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,540
It's a secret.

451
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,340
It's a secret.

452
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,100
It's a secret.

453
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,940
It's a secret.

454
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,740
It's a secret.

455
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,540
It's a secret.

456
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,340
It's a secret.

457
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,340
It's a secret.

458
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,340
It's a secret.

459
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,340
It's a secret.

460
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,340
It's a secret.

461
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,340
It's a secret.

462
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,340
It's a secret.

463
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,340
It's a secret.

464
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,340
It's a secret.

465
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,340
It's a secret.

466
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,340
It's a secret.

467
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,340
It's a secret.

468
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,340
It's a secret.

469
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,340
It's a secret.

470
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,340
It's a secret.

471
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,340
It's a secret.

472
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,340
It's a secret.

473
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,340
It's a secret.

474
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,340
It's a secret.

475
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,340
It's a secret.

476
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,340
It's a secret.

477
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,340
It's a secret.

478
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,340
It's a secret.

479
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,340
Attention, everyone.

480
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,340
According to the report,

481
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,340
a group of red stars

482
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,740
has infiltrated our camp.

483
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,340
Report to each other

484
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,340
if you find anything.

485
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,340
Team Two, you're the best.

486
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,340
Captain.

487
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,740
The south of Linxun is

488
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,940
the main search area.

489
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,340
We can't keep on fighting.

490
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,740
Do you have any information?

491
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,340
Then we'll go into the road

492
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,740
and get to the east side of the road.

493
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,740
The outskirts of the camp.

494
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,740
Report, Captain.

495
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,740
Just now, the drone

496
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,340
found a network protection in front of us.

497
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,340
And several teams

498
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,340
are searching in front of the network.

499
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,740
Attention, everyone.

500
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,140
We have to secretly cross the network.

501
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,140
Only when we let the Blue Army

502
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,140
have no way to find it,

503
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,140
we can act.

504
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,540
Zhao Guoyang, Bai Wei, Li Haiyang.

505
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,540
You go and get me

506
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
the Blue Army's equipment.

507
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,540
I'll do it for you.

508
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,540
Got it.

509
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,540
The patient is so weird.

510
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,540
Yes, I think he's so weird.

511
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,140
Beauty, you're off work.

512
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,140
Bye.

513
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,140
Let's go home.

514
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,340
Bye.

515
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,340
Bye.

516
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,340
Bye.

517
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,340
Bye.

518
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,340
Bye.

519
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,340
Bye.

520
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,340
Bye.

521
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,340
Bye.

522
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,340
Bye.

523
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,340
Bye, bye.

524
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,340
Bye.

525
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,340
Bye.

526
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,340
Bye.

527
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,340
Bye.

528
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,340
Bye.

529
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,340
Bye.

530
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,340
Bye.

531
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,340
Bye.

532
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,340
Bye.

533
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,340
This is my husband.

534
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,340
He comes to pick me up every day after work.

535
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,340
Where is your husband?

536
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,340
He can't come today.

537
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,340
I want to go back by myself.

538
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,340
Then let's send you together.

539
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,340
No, no, it's not going well.

540
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,340
It's okay.

541
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,340
The car is downstairs.

542
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,340
It's really okay.

543
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,340
I'm used to being alone.

544
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,340
Sister, you go back first.

545
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,340
See you tomorrow.

546
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,340
Then share the car's new car with me.

547
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,340
Tell me when you get home.

548
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,340
Okay, don't worry.

549
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,340
Bye.

550
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,340
Bye.

551
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,340
Bye.

552
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,340
Bye.

553
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,340
Two patrol teams

554
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,340
cross each other in 13 minutes.

555
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,340
We must walk in these three minutes.

556
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,340
Understood.

557
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,340
Ye Haiyang, Dai Wei, take action.

558
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,340
Everyone passes at once.

559
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,340
Report.

560
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,340
Come in.

561
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,340
Report, Chief.

562
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,340
The sixth patrol team has not found the enemy.

563
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,340
I know.

564
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,340
Let's go back.

565
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,340
Yes.

566
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,340
Chief, except for the team that sacrificed themselves,

567
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,340
the rest of the patrol team has not found the enemy.

568
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,340
I know.

569
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,340
Let's go back.

570
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,340
Yes.

571
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,340
Chief,

572
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,340
except for the team that sacrificed themselves,

573
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,340
the rest of the patrol team has not found the enemy.

574
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,340
Judging from the combat skills of the red team,

575
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,340
they might have sneaked into the camp.

576
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,340
Since they're here,

577
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,340
let's open the door and take a nap.

578
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,340
No, Chief.

579
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,340
The enemy knows that we sneaked in.

580
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,340
We don't need to be so careful.

581
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,340
Be careful of the trap.

582
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,340
Let's observe first.

583
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,340
Captain,

584
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,340
the outside police have not found the enemy.

585
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,340
There must be a ambush inside.

586
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,340
We don't have a chance to talk about it now.

587
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,340
Then we'll stay here for the whole night.

588
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,340
Wait for the chance.

589
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,340
Understood.

590
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,340
Chief,

591
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,340
the enemy is here.

592
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
Let's go.

593
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,340
Yes.

594
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,340
Let's go.

595
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,340
Yes.

596
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,340
Let's go.

597
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,340
Yes.

598
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,340
Let's go.

599
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,340
Yes.

600
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,340
Let's go.

601
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,340
Yes.

602
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,340
Let's go.

603
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,340
Yes.

604
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,340
Let's go.

605
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,340
Yes.

606
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,340
Let's go.

607
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,340
Yes.

608
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,340
Let's go.

609
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,340
Yes.

610
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,340
Let's go.

611
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,340
Yes.

612
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,340
Let's go.

613
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,340
Yes.

614
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,340
Let's go.

615
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,340
Yes.

616
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,340
Let's go.

617
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,340
Go.

618
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,340
Let's go back.

619
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,340
Let's leave the car here.

620
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,340
I'll drive it myself.

621
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,920
Perhaps our strategy

622
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,700
could've been rather useful to me.

623
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
No choice.

624
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,160
Letting you be dead push him.

625
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:14,980
Captain,

626
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,480
the sun has started to shine.

627
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,800
Can you save our precious time

628
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,360
since there're no traps passing by?

629
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,080
No, it's too risky.

630
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,240
Or, if we all get hurt,

631
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,120
there will be more risk if the entire team fails.

632
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,540
Captain, I'll go.

633
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,660
I'll go with Dai Wei.

634
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,580
No need.

635
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,340
I'll go with Dai Wei.

636
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,020
You stay here.

637
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,620
Captain.

638
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,340
Don't worry.

639
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,460
If we don't have a chance to attack,

640
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,420
we'll stay inside.

641
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,860
Maybe we can use it as a weapon.

642
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,900
If we really do,

643
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,740
the Blue Army won't

644
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,660
suddenly attack us.

645
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,340
Please stay here and don't take any risks.

646
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,260
Your task

647
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,500
is to watch over

648
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,420
and watch over

649
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,580
the highest commander.

650
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,060
Let's go.

651
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:49,660
Dai Wei.

652
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,220
Yes.

653
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:50,940
Hangzhou.

654
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,540
Captain, they've entered.

655
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,060
Text D過去

656
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:11,820
Go.

657
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:12,980
Go.

658
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,780

the

661
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,500
the

662
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,460
disorder

663
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,780
hostages

664
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,340
for a

665
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,780
break

666
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,660
No

667
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,360
Now we have a band

668
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,500
Here

669
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,000
What do we do tomorrow?

670
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,100
Since

671
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,780
We need another party

672
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,180
We will go with Li Yahoo

673
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,920
Does that happen304?

674
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,820
What is this?

675
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,480
Here

676
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:10,980
Hello

677
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:12,900
Did you say hi?

678
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,620
How about dinner?

679
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,820
I'm going to attend

680
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,700
Linlan's sister-in-law's military service.

681
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,340
Military service?

682
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,900
Only sister-in-law can attend?

683
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,340
What? You want to go?

684
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,900
A little.

685
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,580
It sounds more interesting than a big meal.

686
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,420
How about it?

687
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,940
Can the new sister-in-law be my guest?

688
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,460
Why not?

689
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,180
You're a good sister-in-law.

690
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,540
You don't have to be my guest.

691
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,500
You're qualified.

692
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:43,900
Okay.

693
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,220
Wait here. I'll pick you up.

694
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,540
Is it useful to keep them alive?

695
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,940
According to their tactical training,

696
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,460
even if they know that their team members are not dead,

697
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,940
they won't come to risk it.

698
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,220
Then let's use another way

699
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,140
to lure them out.

700
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,100
Send out the message.

701
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,340
Huozhuo and Hongjun are moving to Yasong.

702
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,220
Some of them are still alive.

703
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:26,940
Wendy K đến nas�큶r وث่ Easy A

704
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:39,980
Chief.

705
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,180
Using the L Anth merkiz-a knee to dig up đa vô

706
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:42,740
and bigger cm.

707
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,860
I'm sorry.

708
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,820
Hello, sisters-in-law.

709
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,580
Welcome, sisters-in-law.

710
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,060
The Yongjun Youshu

711
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,260
has always been

712
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,660
one of the most important jobs

713
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,820
in our community.

714
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,260
Today, it's also a great honor

715
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,940
to use the main venue

716
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,020
of our sister-in-law Linglan

717
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,020
to make a bridge

718
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,020
with you.

719
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,140
First of all, on behalf of our sister-in-law,

720
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,260
I would like to thank you

721
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,860
for your concern for the community leaders.

722
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,940
To be honest,

723
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,060
our sisters-in-law

724
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,420
are just normal sisters-in-law.

725
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,460
In our daily life,

726
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,020
many unexpected things happen.

727
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,900
We can't overcome them alone.

728
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,460
We help each other.

729
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,900
Now,

730
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,100
with the help of the community,

731
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,100
I think our future sister-in-law

732
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,660
will live a harmonious life.

733
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,420
A harmonious life.

734
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,300
This time,

735
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,740
we also want to respond to

736
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,860
the community leaders' call

737
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,060
to sign up for the community

738
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,580
to help the girls

739
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,620
to build bridges.

740
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,380
But I think

741
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,700
we can't just

742
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,140
let it go.

743
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,620
We can introduce this girl

744
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,660
to the community leaders.

745
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,780
We have to be responsible for it.

746
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,460
Right?

747
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,980
As the new members,

748
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,380
we will share our experience

749
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,260
with the community leaders.

750
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,260
Who will go first?

751
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,900
They two.

752
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,500
Of course they will go first.

753
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:54,820
Look at you.

754
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,260
You are so excited.

755
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,500
Let me tell you.

756
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,580
One is the new sister-in-law.

757
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,140
The other is the new sister-in-law.

758
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,740
You two talk.

759
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,820
Report.

760
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:07,900
Come in.

761
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,700
Yes.

762
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,580
There is a telegram.

763
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,180
The enemy didn't follow the military car.

764
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:12,780
I know.

765
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,300
Go.

766
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:13,820
Yes.

767
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,180
Chief.

768
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,980
It seems that they

769
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,220
are watching you

770
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,620
with all their hearts.

771
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,660
The soldiers may be thinking

772
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,060
to release all their forces

773
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,020
and catch up with them.

774
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,740
Close their mouths or yourself.

775
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,420
Get down, everyone.

776
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,020
Stop.

777
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,220
Come in.

778
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,460
Go.

779
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,260
They are outbly

780
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,380
mebankous

781
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,420
for so long.

782
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,740
Finally, they act.

783
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,740
Qin Zhengyang.

784
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:03,580
Qin Zhengyang.

785
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,300
Actually,

786
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,860
my husband and I are cool.

787
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,420
I just got divorced less than a year ago.

788
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,300
Before I got divorced,

789
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,180
my dad told me again and again

790
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,380
to think carefully.

791
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,180
I thought

792
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,940
there was nothing to think carefully.

793
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,780
I met the one I like,

794
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,940
what else should I think about?

795
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,300
But

796
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,860
I slowly reacted to it later.

797
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,980
Actually, what my dad told me was very serious.

798
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,100
Not just for myself,

799
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,020
but also for the other party.

800
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,860
After all,

801
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,700
marriage is a matter of two people.

802
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,300
We two have to be mature enough

803
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,300
to be able to run it well.

804
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,300
I respect all girls who choose soldiers.

805
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,420
But

806
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,380
if you insist on giving me a suggestion,

807
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,860
I think

808
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,260
you'd better not make such a hasty choice.

809
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,780
You have to grow up first,

810
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,900
be mature first,

811
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,300
and learn to love others independently.

812
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,460
Only then can you be responsible for yourself

813
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,620
and for marriage.

814
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,500
Good. Well said.

815
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,380
I said it's inappropriate.

816
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,460
What's inappropriate?

817
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,740
You're almost five years old.

818
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,260
You're about to be a doctor.

819
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:24,900
Let him say it.

820
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,660
Say it. Say it.

821
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,300
Come on.

822
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,380
Your dad's phone number is busy.

823
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,220
Come on.

824
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:30,940
Come on.

825
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,460
Come...

826
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,380
Hello.

827
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,140
Mother.

828
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,340
Could you say something to our family?

829
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,340
Our family?

830
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,260
What about your family?

831
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,020
I have told the president

832
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,900
to inform you to have a meeting.

833
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,380
If you think this is an appropriate situation,

834
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,340
I'd like to Cambluduung

835
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,220
get some public Shibi.

836
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,540
It was windy

837
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,660
My mom had a high fever at night

838
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,020
But the troops went out

839
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,220
The typhoon was strong

840
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,580
There is no one in the whole camp

841
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,460
No car

842
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,900
I've been standing in line since I was a kid

843
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,580
I thought about it

844
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,140
What should I do alone

845
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,060
I can only be in that family yard

846
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,980
Looking for

847
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,380
Finally, it was hard to find one

848
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,940
The kind of push car to buy food

849
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,900
I just want to push my mom to the hospital

850
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,020
But I was too young at that time

851
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,540
How do I pull it

852
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,860
How to push and how to pull

853
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,820
That car just can't move

854
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,740
I was anxious

855
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,700
Later, I finally got to the street

856
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,340
Met a patrol police officer

857
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,140
Drive a police car

858
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,260
This is what sent us to the hospital

859
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,940
In fact, this is just me and my mother

860
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,860
A very small man in life

861
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,820
I believe that all the sisters-in-law

862
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,300
In life

863
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,940
I've met a lot of them

864
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,420
But this matter

865
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,900
Leave me a very deep impression

866
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,940
Because after that

867
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,060
I knew

868
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,780
In the military wedding

869
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,860
Not only is there only sweet love

870
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,580
There will be a typhoon

871
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,780
You still have to have a car at home

872
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:08,460
Anyway, I dare not say the experience of the past

873
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,020
But with the military man

874
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,980
Feelings of love

875
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,140
I want to say

876
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,540
Go to love the military uniform

877
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,820
Also love the specific person

878
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,620
I love you

879
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,460
I love you

880
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,380
I love you

881
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,380
I love you

882
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,380
I love you

883
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,380
I love you

884
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,380
I love you

885
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,380
I love you

886
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,380
I love you

887
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,380
I love you

888
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,380
I love you

889
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,380
I love you

890
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,380
I love you

891
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,380
I love you

892
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,380
I love you

893
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,380
I love you

894
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,380
I love you

I love you

900
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,380
I love you

901
