00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Do you know Chen Chuan, the No. 1 sailor in the South China Sea?

4
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
I've heard of him.

5
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,200
He spent three hundred million yuan to get this.

6
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Do you know his background?

7
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
I'm not sure.

8
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,800
Have you ever heard of a man

9
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,600
called Mark Hatcher in English?

10
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,400
I saw his report when I was investigating Chen Chuan's relics.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,800
He's a professional treasure hunter.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,400
In 1986,

13
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,600
more than a million Chinese porcelain relics were found.

14
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,000
More than 60 cases were destroyed.

15
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,200
The remaining 23.9 million cases were auctioned in the Netherlands.

16
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,200
At that time,

17
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
the auction was attended by Chinese relics experts.

18
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,400
The auction costed 30,000 yuan.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,800
But the money couldn't buy

20
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,200
a piece of the porcelain that belongs to us Chinese.

21
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
It's a shame and a pain

22
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,200
in the history of Chinese archaeology.

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Therefore,

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
in 1987,

25
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
our country established

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,000
the underwater archaeology research center.

27
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,000
It may be a coincidence.

28
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,400
It was in the same year

29
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
that we found a porcelain ship.

30
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,200
In 1989,

31
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,800
China and Japan jointly

32
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,400
conducted an archaeological survey

33
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,800
on this ship.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,400
This can be said to be the starting point

35
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
of the underwater archaeology industry in China.

36
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,600
Then, the founder of the underwater archaeology industry,

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,800
Mr. Yu Weichao,

38
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,200
named this ship

39
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
South Sea No. 1.

40
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,600
So that's how the name South Sea No. 1 came about.

41
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Yes.

42
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
The underwater excavation technology

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,600
was very limited at that time.

44
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Therefore, from the discovery of this ship

45
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
to the whole excavation,

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,600
it took nearly 20 years.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
In August this year,

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,200
the National Bureau of Cultural and Cultural Affairs

49
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
publicly released

50
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,600
the results of the South Sea No. 1

51
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,800
protection excavation.

52
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
The total excavation

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,600
was over 180,000 pieces of cultural relics.

54
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,200
Most of them are porcelain,

55
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,800
and some are financial items.

56
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,800
According to the experts' research,

57
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,200
the number of pieces of porcelain

58
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,800
is about 1.5 million pieces.

59
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,200
The number of pieces of porcelain

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
is about 1.5 million pieces.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,400
According to the experts' calculation,

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
the number of pieces of porcelain

63
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
in the South Sea No. 1

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,800
is worth 300 billion yuan.

65
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,400
300 billion yuan?

66
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Yes.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,600
It's a lot of money.

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,400
And as time goes by,

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,200
the money will increase.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Tang Xin,

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,600
you're investigating

72
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,200
the matter of the porcelain in the South Sea.

73
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,400
Including the show

74
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,600
that you're promoting

75
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,400
the protection of the underwater cultural relics.

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,400
While раск о infinitely

77
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,900
valuable and important

78
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,500
for both the international and economic superheroes,

79
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,100
thank you, Professor Bai.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
Why are you not calling me in advance

81
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,400
in coming?

82
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,600
You said you waited for me here

83
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
whether I'm coming or not.

84
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,360
You're angry?

85
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,600
Are you angry?

86
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,720
It depends on

87
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,840
whether you can analyze it today.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,640
If you can't,

89
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,840
you're lying to me.

90
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay.

91
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,280
Then listen to me.

92
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,640
Is there any reason for me to analyze it?

93
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,320
Go ahead.

94
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,040
First, I want to analyze

95
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,360
who is the person

96
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,640
who is in your audio.

97
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
Is it a waiter

98
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,880
or a plumber?

99
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,000
Because they have the most chance to do it.

100
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,240
Why do they want to hurt me?

101
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,920
It's not them who want to hurt you.

102
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,280
Someone wants to hurt you.

103
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,640
They're just bribed.

104
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,280
And the person who bribed them

105
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,920
has mastered all your whereabouts

106
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,760
and knows where you often go.

107
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,280
Who bribed them?

108
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,080
I know.

109
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,600
Are you going to say

110
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,440
that they are not ordinary people?

111
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,680
If they are really people,

112
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,880
you should have appeared on your ship

113
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,920
and not been locked up.

114
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,600
I can't figure it out.

115
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,360
If it's really Han Changzhou,

116
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,240
why did they want to confuse me

117
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,040
instead of...

118
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,080
They just didn't think

119
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
how to deal with you.

120
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,600
And they don't want you

121
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,640
to ruin their plan.

122
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,520
So they temporarily

123
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,320
control you.

124
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,800
They want to stop me from investigating.

125
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,960
Just kill me.

126
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,280
Reporter Tang,

127
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,600
I know you have the courage and spirit

128
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,640
to be fearless.

129
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,480
But they don't want to be

130
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,080
involved in your courage.

131
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,680
What do you mean?

132
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,800
It's simple.

133
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,200
Your colleagues

134
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,800
know what you do in Luoman.

135
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,680
If you are in Luoman,

136
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,920
if you are in danger,

137
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,280
the person you investigate

138
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,480
will definitely be involved.

139
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,200
So

140
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,040
if they want to get you out of the country,

141
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,160
they must have

142
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,600
the confidence and method

143
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,600
to keep you from going back.

144
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,720
If it's really

145
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,400
done by Changzhou Group,

146
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,000
why did Han Yonghang

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,800
get caught?

148
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,160
It may be an accident.

149
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,240
But he

150
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,600
should want to save you.

151
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,000
Did I blame him?

152
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,840
Didn't he touch my computer?

153
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,480
No matter

154
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,440
how old he is,

155
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,240
he won't keep an eye on you anymore.

156
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,560
Then where did

157
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,360
his郵箱 come from?

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,400
Even if he saved me,

159
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,400
he still has food

160
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:06,840
14의

161
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,480
remains of old things.

162
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,100
Although there's a lot of

163
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,320
traces left in his body,

164
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,920
I always find that

165
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,000
he isn't the same

166
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,720
Didn ¡¯t you come out

167
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,040
with your elder brother-in-law with big knives?

168
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,200
You have failed completely.

169
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,560
I'm not lying.

170
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,040
So you aren¡¯t angry now?

171
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,640
All right.

172
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,760
Director Li,

173
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,680
you're here to check on Mengchen?

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,040
It's almost two weeks.

175
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,080
Well,

176
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,160
I heard about Yangyang's accident.

177
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,600
Is he okay now?

178
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,080
He's fine. Don't worry.

179
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,920
Your sister-in-law told me

180
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,760
that if Yangyang didn't help,

181
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,720
he would be in danger.

182
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,720
And Wang Chen's mother-in-law

183
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,880
is also behind Yangyang's work.

184
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,760
So I want to thank you.

185
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,640
Thank you.

186
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Thank you for helping my wife.

187
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,120
And thank her for helping other soldiers

188
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,800
when we were not here.

189
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,160
Zongqing,

190
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,960
I've discussed with your sister-in-law.

191
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,800
We all like the name Xi Xi.

192
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,040
If you don't object,

193
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,600
we'll use it.

194
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,800
Well,

195
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,400
I'll be her goddaughter.

196
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,880
As long as you want,

197
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,920
she'll always be your daughter.

198
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,320
Okay, go.

199
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,960
I'll wait for you here.

200
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,200
You'll go with me

201
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,360
to pick up your sister-in-law and child.

202
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,120
Yes.

203
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,240
You're so good at it.

204
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,000
Come on, Yi Nanwang.

205
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,280
Let me take a photo for you.

206
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,920
Come here.

207
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
Smile nicely.

208
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,360
Smile nicely.

209
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,920
Sister-in-law,

210
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,160
I'll pick up the Brigadier.

211
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,120
Don't go.

212
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,280
Don't just take photos.

213
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,720
Let your captain and Sister-in-law

214
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,800
take photos together.

215
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,760
Hurry up.

216
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,000
Sister-in-law, I don't want to take photos.

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,800
Go.

218
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,800
I don't want to take photos.

219
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
I don't want to take photos.

220
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
I don't want to take photos.

221
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,880
Go.

222
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,480
Hurry up.

223
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,320
Come on.

224
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,400
Wang Zhaoyang,

225
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
take photos with them.

226
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay.

227
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:44,920
Come on.

228
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,840
Can you be closer to them?

229
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,800
Closer.

230
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,000
Be intimate.

231
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,560
Be intimate.

232
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,280
Smile.

233
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,920
Okay.

234
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,160
One, two, three.

235
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,560
Eggplant.

236
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,800
You're all here.

237
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Captain.

238
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,520
Zeng Qing.

239
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,120
Sister-in-law.

240
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,080
Is Yangyang feeling better?

241
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,920
She's much better now.

242
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,640
She asked me to bring you here.

243
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,400
Okay.

244
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,920
Let her take care of herself.

245
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,240
When she's better, come home and sit down.

246
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
Yes, I'll come.

247
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,280
Uncle Wang.

248
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,080
You're here at the right time.

249
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Let's take a family photo.

250
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,680
Sister-in-law, come on.

251
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,080
Don't.

252
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,240
Let's take a photo together.

253
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,200
Okay.

254
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,920
Be careful.

255
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,800
That's right.

256
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
Look at me.

257
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,480
One, two, three.

258
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,560
Okay.

259
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,640
One more.

260
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,640
Smile.

261
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,120
One, two, three.

262
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,920
Smile.

263
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,560
Okay.

264
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,240
Ms. Tang.

265
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,760
Captain made you angry?

266
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,360
No.

267
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,160
Let me show you a video.

268
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,720
What video?

269
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,760
When we were in the care unit,

270
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,240
we had a collective birthday.

271
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,200
Captain was also one of the victims.

272
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,000
The Brigadier Special Force

273
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,400
called the family on WeChat.

274
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,720
Captain gave the phone number to Zeng Qing.

275
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,280
He recorded a video for you.

276
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,000
Tang Xin.

277
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,680
You should be sleeping in the back room.

278
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,680
We just entered the Indian Ocean.

279
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,520
Today, Captain

280
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,240
made a collective birthday for us.

281
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,320
This is the first birthday

282
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,480
I've ever had since I was with you.

283
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,680
So,

284
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,040
I have something to tell you.

285
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,240
This is the direction of Wenzhou.

286
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,240
Every morning,

287
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,160
and when the mission is over,

288
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,760
I will say good night to this direction.

289
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,160
I've been on this mission for so many years.

290
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,240
Every time I look at the end of the sea,

291
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,280
I used to think

292
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,960
of completing the mission smoothly.

293
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,320
But it's different now.

294
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,880
Now,

295
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,280
I know you're waiting for me in the distance.

296
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,560
I'm not.

297
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,760
I'm not.

298
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,400
I'm not.

299
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,200
I'm not.

300
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,920
I'm not.

301
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,800
I'm not.

302
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,360
Good night.

303
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,440
I love you.

304
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,160
I'll see you in my dream.

305
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,400
I'll get my phone.

306
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,040
I'll get my phone.

307
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,800
You're not angry anymore?

308
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,560
Who's angry?

309
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,120
Imagine this.

310
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,220
After the

311
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,640
storm,

312
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,640
you'll be attacked by the enemy.

313
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,280
The only way is to

314
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,800
get through the storm quickly.

315
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
If you're too high or too slow,

316
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
you'll get sick.

317
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Do you understand?

318
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Yes.

319
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
I'll demonstrate it now.

320
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,000
Watch me carefully.

321
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,040
Captain Wang,

322
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,600
you've had enough time

323
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,640
to train your recovery today.

324
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,040
If you keep training, you'll be overworked.

325
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,040
It'll be useful for your recovery.

326
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,440
Dr. Yang,

327
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,080
I still have my foundation.

328
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,840
You can rest assured.

329
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,320
Doctor,

330
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
I'm sorry.

331
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
I'm sorry.

332
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
I'm sorry.

333
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
I'm sorry.

334
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
I'm sorry.

335
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
I'm sorry.

336
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
I'm sorry.

337
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
I'm sorry.

338
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
I'm sorry.

339
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,800
Mr. Bai,

340
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
how do you feel today?

341
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,520
Not bad.

342
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,440
Mr. Bai,

343
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
come here.

344
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Mr. Bai,

345
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
we all hope that Captain Wang can recover soon.

346
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
But he's so impatient.

347
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,080
He'll only fail.

348
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
You persuade him.

349
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
Okay, I got it.

350
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,760
Have you really thought it over?

351
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
Yes.

352
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
But

353
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,960
I haven't told my dad yet.

354
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
Tell your dad?

355
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,200
Are you coming to our army?

356
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
No.

357
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,560
I haven't figured out

358
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,520
whether to go to the army

359
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,120
or to the ordinary hospital.

360
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,280
I want to hear your opinion.

361
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Let's have a bet.

362
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,120
If you choose the hospital outside,

363
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,800
there are not so many regulations.

364
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,520
The working environment will be relatively free.

365
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,360
The contact area will be wider.

366
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,520
But if you choose the army hospital,

367
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,640
you can wear military uniform.

368
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,760
You'll have a chance to attend the peace forum.

369
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,640
You can also see the other side of Zong Qing.

370
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,080
The other side?

371
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
For example,

372
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,040
the bone fracture,

373
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,000
ligament rupture,

374
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
slight concussion,

375
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
muscle injury,

376
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
fracture of the ankle,

377
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,440
and so on.

378
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,400
These are...

379
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,200
Zong Qing's medical records.

380
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,640
You can remember all these.

381
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,280
He usually ran away with the medicine.

382
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,960
According to his speed of

383
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,560
reporting to the medical office in three days,

384
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,480
he can't remember anyone.

385
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
I know.

386
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,080
Every time

387
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,200
he said he had a mission

388
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,440
and couldn't go home,

389
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,280
I guessed it.

390
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,240
Xiao Shang might listen to them

391
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,880
and control them.

392
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,360
If it's a big injury,

393
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,240
he won't even see his face.

394
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Yang Yang.

395
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,880
Did you hear Zong Qing

396
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,240
talking to the doctor?

397
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,040
Zong Qing can't

398
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,480
fully understand

399
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,000
your pain.

400
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,160
But I think he should

401
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,440
share the burden for you.

402
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,480
I've always wanted this to pass.

403
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,960
Not easy.

404
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,960
After Phytonis Compared To Agrinogent,

405
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,760
it's not that easy

406
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,240
but it's noticky.

407
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,000
It can also replace

408
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,400
the shape of the muscle bone.

409
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,560
How can we compare this

410
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,240
to X-raymale diamond Crocodile?

411
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,280
You think you know

412
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,160
Because I don't know

413
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,320
if our baby is a boy or a girl.

414
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,360
So I bought a neutral color dress.

415
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,720
Navy blue.

416
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,560
Cute?

417
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,680
You'll meet him at 9 o'clock around seven.

418
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,920
Get back to work.

419
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,720
No.

420
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,720
Have you been eating for a while?

421
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,060
Just ㅅ ceo!

422
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,060
抽 Thats a sign.

423
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,920
When i see you going out,

424
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,600
Midnight.

425
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,640
Since when did you go back to work after leaving the Platoon 5 status group?

426
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,280
Five years ago.

427
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,360
Was that all your company circumstances?

428
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,720
My girlfriend?

429
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,600
Was your girlfriend a soldier?

430
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,160
Right.

431
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,960
Guard of the

432
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,680
telltale fashion room's soldier.

433
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,720
He retired this year.

434
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,920
Retired this year?

435
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,560
You haven't seen each other for a long time, four-year-olds?

436
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,280
We have been together for 6 months

437
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,800
and we have never met each other.

438
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,240
I didn't stop him from hitting

439
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,080
He is a medical soldier

440
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,920
Can't dream a few mobile phones for a week

441
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,520
And our time arrangement

442
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,040
Not together

443
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,640
So even if I go this time

444
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,760
Can't see it

445
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,680
Not blame the captain

446
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,280
We called when we were in the warehouse

447
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,880
Some things

448
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,040
We can't talk

449
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,240
why

450
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,120
Get in the car first

451
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,200
look

452
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,320
a

453
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,680
Pyrom 회

454
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,360
Scared me

455
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,600
Can't walk

456
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,520
teouting

457
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,440
Yes.

458
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,760
Let me see.

459
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,000
What book can make my wife

460
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,960
so addicted to reading?

461
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,440
Professional, Secretary Lei.

462
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,760
Honey,

463
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,840
I've thought about it.

464
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,520
I want to be professional again.

465
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,760
Will you support me?

466
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,040
I won't support you in any way.

467
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,040
Come on.

468
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,240
Let me show you my resume.

469
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,440
Okay.

470
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,640
How is it?

471
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,600
Let me see.

472
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,640
Your resume

473
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,720
may not be good enough.

474
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
What are you doing?

475
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,960
Just say it.

476
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,000
I'll say it then.

477
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,360
I think your resume

478
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,760
lacks some objectivity.

479
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,520
If you interview her,

480
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,920
you'll understand.

481
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,200
Well,

482
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,920
your husband will help you to modify it.

483
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,760
You can continue to read

484
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,800
your professional resume.

485
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,600
I promise

486
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,320
you'll get the same result

487
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,960
after you finish this.

488
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,240
Thank you, Captain.

489
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:34,880
Thank you.

490
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,240
Sorry.

491
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,840
Cheng Yuan,

492
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,880
I've been a newbie for two years.

493
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,520
You can only say sorry to me

494
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,320
after two years.

495
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,640
I promise

496
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,920
I'll try to accompany you more in the future.

497
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,120
Even if I'm late,

498
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,760
it's only in December.

499
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,400
I'll be out in December.

500
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,560
Where will you go to accompany me?

501
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,160
Ke'er,

502
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,480
I really can't quit.

503
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,840
I've made up my mind

504
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,280
since the first day

505
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:36,960
I came here.

506
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,960
What about us?

507
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,120
I'm not forcing you.

508
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,640
I really want to know

509
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
what you plan

510
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,320
for our future.

511
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,200
Will we break up?

512
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,440
Or get married?

513
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,920
Do you want me to wait for you?

514
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,480
Or go with you?

515
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,040
Or forever?

516
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,520
Cheng Yuan,

517
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,400
I respect all your choices.

518
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,600
But you have to

519
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,320
give me an answer.

520
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,200
I'll go back first.

521
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,200
Next time we meet,

522
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,120
you have to answer me.

523
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,280
I...

524
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,760
I want to eat more.

525
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,720
Just a little bit,

526
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
do you sound happy?

527
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,960
Yes.

528
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,040
It's delicious!

529
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,000
Have some more too,

530
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,680
you're all thinner.

531
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:41,560
You're right.

532
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,320
So I help Yanyang

533
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,600
when you need to.

534
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
Eat as much as you want.

535
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,600
Mom, I'm not tired.

536
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,040
I'mana train and lose weight.

537
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,960
You should

538
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,500
help Yanyang.

539
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,240
Here.

540
00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:18,400
It's not good for health

541
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,800
Dad and mom

542
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,760
I have something to discuss with you

543
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,000
I can't do this anymore.

544
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,760
Zong Qing, you have to watch her.

545
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,680
Mom, look at me.

546
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,880
I'm already recovered.

547
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,400
I've thought about this decision carefully.

548
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,200
So I hope you all support me.

549
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,600
We support you.

550
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,720
I also express that

551
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,240
as long as you are healthy,

552
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,320
I will support you in everything.

553
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,240
Actually, I support you in everything.

554
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,080
You just have to take care of yourself.

555
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,000
I know, mom. Don't worry.

556
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,400
I'll pass all the votes.

557
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,040
Come on.

558
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,360
Cheers.

559
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,880
Although I had some difficulties

560
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,240
during the trip to Luo Man,

561
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,160
I'm glad I got to thank you.

562
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,920
I still want to thank you.

563
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,440
By the way,

564
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,880
after you came back from Luo Man Island,

565
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,000
have you ever thought about

566
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,600
what your identity

567
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,560
is?

568
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,480
I asked him before.

569
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,240
He never said anything.

570
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,720
He wanted to expose you,

571
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,000
but he didn't want to reveal his identity.

572
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,040
It's easy to understand.

573
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,480
But this time, it's different.

574
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,760
He can accurately grasp

575
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,000
Han Changzhou's coordinates in Luo Man Island.

576
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,440
And he can also know

577
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,880
what his hotel in Changzhou is.

578
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,400
This ordinary person

579
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,760
can't grasp it.

580
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,040
That is to say,

581
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,280
he knows everything

582
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,240
about Han Changzhou now.

583
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,960
The more he knows,

584
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,480
the greater the risk.

585
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,480
Han Changzhou and others

586
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,560
must know who he is.

587
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,480
You mean

588
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,320
they are also looking for him?

589
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,000
Only these five people

590
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,640
can get in touch with the company.

591
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,520
Who else can it be?

592
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,320
Mr. Han,

593
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,600
there's one more person.

594
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,520
Who?

595
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,120
Xu Gengshui.

596
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,800
Didn't he die long ago?

597
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,840
Yes, he did.

598
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,720
But he also knows

599
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,920
our core secrets.

600
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,840
I just remembered it all of a sudden.

601
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,320
Yes.

602
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Old Xu, Xu Gengshui.

603
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,080
It happened many years ago.

604
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,920
Is there anyone else in his family?

605
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,280
No.

606
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,640
Old Xu has no children.

607
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,240
His parents passed away long ago.

608
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,320
How about this?

609
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,000
You arrange someone

610
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,200
to sweep the tomb for his parents

611
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,480
and wash flowers.

612
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,160
After all, Old Xu

613
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
also contributed a lot to the company.

614
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,720
By the way,

615
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,000
I have something to tell you.

616
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,880
After Luo Man came back,

617
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,880
Han Yihang kept asking me to invite you

618
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,080
to dinner.

619
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,960
Did he invite me to dinner?

620
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,000
I didn't tell him.

621
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,440
He said

622
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,320
his life is saved by you.

623
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,480
You must thank him.

624
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,200
His life is not saved by me.

625
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,440
It's saved by the Chinese Navy's

626
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,680
escort team.

627
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,200
Aren't you the captain?

628
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,640
Besides,

629
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,920
he wants to ask someone else.

630
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,960
He can't find a place

631
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,080
to ask someone to help him.

632
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,440
If he says that again,

633
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,320
just tell him

634
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,600
I got the goodwill.

635
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,800
I won't eat.

636
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,440
Actually, it's nothing.

637
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
He is not a bad person.

638
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,200
I know that.

639
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,360
He is not a bad person.

640
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,880
He just doesn't like me

641
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,960
and he likes you.

642
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,120
So,

643
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,480
it's good to have a meal.

644
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,440
He can see

645
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,640
our relationship

646
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,240
and won't bother me.

647
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,960
Mr. Han.

648
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,680
Mr. Han.

649
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,320
You want to see me?

650
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,320
Sit down.

651
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,480
I've been thinking about

652
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,400
how to get close to

653
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,880
my dad and brother's computers.

654
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,360
But they are too close.

655
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,880
I can't get close to them.

656
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,480
I can't get close to them.

657
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,920
I can't get close to them.

658
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,360
I can't get close to them.

659
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,240
It's too tight.

660
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,680
I don't have a chance.

661
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,680
Let alone my phone.

662
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,520
So I asked you here today

663
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,040
to help me figure out

664
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,280
if there is any better

665
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,600
or more direct way.

666
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,560
Do you understand?

667
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,200
There must be a way.

668
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,200
But it needs a suitable chance.

669
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,040
How about this?

670
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,480
You give me this matter.

671
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,320
I'll be more convenient than you.

672
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,960
Okay.

673
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,000
Okay.

674
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,560
I've heard that there is

675
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,920
an ocean museum in Wenzhou.

676
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,360
You didn't have a chance to come here.

677
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,720
It's pretty.

678
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,600
Yes.

679
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,840
Hello.

680
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,040
May I ask

681
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,640
which exhibition hall

682
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,600
is the underwater relics?

683
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,360
Hall 3 and Hall 6.

684
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,640
Okay, thank you.

685
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,120
I've been following the underwater relics

686
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,400
for so long.

687
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,080
It's the first time I've seen

688
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,760
so many relics.

689
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,800
Yes.

690
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,800
There are many

691
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,240
that are submerged in the ocean.

692
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,600
Come on, follow me.

693
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,040
Come and have a look.

694
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,760
Come on.

695
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,800
Come on.

696
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,680
Come on.

697
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,880
Come on.

698
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,920
Come on.

699
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,880
Come on.

700
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,000
Come on.

701
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,200
Come on.

702
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,400
Come on.

703
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,680
Come on.

704
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,720
Come on.

705
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,600
Come on.

706
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,720
Come on.

707
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,600
Come on.

708
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,720
Come on.

709
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,800
These underwater relics

710
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,440
were just taken out not long ago.

711
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,960
It's said that there are clues

712
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,200
provided by the Journalist Bureau.

713
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,240
Come and have a look.

714
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,680
Come on, come and have a look.

715
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,440
This underwater relic

716
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,720
is a commercial ship

717
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,920
that has been submerged in the ocean

718
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,680
for 800 years.

719
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,240
You mean

720
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,680
when you went there,

721
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,120
someone had already sweeped the tomb

722
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,080
and picked flowers?

723
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,040
Yes.

724
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,280
You didn't find the tomb, right?

725
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,200
Mr. Han, we've confirmed that

726
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,280
it's the tombstone of Xu's parents.

727
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,800
We all know that

728
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,080
Xu and his parents

729
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,600
have no other relatives.

730
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,880
Who was the one

731
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,720
who picked the flowers?

732
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,560
Keep an eye on him

733
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,880
and see who picked the flowers.

734
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,240
Yes, Mr. Han.

735
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,720
Mr. Han,

736
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,760
Mr. Han,

737
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,920
do you think this is...

738
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,200
We'll see.

739
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,480
Are you feeling better?

740
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,320
I'm fine.

741
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,760
Actually, we should have come to see you

742
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,120
and dragged you here.

743
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,680
You mean

744
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,240
I should have visited you first.

745
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,000
The child can't leave me.

746
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,600
Mr. Wang won't let me go.

747
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,640
I'm embarrassed.

748
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,760
I'm not the only one who's embarrassed.

749
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,120
Sister-in-law,

750
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,760
I've told Zong Qing

751
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,360
not to mention this matter.

752
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,280
Let him go.

753
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,320
Yang Yang.

754
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,280
Are you feeling better?

755
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,800
I'm much better.

756
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,400
Zhao Yang,

757
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,800
take me to see my sister.

758
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,320
Okay.

759
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,320
Okay.

760
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,080
Sister-in-law, let's wash up and sleep.

761
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:13,960
Don't.

762
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,000
It's okay.

763
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,600
Xiao Xi He,

764
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,920
you should grow up

765
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,360
and be a good girl.

766
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,160
Mr. Han.

767
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,440
Mr. Wu,

768
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,280
hello.

769
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,880
I finally get to see you.

770
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,800
Mr. Han, you're too kind.

771
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,360
Please have a seat.

772
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,520
The army has rules.

773
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,560
You can't drink.

774
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,280
Not at all?

775
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,560
Mr. Wu,

776
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,360
don't misunderstand.

777
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,240
I just want to

778
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,600
give you a toast

779
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,800
to thank you for saving my life.

780
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,040
I have to tell you this.

781
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,880
I didn't save your life.

782
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,280
The China Navy's escort team saved you.

783
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,360
We received the signal.

784
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,400
We don't know who it was.

785
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,120
Yes.

786
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,360
From your point of view,

787
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,560
it's true.

788
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,920
But from my point of view,

789
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,080
you saved my life.

790
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,600
But I'm not capable

791
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,600
to invite everyone here.

792
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,520
But I have to thank you

793
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,520
for your gratitude.

794
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,520
For what?

795
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,360
Tang Xin told me

796
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,920
if you didn't save Tang Xin

797
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,840
in the island of Romance,

798
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,080
you wouldn't have been in danger.

799
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,360
Compared with what I did

800
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,880
to what you did,

801
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,480
it's not worth mentioning.

802
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,560
Well,

803
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,320
I'll drink to

804
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,520
toast to you.

805
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,480
No, no.

806
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,200
I have to toast to

807
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,720
Captain Wu.

808
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,760
Mr. Han,

809
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,040
I'll drink to you.

810
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,000
Let's toast.

811
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,640
Okay.

812
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,400
Let's drink first.

813
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,400
Sit down.

814
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,760
Mr. Han.

815
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,560
Why are you here?

816
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,360
I'm having dinner here.

817
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,800
I heard my brother

818
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,160
was here to say hello.

819
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,760
I haven't introduced myself yet.

820
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,280
I'm Han Yutian,

821
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,640
Yu Hang's brother.

822
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,360
Brother,

823
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,280
why don't you introduce yourself?

824
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,360
This is Tang Xin,

825
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,440
a reporter from the Minkwang Network.

826
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,480
Hello.

827
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,520
This is the fourth person

828
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,560
I've met in the last two days.

829
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,120
Captain Wu?

830
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,640
Nice to meet you.

831
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,200
I didn't expect to see you here.

832
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,680
Nice to meet you.

833
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,200
Father,

834
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,480
you didn't tell me

835
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,000
about this important guest.

836
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,120
Hello, reporter Tang.

837
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,000
My brother always reminds me

838
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,600
that we should drink to you

839
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,280
on the day of the festival.

840
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,000
Here.

841
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,840
Thank you for saving my brother.

842
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,280
I guess you didn't hear that

843
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,720
our army has rules.

844
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,760
We can't drink alone.

845
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,760
There's a saying,

846
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,880
a general is a general.

847
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,400
A general has his own rules.

848
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:40,760
Please.

849
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,240
Mr. Han,

850
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,720
don't be so strict.

851
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,520
I'll drink this wine

852
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,720
for my boyfriend.

853
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,840
Okay.

854
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,440
It's good.

855
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,880
Sit down.

856
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,880
My brother told me

857
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,760
that you're the captain of the Blue Team.

858
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,960
Your family must be proud

859
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,120
of you.

860
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,360
Mr. Han,

861
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,280
we're together.

862
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,480
Why do you only talk to

863
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,320
my boyfriend alone?

864
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,480
I met the savior.

865
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,400
So I talked more.

866
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,640
Is your family a soldier?

867
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,160
Almost.

868
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,520
Sorry.

869
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,280
I have to go back to the army.

870
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,240
You can eat first.

871
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,480
So fast?

872
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,440
Tang Xin,

873
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,880
call me if you need me.

874
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,200
See you.

875
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,960
Did I say something wrong?

876
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,680
The army is strict.

877
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,640
Don't mind it.

878
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,240
I understand.

879
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,360
I understand.

880
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,560
Okay.

881
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,920
There are a bunch of guests over there.

882
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,960
I'll go first.

883
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,320
Brother,

884
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,080
take care.

885
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,000
Sorry.

886
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,760
How did your brother know

887
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,640
we're having dinner here?

888
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,880
I guess he ate next door.

889
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,320
I saw it by chance.

890
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,520
Never mind.

891
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,040
Let's eat.

892
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,520
Come on.

893
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,920
Let's eat.

894
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,920
Try this.

895
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,760
It's their specialty.

896
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:37,960
Mr. Han,

897
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,200
I have a question.

898
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,760
Your family is a big enterprise.

899
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,880
How did you and your brother

900
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,560
manage to divide the business?

901
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,760
It's my dad's decision

902
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,120
to divide the business.

903
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,960
After I came back from abroad,

904
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,000
my dad

905
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,280
gave me some

906
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,040
relatively public-rights-oriented industries.

907
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,680
For example,

908
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,800
the fund,

909
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,600
the nursing home,

910
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,400
they all

911
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,760
don't care about the profit.

912
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,840
As for the core industries,

913
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,360
like the export of sea medicine,

914
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,560
the fishing,

915
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,320
and the aquaculture,

916
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,920
my dad and my brother

917
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,960
managed them all.

918
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,080
Brother.

919
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:17,640
Come in.

920
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,000
The buns that Lin Lan made for you,

921
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,040
I'll bring them to you.

922
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,400
I'll go see her.

923
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,560
I'll go with Yang Yang.

924
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,200
How is Yang Yang?

925
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,800
She told me

926
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,080
she wanted to be a doctor.

927
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,520
I think she's out of the child's world.

928
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,080
What do you think?

929
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,440
I only want her to be fine.

930
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,520
I've told myself

931
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,040
I can't let her

932
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,480
get hurt again.

933
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,720
She can do whatever she wants.

934
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,720
I'll take care of the big things.

935
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,560
I'll take care of her.

936
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,400
I'll take care of her.

937
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,400
Why are you looking at me like that?

938
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,760
I think you've changed.

939
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,320
You've become mature.

940
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,200
Do you remember our first meeting?

941
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,600
You were in the company at that time.

942
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,400
You wanted to quit.

943
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,640
But the Brigadier thought

944
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,080
you were a good person.

945
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,160
He wanted to keep you alive.

946
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,240
So I sent Cheng Yuan to fight with you.

947
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,600
I even told him

948
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,440
you were a soldier.

949
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,200
I told him to discipline you

950
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,240
and train you.

951
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,840
But you failed

952
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:43,960
in the end.

953
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,640
I was just saying.

954
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,960
Cheng Yuan didn't even call me a gun.

955
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,880
He was so reckless

956
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,080
and even got angry.

957
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,680
He even humiliated me

958
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,640
with your hands.

959
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,800
Cheng Yuan was still young at that time.

960
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,200
Now he's grown up.

961
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,880
I'm happy to see you grow up.

962
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,640
Wait a minute.

963
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,200
You're not right.

964
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,200
We're in the same age.

965
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,120
Don't take advantage of me.

966
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,640
It's been almost ten years.

967
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,440
You...

968
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,680
I...

969
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,480
Cheng Yuan...

970
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,840
Wang Chen...

971
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,640
I've known him for so long.

972
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,280
All right.

973
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,880
Don't think too much.

974
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,800
Captain Chen will definitely come back.

975
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,800
The cold snow and the cold rain

976
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,240
The bigger the world, the lonelier it gets

977
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,840
Only standing by your side

978
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:12,200
I can feel the warmth in my heart
