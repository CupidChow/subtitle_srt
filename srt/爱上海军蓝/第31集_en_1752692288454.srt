00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The will of the people always moves forward

3
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
towards the hot sun

4
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
just like you

5
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Come

6
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What did you write, dad?

7
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wife, son

8
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm still watching you

9
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm still holding you

10
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm back

11
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The Long Ballad

12
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
My song

13
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
is about you

14
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Auntie, when did you come to Wenzhou?

15
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I just came for a few days

16
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I heard that Wu Si was coming back

17
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I quickly went to his house and came back

18
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Where do you live here?

19
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If you don't mind

20
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
you can live in our house

21
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No trouble

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I can't stay here for a few days

23
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And I've settled down at the hotel

24
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't worry

25
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Have you seen Wu Si?

26
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes

27
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I happened to be there

28
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
when you called me that day

29
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Tang Xin, can I ask you

30
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
what happened between you?

31
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Auntie, in fact

32
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Wu Si proposed to me before he left

33
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He was already married

34
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I was deliberately waiting for him to come back safely

35
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I promised him

36
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But I didn't expect

37
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
everything changed after he came back

38
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He didn't do anything about the proposal

39
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and he kept hiding from me

40
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I don't know why

41
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Tang Xin

42
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Wu Si's father

43
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
died when Wu Si was very young

44
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I heard from Wu Si

45
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
His father was a navy officer

46
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and later he became a police officer

47
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He was responsible for the sea traffic

48
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He had to work for ten months

49
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I waited for him to come back

50
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and we could reunite

51
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and live together

52
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Until that day

53
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Hello

54
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Hello, son

55
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Dad, mom, come to eat

56
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Coming

57
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Dad, when will you come home?

58
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you want the game console?

59
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't want the game console

60
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I want to let dad go home

61
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Dad, when will you come home?

62
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Come, mom says

63
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Hello, Tong Shu

64
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm taking a rest today

65
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Which one do you want?

66
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'll take my son

67
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I asked for a price last time

68
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The shop in the sixth floor is 273

69
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The shop in the sixth floor is 238

70
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They are all cheap

71
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's only 35 yuan

72
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But the game card with the battery has to be sold out

73
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If the shop is sold out

74
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
the sales will be very fast

75
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It will be changed in 17 to 18 hours

76
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Dad, there are many kinds of game consoles

77
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Which one do you want?

78
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
There is a picture in the picture Liu gave me

79
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's very expensive

80
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's not easy to make

81
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I ran back at the beginning

82
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You ask people

83
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay, I see

84
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Daughter-in-law

85
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm so busy with you and my son

86
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I want to go home

87
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I want to go home and see you

88
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Give me the phone

89
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Ok

90
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Son, the sun is very good today

91
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I want to sleep for a while

92
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Tell dad

93
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Good night, dad

94
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Brother Tong

95
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Brother Tong

96
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Before being a spy

97
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We agreed to use the game console as a code

98
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
If he calls back

99
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Say buy a game console for your son

100
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He will be very angry

101
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He will be very angry

102
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If he calls back

103
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It means he exposed

104
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That was the last call he made

105
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Take the route of Liu Bujiao and Lu Zhangjiao

106
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Five degrees

107
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Reversing speed 17,8

108
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Inform old Liu

109
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Sea police are pursuing the wrong direction

110
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I will call the police right away

111
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But the police rushed over

112
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's too late

113
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Tang Xin

114
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The change before and after the five-time play

115
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I think it may be because

116
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We have experienced so much in these years

117
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Related

118
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This play

119
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He may have experienced

120
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The danger and sacrifice we don't know

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So he changed

122
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Aunt is thinking

123
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
He is afraid

124
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He is afraid that one day

125
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Will not come back like his father

126
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He is afraid

127
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Your future life

128
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Will become like me

129
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Captain

130
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's me

131
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Call from the police

132
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Zongqing's matter

133
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Bring it over tonight

134
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yes

135
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The reason I said this today

136
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I just want

137
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I just want to remind you

138
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Before you choose to marry a soldier

139
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
A lot of things

140
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You have to think about it

141
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Aunt

142
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Then I want to ask you a question

143
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
If I want to marry Wu Si

144
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Do you agree

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
As Junsao

146
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I do not agree

147
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Because of one more objection

148
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You will have one more

149
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Think carefully

150
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But as Wu Si's mother

151
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I will not agree

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I bless you

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Thank you

154
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The captain

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
All right

156
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Captain

157
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Prepare to go back

158
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Prepare to go back

159
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The former sniper training

160
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
All members were trained

161
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's your turn this year

162
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But captain

163
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The results are not out yet

164
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No need to wait for the test results

165
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You are fine

166
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Nothing

167
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
How can it be fine

168
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,520
I'm not a person

169
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,920
who likes to take care of myself.

170
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,440
I understand.

171
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,360
Get ready to go back.

172
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,680
Manager Xu,

173
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,960
you scared me.

174
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,280
Fan Yang,

175
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,320
you were not like this before, right?

176
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
I think Yang Yang

177
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,680
is really not afraid.

178
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,880
How can I not be afraid?

179
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,640
I don't want you to be too nervous.

180
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,600
You're so scared.

181
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,720
If I'm scared,

182
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,080
aren't you more worried?

183
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,480
Okay.

184
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,680
Now everything is over.

185
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,840
Honey.

186
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,120
I want another child.

187
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,240
I also want another baby.

188
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,320
But

189
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,840
I've thought about it seriously.

190
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,280
I want to be a mother

191
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,880
when I'm more prepared.

192
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,120
I don't want to be

193
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,360
wronged like before.

194
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,280
I want to grow up

195
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,840
and be independent.

196
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,680

It's me.

290
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,640
Qiu Xiaoshu, you've been here several times.

291
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,320
You finally came in.

292
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,280
Are you going to be discharged?

293
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,200
I'll take you home.

294
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,600
I won't come back.

295
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,840
I'm sorry.

296
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,400
Don't say sorry to me.

297
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,440
That day,

298
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,320
when you came with Brigadier,

299
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,320
I said it had nothing to do with you.

300
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,840
Brigadier also said

301
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,440
I had given him the best gun.

302
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,280
This gun is the best.

303
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,040
But it's not the best.

304
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,400
The best sniper

305
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,760
in our company

306
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,560
is Yinan Wang.

307
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,320
He'll be better than me in the future.

308
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,360
It's okay.

309
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,040
Not being a sniper,

310
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,400
Yinan is the best soldier.

311
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,600
You don't have to blame yourself.

312
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,640
I don't regret it.

313
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,400
Even if I have to do it again,

314
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,840
I'll still go for it.

315
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,520
Even if I can't see

316
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,400
my eyes in the future,

317
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,960
don't worry, I'll live well.

318
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,280
You know,

319
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,800
Ke'er is waiting for me.

320
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,120
I'm not afraid of anything.

321
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,960
I'm not afraid of anything.

322
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,840
I'm not afraid of anything.

323
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,240
I've been

324
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,560
pretty bad to him these years.

325
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,560
Now he's retiring.

326
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,000
I want to send him home myself.

327
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,720
My ability will get worse.

328
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,720
I want to spend time with him

329
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,000
just like an ordinary boyfriend

330
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,880
while I can still see him.

331
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,920
Can't you let me see you guys

332
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,840

333
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,360
That's right.

334
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,320
Rule.

335
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,300
The imperial guards

336
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,520
are in the

337
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,000
lead act.

338
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,200
The officer who killed wearing thecomings

339
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,020
was not a suspect when performing the forceful task.

340
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,920
Talk.

341
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,480
Other police officers

342
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,140

343
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,020
Thanks.

344
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,060
Time to go.

00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,440
I said I wouldn't cry.

360
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,320
Why are you crying?

361
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,040
Okay, okay, okay.

362
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,560
You're the youngest gunman now.

Hu Si!

391
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,080
Yes.

392
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,600
Give them their names and histoire names!

393
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,560
Yes.

394
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,240
Zhou Yuxuan!

395
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,880
Yes

396
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,360
Bai Gengming

397
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,120
Yes

398
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,040
Zong Qing

399
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,600
Yes

400
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,440
Wang Chen

401
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:40,960
Yes

402
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,880
Members

403
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,760
Yes

404
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,520
Members

405
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,720
Yes

406
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,280
Slow down, don't choke

407
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,960
You don't have time to eat usually

408
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,920
I have to change shifts

409
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,680
Slow down

410
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,440
You are in a hurry to change shifts

411
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,960
You have to eat well

412
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,200
How about mom

413
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
Make the meal tomorrow

414
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,240
I'll send it back to you

415
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,200
Don't don't

416
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,360
Bad impression

417
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,240
What's the bad impression

418
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
Not the army

419
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,920
What is the bad impression

420
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,520
dad

421
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,360
My mom is coming to see me

422
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
You take care of her

423
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,760
That's bad influence

424
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,520
Open a small warehouse to engage in special

425
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,360
What is this

426
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,920
I can't afford you two

427
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,400
A pair of working soldiers

428
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,080
Eat it

429
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,440
Zong Qing is going out for a few days

430
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,960
Did you contact the emergency training?

431
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,960
I know

432
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,120
He told me

433
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,560
I don't ask much about his business now

434
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,920
I just have to be responsible for waiting for him to come back

435
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,120
I don't eat, mom

436
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,160
Go to work

437
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,760
You still have a bite

438
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,640
Eat and go

439
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,240
Eat

440
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,680
dad

441
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,080
gone

442
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,560
You have to eat well if you are busy

443
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,640
Body

444
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,600
This is the foundation of revolution

445
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,840
Thank you for your concern

446
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,160
Mr. Han

447
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,680
You entrusted me with something

448
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,960
I'm serious about your attention

449
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,360
Your father and brother are still in Luo Man

450
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,120
The scope of activity is not only the Asst. Hotel

451
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,720
It's also the Atoka Company

452
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,240
Mr. Lin

453
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,000
Then did you find out

454
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,800
Some special places

455
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,640
There is a foreigner

456
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,120
Often meet at the hotel

457
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,840
This person is called William

458
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,320
I asked a friend to help check it

459
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,640
He is a cultural relic search group investor

460
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,440
International wanted criminal

461
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,280
You are too much, Zong Qing

462
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,240
Say you want to invite me to dinner

463
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,080
Just eat this

464
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,200
Okay, you say it

465
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,520
Know you have something to say

466
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,000
It's not a new sister

467
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,560
This emergency training

468
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,360
Captain don't go

469
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,280
He is still in Liao Yang

470
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,240
That's his business

471
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,320
You don't have to tell me

472
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,400
New sister

473
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,480
Give the captain another chance

474
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,160
It's not that I don't give him a chance

475
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,840
He is about to give up me now

476
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,760
I'm still here

477
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,120
Foolishly fantasizing about his future

478
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,240
In his future plan

479
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,280
I'm not in it at all

480
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,680
What does it look

481
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,240
What's this

482
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,400
The captain wrote

483
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,480
Written by you

484
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,480
Tang Xin

485
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,480
If you read this letter,

486
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,480
you might receive a bad news at the same time.

487
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,480
Sorry.

488
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,480
I'll leave now.

489
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
This life is not long.

490
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
But I've been through it seriously.

491
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,480
I don't regret entering the army.

492
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,480
I don't regret meeting you.

493
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
I've finished the battle I should have.

494
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,480
I've kept the faith I should have.

495
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,480
I've loved the person I love.

496
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
I've been through it.

497
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,480
I've never been defeated.

498
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,480
When you miss me,

499
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,480
I'll come back to see you from the battlefield.

500
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,480
Love is pure.

501
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,480
Love is sincere.

502
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
Never stop.

503
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
Jingli.

504
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,480
What's this?

505
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
A military tradition.

506
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,480
When we're doing some special missions,

507
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
we'll write a resolution.

508
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
And...

509
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
It's written for Zhiqi's family.

510
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,480
If we get the mission back,

511
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
the letter will be returned to us.

512
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
If we can't get the mission back,

513
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,480
we'll send it to Jiaxu with the news of the battle.

514
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
Xiyi.

515
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,480
Captain.

516
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
The letter he wrote to Aidan

517
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,480
hasn't changed much.

518
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,480
But since he was with you,

519
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
he wanted to add you to the letter.

520
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
Actually,

521
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,480
he had made the worst plan

522
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
to say goodbye to you.

523
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,480
He told us

524
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,480
if he sacrificed himself,

525
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
he would give you the latest letter.

526
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Which letter is this?

527
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
You can draw it for me.

528
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Xin.

529
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,480
Actually, captain

530
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,480
always makes it look like

531
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,480
he wants to see you for the last time.

532
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
He can't finish his sentence.

533
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
So the letter he wrote

534
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,480
is getting longer and longer.

535
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
It's like he wrote the first letter

536
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,480
but didn't get the next one.

537
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Let's criticize him together.

538
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Captain, this is not the end of the world.

539
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
Why do you write like this?

540
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,480
You...

541
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,480
Actually, you'll know when you see it.

542
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
You...

543
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,480
See for yourself.

544
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
In this,

545
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
there's a future

546
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,480
that he can't complete.

547
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,480
His and your future.

548
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,480
Xin.

549
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
I want to correct you with this.

550
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,480
Actually, for captain,

551
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,480
you are part of his future.

552
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,480
He doesn't believe you.

553
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
He doesn't believe in himself.

554
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,480
To be honest,

555
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,480
for us,

556
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
we are professionals,

557
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
it's very important

558
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
to find a sense of security

559
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
in front of the one we love.

560
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,480
It's not love.

561
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,480
It's a test of humanity.

562
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
Marrying someone like you

563
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
is not like getting married.

564
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,480
It's an extreme challenge.

565
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,480
Since it's an extreme challenge,

566
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
right, Xin?

567
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
Then you and captain

568
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
will play this game.

569
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
I'll go to the hospital.

570
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
I'll go to the hospital.

571
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,480
I'll go to the hospital.

572
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
Xin.

573
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,480
Honey.

574
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
You must eat well

575
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
at home this time.

576
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
I've put the fridge

577
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,480
in the dish you like most.

578
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,480
When you cook it,

579
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
Honey,

580
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,480
this time when you come back,

581
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,480
let's move.

582
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,480
I don't want to live here.

583
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,360
Okay, I'll go back..

584
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,880
You cooked the same thing here.

585
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,640
You don't want to do it anymore.

586
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,000
It's all memories of our break-up.

587
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,440
We've never stuck together

588
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,560
here for so long.

589
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,600
You want to go home or leave?

590
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,440
You said that you would let me be home.

591
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,600
But now that I'm busy with work now,

592
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
I don't like this place.

593
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Honey,

594
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
don't always think about bad things.

595
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Think about the time when we were together.

596
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
Right?

597
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Look,

598
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,600
we played games together,

599
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
cooked together.

600
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
You were also fried, right?

601
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
And we hugged and slept together.

602
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
How happy you are!

603
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,600
But you are leaving again this time.

604
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,600
I don't want to stay here alone.

605
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
I'm so tired.

606
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
If you don't want to,

607
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
you can move in with me.

608
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,600
I promise I'll be back soon.

609
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
When I'm back,

610
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
we can move wherever you want.

611
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
I'll help you with the arrangement.

612
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,600
Okay?

613
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,600
No.

614
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
See you.

615
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
Be careful.

616
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
Okay.

617
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
I've taken the kids away.

618
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,600
Think about your own business.

619
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
What's my business?

620
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
Don't pretend to be stupid.

621
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Yangyang told me

622
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
to wait for you and Xin's wedding.

623
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
Work hard.

624
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Okay.

625
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Let's go.

626
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
All the tasks

627
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
must be done in a stable way.

628
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
Do you understand?

629
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Yes.

630
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
No need to send me to eat.

631
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
Come on.

632
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,600
You can do it, Captain Chen.

633
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Fang Yuan.

634
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,600
I'll take care of her.

635
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
You have to train well

636
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
before you have a snack.

637
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
Yes.

638
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Aren't we breaking up?

639
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Come out and meet me.

640
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
I'll agree if you make it clear.

641
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Wait.

642
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
I'm leaving, Captain Chen.

643
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
Bye.

644
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Go.

645
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Ke'er.

646
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
Cheng Yuan, you're here.

647
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Why did you ask me to meet here?

648
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
Where is this?

649
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Park.

650
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,600
I finally caught up with your vacation.

651
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,600
I also retired.

652
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,600
We finally have time together.

653
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Yes.

654
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,600
It's rare.

655
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
Where do you want to go today?

656
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,600
I'll accompany you.

657
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,600
I've been in this city for a year and two years.

658
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
It can be said that

659
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
I'm familiar with this city

660
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,600
and unfamiliar with it.

661
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
We never have time

662
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
to walk around together.

663
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
I want to say goodbye to Wen Zhou

664
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,600
before I leave.

665
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
How?

666
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
Hello, sir.

667
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Are you Mr. Wu Si?

668
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Yes.

669
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,600
The blue sky is blue.

670
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,600
My heart is so cold.

671
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,600
I miss you.

672
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Is it beautiful?

673
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
It's beautiful.

674
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Sometimes, I want to tell you

675
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
that I'm sorry.

676
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
I'm sorry.

677
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
I'm sorry.

678
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,600
I'm sorry.

679
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
I'm sorry.

680
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
I'm sorry.

681
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,600
I'm sorry.

682
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,600
I'm sorry.

683
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
I'm sorry.

684
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
I miss you.

685
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600
I miss you every day.

686
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
If you miss me,

687
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,600
why do you want to break up with me?

688
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
Can you

689
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
miss me too?

690
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,600
You've been avoiding me.

691
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,600
Are you happy?

692
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,600
You're always cold to me.

693
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,600
I'm happy.

694
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,600
I'm sorry.

695
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,600
I read the will you wrote.

696
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,600
I read it as a love letter.

697
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,600
Don't write it.

698
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Is there anything you want to say?

699
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,600
Don't write a real love letter to me.

700
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,600
I want to tell you my heart.

701
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,600
Thank you for being with me.

702
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,600
The cold snow is getting colder.

703
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,600
The more time passes, the colder it gets.

704
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,600
Only when you're by my side.

705
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,600
I'm so hungry.

706
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,600
I haven't eaten anything.

707
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,600
I want to wear this wedding dress.

708
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,600
I'll send you a wedding dress.

709
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,600
I'll send it to you.

710
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,600
You promised me when you left.

711
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,600
Now you're back.

712
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,600
I can't keep my promise.

713
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,600
I'm sorry.

714
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,600
I'm sorry.

715
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,600
I'm sorry.

716
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,600
I'm sorry.

717
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,600
I'm sorry.

718
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,600
I'm sorry.

719
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,600
I'm sorry.

720
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,600
I'm sorry.

721
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,600
I'm sorry.

722
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,600
I'm sorry.

723
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,600
I'm sorry.

724
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,600
I'm sorry.

725
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,600
I'm sorry.

726
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,600
I'm sorry.

727
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,600
I'm sorry.

728
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,600
I'm sorry.

729
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,600
I'm sorry.

730
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,600
I'm sorry.
