1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,960
The lessife

2
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,680
Episode 22

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's talk.

4
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,480
You said you didn't want to get involved in business.

5
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,080
It's actually very many things to worry about.

6
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,120
This is also the reason why

7
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,920
Lan Tian was so 느낔utant at the time.

8
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,800
Chief Han,

9
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,680
I have a good news.

10
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,600
What was that?

11
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,760
Is that true?

12
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,560
This coincidence

13
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,640
is really going to be a huge success.

14
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,400
Nothing else.

15
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,920
Then follow her.

16
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,880
See where she lives.

17
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,240
And what kind of people she has.

18
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,400
Don't lose her.

19
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,720
Okay, Mr. Han.

20
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,440
I didn't expect

21
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,400
you would ask me out for coffee.

22
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,200
I'm really a little shocked.

23
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,640
I'm sorry, Mr. Han.

24
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,640
I do have a few questions

25
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,560
for you.

26
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,800
Go ahead.

27
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,160
Here's the thing.

28
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,600
Last time I was kidnapped

29
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,800
in Luoman,

30
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,320
you said you thought it was a human crime.

31
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,960
But there's a question

32
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,000
I've never thought of.

33
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,520
What is it?

34
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,080
What is it?

35
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,760
What is it?

36
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,320
What is it?

37
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,960
What is it?

38
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,560
What is it?

39
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,240
What is it?

40
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,920
What is it?

41
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,200
I've never thought of that.

42
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,160
If it's really a human crime,

43
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,480
why didn't they

44
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,920
send us directly

45
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,880
to the ship after they kidnapped us?

46
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,080
Instead, they locked us up

47
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,960
in a place.

48
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,480
Maybe they want to

49
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,840
catch a few more people

50
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,440
and send them to the ship together.

51
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,560
One more question.

52
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,520
I saw the waitress

53
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,040
with my own eyes

54
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,480
picking up the old cup

55
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,520
from the bartender's hand

56
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,960
and sending it to my desk.

57
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,920
It's said that the human criminal

58
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,800
didn't do anything wrong.

59
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
Could it be that

60
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,280
the bartender and the waitress

61
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,200
were bribed

62
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,120
in advance?

63
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,040
It's quite common

64
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,760
to see such a joint crime

65
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,960
in foreign countries.

66
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,720
The waitress and the bartender

67
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,560
were probably bribed.

68
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,480
But they shouldn't be human criminals.

69
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,000
Because the person who bribed them

70
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,120
knew my whereabouts clearly

71
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,240
and knew that I often

72
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,320
went to that coffee shop.

73
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,640
So it's definitely not

74
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,600
a random kidnapping.

75
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,200
So you mean

76
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,960
there's a third way?

77
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,200
In such a sensitive time

78
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
and a sensitive place,

79
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,840
I'm very sad.

80
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,720
I think it's a good

81
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,200
and well-planned kidnapping.

82
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,280
I understand your feelings

83
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,560
and the logic you're talking about.

84
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,440
But the evidence we have

85
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,800
at present

86
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,800
can't prove

87
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,880
that it's not a coincidence.

88
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,680
Right?

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Besides,

90
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,600
if they just want you

91
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,920
to shut up,

92
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,120
they can take more

93
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,640
and more direct measures.

94
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,120
There's no need to play such tricks.

95
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,080
I think the reason

96
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,320
they didn't use a more direct method

97
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,840
is that they were afraid of hugging themselves.

98
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,040
But they want me to stay abroad

99
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,880
and stay abroad forever.

100
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,920
Wu Si analyzed it for you.

101
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,840
Do you think he's right?

102
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,120
Hello.

103
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,760
How is it?

104
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,960
Mr. Han, we found his house.

105
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,160
Where is it?

106
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,200
It should be called Hongya Village.

107
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,840
There are few houses.

108
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,000
It feels like it's going to be abandoned.

109
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,000
Hongya Village?

110
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,000
Yes.

111
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,600
What should we do next?

112
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,760
Go to his house and control him.

113
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,240
Then find his ID card

114
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,880
and see who he is.

115
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,680
Okay, Mr. Han.

116
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,160
Hello.

117
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,720
Call a few people to come to Hongya Village.

118
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,080
If we start from

119
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,680
a logical analysis,

120
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,080
it's possible.

121
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,000
But I have to say

122
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,560
that the evidence we have

123
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,720
can't prove

124
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,560
that it's not a coincidence.

125
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,640
But anyway,

126
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,120
it's all because

127
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,640
you investigated the cultural relics.

128
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,520
So I think you should

129
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,800
give me the information

130
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,000
and I'll help you.

131
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,920
I'll help you find out the truth.

132
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,920
Okay?

133
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,840
What can you do

134
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,320
if you know the truth?

135
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,040
Can you

136
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,920
kill the aunt and the relative?

137
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,320
I can't

138
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,160
kill the aunt and the relative.

139
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,400
But if there's enough evidence

140
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,800
to prove that the cultural relics

141
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,080
were planted by my dad and my brother,

142
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,920
I have my way

143
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,440
to stop them.

144
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,440
What way?

145
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,280
You'll know it then.

146
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,080
If you really want to investigate,

147
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,640
you really

148
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,080
have more experience than me.

149
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,400
Yes.

150
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:50,360
The origin of the

151
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,720
plant

152
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,920
I'm fine!

153
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,760
Some of you

154
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,520
stand here looking for one of others.

155
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,800
Who is that?

156
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,800
The person we found cannot be there.

157
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,100
The

158
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,680
who is here is someone

159
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,760
you shady person

160
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,380
had to tell.

161
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,680
Thank you.

162
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,880
Stay here and be brave.

163
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,400
That is not possible.

164
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,360
Mr. Jin,

165
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,480
seem like

166
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,580
she really does not have the bad hand.

167
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,780
Then why did you go to the tomb of Xu Gengshui's parents?

168
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,020
This is...

169
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,340
They are my uncle and aunt.

170
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,060
I haven't been there for many years.

171
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,660
I've only been there once.

172
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,220
What's the matter?

173
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,140
What's your computer password?

174
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,900
What computer password?

175
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,620
Ouch!

176
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,900
Brother,

177
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,180
you should have said something.

178
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,660
Why did you hit me?

179
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,100
Fine.

180
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,180
I'll say it.

181
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,820
I'll say it, okay?

182
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,700
This computer...

183
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,900
I stole it.

184
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,740
Ouch!

185
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,620
Ouch!

186
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,540
What's your email password?

187
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,820
I don't have an email.

188
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,980
Ouch!

189
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:46,900
Ouch!

190
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,620
Mr. Han,

191
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,220
here are the list of the first batch and the second batch.

192
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,180
Please have a look.

193
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,140
Hello.

194
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,380
How is it going?

195
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,540
Mr. Han,

196
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,100
we've checked the ID card.

197
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,780
This is Wei Jiangnan.

198
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,740
We've checked the computer email.

199
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,940
There is a record of him and Tang Xin.

200
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,300
We can confirm that

201
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,020
this is the clue that this guy

202
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,020
sent to Tang Xin.

203
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,260
Wei Jiangnan?

204
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,940
Does our company have such a person?

205
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,580
I don't remember.

206
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,420
I've never heard of him.

207
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,620
I'll check it.

208
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,900
Keep digging.

209
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,900
Dig this thing out.

210
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,940
So you know.

211
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,020
And do your research.

212
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,780
Doctor.

213
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,140
I must wait for his return fromони.

214
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,660
He must major in department 2.

215
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,020
I'll see him tomorrow at the station.

216
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,300
Right.

217
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,660
Everything goes well.

218
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,060
I'm going to work soon.

219
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,700
So,

220
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
I'm going to

221
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,900
get the hospital

222
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,020
for Linlan.

223
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,780
I'll start from the hospital,

224
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
and then I'll go to the anesthesia department.

225
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,500
I heard that the anesthesia department is very tired.

226
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,580
The people in the anesthesia department are too nervous.

227
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,420
If I were alone,

228
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,740
I would be able to

229
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,580
get up

230
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,580
when I meet the emergency of Linlan.

231
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,220
Why are you looking at me like that?

232
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,060
I'm not.

233
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,420
Why do you suddenly feel like you've grown up?

234
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,340
I also asked Sister Qiu Xiao's suggestion.

235
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,140
She said

236
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,020
there is no doctor in the hospital.

237
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,860
As long as you can cure and save people,

238
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,860
it's worth going.

239
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,700
Mr. Pan,

240
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,380
I checked it again.

241
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,180
There is no such person as Wei Jiangnan in the office.

242
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,980
Then let's not care

243
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,980
who Wei Jiangnan is.

244
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,900
We can now

245
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,300
be sure

246
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,340
that Wei Jiangnan

247
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,060
is the person who provided the clue to Tang Xin.

248
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,580
From the emails from their network,

249
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,700
Tang Xin knows too much.

250
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,380
We have to meet and talk.

251
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,100
Use Wei Jiangnan's mailbox

252
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,180
to send Tang Xin an email.

253
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,220
Tell her that there is new evidence now.

254
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,100
We have to meet and talk.

255
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,740
Then transfer Tang Xin

256
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,580
to Wei Jiangnan's house.

257
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,020
And then?

258
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,540
Control her.

259
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,020
I want to talk to her in person.

260
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,340
You can look at this picture.

261
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,180
This is the East China Sea route,

262
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,220
also known as

263
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,940
the Silk Road in the East China Sea.

264
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,380
Let's turn over to the next picture.

265
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,660
This picture

266
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,740
is the Silk Road in the South China Sea,

267
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,100
also known as the South China Sea route.

268
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,900
You can see it clearly.

269
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,020
Its starting point

270
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,660
is in Guangzhou and Quanzhou.

271
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,980
Then it is

272
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,020
through the

273
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,620
Pearls of the South China Sea

274
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,260
and the Southeastern Peninsula of China,

275
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,020
through the Indian Ocean

276
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,340
and into the Red Sea,

277
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,780
reaching the East Africa and Africa,

278
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,780
and through more than a hundred countries and regions.

279
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,660
It can be said that it is an important sea passage

280
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,260
for our country and foreign trade

281
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,660
and cultural exchanges.

282
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,140
Mr. Bai,

283
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,100
I'm sorry to interrupt.

284
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,500
My reporter asked me to meet

285
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,940
and said that he had important information for me.

286
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,660
Do you want me to go with you?

287
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,460
No.

288
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,780
I'm afraid that a stranger's words

289
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,780
will cause him to misunderstand.

290
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,140
Then you have to be careful.

291
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,020
Be sure to be safe.

292
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:46,940
Okay.

293
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,700
Wu Si,

294
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,140
the reporter asked me to meet

295
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,540
and I just got off the building.

296
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,580
Are you free?

297
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,540
Do you want me to take you there?

298
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,260
Hurry up.

299
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,100
Hurry up.

300
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,900
Speed up.

301
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,740
Hurry up.

302
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,940
Hurry up.

303
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,260
Run. Run.

304
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,980
Speed up.

305
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,420
Wu Si,

306
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,620
the reporter asked me to meet

307
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,340
and said that a stranger's words will cause him to misunderstand.

308
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:04,940
Hurry up.

309
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,780
Hurry up.

310
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,340
Run.

311
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,140
Hurry up.

312
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,940
Run.

313
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,700
Hurry up.

314
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,340
Run.

315
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,180
Hurry up.

316
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:10,940
Run.

317
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,740
Hurry up.

318
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,300
Run.

319
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,220
Hurry up.

320
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,020
Run.

321
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,940
Hurry up.

322
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,780
Run.

323
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,660
Hurry up.

324
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,620
Hurry up.

325
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,620
Hurry up.

326
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,620
Hurry up.

327
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,620
Hurry up.

328
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,620
Hurry up.

329
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,620
Hurry up.

330
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,620
Hurry up.

331
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,620
Hurry up.

332
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,620
Hurry up.

333
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,620
Hurry up.

334
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,620
Hurry up.

335
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,620
Hurry up.

336
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,620
Hurry up.

337
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,620
Hurry up.

338
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
Hurry up.

339
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,220
Hurry up.

340
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,300
Hurry up.

341
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,980
Veiled.

342
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,660
Stop.

343
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,940
The road ahead is not wide.

344
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,700
To the two road bend.

345
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,300
That's the way.

346
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,980
She started talking.

347
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:03,940
You say that too.

348
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,340
Get down!

349
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,780
Stop right there!

350
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:26,060
This foot

351
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,380
I come to in a village.

352
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,540
But it seems that I'm wrong.

353
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,060
Forget about it now.

354
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,620
fixed

355
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,440
Director Han

356
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,360
We've tons of fans.

357
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,800
Director Han

358
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,040
Really

359
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,440
what

360
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,100
You're looking at it yourself

361
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,620
I checked again.

362
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,540
There is no one like Wei Jiangnan in the company.

363
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,220
Then let's not care who this Wei Jiangnan is.

364
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,460
From the emails he sent,

365
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,580
Tang Xin knows too much.

366
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,620
I have to talk to him in person.

367
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,340
You send an email to Tang Xin

368
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,380
with Wei Jiangnan's email.

369
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,420
Just say that

370
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,580
there is a new clue now.

371
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,380
We have to meet to talk.

372
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,540
Then transfer Tang Xin

373
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,380
to Wei Jiangnan's house.

374
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,700
Then

375
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,700
control her.

376
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:55,900
Hello.

377
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,020
I want to call the police.

378
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,180
Are you okay?

379
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,220
Yes.

380
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,220
I'm fine, thanks.

381
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,500
I didn't see that the police were investigating.

382
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,860
I think they have a place over there.

383
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,300
Then

384
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,460
send out the clue.

385
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,980
Prepare to 팽 it.

386
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,740
Don't worry.

387
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,580
I know what's gonna happen.

388
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,060
It's just a little time.

389
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,380
Is it good?

390
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,060
They are all piloted.

391
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,260
You can see my house through a narrow path.

392
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,620
Come out!

393
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,380
Stop!

394
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,700
Don't run!

395
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Stop!

396
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,620
Stop!

397
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,700
Stop!

398
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,820
Stop!

399
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,860
Stop!

400
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,060
I'll tell you.

401
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,140
Today's mission is to save the hostage and the reporter.

402
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Got it?

403
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Let's go.

404
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,660
Stop!

405
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,660
Stop!

406
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,660
The police are here! Run!

407
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
Follow me.

408
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,060
Yes.

409
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,060
Where are they?

410
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,780
Stop!

411
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,300
Stop!

412
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,460
Don't run!

413
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,980
Stop!

414
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,980
Stop!

415
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,980
Stop!

416
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,980
Stop!

417
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,980
Stop!

418
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,980
Stop!

419
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,980
Stop!

420
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,980
Stop!

421
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
Stop!

422
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,980
Stop!

423
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,980
Stop!

424
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,620
We're the police.

425
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,620
You're the man in the disguise.

426
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,020
Let's go.

427
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,020
Thank you.

428
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,020
Thank you.

429
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,020
You're safe.

430
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,980
Thank you.

431
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,420
Hello?

432
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,420
Tang Xin.

433
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,420
Did you see him?

434
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,100
Where are you now?

435
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,300
I saw him.

436
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,300
But I'm in the hospital with a glorious stomachache.

437
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
You're hurt?

438
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,980
Is it serious?

439
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,300
I'm fine.

440
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,900
I've taken care of it.

441
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,700
Mr. Huang, come in.

442
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,620
What's the rush?

443
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,660
I want to take a leave.

444
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,660
You?

445
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,660
Why?

446
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,660
Tang Xin is in the hospital.

447
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,660
I need to see her.

448
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,660
What's the matter?

449
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,660
It's about work.

450
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,660
I didn't get a call when I was training.

451
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,660
She said she was in the hospital when I went back.

452
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,660
Don't worry.

453
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,660
Go to the hospital first.

454
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,660
Li Jun, I'll give you a few days off.

455
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,660
You're hurt.

456
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,660
You should go to the hospital for a physical examination.

457
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,660
And you can stay with Tang Xin.

458
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,700
Thank you, sir.

459
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,700
Mr. Huang, you...

460
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,700
I...

461
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,700
Tang Yutian.

462
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,700
I've warned you many times.

463
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
Don't touch Tang Xin.

464
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,700
You have to force me to break my face with you.

465
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,740
You want to force me to break your face with you, right?

466
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,740
You're here for your beloved female reporter again.

467
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,740
I'm making trouble, right?

468
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,740
You're really not afraid of me

469
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,740
to tell you about the dirty things you did, right?

470
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,740
Okay.

471
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,740
Okay.

472
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,780
Then tell me.

473
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,780
What dirty things did I do?

474
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,780
You used Weijia Nan's email

475
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,780
to trick Tang Xin.

476
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,780
Then you found someone

477
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,780
to kidnap Tang Xin.

478
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,780
Does that count as dirty?

479
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,780
What Weijia Nan?

480
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,780
Kidnapping?

481
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,780
What are you talking about?

482
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,780
You're brave enough to do it, right?

483
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,780
Then I'll tell you again.

484
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,780
Tang Xin and Weijia Nan

485
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,820
have been rescued by the police.

486
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,820
Are you guilty?

487
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,820
Can you still pretend to be guilty?

488
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,820
You're the one who held the police?

489
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,820
Yes.

490
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,820
Han Yu Hang.

491
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,820
What do you want?

492
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,820
I want to see Tang Xin.

493
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,820
I want to see Tang Xin.

494
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,820
I want to see Tang Xin.

495
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,820
I want to see Tang Xin.

496
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,820
I want to see Tang Xin.

497
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,860
What do you want?

498
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,860
I want to save you.

499
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,860
I don't want to see my brother

500
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,860
in jail one day.

501
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,860
Han Yu Hang.

502
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,860
Mr. Han.

503
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,860
It seems that Mr. Han

504
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,860
has a lot of information on us.

505
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,860
How did he know?

506
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,860
Mr. Han.

507
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,860
It's not the time to be entangled in this problem.

508
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,860
Think about it.

509
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,860
If it's really like what he said,

510
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,860
Tang Xin and Weijia Nan

511
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,860
have been rescued by the police.

512
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,860
They have a lot of evidence in their hands.

513
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,860
I don't know.

514
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,860
I don't know.

515
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,860
I don't know.

516
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,860
Dad.

517
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,860
Something happened.

518
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,860
Weijia Nan.

519
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,860
Who kidnapped you?

520
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,860
Do you know them?

521
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,860
I don't know.

522
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,900
Then how did you know

523
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,900
that they were in jail

524
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,900
for the crime of burying cultural relics?

525
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Because I used to be

526
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,900
a middle-class employee of Changzhou Group.

527
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,900
Then I became a senior manager at the airport.

528
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,900
So

529
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,900
I know more about them.

530
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,900
Weijia Nan.

531
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,900
We verified your identity and information.

532
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,900
Your real name and identity

533
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,940
are you?

534
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,940
Yes.

535
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,940
I'm not Weijia Nan.

536
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,940
My real name is Xu Genshui.

537
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,940
I had no choice

538
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,940
but to hide my identity.

539
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,940
I saw Han Changzhou and others

540
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,940
getting more and more cultural relics in jail.

541
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,940
I wanted to collect the evidence quickly

542
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,940
and give them the evidence

543
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,940
to the police.

544
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,980
They found me

545
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,980
and killed me

546
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,980
after I collected their evidence.

547
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,980
Luckily,

548
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,980
I was lucky

549
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,980
and got a life.

550
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,980
Why didn't you report the case

551
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,980
after you escaped?

552
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,980
Because I didn't have the evidence.

553
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,980
Once Han Changzhou and others

554
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,980
found that I was still alive,

555
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,980
they would definitely not let go.

556
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,980
In order not to let them recognize me,

557
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,980
I went to get a face first

558
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,980
and then,

559
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,980
under the name of Weijia Nan,

560
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,980
I got a fake ID

561
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,980
and hid it.

562
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,980
I didn't expect

563
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,980
they would still find out.

564
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,980
Chief.

565
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,020
Chief.

566
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,020
Okay, I got it.

567
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,020
Xu Genshui,

568
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,020
your case

569
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,020
is highly related to the case.

570
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,020
The city police has filed a case

571
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,020
on the collection of cultural relics.

572
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,020
You need to go to the city police

573
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,020
and explain the situation again.

574
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,020
Okay.

575
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,020
Thank you for your cooperation.

576
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,020
Thank you for providing

577
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,020
the criminal clues

578
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,020
for our police agency

579
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,020
to prevent crime.

580
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,020
Thank you.

581
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,060
You don't have to thank me.

582
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,020
This is what every

583
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,020
citizen with conscience should do.

584
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,060
Anyway,

585
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,060
that's basically the case.

586
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,060
I've been in my heart today

587
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,060
and didn't receive your message.

588
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,060
My phone was in the dormitory.

589
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,060
You've been through so much

590
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,060
by yourself.

591
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,060
I feel very bad.

592
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,100
It's okay.

593
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,100
I'm still

594
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
in front of you.

595
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,100
It's a good thing

596
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,100
the police went there in time.

597
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,100
If it was a little later,

598
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,100
the consequences would be unimaginable.

599
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,100
I'm here.

600
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,100
I have a question

601
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,100
to ask you.

602
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,100
What is it?

603
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
This time,

604
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,100
the police

605
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
prepared a lot.

606
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,100
So I was thinking

607
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,140
who called the police?

608
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,140
I heard

609
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,140
the police said

610
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,140
someone secretly called the police.

611
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,140
He knew

612
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,140
there would be a kidnapping.

613
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,140
Even the specific address

614
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,140
was very accurate.

615
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,140
Then this person

616
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,140
must know

617
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,140
someone was trying to kidnap you.

618
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,140
Who do you think it could be?

619
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,140
Han Yu Hao.

620
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,140
Han Yu Hao.

621
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,180
Anyway,

622
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,180
I'm glad

623
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,180
I got the job.

624
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,180
I should thank Captain Wu.

625
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,180
Why thank me?

626
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,180
I did nothing wrong.

627
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,180
Thank you

628
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,180
for criticizing me so harshly last time

629
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,180
and asking me to go out of the investigation room.

630
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,220
You must remember to pay me back.

631
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,220
I'm so heartless

632
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,220
to accept your criticism this time.

633
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,220
You have to praise me.

634
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,220
Praise you.

635
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,220
Xin Xin,

636
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,220
what's wrong?

637
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,220
Mom,

638
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,180
our company

639
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,220
has a temporary notice to go on a business trip.

640
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,220
I have to go now.

641
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,220
I'll be back in a few days.

642
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,220
You can tell my dad

643
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,220
not to worry.

644
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,220
Why are you

645
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,220
in such a hurry?

646
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,220
Did you bring your luggage?

647
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,220
I can't wait to pack it.

648
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,220
I'll buy it when I need it.

649
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,220
I have to go now.

650
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,220
I won't talk to you anymore.

651
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,220
Bye.

652
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,220
Okay, be careful.

653
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,260
So anxious.

654
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,260
Xin Xin.

655
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,260
My little ancestor,

656
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,260
this is the hospital.

657
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,260
Keep your voice down.

658
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,260
Why are you hospitalized again?

659
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,260
How's your neck?

660
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,260
It's okay.

661
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,260
It's okay.

662
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,260
It's a secret.

663
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,260
Don't be so hard on yourself.

664
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,260
What's going on?

665
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,260
Is it serious?

666
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,260
I'm so worried.

667
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,260
I'm worried about you.

668
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,260
I'm worried about you.

669
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,260
I'm worried about you.

670
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,260
I'm worried about you.

671
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,260
I'm worried about you.

672
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,260
I'm worried about you.

673
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,300
You can just

674
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,300
investigate the news.

675
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,300
You can just

676
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,300
find out the pain

677
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,300
and let her be tied up.

678
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,300
Your daughter is a big man.

679
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,300
She'll be blessed.

680
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,300
What?

681
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,300
Do you still want your neck?

682
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,300
Can't you be more careful?

683
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,300
I can't afford

684
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,300
to keep you from doing this.

685
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,300
I was scared to death

686
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,300
when I was about to die.

687
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,300
I was afraid that I'd scare you

688
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,300
and didn't tell you on purpose.

689
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,300
So I came here.

690
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,300
Who told you that?

691
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,300
Zong Qing.

692
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,300
Zong Qing?

693
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,900
I heard that Captain Wu and the tail got angry

694
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,140
and ran to the hospital.

695
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,780
I was so scared.

696
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,580
How is your neck?

697
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,420
Does it hurt?

698
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,460
It's fine.

699
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,260
Look.

700
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,540
Is it okay?

701
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,260
Okay.

702
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,820
I've finished reading it.

703
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,340
It's almost...

704
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,420
Why are you staring at me?

705
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,980
Zong Qing didn't tell you that he died?

706
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,300
It's not easy for a man's boyfriend to show his affection.

707
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,460
Be a little more serious.

708
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,540
Don't be so arrogant.

709
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,540
No, Tang Xin.

710
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,460
You forget your best friend when you have a boyfriend.

711
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,980
I'm worried about you.

712
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,540
I know you love me and care about me.

713
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,740
I've received your love.

714
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,940
Disappear.

715
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,940
You're so rude.

716
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,860
Look at you.

717
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,860
You're so gentle.

718
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,660
You think I'm delaying your honeymoon in the hospital,

719
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,660
right?

720
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,460
You get over the stress first.

721
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,220
You're too sending me the morning bus outside.

722
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,900
Don't talk about it here.

723
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,700
Be quick.

724
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,260
Our droppers should be back.

725
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,220
Tang Xin and Miss Egg are preparing for the wash up.

726
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,660
Fine.

727
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,540
I'll leave in 2 minutes.

728
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,180
I'll get some fruit inst.

729
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,140
Get what?

730
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,460
Go and enjoy yourself.

731
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,220
You really are great.

732
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,620
I am impressed with your spirit,

733
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,660
but what you are doing is just35 percent more than I thought.

734
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,020
Let's go over there.

735
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,980
I am really sorry for taking so long.

736
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,740
I will be back in a minute.

737
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,940
We have our own plans.

738
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,900
Secretary Zhou.

739
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,420
I came to sign with Mr. Han.

740
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,460
Why can't I see him?

741
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,540
Mr. Han is abroad.

742
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,420
Dad.

743
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,460
You have to take good care of this Han Yu Hang.

744
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,100
You can't let him keep messing around like this.

745
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,860
I think you're messing around.

746
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,260
You've already seen the information

747
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,860
of the public security case in that person's mailbox.

748
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,540
You're still going to tease that female reporter?

749
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,340
Now,

750
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,700
both of them were rescued by the Public Security Bureau.

751
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,620
How can you blame me?

752
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,100
If he didn't put a camera in the company's meeting room

753
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,980
and report it to the police,

754
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,420
would these things happen?

755
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,660
I think he's spoiled.

756
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,740
How about sending him abroad?

757
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,260
Don't mess around with us.

758
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,980
If he wants to mess around,

759
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,060
he can do it anywhere.

760
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,420
If you send him away,

761
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,620
he won't come back.

762
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,060
Then let him stay here

763
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,340
and mess around.

764
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,060
I think

765
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,220
he just found out about us.

766
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,300
He can't accept it

767
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,100
for a while.

768
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,860
Anyway,

769
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,300
he's my biological son

770
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,820
and your biological brother.

771
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,740
I think you should be careful.

772
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,460
Dad,

773
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,100
I'm telling you the worst.

774
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,180
If he keeps messing around like this,

775
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,780
don't blame me for not

776
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,060
recognizing you as my biological brother.

777
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,220
Slow down.

778
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:35,940
Don't rush.

779
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,740
efficient

780
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,980
Do you need to rest?

781
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,020
Come on, I can't.

782
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,780
You're late. Go to the next one.

783
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,380
Slow down.

784
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,340
That's okay.

785
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,340
Who is it?

786
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,020
I'm here to see you.

787
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,940
Why are you here?

788
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,420
I'm here to see you.

789
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,900
I'll go downstairs first.

790
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,860
Be careful.

791
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,020
Don't touch her.

792
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,540
Why are you so fierce?

793
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,180
I'm not fierce.

794
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,580
Alright.

795
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,780
I'll practice by myself.

796
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,140
You two can stay by yourself.

797
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,260
I'm here to see you.

798
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,340
You're here to see me?

799
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,340
I'm here to see you.

800
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,340
I'm here to see you.

801
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,340
I'm here to see you.

802
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,340
I'm here to see you.

803
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,300
You're here to see me,

804
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,460
not someone else.

805
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,100
Of course I'm here to see you.

806
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,100
I'm here to see him.

807
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,740
Did you hear that?

808
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,340
By the way,

809
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,780
hurry up and practice.

810
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,580
The doctor said

811
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,700
you don't need to wear this for a long time.

812
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,740
You need to do some recovery training occasionally.

813
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,060
Thank you, Captain Wu.

814
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,620
Okay.

815
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,820
What's wrong?

816
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,380
Come on.

817
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:16,980
Show him.

818
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,740
What do you mean?

819
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,900
Show your heart.

820
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,260
What...

821
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,300
What is she doing?

822
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,100
People say that the heart

823
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,500
is the same as the

824
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,060
size of a fist.

825
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,060
Not that.

826
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,020
This...

827
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,980
Cheng Yuan.

828
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,860
Cheng Yuan.

829
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,820
Cheng Yuan.

830
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,260
Is my light bulb too bright?

831
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,060
It's not bright.

832
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,500
I'll go then.

833
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,940
Can you write a letter?

834
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,540
He can.

835
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,380
He's almost as good as a target.

836
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,100
What?

837
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,060
Write a letter.

838
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,740
Write a letter.

839
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,620
Write a letter.

840
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,780
Write a letter.

841
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,700
You've practiced this before?

842
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,300
Wu Ke is taking selfies every day.

843
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,700
I can tell from his looks.

844
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,380
Look at him, Captain Wu.

845
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,740
Can you learn from Cheng Yuan?

846
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,500
Cheng Yuan.

847
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,140
Yes.

848
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,180
Take a group photo.

849
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:25,780
Yes.

850
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,620
Captain, what's the unit of the first group?

851
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,740
One group.

852
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,460
One group.

853
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,380
Just take a group photo.

854
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:34,820
Got it.

855
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,540
Wait, wait, wait.

856
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,260
Wait, Cheng Yuan.

857
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,180
Three, two, one.

858
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:37,660
Wait.

859
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,620
I didn't put on makeup.

860
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,100
Cheng Yuan, you...

861
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:39,660
One more.

862
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,020
Three, two, one.

863
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,260
You're so dark.

864
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,140
I didn't put on makeup.

865
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,660
You can't take photos.

866
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,140
Can you wait for me?

867
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:44,860
I can't take photos.

868
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,660
You can't take photos.

869
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,100
Okay.

870
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,020
Leave me alone.

871
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,020
I want to...

872
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,580
Take a photo.

873
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,700
Captain, look at Qian Yi.

874
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,140
Three, two, one.

875
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,220
Wu Ke.

876
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,100
What's this?

877
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,820
There's still you, Cheng Yuan,

878
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,420
who can't keep an eye on things that can't be measured.

879
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,260
Impossible.

880
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,500
Who's the thing?

881
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,700
How about this, Captain?

882
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,660
You press the Tang reporters.

883
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,780
I'll give you a set of points.

884
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,260
No.

885
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,300
This is a military hospital.

886
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,220
You can't do this.

887
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,980
Don't mess around. Come here.

888
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:28,740
Make sure you take good pictures.

889
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,860
Three, two, one.

890
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,500
Tang Xin.

891
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,300
Tang Xin.

892
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:37,980
Tang Xin.

893
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,380
Tang Xin.

894
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,780
Where do you live?

895
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,660
Here.

896
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,260
Here.

897
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:47,860
Where's Little Wild Monkey?

898
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,460
Where's Little Wild Monkey?

899
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,740
Keep your voice down.

900
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,540
Don't scare Xing Xing away.

901
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,140
She...

902
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:56,980
Where is she?

903
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,140
I'm asking you.

904
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,620
I'm asking you.

905
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,380
Where is she?

906
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,300
Where is she?

907
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,780
Where is she?

908
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,500
Where is she?

909
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,780
What do you mean?

910
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,380
Report.

911
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,940
I heard you say Xin.

912
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,020
I'll put your heart on the line.

913
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,780
Put my heart on the line?

914
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,940
I'm looking for Tang Xin.

915
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,620
Who's this kid?

916
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,180
Why didn't you ask your parents

917
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,300
before you came here?

918
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,900
Why did you come out when you were in danger?

919
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,580
This kid is so annoying.

920
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,260
He told us he's on a business trip.

921
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,020
If Yang Yang didn't tell us it,

922
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,500
I...

923
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,820
We'll be fooled by him again.

924
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,660
You are so unorganized.

925
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,620
Captain Tang.

926
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:38,880
Are you all right?

927
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,540
What happened?

928
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,940
You have nothing to report, have you?

929
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,240
You do, right?

930
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,360
No.

931
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,560
That does not matter.

932
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:00,920
Dad!

933
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,080
What is it?

934
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,260
Want to do some push-ups?

935
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,260
Fine.

936
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,300
Go.

937
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,920
calm quiet

938
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,540
Tracy

939
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,460
Get up

940
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,220
Go

941
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,220
Sit tight

942
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:12,300
I've hidden more expectations in your heart

943
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,300
I really understand

944
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,300
You said love is too vague

945
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:26,300
But your eyes gave me an answer

946
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:34,300
I can exchange all my heart and soul with you

947
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:41,300
Thank you for waking up the courage that used to be weak

948
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:45,300
Let all coincidences become a wish

949
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,300
Let all the simple things become a partner

950
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,300
Open the door of time

951
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:57,300
The sea of people can't separate us

952
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,300
You wait for the heart to warm

953
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:06,300
Why don't you answer in my memory

954
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,300
The loneliness of the time I hate

955
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:15,300
I can't help but miss you

956
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,300
I can't regret

957
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:23,300
Let all the simple things become a wish

958
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:27,300
Let all the simple things become a partner

959
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,300
Thank you for being by my side

960
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,300
Even the snow and the sea

961
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,300
The bigger the world, the lonelier it gets

962
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,300
Only standing by your side

963
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:48,300
I can feel the warmth in my heart
