1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,440
Captain, what should I do?

2
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,480
Do you want this child?

3
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,680
Yes, of course.

4
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,280
Do you know what it means to have a child?

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,880
A teacher with a动身

6
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:12,100
is no longer an labor

7
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,860
What impressed you the most?

8
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,420
My mom

9
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,620
would sit by the phone

10
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,340
and wait for the call every day.

11
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,060
Sometimes, she would

12
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,500
answer a phone call every week.

13
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,260
Sometimes, she couldn't even

14
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,260
answer a phone call

15
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,700
for a month, half a year

16
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,900
or longer.

17
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,380
It's hard to understand.

18
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,100
But it's a great

19
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,260
burden

20
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,300
for the kids and the family.

21
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,660
I'm much better now.

22
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,260
I can contact her

23
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,340
every week when I'm not on a mission.

24
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,940
When I'm fine,

25
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,980
I can go home a few times a week.

26
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,740
But it's not enough

27
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,180
for a child to be raised.

28
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,340
So basically,

29
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,220
what if he can't eat on the way?

30
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,780
What if he has a poor stomach?

31
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,860
What if he can't walk?

32
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,580
What if he can't sleep on the way?

33
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,740
You can't even

34
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,620
make sure of it.

35
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,820
You can only make

36
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,780
the worst decisions.

37
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,940
You have to understand him.

38
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,140
He has to think about you.

39
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,980
You're missing out on the whole.

40
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,700
What should he do?

41
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:24,780
Director,

42
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,460
what should you do in your place?

43
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:31,980
I thought

44
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,980
my lover

45
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,940
would be pregnant with our child.

46
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,220
When I got up at night

47
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,260
and didn't even have a sip of water

48
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,260
to feed her,

49
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,260
I was so depressed

50
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,180
and poisoned.

51
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,100
I understand you.

52
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,340
Yes, you're responsible.

53
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,060
But you have to hold on.

54
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,700
If you can't,

55
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,060
then all you said to Junjian

56
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,460
that day was nonsense.

57
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,060
Tong Qing,

58
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,660
explain to the brides

59
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,340
the other reasons.

60
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,500
The sea is the witness.

61
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:30,440
Junjian is a

62
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,540
rare guest.

63
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,820
Sorry,

64
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,860
I have to trouble you.

65
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,940
I have something urgent at work.

66
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,740
I left Yangyang here

67
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,540
to take care of it for a long time.

68
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,420
I'll pick him up when I'm done.

69
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,140
It's okay.

70
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,260
I just got a job.

71
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:39,980
I just got a job.

72
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,820
I have time.

73
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,420
Yangyang,

74
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,100
you're mine today.

75
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,700
Go ahead.

76
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,700
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,420
Sister-in-law,

78
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,180
I'm sorry to trouble you.

79
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,540
Bye.

80
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,100
Bye.

81
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,820
Sister-in-law,

82
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,340
Ning Zhi is about to give birth.

83
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,620
Why are you still here?

84
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,940
It's still a few days

85
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,140
before the baby is born.

86
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,860
I can't be idle

87
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,900
if I stay at home.

88
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,060
Have you prepared everything?

89
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,580
What's there to prepare?

90
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,980
Just give birth when the time comes.

91
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:09,940
Yes.

92
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,420
Do you want to touch it?

93
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,260
No.

94
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,500
Are you afraid?

95
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,980
Sister-in-law, aren't you afraid?

96
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,500
Why should I be afraid?

97
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,740
I'm pregnant.

98
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,780
Actually, when I just got my first child,

99
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,460
I was afraid too.

100
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,420
Wang Lang was in the army at that time.

101
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,940
My mother-in-law and I were at home.

102
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,300
I saw that my belly

103
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,180
was getting bigger and bigger.

104
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,660
I was so nervous.

105
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,780
I thought

106
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,660
I wasn't ready yet.

107
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,180
Why did I become a mother?

108
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,460
The key is

109
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,100
Wang Lang was not there when he was pregnant.

110
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,300
When the baby was about to give birth,

111
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,420
Wang Lang asked for a leave.

112
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,540
But who knew

113
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,860
he would die in an emergency

114
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,180
in a train?

115
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,220
He was called back halfway.

116
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,140
I couldn't stop myself

117
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,340
when I heard it.

118
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,620
Wang Zhao Yang was born on that day.

119
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,260
On the third day of giving birth,

120
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,580
Wang Lang called the first time.

121
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,580
But he cried on the phone.

122
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,100
He couldn't even apologize.

123
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,900
Brigadier, you cried?

124
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,660
Have you ever heard a man cry?

125
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,620
He was the kind of man

126
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,420
who kept his voice down

127
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,900
and had a terrible voice.

128
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,060
He seemed to suffocate himself to death.

129
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,660
His busiest feelings

130
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,320
were likeressing lift and soft jaki했던.

131
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,480
Actually,

132
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,020
giving birth benefits both men.

133
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,020
But giving birth

134
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,540
was something

135
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,460
the woman herself

136
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,220
wanted to face themselves exactly.

137
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,620
In the October incest,

138
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,260
her body

139
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,940
スrosed and new but

140
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,820
she had young stats,

141
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,420
ツ deserves Beating Every Day.

142
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,720
If you didn't go to work,

143
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,220
I wouldn't have been able to help you.

144
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,620
Especially when you were about to give birth,

145
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,120
it was painful.

146
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,880
Why did you shout it was painful?

147
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,020
But Russia is also strange.

148
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,080
You need a nurse to put a ugly

149
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,540
and small head on your face,

150
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,820
your fingers.

151
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,020
My heart

152
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,940
calmed down.

153
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,940
I forgot all the pain.

154
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,460
It's so sad.

155
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,940
Sister-in-law,

156
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,180
I'm pregnant too.

157
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,940
I can see that.

158
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,500
That's why Xin Xin

159
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,020
brought you here.

160
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,740
I don't know what to do.

161
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,340
I'm a little scared.

162
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,060
Remember,

163
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,460
it's not a duty to give birth.

164
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,180
It's a choice.

165
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,020
After I gave birth to Wang Zhao Yang,

166
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,060
I thought

167
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,140
I would never

168
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,340
have a second child.

169
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,220
Let me tell you.

170
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,940
Look, now I don't have a second child.

171
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,740
It's hard to be pregnant.

172
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,460
But you know what?

173
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,900
When a child is born,

174
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,660
many things

175
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,060
will happen that you can't imagine.

176
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,060
Really.

177
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,460
So,

178
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,340
I hope you can think it over.

179
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,140
Yes, I did.

180
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,780
I forgot to say.

181
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,300
The day after you hand the rock Tapiota to Wu Si,

182
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,900
I will go to the museum.

183
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,460
I hope to gain the attention of the entrant department.

184
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,540
Also,

185
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,940
if someone really

186
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,420
traps thearies underwater,

187
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,220
then there would be

188
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,100
more graffiti

189
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:55,980
left overseas

190
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,940
with this case taken more time.

191
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,620
Let's go and have to report to director Qian.

192
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,620
I think we should thrash outside after taking bankم

193
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,140
uncle in deушifaksuspenseful

194
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:14,900
I have been to the ge

195
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,100
Director Qian asked you to go to the meeting

196
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,000
it is Could

197
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,200
I'm just a reporter

198
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,640
Not so broad

199
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,480
What other clues do you have

200
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,480
Tell me together

201
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,720
That's all for now

202
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,600
But maybe you're lucky

203
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,120
Can really get something

204
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,200
Check the company registered in Luoman Island

205
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Is it related to the cultural relics?

206
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,840
Very important

207
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,800
All information is needed

208
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,760
Sister-in-law

209
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,080
But I don't feel it at all

210
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,080
I'm not happy at all

211
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,640
Not excited at all

212
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,080
Not looking forward to it at all

213
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,480
Am I not worthy of being a mother?

214
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Of course not

215
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,360
Do you know when I started

216
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,560
Don't you regret it

217
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,120
When Wang Zhangyang was full moon

218
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,000
Wang Lang asked for a leave and came back

219
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,960
I remember one morning

220
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,760
I just opened my eyes

221
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,840
I saw Wang Lang in a daze

222
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,800
I'm afraid of my child

223
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,280
He was afraid of making a noise

224
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,520
He didn't turn on the light

225
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,880
He put the curtain

226
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,560
Just opened a small bag

227
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,040
Put the child in front of that bag

228
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,120
Put the child in his mouth

229
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,040
He was stupid

230
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,400
He was sweating

231
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,960
I looked at him at that time

232
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,440
to be honest

233
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,360
Sometimes Wang Zhangyang is disobedient

234
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,160
When Wang Lang made me angry

235
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,640
I remember that day

236
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,400
I remember that day

237
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,640
With that curtain

238
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,600
I felt warm

239
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,000
You know

240
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,040
My life is worth it

241
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,160
Can i touch it

242
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,240
Of course

243
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,760
He's turning around

244
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,160
I'm greeting you

245
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,120
Do you feel it

246
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,840
Our two children are talking

247
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,880
Sister Yangyang

248
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,160
We'll meet soon

249
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,600
I have to express my reflection

250
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,600
What's wrong

251
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,960
How about it

252
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,280
I'm not the only one who peeks

253
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,240
Okay, you do something else

254
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,960
I'll think about it

255
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,880
Dad mom

256
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,800
I'm back

257
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm back

258
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,920
Come on, come on, come on

259
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,240
I officially announce to you

260
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,560
A big good news

261
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,360
What good news

262
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,200
Lan Yangyang

263
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,840
pregnant

264
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,080
This is a good thing

265
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,680
I'll call Lan Weiguo later

266
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,440
I live

267
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,600
At least let our Xinxin

268
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,440
Have some joy of her grandchild

269
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,680
Dad, can you stop

270
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,480
What can you burn me

271
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,120
I don't burn you, who do you burn

272
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,680
I'm greedy

273
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,840
Look at her

274
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,080
it is good

275
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,640
I help you

276
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
That's great

277
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,280
Chen Pei

278
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,960
Captain, what is this

279
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,200
When will this go

280
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,440
Don't you understand

281
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,760
You have to go

282
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,560
Find it

283
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,040
Captain

284
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,080
Your princess sent a WeChat

285
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Do you want me to throw it away

286
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,840
Captain

287
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,640
You said you gave her a bunch of 50 more

288
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,800
Are you serious

289
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,960
I'm back.

290
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,040
I'm ringing her up now.

291
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440
I want another talk.

292
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,920
I'm back at dad's

293
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,680
Let's talk in a few days.

294
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,040
Right away.

295
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,740
I beauty 그냥

296
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,860
have something in my mind.

297
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,640
Are you all right?

298
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,900
No better news, I suppose.

299
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,880
In the showbiz video

300
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,280
with careful examination,

301
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:47,040
an indicating long-term

302
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,240
immediate route to a risk of death in the future.

303
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,120
The nearest suburb

304
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,680
where the Kabulian

305
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,000
tomb filled with

306
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,720
radiogewirms

307
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,160
He's not sure about you.

308
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,000
This proves again

309
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,960
that I suspect Changzhou is the right one.

310
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,760
I think he has more clues.

311
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,360
Think about what he said at the end.

312
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,720
If you're lucky,

313
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,640
you might really get something.

314
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,360
You mean

315
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,280
if I go to Luo Man,

316
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,400
will he still give me clues?

317
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,880
It's possible.

318
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
But

319
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,800
it's a kind of excuse.

320
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Is it worth it?

321
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's okay.

322
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,960
But you can't go alone.

323
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
I'll go with him.

324
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,800
I mean

325
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,600
it's not as important as

326
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
the safety of the country.

327
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,800
Before you go,

328
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
you have to

329
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,720
report to the relevant departments.

330
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,000
I know.

331
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,560
Go.

332
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,400
The Yading Bay is a coastal road

333
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,920
from the Indian Ocean

334
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,200
to the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.

335
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,720
It's also the main route

336
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
connecting the Eastern Asia, Western Europe

337
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,320
and the North American East Coast.

338
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,680
There are about 20,000 boats

339
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,680
and ships

340
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,520
passing through here.

341
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,640
The cargo volume

342
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,920
is one-fifth of the total cargo volume in the sea.

343
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,600
Since 2008,

344
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,960
we've sent the first batch of escort ships.

345
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,240
The Yanyang Escort

346
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,800
has become the tradition

347
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,040
of our navy's regular deployment

348
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,280
and mission.

349
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,000
The escort ship is still the same.

350
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,760
Three ships and one fleet.

351
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,320
We'll head to Wenzhou.

352
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,720
Wang Lang.

353
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,600
Yes.

354
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,680
This escort ship

355
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,120
will pass the Mosheng Sea for the first time.

356
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,440
We must strengthen our leadership.

357
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,160
Besides,

358
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,240
the superior unit has decided

359
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,040
that the escort ship special forces

360
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,120
will be built by you.

361
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,600
Bring good roads and good soldiers.

362
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,880
We'll complete the mission.

363
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,360
Attention.

364
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,800
Attention.

365
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,120
Comrade Shi Shao.

366
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,520
The men's assault team has gathered.

367
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,200
Please give the order.

368
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:23,760
Attention.

369
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,560
Yes.

370
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,760
Attention.

371
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,280
Say it.

372
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:32,920
Attention.

373
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,880
Attention.

374
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,240
Cut the crap.

375
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,880
The new batch of escort ships

376
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
is about to start.

377
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm here to pick people today.

378
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,680
The old rule.

379
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,120
Continue.

380
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,320
You must give up.

381
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't let me see

382
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,360
your men have a squad.

383
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,200
Can you do it?

384
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,280
Yes.

385
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,540
???

386
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,120
Fire!

387
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,280
One, two, three.

388
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,760
Don't take a shower tonight.

389
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,360
You can't dip yourself in water these days.

390
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,200
Can you go closer?

391
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,160
Don't move.

392
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,640
What's the man's name?

393
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,760
How can you be a gunman without taking off a few layers of skin?

394
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,680
Bear with it.

395
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,000
Does it still hurt?

396
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,520
No.

397
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,680
It doesn't hurt now.

398
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,480
Have you eaten a little?

399
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,240
sections

400
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,080
走

401
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,440
Have you finished eating?

402
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,840
You can go ahead and eat.

403
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,920
I'll go ahead and eat.

404
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,400
That

405
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,400
Dr. Qiu

406
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
You're not sun-drying, you're applying medicine

407
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,400
I'm done, it's okay

408
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Captain, our tent must be so close to the sea

409
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,400
I can't sleep at night listening to the waves

410
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
You can't sleep when you hear the waves

411
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
What about the ship's ship?

412
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
You have to listen more and practice more

413
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
And customers

414
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
Yes

415
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
You two little kids

416
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
Don't you know what you are good at?

417
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Practice more, it's good for you

418
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Sleep, sleep

419
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Okay, okay

420
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Where is it hurt?

421
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Back

422
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Here, it hurts

423
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
It hurts

424
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
It hurts

425
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
How about it, you little kid

426
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
You're not good at being a man, right?

427
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,400
I'm very good

428
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Don't brag, you can't even hear the waves

429
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
I'm very good

430
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm very good

431
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
When will the meal be ready?

432
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
I'm hungry, hurry up

433
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
Zhang Yuchu, Hua Zhou

434
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
Hurry up

435
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Stop

436
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
Clear the ship

437
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Okay, go straight to the shore

438
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
Zongxi

439
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
What are you looking at?

440
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
There are no fairy girls in the sky

441
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
I think it's much more beautiful than a fairy girl

442
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
I'm thinking about my son's name

443
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Zongxi

444
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
How about my dad got it

445
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Zongxi

446
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,400
Why not call it Songdong, Zongnan, Zongbei

447
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Why is the ticket called Zongxi?

448
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
You have no culture

449
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
West, west, west

450
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Who gives his child such a name?

451
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Your child's name is called five, six, seven

452
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Five eight forty, five nine forty five, Wudang

453
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Don't say Wudang is a good name

454
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
The child wants to be alone

455
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Or you are the leader of Shaoxiao

456
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
I'll marry you

457
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
I'm ready to make a good bet

458
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
I'll give you a good one for your child

459
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Call it Zongshi, how about Zongshi?

460
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Row

461
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
My child is called Zongshi

462
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Your child is called Wudang

463
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Wudang, Zongshi, grow up to be a retreat soldier

464
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Good or not

465
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Really

466
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Zongxi sounds good

467
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Right?

468
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
I think so too

469
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Zongxi

470
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
We love you

471
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
We will love you

472
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
We love you

473
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Wudang

474
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
We will be dead

475
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Wudang

476
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:47,400
Welcome the strategic language

477
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:25,140
Watch out!

478
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,540
I'll demonstrate it to you.

479
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,140
10 days ago

480
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,260
Good!

481
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,100
You guys are leaving?

482
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,740
What?

483
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,940
I'm not...

484
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,020
This won't do.

485
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,860
It's so hard.

486
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,540
Captain.

487
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,820
You're still a few rounds away.

488
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,740
You have to hang in there.

489
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,420
Yes, captain.

490
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,420
Keep training.

491
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,740
I'll go.

492
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,580
Hurry.

493
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,260
It's almost done.

494
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,220
It's almost done.

495
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,260
Come on, Zhang.

496
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,060
Okay, keep going.

497
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,060
Where's the investigation going to Luo Man?

498
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,700
Chang Xin, you're a little too much.

499
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,860
You didn't even find out

500
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,740
that you were a spy in China.

501
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,980
You can find the truth when you go abroad.

502
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,860
This is the only clue

503
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,660
I can find.

504
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,660
I've analyzed it.

505
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,540
Because the institutions that register

506
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:30,580
in Luo Man

507
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,220
won't share their corporate information.

508
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,300
So many companies that are engaged in illegal activities

509
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,660
are willing to hide there.

510
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,020
Since the informant gave me this clue,

511
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,900
the Atoka Company

512
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,340
must have a lot of information.

513
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,420
The clues and information

514
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,180
he gave you before were also a lot.

515
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,900
What happened?

516
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,980
You went out three times,

517
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,540
and you didn't even see Chen Chen's shadow.

518
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,660
When you get to Luo Man,

519
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,340
can you spread his information?

520
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,700
Hello, Mr. Bai.

521
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,580
Tang Xin,

522
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,980
the result of the

523
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,380
magnetic field

524
00:26:59,380 --> 00:26:59,860
you gave me last time

525
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,860
has come out.

526
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:09,060
It's indeed a underwater

527
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,700
submerged cultural relic.

528
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,300
Wait, Mr. Bai.

529
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,100
I didn't hear it clearly.

530
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,780
Please repeat it.

531
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,860
I mean, the magnetic field

532
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,060
you gave me last time

533
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,460
has come out.

534
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,300
It's indeed a underwater

535
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,340
submerged cultural relic.

536
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,780
If the magnetic field is complete,

537
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,100
the value of the cultural relic will be very high.

538
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,300
And now the Cultural Relic Bureau

539
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,860
has decided to officially

540
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,300
give the magnetic field

541
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,380
to the Atoka Company.

542
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,420
That's great.

543
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,420
Thank you, Mr. Bai.

544
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,540
We should thank you.

545
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,620
The leadership of the Cultural Relic Bureau

546
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,620
especially asked me to

547
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,900
convey my gratitude to you.

548
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,020
You're welcome.

549
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,380
It's all our job.

550
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,860
Okay, bye.

551
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,900
Mr. Tian,

552
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,260
you heard it too.

553
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,820
Do you think I should go to Luo Man?

554
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,980
I hope this matter

555
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,860
can be resolved.

556
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,100
Okay.

557
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,940
But you must be careful.

558
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,300
After a period of training,

559
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,940
the list of candidates for the new escort mission

560
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,740
has been released.

561
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,940
The next candidates

562
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,700
will be trained in seafloor defense.

563
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,700
The talented people who are trained in real combat

564
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,620
will be qualified to be on the escort.

565
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,300
Now I announce

566
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,780
the list of candidates for the escort.

567
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,540
Wu Si.

568
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,300
Yes.

569
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,220
Zhong Qing.

570
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:18,900
Yes.

571
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,060
Cheng Yuan.

572
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,900
Yes.

573
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,500
Dai Wei.

574
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,220
Yes.

575
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,820
Zhou Ke Yang.

576
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,500
Yes.

577
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,100
Li Xu.

578
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,820
Yes.

579
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,180
Ye Hai Yang.

580
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,860
Yes.

581
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,580
Yi Nan Wang.

582
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,300
Yes.

583
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,020
Wang Chen.

584
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,700
Yes.

585
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,460
Peng Tie Chao.

586
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,100
Yes.

587
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,060
Yu Bo.

588
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:40,700
Yes.

589
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,380
Song Hong.

590
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,060
Yes.

591
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,300
Liu Xiang Sheng.

592
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,020
Yes.

593
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,260
Ke'er.

594
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,540
Cheng Yuan.

595
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,980
Why are you here suddenly?

596
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,660
I see.

597
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,100
You want to make it up to me, right?

598
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,900
I'm going to set off for the escort.

599
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,820
How long will you go?

600
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,460
I'm not sure.

601
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,300
It depends on the mission.

602
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,340
But you'll be leaving in September.

603
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,540
I shouldn't be able to come back.

604
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,220
I'm sorry.

605
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,100
I'm sorry.

606
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,780
I get it.

607
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,180
Is there anything else?

608
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,300
I'll go back first.

609
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,940
I'm sorry.

610
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,100
Don't be angry.

611
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,340
Are you afraid I'll be angry?

612
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,980
The escort is a mission.

613
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,220
I have to go.

614
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,380
I'm not not letting you go.

615
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,820
You knew I was leaving in September.

616
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,100
And you knew

617
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,900
that the time of the paramedic would come.

618
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,140
But you still decided to sign up.

619
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,380
You came to inform me

620
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,460
after the list was confirmed.

621
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,060
You just wanted to avoid me from leaving, right?

622
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,820
No.

623
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,260
Don't worry.

624
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,820
I'm a soldier too.

625
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,340
I won't drag you down.

626
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,860
I came to the army myself.

627
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,580
I can leave now.

628
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,620
Ge'er.

629
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,140
There's no signal on the sea.

630
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,940
You have to call at a specified time.

631
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,220
I can't keep in touch with you.

632
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,340
I'm sorry.

633
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,500
Take care of yourself.

634
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,380
Cheng Yue.

635
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,820
Do you know what I've heard the most

636
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,100
in the past two years?

637
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,300
You just said,

638
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,180
I'm sorry.

639
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,580
You have to take care of yourself.

640
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,220
Otherwise,

641
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,700
I'll be counting on you to take care of me.

642
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,860
Okay.

643
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,500
Go back.

644
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,700
Can you?

645
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,740
Alright.

646
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,300
Be careful on the sea.

647
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,780
I will be a Messenger of Human Straits

648
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,580
Introduce yourself

649
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,860
No

650
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,540
I'm 5 years older than you

651
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,380
Stay away from me

652
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,100
where is your ‎

653
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,660
I will be your food

654
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,020
Don't see me

655
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,700
Get ready

656
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,340
Come with me

657
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,060
Get ready

658
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:19,700
Hurry...

659
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,100
Get ready

660
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:20,980
Honey.

661
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,540
Why are you back?

662
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,420
I miss you.

663
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,020
Here.

664
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,340
Why are you back so late?

665
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,620
I thought you were mad at me.

666
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,740
I'm not mad at a goddess.

667
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,700
Are you kidding me?

668
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,580
I just came back from the game.

669
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,700
I didn't even change my clothes.

670
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,340
Come on.

671
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,100
Let me show you.

672
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,380
I went shopping today.

673
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,540
I bought some things

674
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,300
that I like.

675
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,420
You can't not like them.

676
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,260
And then?

677
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,100
I don't know

678
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,380
if the baby is a boy or a girl.

679
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,380
So I bought a neutral color.

680
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:00,900
Look.

681
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,820
It's navy blue.

682
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,500
It's cute.

683
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,180
Honey.

684
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,820
You've figured it out?

685
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,140
I've figured it out.

686
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,580
Honey.

687
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,220
I'm not that scared anymore.

688
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,580
Let's give birth to the baby.

689
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,340
And we'll be the coolest parents

690
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,300
in the world.

691
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,100
They said

692
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,820
you'll be stupid for three years.

693
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,940
You have to take good care of me.

694
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,340
You can't think I'm stupid.

695
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,420
You can't think I'm fat.

696
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,620
You can't think I'm ugly.

697
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,700
I've figured it out.

698
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,940
You'll come back every week.

699
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,980
You'll go to the maternity class with me in the morning.

700
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,260
And you'll help me

701
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,580
decorate the nursing home in the afternoon.

702
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,100
Okay?

703
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,460
If you want to see it,

704
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,420
call again.

705
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,900
Honey.

706
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,940
I touched the

707
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,420
logistics-operating task

708
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,660
when joining the «N recruit».

709
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,420
For how long?

710
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,820
At least two months.

711
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,820
Sorry.

712
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,140
alone at home.

713
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,340
It's okay.

714
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,340
Mom can take good care of me.

715
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,620
I'll wait for you at home with baby.

716
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,020
Honey.

717
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,340
Enough.

718
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,540
You're always so annoying.

719
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,980
What do you want to say?

720
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,420
Tell your daughter.

721
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,460
Honey.

722
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,540
Dad is going out.

723
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,220
Listen to me.

724
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,420
Don't bother mom.

725
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,460
After dad comes back,

726
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,340
I'll hug you every day.

727
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,220
Hug mom.

728
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,060
Okay.

729
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,740
You should go to the hospital

730
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,860
and come back with a smile.

731
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,460
Do you hear me?

732
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,140
Lie down.

733
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,060
Lie down.

734
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,380
I'll send you out.

735
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,300
Don't send me out.

736
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,260
If you send me out,

737
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,180
I can't even get out of this door.

738
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,460
You're a Brigadier at home.

739
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,500
Be good.

740
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:58,940
Honey.

741
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,380
I'm going to work in the branch.

742
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,620
Okay.

743
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,700
Go.

744
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,340
Wang Lang.

745
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,020
Come back early.

746
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,340
Son.

747
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,780
It's so late. Why don't you sleep?

748
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,580
Dad.

749
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,060
When mom was sleeping,

750
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,580
were you not there?

751
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,020
If I wasn't there,

752
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,460
would you be afraid?

753
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,900
I wouldn't be afraid.

754
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,340
Dad, you can't be afraid.

755
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,740
I'm here.

756
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,660
I'm here.

757
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,660
I'm here.

758
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,660
I'm here.

759
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,660
I'm here.

760
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,860
I'm here.

761
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,020
follow me.

762
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,180
Okay.

763
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,420
So beautiful.

764
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,060
What's wrong with you?

765
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,380
Am I balding?

766
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,460
Shili.

767
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,980
I don't even know how to enjoy this home-cooking.

768
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,420
health insurance, file,

769
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,940
birth certificate,

770
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,460
and medical records.

771
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,860
I know all of them.

772
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,180
Wang Zhuang Yang,

773
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,780
I'll leave this home to you.

774
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,340
Can you take care of my mom and sister?

775
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,460
Yes.

776
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,940
Maybe you can open up more convenient stores.

777
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,380
Honey, you're awake.

778
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,620
I won't wake you up then.

779
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,740
rogenine.

780
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,620
well

781
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,020
the soy milk machine is new

782
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,940
I specially chose the simplest one

783
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,620
a textbook

784
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,360
Please

785
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,780
carbonated drinks in the refrigerator

786
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,780
all removed by me

787
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,340
fruits and milk

788
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,460
are all ordered by the sky

789
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,460
I've organized everything you bought.

790
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,460
I've put everything I'll use out there.

791
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,460
I took some books with me to study.

792
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,460
I'll give you a test result when I come back.

793
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,460
I've already taken the pregnancy test.

794
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,460
You must take it when you have a backache.

795
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,460
Tai Xin Yi's operation is a bit complicated.

796
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,460
I've recorded a small video for you.

797
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,460
Remember to check your WeChat.

798
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,460
You must wear防滑拖鞋 when you enter the bathroom.

799
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,460
If the bathroom is dirty, call the service.

800
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,460
Don't do it yourself.

801
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,460
I've already made an appointment for the cleaning.

802
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,460
When I'm not here, you're not allowed to do housework.

803
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,460
Did you hear that?

804
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,460
I'll be back.

805
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,460
I'll be back.

806
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,460
I'll be back.

807
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,460
I'll be back.

808
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,460
I'll be back.

809
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,460
This is my first time to give an award.

810
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,460
I didn't have much experience.

811
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,460
I've taken the best items you've bought

812
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,460
and gave it to you.

813
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,460
Please forgive me.

814
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,460
There's no signal at sea.

815
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,460
But I'll tell you good morning and good night.

816
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,460
Your only task

817
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,460
is to keep yourself clean.

818
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,460
Yeah, thank you.

819
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,460
What do you mean?

820
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,460
I'm just saying,

821
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,660
Your only mission is to raise yourself

822
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,700
White fat

823
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,540
Wait for me to come back with the baby

824
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,900
Wife, I love you

825
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,140
79

826
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,540
80

827
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,820
81

828
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,180
Are you okay?

829
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,020
Get up and walk

830
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,740
You don't faint

831
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,020
The more you squat, the more you faint

832
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,820
Have already arrived at the very ocean

833
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:53,980
Please图秘

834
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,420
Galaxy

835
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,060
Technology

836
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,980
In addition

837
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:01,980
deliver

838
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,420
all

839
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,300
Space

840
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:09,540
I wish all my heart can meet you and exchange it with you

841
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:17,060
Thank you for waking up that once weak courage

842
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,540
Let all coincidences become a distance

843
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:24,220
Let all the simple things become a partner

844
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:29,140
Open the light of the years after the past

845
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:53,660
Even if the cut-throat even can

846
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,760
break us apart

847
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:02,280
I hope you can leave my heart

848
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,600
Thank you for being by my side

849
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,760
Even if it's snowy and dark

850
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,280
The bigger the world, the lonelier it gets

851
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,840
Only standing by your side

852
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:24,760
I can feel the warmth in my heart
