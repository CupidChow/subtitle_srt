1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The Long Ballad

3
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The Long Ballad

4
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The Long Ballad

5
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The Long Ballad

6
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The Long Ballad

7
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
One more thing needs to be declared

9
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
before announcing the results.

10
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We set up a new emergency rescue test.

11
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This time, some members

12
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
have only one third of basic oxygen

13
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
in their oxygen senator.

14
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But the meter rating shows normal.

15
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We placed some spare oxygen senators underwater.

16
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But it was a pity

17
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
that only a few members found them.

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You guys here are all top soldiers from the world.

19
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
To be a qualified soldier,

20
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
we should not only be strong,

21
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
but also have other qualities.

22
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Preferring the life security of our comrades in arms

23
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
to the competitiveness in case of a sudden crisis,

24
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and adapting ourselves to completing the tasks

25
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
in extreme environments

26
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
when encountering temporary dangers.

27
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Therefore, I announce the winner of the game

28
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
is Blue Blade Commando from the Chinese Navy.

29
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
They are not only the first team

30
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
to discover the malfunction of the oxygen senator,

31
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
the team making the quickest response at critical moments,

32
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
but also the one demonstrating strong teamwork in the challenge.

33
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
As for the two captains,

34
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Wu Sen and Zhong Qing,

35
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
they have been given a thorough check-up

36
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and will soon recover from hearing loss caused by drowning

37
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
after some rest and recuperation.

38
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We should all get good results in the upcoming competitions.

39
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Go!

40
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Go!

41
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This one.

42
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Xin Xin, look.

43
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Doesn't this look like it?

44
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Look.

45
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
No way.

46
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is a real one.

47
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's a real one.

48
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No way.

49
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is real.

50
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
No way.

51
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It really isn't.

52
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is this a plant that hasn't yet died?

53
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Then when are we going to find it?

54
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What sound?

55
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Listen.

56
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What sound?

57
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Run!

58
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yao Yao!

59
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Xin Xin, run!

60
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Go!

61
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
There's no one here, right?

62
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
There shouldn't be.

63
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's too scary.

64
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh my god.

65
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let's take a break.

66
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Did you really hear that?

67
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I really heard a wolf howl.

68
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You didn't hear it, did you?

69
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Did you hear it with your ears?

70
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You must have heard it wrong.

71
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I didn't hear it wrong. It was a wolf howl.

72
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's really scary.

73
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm going to go get some water.

74
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Wait.

75
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Did you hear another wolf howl?

76
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Did it follow you?

77
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You scared yourself.

78
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Come, let's go.

79
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Wait a minute.

80
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's that girl.

81
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Did you hear that?

82
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's that girl.

83
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What?

84
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What's that?

85
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Did you hear that?

86
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's that girl.

87
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What's that?

88
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's that girl.

89
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yao Yao.

90
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Look, this is all pine trees.

91
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,960
How do you sleep

92
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,280
Get some rest for five minutes

93
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,400
OK

94
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,200
Just five minutes

95
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,580
Captain

96
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,920
How are you

97
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,840
Are you feeling better?

98
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,520
I'm fine.

99
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,040
It's okay.

100
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,240
It won't affect the competition tomorrow.

101
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,920
The last section was good.

102
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,200
The team reacted quickly.

103
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,400
Yi Nanwang was in the lead.

104
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,440
Wang Chen also completed his task.

105
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,520
Do you know the rules of the quarterfinals?

106
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,280
Yes.

107
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,920
No rashness.

108
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,600
No lagging.

109
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,400
Team cooperation.

110
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,520
Best results in the competition.

111
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,240
Members should pay attention to the adjustment.

112
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,440
In the best condition,

113
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,760
we should welcome the final sniper contest.

114
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,480
Yes.

115
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,240
Xinxin.

116
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,920
You can't adjust the stopwatch.

117
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,240
I'll wait.

118
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,840
Give it to me.

119
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,600
I don't think I have it.

120
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,520
What's wrong?

121
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,320
Just go.

122
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,560
Do you want to talk about that?

123
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,640
I'm thinking.

124
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,760
Light the torch.

125
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,560
I thought

126
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,200
once

127
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,960
they said they would write me

128
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,240
a survival song in the wild.

129
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,000
I didn't expect I would get it this time.

130
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,800
If only Zong Qin and Captain Wu were here.

131
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,040
I regret it so much.

132
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,520
I shouldn't have let you

133
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,160
come to this kind of place with me.

134
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,600
I'm sorry.

135
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,560
Come on.

136
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,120
What's the point of saying this now?

137
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,120
Besides, I chose the way myself.

138
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,200
I have to go anyway.

139
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,080
Right?

140
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,400
Forget it.

141
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,480
It's late.

142
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,720
It's okay. There's a hole.

143
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,480
The wild animals won't come near us at night.

144
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,640
Let's go.

145
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,120
It's been a day.

146
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,120
Get some rest.

147
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,840
Get some rest.

148
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,740
Get some rest.

149
00:12:39,960 --> 00:13:04,880
It seems like

150
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,560
Childe Mansion

151
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,400
Ready, go

152
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,640
Go!

153
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,820
Go!

154
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,800
Go!

155
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,040
Go!

156
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,240
Go.

157
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,360
Jump!

158
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,080
Catch the enemy.

159
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,780
Run

160
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
No one is willing to leave

161
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
No one is willing to leave

162
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
I beg you to turn around

163
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
To be you is not worth it

164
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,880
To be you is not worth it

165
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
Xi Qi, I really can't walk anymore

166
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
Let's take a break

167
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
No, you can't walk

168
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,880
Hurry up

169
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
I really can't walk

170
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
No, no, no

171
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,880
I have to take a break

172
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
OK, take a break for two minutes

173
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
What are you doing?

174
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,880
I really don't understand

175
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
We are lost

176
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
We can't walk again

177
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,880
We have to take a break

178
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
We have to take a break

179
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,880
What if someone sees us

180
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
and comes to us

181
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
Yes, Zhen Zhen told me

182
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
He said if you are lost in the forest

183
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
you must take a break

184
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,880
But

185
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,880
Can someone come here?

186
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Can you see it?

187
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Anyway, one more mark

188
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
One more hope

189
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
OK

190
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
Who?

191
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Two minutes

192
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,880
It's dark

193
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
I have to go out

194
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,880
Let me go

195
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,880
OK

196
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
Hello

197
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
In our hotel there are two Chinese girls

198
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,880
Yes, they are missing for two days

199
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,880
They are in the forest

200
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,880
They could be in danger

201
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
I will go out

202
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880

216
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
You have taken all your things?

217
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
How much do you need?

218
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880
Two packs of cookies

219
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
and two packs of bread

220
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
We have to drink all

221
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,600
Don't you feel customized?

222
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,640
Same for you.

223
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,600
Here you are.

224
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,200
This is the first time the firewood has Maoriali's

225
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,800
cold tea.

226
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,760
Slow down.

227
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm done drinking.

228
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,160
I'll leave the bottle here.

229
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,840
I'll fetch you some water tomorrow.

230
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
You can take it.

231
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,360
Xin Xin.

232
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,200
Are we really going to die?

233
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,920
If we can't find the way tomorrow,

234
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,800
it'll be really dangerous.

235
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,520

00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,000
It's not easy to win the championship in such an international competition.

243
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You must reward them well when you come back.

244
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,400
Yes.

245
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,640
Your sister-in-law is here at this time.

246
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,480
I'll go and congratulate her first.

247
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,680
Hey, I'll tell you a good...

248
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,080
What?

249
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,280
Don't worry. I know.

250
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,880
Chief, what happened?

251
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,760
Yang Yang disappeared in the dark.

252
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
The hotel has called the police.

253
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,960
Yang Yang disappeared?

254
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,960
I got it.

255
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,920
I got it.

256
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,120
must be present.

257
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,680
Okay.

258
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,600
See you when Reporter Tang comes back.

259
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,000
Mr. Han.

260
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,080
This is the reform plan

261
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,720
of Mr. Ma's wife, Yang Laoyue.

262
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,600
Don't worry.

263
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,440
How about this?

264
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,840
I have a very important thing

265
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,400
to talk to Reporter Tang.

266
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,360
You help me check

267
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,440
when he will come back.

268
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,480
Got it.

269
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,320
Don't put salt in it.

270
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,080
I'll give it to you.

271
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,120
Let me do it.

272
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,680
Cheers.

273
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,440
Good job.

274
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,680
You eat too.

275
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,040
Okay.

276
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,640
I'll eat some.

277
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,080
Okay.

278
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,640
Alright.

279
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,840
See you.

280
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,760
Cheers.

281
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,800
Come on.

282
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,120
Captain.

283
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,680
What did they say?

284
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,400
Still wearing it?

285
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,840
Yi Teng.

286
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,720
You've been a soldier for two years.

287
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,320
But you've participated in such a high-quality competition.

288
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,760
You're better than many people in the competition.

289
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,280
Don't say that, Captain.

290
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,440
I can go abroad to compete.

291
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,520
It's all your contribution.

292
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,400
My growth is inseparable from yours.

293
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,120
Don't be so arrogant.

294
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
We're just assistants.

295
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,320
The key is to see your personal effort.

296
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,640
How about this?

297
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
I'll drink with you.

298
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,320
I'll drink.

299
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,400
I'll drink with you.

300
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,560
Cheers.

301
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,440
Cheers.

302
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,440
Good.

303
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,240
We dare not.

304
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,160
Otherwise, it's expensive.

305
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Anyway,

306
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,080
it's worth celebrating

307
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,040
for such a result today.

308
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:54,880
Cheers.

309
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,720
Cheers.

310
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,440
Come on.

311
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,400
One, two, three.

312
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,720
Cheers.

313
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,200
Captain Wu.

314
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,160
It's from Chinese Embassy.

315
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,920
Please take the call.

316
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:11,960
Okay.

317
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,240
Join us, sir.

318
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,760
Are you okay?

319
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,320
Hello.

320
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,120
What did he say?

321
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,840
Okay.

322
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,600
So good.

323
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,920
The officer of the military has given the order

324
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,920
to let four of us cooperate in this operation

325
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,880
to search for missing Chinese citizens.

326
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,480
Yes, sir.

327
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,360
So here we are.

328
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,120
This is the place.

329
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,000
There are too many tourists over here.

330
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,280
So,

331
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,120
you have to get out from here

332
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,240
and go into the forest.

333
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,560
You stay here,

334
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,480
maintaining for help and backup.

335
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,440
No, no, no.

336
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,760
Therefore, we have many people.

337
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,200
We better accommodate them

338
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,280
and get into the jungle.

339
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm sure someone has explained

340
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,520
the situation before you today set out.

341
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,200
I'm sure someone has explained

342
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,920
the situation before you today set out.

343
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
I'm sure someone has explained

344
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,320
the situation before you today set out.

345
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,800
But I need to repeat that mission.

346
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,840
Today for searching at least two Chinese citizens,

347
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,480
we're signed by the embassy

348
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,800
to carry out this joint application.

349
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,720
Since you're too familiar with the missing person,

350
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,120
therefore you were special allowed

351
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,720
cooperate with the police in the action.

352
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,200
However, no weapon is allowed.

353
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,960
For two of you,

354
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,920
our law have to be complied.

355
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:36,920
Got it.

356
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,440
These are the equipment.

357
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,560
Yes.

358
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,800
There are lots of wild animals in the forest.

359
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,640
So please,

360
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,760
don't harm them during the searching.

361
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,160
Sure.

362
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,800
Sure.

363
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,520
Thanks.

364
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,200
Okay.

365
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,920
Of course.

366
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,080
This forest is too big.

367
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,440
It's not a good idea to keep searching.

368
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,000
Let's split up.

369
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,040
I'll go with the police

370
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,080
and Cheng Yuan and Yi Dengong.

371
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,000
Report back to the police.

372
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,520
Got it.

373
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,000
I'll hold you.

374
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,800
Hold my hand.

375
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,760
Hold my hand.

376
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,920
Hold my hand.

377
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,040
Water.

378
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,720
It's the sound of water.

379
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,600
It's water.

380
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,880
Hurry up.

381
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,560
Come on.

382
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:53,960
Let's go.

383
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,600
Find water.

384
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,080
Water.

385
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,680
Hurry up.

386
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,840
No!

387
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,680
What is it?

388
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,380
Come on!

389
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,380
Be careful!

390
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:19,360
Hurry up!

391
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,520
Chen Miao, there's a crosswalk.

392
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,340
I'm gonna find them.

393
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,800
Copy that.

394
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,680
violations for taking orders from thelich

395
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:59,760
Many high-ranking officials

396
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,240
в This kind of panic

397
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,680
I understand. Are you okay?

398
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,200
No, I'm not. I'm so tired, man. Sorry.

399
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,120
The

400
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,000
Song Qing, we should have walked 5-6 kilometers, right?

401
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,280
It shouldn't be. Did they walk this far?

402
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,600
When people are nervous, they are lost. They don't even know how far they have walked.

403
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,400
I took Yangyang to travel during the holidays.

404
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,040
I taught him.

405
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,920
If he gets lost,

406
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,640
he can make a mark on the tree.

407
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,160
I didn't see it all the way here.

408
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,760
Let's go.

409
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,320

This is a road.

00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,160
Their physical strength

421
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,360
shouldn't be so weak.

422
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,960
They might follow the road.

423
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,560
Be careful.

424
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,360
Slow down.

425
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,160
Wait for me.

426
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360

Don't leave me here alone.

I'll go with you.

436
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,360
Your legs are like this.

437
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,960
You should get some strength.

438
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,960
I'll go find the road

439
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,560
