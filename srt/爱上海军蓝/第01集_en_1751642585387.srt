1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,200
We hug this piece of blue sky

2
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,600
The end of the good time is me who never changes

3
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,200
I don't need to endure the endless anger

4
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,800
I want to be my own friend and opponent

5
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,600
No one is looking at you when you look back

6
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,400
To be you is not worth it

7
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,000
To be you is not worth it

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,800
To be you is not worth it

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,080
哈哈哈

10
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,840
Chief

11
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,560
Chief

12
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,360
Chief

13
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,920
Chief

14
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,080
Chief

15
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,200
Comrades, be careful.

16
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,600
I'll start with a fire strike.

17
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
I expect to destroy 80% of the target.

18
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,640
Your task is to use the fire to

19
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,200
take advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness and quickly land on the shore.

20
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,600
Destroy the enemy's wireless communication relay station.

21
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,400
Make a condition for the whole army to land.

22
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,200
Make sure to complete the task as soon as possible.

23
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,400
Yes.

24
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,000
Fire.

25
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,800
Fire.

26
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,000
Fire.

27
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,400
Team A, I'm the commander.

28
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,000
Pay attention to your team entering the enemy's area.

29
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,000
I got it.

30
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,000
Team B, pay attention to your reconnaissance.

31
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,600
Increase your alert. Don't expose yourself.

32
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,200
Lei Yao, I spotted the enemy's fire on the road.

33
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,800
I got it.

34
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,000
You...

35
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,200
You are...

36
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,900
Lei Yao,

37
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:54,400
the road at the crown prince's place is covered with bristles,

38
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
L.A.O.

39
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,760
On the way,

40
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,760
a patrol team found you.

41
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,760
Distance 170.

42
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
L.A.O. has blocked the four o'clock direction of the fire.

43
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Pay attention to the surrounding situation and report at any time.

44
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
L.A.O.

45
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Two people were found in the direction of two o'clock.

46
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Distance 140.

47
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Two degrees fifty.

48
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
They are coming.

49
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
We need to find De隆.

50
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Please.

51
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
That way.

52
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
That way?

53
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
We need to go out, go and check it.

54
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Yes, sir.

55
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Get out from that direction.

56
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Yes, sir.

57
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
certain production group.

58
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
No��!

59
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Shoot.

60
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Han Yang, my team paid off.

61
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
We have such aMike trawler arrived.

62
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,640
Where is the dead guy?

63
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,780
There he is.

64
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
solider

65
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,000
I see.

66
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,520
這個

67
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:38,740
Keep right of the target.

68
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:47,180
Fire!

69
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,180
Report!

70
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,180
Come in.

71
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,180
Commander,

72
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,180
our brigade has completed the mission

73
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,180
and the special forces are ready to go.

74
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,180
Please give us instructions.

75
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,180
The whole exercise was a success.

76
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,180
Your brigade's performance was excellent.

77
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,180
Thank you, Commander.

78
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,180
I will be in charge of the special forces.

79
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,180
I will be in charge of the special forces.

80
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,180
I will be in charge of the special forces.

81
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,180
I will be in charge of the special forces.

82
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,180
I will be in charge of the special forces.

83
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,180
Thank you, Commander.

84
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,180
Report!

85
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,180
Come in.

86
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,180
Report, Commander.

87
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,180
We received an emergency rescue signal.

88
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,180
The ocean of the Yangtze River is on fire.

89
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,180
There are no sea-level patrol ships nearby.

90
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,180
We received a warning from the superior

91
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,180
to take action to rescue the troops.

92
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,180
The ship is closest to the sea of the accident.

93
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,180
The landing ship of the special forces

94
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,180
is only three nautical miles away from the sea of the accident.

95
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,180
Wolf,

96
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,180
send people to search the rescue.

97
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,180
Yes.

98
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,180
Hurry up!

99
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,180
Hurry up!

100
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,180
Hurry up!

101
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,180
Hurry up!

102
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,180
Hurry up!

103
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,180
Hurry up!

104
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,180
Wait!

105
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,180
Where is Director Han?

106
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,180
I didn't see him.

107
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,180
Is he still inside?

108
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,180
Where are you going?

109
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,180
He's on fire. We can't leave him alone.

110
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,180
Help!

111
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,180
Anyone?

112
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,180
Anyone?

113
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,180
Help!

114
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,180
Report!

115
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,180
The man has rushed to rescue the sea of the accident.

116
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,180
He's on fire.

117
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,180
Help!

118
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,180
Anyone?

119
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,180
Director Han!

120
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,180
Director Han, are you inside?

121
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,180
I saw him.

122
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,180
Let's go!

123
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,180
We can't get out. It's difficult.

124
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,180
One, two, three!

125
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,180
Don't be late! It's too hot!

126
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,180
Go!

127
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,180
Find a way to the door!

128
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,180
Go!

129
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,180
Hold on!

130
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,180
Go!

131
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,180
Go!

132
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,180
Go!

133
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,180
Hold on!

134
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,180
Hold on!

135
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,180
Director Han, don't worry.

136
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,180
I won't leave you alone.

137
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,180
I'll find a way.

138
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,180
You can't find it.

139
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,180
Hold on!

140
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,180
This is the equipment.

141
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,180
Let's go!

142
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,180
Help!

143
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,180
Help!

144
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,180
Don't move!

145
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,180
Hold on!

146
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,180
Don't move!

147
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,180
Get down!

148
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,180
Be careful!

149
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,180
Slowly!

150
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,180
Go!

151
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,180
Go!

152
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,180
Wei Ming!

153
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,180
Sit down!

154
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,180
Sit down! It's dangerous!

155
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,180
No! It's dangerous!

156
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,180
Where's Xin Nian?

157
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,180
Didn't she go to see you?

158
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,180
Wasn't she with you?

159
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,180
Yes, but...

160
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,180
She didn't come to see me!

161
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,180
Go!

162
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,180
Go!

163
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,180
Go!

164
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,180
Attention!

165
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,180
Comrade Brigadier Li,

166
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,180
the Blue Team

167
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,180
is ordered to carry out the task of rescuing the people on the sea.

168
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,180
The task is completed.

169
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,180
All the people in danger are rescued.

170
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,180
Please give your instructions.

171
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,180
Thank you for your hard work today.

172
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,180
Take the troops back.

173
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,180
Comrade Brigadier Li,

174
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,180
Captain Wu Si is asking for punishment.

175
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,180
Yi Nan Wang didn't get into the attack position

176
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,180
and shot the gun in advance.

177
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,180
This led to the team's exposure.

178
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,180
What do you think?

179
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,180
Captain,

180
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,180
Yi Nan Wang is a trained soldier.

181
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,180
It's his first time in the drill.

182
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,180
He rarely cooperates with his teammates.

183
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,180
It's not his problem.

184
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,180
I didn't treat him well.

185
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,180
The Blue Team needs three missions.

186
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,180
Do you think Yi Nan Wang

187
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,180
can complete the three missions independently?

188
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,180
He usually shoots zero,

189
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,180
digs people, diving,

190
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,180
high-altitude diving,

191
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,180
and shallow penetration.

192
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,180
Which one of them can master it?

193
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,180
He performed like this

194
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,180
when he first participated in the drill.

195
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,180
It means he's not good at anti-pressure.

196
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,180
I'm talking about the matter now.

197
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,180
Do you think

198
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,180
he's qualified to officially join the Blue Team?

199
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,180
Captain,

200
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,180
Yi Nan Wang has been a trained member for a while.

201
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,180
He does have a short-term training.

202
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,180
This time,

203
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,180
his performance was not good enough.

204
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,180
But he is capable and capable.

205
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,180
I want to keep him and treat him well.

206
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,180
I can definitely bring him out.

207
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,180
You want to keep him?

208
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,180
Do you know how much resources and effort

209
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,180
the country will need to build

210
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,180
a special team like the Blue Team?

211
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,180
Captain.

212
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,180
Enough.

213
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,180
The issue of Yi Nan Wang's flow

214
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,180
is freely considered by the organization.

215
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,180
Listen.

216
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,180
If you fail the transfer exam,

217
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,180
no one will be able to apply for it.

218
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,180
Captain.

219
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,180
Hai.

220
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,180
Director Tian.

221
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,180
What can I do for you?

222
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,180
Where is Tang Xin?

223
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,180
Xin was slightly injured.

224
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,180
She's in the hospital.

225
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,180
Are you okay?

226
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,180
Director Tian.

227
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,180
You saw the scene at that time.

228
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,180
The transfer was cancelled.

229
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,180
But fortunately,

230
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,180
Xin was lucky.

231
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,180
It's a good thing.

232
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,180
Xin Xin.

233
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,180
I'm sorry.

234
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,180
I'm sorry.

235
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,180
Xin Xin.

236
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,180
Xin Lang.

237
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,180
Xin Lang.

238
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,180
This...

239
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,180
Why am I in the hospital?

240
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,180
You...

241
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,180
You're still so shy to say it.

242
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,180
You're fine.

243
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,180
Why are you so arrogant?

244
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,180
Why are you sailing?

245
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,180
Why are you sailing?

246
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,180
It's dangerous.

247
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,180
Come here.

248
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,180
Do you know?

249
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,180
If it weren't for Hai Jun's comrades,

250
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,180
your life would be almost gone.

251
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,180
Do you know?

252
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,180
Are you okay?

253
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,180
Mom.

254
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,180
Where is my comrade?

255
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,180
Where did he go?

256
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,180
He went back to the army.

257
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,180
He can't stay here and guard you.

258
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,180
When did he go back?

259
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,180
No.

260
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,180
I'm just...

261
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,180
You...

262
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,180
What are you doing?

263
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,180
You're just going to break into my shoes.

264
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,180
You're being too fierce.

265
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,180
You're not eating anything.

266
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,180
Tang Xin is good.

267
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,180
Of course.

268
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,180
Who am I to explain?

269
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,180
You...

270
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,180
You should edit this video

271
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,180
again.

272
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,180
Make Tang Xin's scene

273
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,180
bigger.

274
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,180
I understand.

275
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,180
We're having a meeting today.

276
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,180
We're mainly discussing

277
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,180
Yi Nan Wang's performance in this performance.

278
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,180
First, I'll do a self-review.

279
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,180
Yi Nan Wang's performance in this performance was poor.

280
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,180
As the captain,

281
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,180
I have a certain responsibility.

282
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,180
Captain.

283
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,180
Yi Nan Wang's performance was poor.

284
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,180
You're doing a review.

285
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,180
What do you mean?

286
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,180
Captain is worried about his transfer test.

287
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,180
No way.

288
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,180
Our transfer was not a life-or-death

289
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,180
practice.

290
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,180
It's not just this practice.

291
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,180
Captain.

292
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,180
I didn't do well.

293
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,180
I didn't perform well in training.

294
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,180
This practice

295
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,180
was my mistake.

296
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,180
I made everyone know.

297
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,180
I'm sorry.

298
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,180
Knowing your shortcomings is also a progress.

299
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,180
Go back and strengthen your training.

300
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,180
Don't feel guilty.

301
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,180
I was a pre-trained member

302
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,180
who was temporarily replaced.

303
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,180
If the test doesn't pass,

304
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,180
I'll go back to the old company and continue to train.

305
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,180
One day, I'll come back to the Blue Team.

306
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,180
Why do you always think about going back to the old company?

307
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,180
If you want to train, train here.

308
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,180
The Blue Team doesn't have a soldier who can't be trained.

309
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,180
That's right.

310
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,180
Chen Yuan.

311
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,180
Does the Blue Team have a saying that they can't pass the test?

312
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,180
No.

313
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,180
Did you hear that?

314
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,180
If you want to enter, enter once.

315
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,180
Don't leave your hand behind.

316
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,180
Yes.

317
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,180
Louder.

318
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,180
Yes.

319
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,180
Go back and train.

320
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,180
Yes.

321
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,180
Hello.

322
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,180
I want to ask.

323
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,180
From the injured female reporter

324
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,180
who was sent from Dayan Jiao,

325
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,180
which room does she live in?

326
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,180
I'm from the Reconnaissance Team.

327
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,180
I'm here to see you on behalf of the team.

328
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,180
Who?

329
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,180
I've paid for this.

330
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,180
Old captain.

331
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,180
Wang Lang.

332
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,180
That's good.

333
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,180
That's good.

334
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,180
Long time no see.

335
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,180
Really?

336
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,180
It's my fault. I went to see you.

337
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,180
Why are you so angry?

338
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,180
Wait a minute.

339
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,180
You...

340
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,180
You go back.

341
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,180
I'm going to the Blue Team.

342
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,180
I'm going to the Blue Team.

343
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,180
I'm going to the Blue Team.

344
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,180
I'm going to the Blue Team.

345
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,180
I'm going to the Blue Team.

346
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,180
You go back.

347
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,180
My...

348
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,180
Go back.

349
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,180
Go back.

350
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,180
My dad...

351
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,180
I have an emergency.

352
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,180
Can you stop me?

353
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,180
What emergency?

354
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,180
Your emergency is my emergency.

355
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,180
Don't.

356
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,180
Sister-in-law.

357
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,180
Xin Xin.

358
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,180
You don't recognize me?

359
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,180
Uncle Wang.

360
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,180
Go in.

361
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,180
Xin Xin, I heard about your

362
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,180
advice to Yongwei.

363
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,180
Uncle Wang.

364
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,180
I didn't send this fake news.

365
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,180
I was just going to solve this.

366
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,180
I'm at least

367
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,180
a good person.

368
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,180
I'm not following.

369
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,180
The one who really saved people is the Navy...

370
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,180
What?

371
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,180
Uncle Wang.

372
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,180
Aren't you from the Navy?

373
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,180
You must know who saved me, right?

374
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,180
The army has rules.

375
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,180
I have no right to

376
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,180
disclose any information to you.

377
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,180
What?

378
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,180
I'm going to have an interview.

379
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,180
Is that okay?

380
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,180
You can apply for an interview.

381
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,180
But you have to wait for the review.

382
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,180
After the review,

383
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,180
you have to see the personal will of the warrior.

384
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,180
If he doesn't want to,

385
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,180
I can't help it.

386
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,180
What is the advice to Yongwei?

387
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,180
I can't even get into

388
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,180
what I'm saying.

389
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,180
I'm sorry.

390
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,180
Here.

391
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,180
No, I can't.

392
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,180
My eyes are blurry.

393
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,180
Hurry up.

394
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,180
What are you doing?

395
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,180
I'm following.

396
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,180
I just said I'm following.

397
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,180
I'm from the Navy.

398
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,180
You can follow?

399
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,180
You're really my girlfriend.

400
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,180
When did you say

401
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,180
you have no right to disclose?

402
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,180
I'm not following.

403
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,180
Dad, dad, dad.

404
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,180
Can you let go of me?

405
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,180
If you don't let go,

406
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,180
I can't make it.

407
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,180
Let go.

408
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,180
You're so strong.

409
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,180
I'm saying goodbye.

410
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,180
I'm leaving.

411
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,180
Take care.

412
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,180
I'm going.

413
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,180
Goodbye.

414
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,180
Slow down.

415
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,180
Captain Wang,

416
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,180
is Xinxin okay?

417
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,180
She's following you.

418
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,180
She's fine.

419
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
Besides,

420
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,180
at this time,

421
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,180
she's gone to the unit.

422
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,180
It's a waste of time.

423
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,180
Is it your disease

424
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,180
that you're saving her?

425
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,180
How are you?

426
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,180
Are you okay?

427
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,180
Don't worry.

428
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,180
Everyone is fine.

429
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,180
Xinxin is good too.

430
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,180
How brave.

431
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,180
Xin is good.

432
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,180
She's so good.

433
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,180
She's still young.

434
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,180
When she becomes a family,

435
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,180
she'll be stable.

436
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,180
That's right.

437
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,180
This girl

438
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,180
really has to become a family.

439
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,180
She's been busy all day.

440
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,180
She's been looking for someone to take care of her.

441
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,180
Do you have

442
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,180
any good soldiers in your family?

443
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,180
Old captain,

444
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,180
I remember Xinxin

445
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,180
saying since she was a child

446
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,180
that she won't marry a soldier.

447
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,180
She's a mouthful.

448
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,180
I don't know

449
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,180
what I'm thinking.

450
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,180
Her personality

451
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,180
is suitable for marrying soldiers.

452
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,180
Think about it.

453
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,180
Old captain, I...

454
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,180
Don't say it.

455
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,180
There's really one.

456
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,180
Who?

457
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,180
I mean, your wound.

458
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,180
You should get a bandage.

459
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,180
I've already got it.

460
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,180
It's fine.

461
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,180
This female reporter

462
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,180
is really...

463
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,180
We saved her.

464
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,180
She had to send a message

465
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,180
to suggest that she's the one who saved her.

466
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,180
She's also saving people.

467
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,180
I'm not happy

468
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,180
to see you hurt.

469
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,180
I mean,

470
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,180
shouldn't you

471
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,180
take care of your expression?

472
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,180
Wait.

473
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,180
Look at this tattoo.

474
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,180
It's like Brigadier Er Lian Ling.

475
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,180
Zhong Qing.

476
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,180
Yes.

477
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,180
Brigadier.

478
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,180
Repeat what you said.

479
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,180
The brave and brave woman.

480
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,180
Who's the one who raised her head?

481
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,180
You're all on me.

482
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,180
Where did this tattoo come from?

483
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,180
Don't you know?

484
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,180
Sir.

485
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,180
We sent it

486
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,180
without any hesitation.

487
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,180
It's good that you know.

488
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,180
Brigadier.

489
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,180
Have you seen that female reporter?

490
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,180
How is she?

491
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,180
She's fine.

492
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,180
She's out of the hospital.

493
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,180
I'll go and check.

494
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,180
Okay.

495
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,180
Thank you.

496
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,180
Brigadier.

497
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,180
What do you wear when you go out?

498
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,180
Brigadier.

499
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,180
I only have a few clothes.

500
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,180
I don't know which one you mean.

501
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,180
I just

502
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,180
look a little cool.

503
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,180
Brigadier.

504
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,180
Are you going on a business trip?

505
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,180
It's a big deal.

506
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,180
Come out with me at six o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

507
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,180
You can go and ask for leave.

508
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,180
Yes.

509
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,180
Blind date?

510
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,180
What are you talking about?

511
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,180
It's such an ancient game.

512
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,180
How can you two think of it?

513
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,180
What do you mean by ancient?

514
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,180
Your mother and I

515
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,180
are dating.

516
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,180
That's right.

517
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,180
How can you say this is a game?

518
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,180
You're too serious.

519
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,180
Dad, mom.

520
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,180
If you think I'm a family man,

521
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,180
just tell me.

522
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,180
Why are you so stubborn?

523
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,180
I just walked around the ghost gate.

524
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,180
Stop it.

525
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,180
Don't do this.

526
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,180
I don't know what kind of body you have.

527
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,180
Go or not go,

528
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,180
just say a word of relief.

529
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,180
Of course I won't go.

530
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,180
I don't know anyone.

531
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,180
I met for the first time.

532
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,180
I'm going to date and get married.

533
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,180
I have two grandpas by my side.

534
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,180
I'm not going to do silly things.

535
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,180
If you don't want to do silly things,

536
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,180
you can do it.

537
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,180
Then you can bring a young man back

538
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,180
and let us see.

539
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,180
I'm not in a hurry.

540
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,180
Why are you two in a hurry?

541
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,180
What do you think we are in a hurry?

542
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,180
You're a news reporter.

543
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,180
You're always on the news.

544
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,180
How much are you worrying about?

545
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,180
Can't you find someone to take care of you?

546
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,180
Yes.

547
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,180
You count how old you are.

548
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,180
I'm not that old.

549
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,180
Besides,

550
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,180
love is not suitable.

551
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,180
It's not suitable.

552
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,180
If it's not suitable,

553
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,180
we can always find a match.

554
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,180
Yes.

555
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,180
When you're suitable,

556
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,180
we'll go to the nursing home.

557
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,180
Don't be so self-conceited.

558
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,180
Don't be a soldier.

559
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,180
You have to obey the order.

560
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,180
Yes.

561
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,180
Yes.

562
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,180
Okay.

563
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,180
You...

564
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,180
I see you two

565
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,180
support me so much.

566
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,180
Tell me.

567
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,180
What's the relationship?

568
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,180
Who is it like?

569
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,180
What are you doing?

570
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,180
Are you a soldier?

571
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,180
No need to ask.

572
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,180
Matching you

573
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,180
is a good match.

574
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,180
So,

575
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,180
you want me to find a soldier?

576
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,180
Why don't you ask Mr. Wang

577
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,180
to find the person

578
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,180
who saved me from the big deal?

579
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,180
Maybe...

580
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,180
You think you're buying vegetables?

581
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,180
You're so picky.

582
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,180
Be serious.

583
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,180
Hold on.

584
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,180
If you drop it,

585
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,180
you'll be drunk for two hours.

586
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,180
Hold on.

587
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,180
How is it?

588
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,180
What are you practicing?

589
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,180
Pay attention to the distance

590
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,180
between the three points.

591
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,180
What's that look?

592
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,180
Are you okay?

593
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,180
I want to have a match with Yi Nan Wang.

594
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,180
I've filled the quota.

595
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,180
You've filled the quota?

596
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,180
If you're done,

597
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,180
give her my quota.

598
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,180
You don't want to be the one to go?

599
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,180
What should I do then?

600
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,180
Where's Ji Xun?

601
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,180
I'm afraid

602
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,180
she can't wait until the day she's trained.

603
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,180
Yang Yang, wait for me.

604
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,180
Why are you walking so fast?

605
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,180
I saw it just now.

606
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,180
She vomited in the toilet.

607
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,180
What are you talking about?

608
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,180
I didn't vomit.

609
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,180
Who said I vomited?

610
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,180
You said our classmates have been together for so long.

611
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,180
I know you.

612
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,180
There's a class in the afternoon.

613
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,180
There's a class on stage waiting for you.

614
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,180
Okay, I won't say it.

615
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,180
You said you vomited from the first step to the complete one.

616
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,180
You vomited again.

617
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,180
You've graduated.

618
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,180
You can't sell this class.

619
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,180
I'm sorry to the teacher.

620
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,180
I want to drink milk tea.

621
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,180
Why don't you go to the milk tea shop with me?

622
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,180
I don't want to drink it.

623
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,180
There's a class in the afternoon.

624
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,180
I'll show you a video to relieve your boredom.

625
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,180
Come on.

626
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,180
Hurry up.

627
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,180
My goodness.

628
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,180
I'm sorry.

629
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,180
I'm sorry.

630
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,180
I'm sorry.

631
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,180
I'm sorry.

632
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,180
I'm sorry.

633
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,180
I'm sorry.

634
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,180
The flight is going up.

635
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,180
No.

636
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,180
I'm sorry.

637
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,180
What's wrong with you?

638
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,180
Why did you go to the sea?

639
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,180
Did you watch the news?

640
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,180
Not only me.

641
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,180
The whole world saw it.

642
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,180
What's wrong with you?

643
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,180
I read the news that you were caught in the sea.

644
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,180
How can I say that?

645
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,180
But I'm relieved to hear that you're okay.

646
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,180
Why did you go to the sea?

647
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,180
I received the news and did a thorough investigation.

648
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,180
When the media didn't see it,

649
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:44,980
Fortunately, there was a navy

650
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,180
Our big news is out of the hospital so soon.

651
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,180
Mr. Tian, did you send this news?

652
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
Yes.

653
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,180
What's wrong?

654
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,180
The typical two-turned-reviews have all gone up.

655
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,180
It's not up.

656
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,180
It's also a fake news that hasn't been confirmed.

657
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,180
You hurry up and withdraw it.

658
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,180
Why is it a fake news?

659
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,180
You're not the one who saved people.

660
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,180
You're not the one who saved people.

661
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,180
Yes, but I was caught by someone.

662
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,180
What's wrong with you?

663
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,180
What we reported is the truth.

664
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,180
How the netizens interpret it is their own business.

665
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,180
Do a good job.

666
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,180
Then I'll be all open.

667
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,180
I'm going to be a net celebrity.

668
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,180
What kind of net celebrity am I?

669
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,180
You pushed the wrong person.

670
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:22,180
You should push the soldiers of the navy.

671
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,180
They saved people.

672
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,180
I can't stand this honor.

673
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,180
Tang Xin, you've been a reporter for so long.

674
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,180
You're far from a reporter.

675
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,180
The social topic is more sensitive.

676
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,180
Who can guarantee the filial piety?

677
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,180
Okay, I'll guarantee it.

678
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,180
Leave it to me.

679
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,180
Mr. Han.

680
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,180
Hold it.

681
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,180
Mr. Han, don't worry.

682
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,180
I won't leave you alone.

683
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,180
I'll go find the tools.

684
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,180
You wait for me.

685
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,180
Yu Hao.

686
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:12,180
I just heard that the ship was on fire.

687
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,180
Are you okay?

688
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,180
I'm fine.

689
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,180
I've sat down.

690
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,180
Yesterday, I went to the hospital to check.

691
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,180
The doctor said that it's nothing.

692
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,180
It's just that the smoke has been stuck in it.

693
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,180
It's good to be okay.

694
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,180
I said you went out to play.

695
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,180
You tell me.

696
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,180
I'll give you the yacht.

697
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,180
Why did you go fishing?

698
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,180
I'm not going to play this time.

699
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,180
I have something to do.

700
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,180
Something?

701
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,180
What can you do out of the sea?

702
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,180
I have a friend.

703
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,180
I heard that someone was fishing in the sea near the Yangtze River.

704
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,180
He was fishing for the relics of the ship.

705
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,180
So he wanted to investigate.

706
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,180
But he didn't have a boat.

707
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,180
He could only ask me for help.

708
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,180
I heard.

709
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,180
You went there just because you heard it?

710
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,180
Where did you hear it?

711
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:08,180
Someone sent a lot of clues to his mailbox.

712
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:14,180
So that person also hopes that our local media in Wenzhou can intervene in the investigation.

713
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,180
Just so happen that my friend is a reporter.

714
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,180
This is what he should be looking at.

715
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,180
Be careful.

716
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,180
I'm a director of the Mingshua King.

717
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,180
Why don't you report the election and go out to sea to shoot?

718
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,180
You are not a reporter in the social media.

719
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,180
You are the chief editor of the media center.

720
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,180
If you have any good questions, you'd better tell me.

721
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:38,180
I haven't done anything yet.

722
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,180
What if I don't get anything?

723
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,180
I can't be a leader.

724
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,180
Yes, I have a dream.

725
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,180
I will definitely tell you.

726
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,180
Then you must support me in my work.

727
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,180
You support me first.

728
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,180
Don't leave this place.

729
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,180
Except for your work.

730
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:58,180
If you don't want to leave, I can only tell you the truth in my own way.

731
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,180
Leave, leave, leave.

732
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,180
Captain.

733
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,180
Brigadier Wang.

734
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,180
Long time no see.

735
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,180
It's not that.

736
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,180
Let me introduce you.

737
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,180
This is Wu Si.

738
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,180
The captain of the Blue Town Assault Team of the Navy Special Forces.

739
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,180
The best soldier I've ever taken.

740
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,180
Hello, I'm Tang Yuanchao.

741
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,180
Hello, Mr. Tang.

742
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,180
Sit down.

743
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,180
You can sit down if the captain asks you to.

744
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,180
Yes.

745
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,180
Your sister-in-law didn't come?

746
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,180
Your sister-in-law?

747
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,180
She didn't come.

748
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,180
She...

749
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,180
She is afraid that I will fight with Xiao Zuo Feng later.

750
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,180
That's good.

751
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,180
Sit down.

752
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,180
Hello.

753
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,180
How are you?

754
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,180
I'm fine.

755
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,180
I've been busy in the ship for half a lifetime.

756
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,180
Now I'm in the night shift.

757
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,180
Is your sister-in-law happy?

758
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,180
Why is she happy?

759
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,180
I was not at home every day before.

760
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,180
Now I'm at home every day after I'm in the night shift.

761
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,180
She asked me to go out every day.

762
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,180
You...

763
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,180
How are you?

764
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,180
Did Lin Lan come back?

765
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,180
Not yet.

766
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,180
It's okay.

767
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,180
You are still young.

768
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,180
You have a long way to go.

769
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,180
Don't talk about me.

770
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,180
Where is Xin Xin?

771
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
She is here.

772
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,180
She is very busy recently.

773
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,180
You can sit down first.

774
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,180
I'll make a call first.

775
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,180
Sit down.

776
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,180
Relax.

777
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,180
Captain.

778
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,180
We are...

779
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,180
Let me introduce you to someone.

780
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,180
Okay.

781
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,180
Mr. Tang's daughter.

782
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,180
That's too sudden.

783
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,180
So what?

784
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,180
I told you in advance.

785
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,180
You have to find a way to deal with me.

786
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,180
But...

787
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,180
Don't but.

788
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,180
Sit down.

789
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,180
Mr. Tang, why are you rushing?

790
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,180
I'm almost there.

791
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,180
Don't forget the blind date.

792
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,180
Don't worry.

793
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,180
Why are you so happy?

794
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,180
Something is wrong with you.

795
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,180
I'm just trying to respond to your call.

796
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,180
Okay, see you later.

797
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,180
Don't rush.

798
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,180
Okay.

799
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,180
Don't hang up.

800
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,180
We are at the parking lot.

801
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,180
We'll go upstairs soon.

802
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,180
Listen.

803
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,180
Your uncle is here.

804
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,180
Wait.

805
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,180
Say hello.

806
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,180
Say hello.

807
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,180
Hello, Uncle Wang.

808
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,180
You are here.

809
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,180
It's so hard to find a restaurant.

810
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,180
I've been walking around for three rounds.

811
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,180
There's no parking space.

812
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,180
Say something.

813
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:11,180
Your destination, Momo Cafe, is 200 meters ahead.

814
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,180
Okay.

815
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,180
Uncle Wang, say hello.

816
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,180
Hello.

817
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,180
Hello.

818
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,180
Okay.

819
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,180
Uncle Wang, I'll park the car and stop talking.

820
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,180
You guys eat first.

821
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,180
Don't wait for me.

822
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,180
Say something.

823
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,180
Hello.

824
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,180
I'm Wu Si.

825
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,180
See you later.

826
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,180
Okay.

827
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,180
Good.

828
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,180
Don't be so stubborn.

829
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,180
Sit down.

830
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,180
Hello.

831
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,180
You are hurt?

832
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,180
I'm disappointed.

833
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,180
It's okay.

834
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,180
Is your bone okay?

835
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,180
It's okay.

836
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,180
I know.

837
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,180
Okay.

838
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,180
Old captain.

839
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,180
I'm sorry.

840
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,180
I have to go back in advance.

841
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,180
Then you go first.

842
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,180
Give me this 32.

843
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,180
No.

844
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,180
Call me Wu Si.

845
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,180
Just leave him with me.

846
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,180
Okay.

847
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,180
I'm leaving.

848
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,180
Go.

849
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,180
I'll see you out.

850
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,180
Go.

851
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,180
Go back.

852
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,180
Captain.

853
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,180
Since you are here,

854
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,180
I won't be a deserter.

855
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,180
I just want to see you off.

856
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,180
You are so stingy.

857
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,180
Captain.

858
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,180
I didn't mean to be stingy.

859
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,180
You are so quiet.

860
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,180
I brought you here this time.

861
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,180
I'm praising the sea.

862
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,180
Be more reserved.

863
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,180
The workers will be here soon.

864
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,180
You should take the initiative.

865
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,180
Yes.

866
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,180
I'll report to you when I get back.

867
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,180
I'll report to you immediately.

868
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,180
Drink some water.

869
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,180
I parked the car in Hainan.

870
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,180
Hello, dad.

871
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,180
Thank you.

872
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,180
Are you parking or building a car?

873
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,180
Are you going upstairs now?

874
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,180
What's wrong?

875
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,180
I'm already upstairs.

876
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,180
I'm still in the cabin.

877
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,180
Well...

878
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,180
Wait a minute.

879
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,180
Well...

880
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,180
No.

881
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,180
You...

882
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,180
Who are you dating?

883
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,180
Isn't he the guy you introduced?

884
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,180
Dad, you have a good taste.

885
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,180
Maybe you can make it.

886
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,180
What?

887
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,180
He's here.

888
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,180
Who can you date?

889
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,180
What's wrong?

890
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,180
What a coincidence.

891
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,180
But I think he's a good guy.

892
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,180
Little Duoduo.

893
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,180
Fine.

894
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,180
You can play this trick with me.

895
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,180
No matter where you are now,

896
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,180
come here right now.

897
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,180
Do you hear me?

898
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,180
No.

899
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,180
I can't go back now.

900
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,180
Maybe this time

901
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,180
it's my destiny.

902
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,180
Okay.

903
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,180
I'll go back to tell you.

904
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,180
Bye.

905
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,180
You...

906
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,180
I'm so mad.

907
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:45,180
The blue sky is so blue.

908
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,180
My heart is so cruel.

909
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:53,180
I miss you so much.

910
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,180
You block the clouds for me.

911
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:01,180
You always take the burden silently.

912
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:07,180
The long road can make me feel at ease.

913
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:12,180
People don't show romance.

914
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,180
The dream is so ordinary.

915
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:22,180
But you have more expectations in your heart.

916
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,180
I really don't understand.

917
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:30,180
You say love is so confusing.

918
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:36,180
But you give me the answer with your eyes.

919
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:44,180
I can exchange all my heart with you.

920
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:51,180
Thank you for waking up the courage that used to be weak.

921
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,180
Let all coincidences be the same.

922
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,180
Let all the simple things be white.

923
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:03,180
Let all the years be bright.

924
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:08,180
The blue sea can't separate us.

925
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,180
You are waiting for the warm star.

926
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:17,180
I will never forget your answer.

927
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:22,180
I will never forget your time.

928
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:26,180
I will never forget your love.

929
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:30,180
I will never regret.

930
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:34,180
Let all the happiness be the same.

931
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:38,180
Let all the things be the same.

932
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,180
Thank you for being by my side.

933
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:45,180
Let all the darkness be the same.

934
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,180
The bigger the world, the more lonely it is.

935
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,180
Only standing by your side,

936
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:59,180
I feel the warmth in my heart.
