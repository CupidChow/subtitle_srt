1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,440
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,260
Although the theme is old-fashioned,

3
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,340
there are few people who analyze the professional comparison

4
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,220
based on medical ingredients.

5
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,340
Send it to me.

6
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,340
I'll find your colleagues

7
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,540
to send it to you.

8
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,060
Watch the feedback of the netizens.

9
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,940
Then,

10
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,540
find some friends of the self-media

11
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,780
to give you some compensation.

12
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,700
Okay, I'll listen to you.

13
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,780
When the reading volume is increased,

14
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,340
I can let my dad see.

15
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,640
Don't say that I'm a real person.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm a real person.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,760
Are you my best friend?

18
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,160
I want to take you out to play.

19
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,800
But you don't want to.

20
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,960
You care about your small vault, right?

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
The ticket and hotel

22
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,320
are all gone.

23
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,720
No, I care about it.

24
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,720
I just started working

25
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,800
with my friends.

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,920
I don't dare to ask for leave.

27
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,960
So,

28
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,440
I can only let you go with me.

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,560
Please.

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,320
I know

31
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,620
I'm a betrayer.

32
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,380
I'm not sincere at all.

33
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,540
I won't go.

34
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,740
I have a lot of things to do.

35
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,580
Sister,

36
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,660
just give yourself a break.

37
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,100
You can't finish your work.

38
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,220
Go out and charge the electricity.

39
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,740
You can't come back and play outside.

40
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,580
Who are you waiting for?

41
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,860
No one.

42
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,540
Is it Wu Si?

43
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,420
No.

44
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,980
Who is it?

45
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,220
You've been staring at your phone for a day.

46
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,380
Who is so important?

47
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,980
Not important.

48
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,740
Not important at all.

49
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,060
If it's not important,

50
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,180
just put your phone away.

51
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:20,740
If you keep staring,

52
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,860
you'll break the phone.

53
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,860
You can't get it back.

54
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,780
You can't get it back.

55
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,780
You can't get it back.

56
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,060
I'm not a good person.

57
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,060
I'm not a good person.

58
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,880
If you keep staring,

59
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,360
you'll break the phone.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Orange.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm done.

62
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,700
I'm done.

63
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,460
You're eating so clean.

64
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,300
The number you dialed

65
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,500
is currently unavailable.

66
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,700
Please try again later.

67
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,700
Okay.

68
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,740
The number you dialed is currently unavailable.

69
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,260
Please try again later.

70
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,460
Who's calling?

71
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,060
Are you playing hide-and-seek?

72
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,660
If you don't answer it,

73
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,660
do you believe me?

74
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,500
Have you used up your phone?

75
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,060
What?

76
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,900
You can't find Wu Si, can you?

77
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,500
You lost contact.

78
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,760
You're thinking about it.

79
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,160
Who's thinking about it?

80
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,760
I'm thinking about my draft.

81
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
You're so stubborn.

82
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,360
I'll help you and Wang Lang

83
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
to get your eyes checked.

84
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
No need.

85
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
No need.

86
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
I don't want to know.

87
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,960
Okay, I'm going to rest.

88
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
You can go out.

89
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,640
It's really...

90
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,200
It's really in my heart.

91
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,000
It's really in my heart.

92
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
It's really in my heart.

93
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
I'm so upset.

94
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
I'm so upset.

95
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Just saying it.

96
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,160
I told you to ask me.

97
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,600
Shijie.

98
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,160
We didn't do anything wrong.

99
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,160
We just wouldn't have parts.

100
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
Li Zhe.

101
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,160
They only did their best.

102
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,360
Theyaser forces.

103
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Zhao Fangtai.

104
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
Security lab.

105
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
We'll be back after ten days.

106
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Is it a good day?

107
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Ex They are here.

108
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
It's great.

109
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
We won't get lásIm left.

110
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
We'll just be friends.

111
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,340
The annual international navy friendship competition

112
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,900
will be held in An State.

113
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,620
After several elections,

114
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,540
our brigade has confirmed the contestants.

115
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,060
Next, please announce the list.

116
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,820
The brigade's party committee has decided

117
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,460
to appoint the following comrades

118
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,420
to represent the Chinese navy.

119
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,060
Next, please call out the names.

120
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,980
Attention!

121
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,900
Zhong Qing.

122
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,700
Yes!

123
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,620
Chen Yuan.

124
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,420
Yes!

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,060
Dai Wei.

126
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,940
Yes!

127
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,420
Zhe He Yang.

128
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,220
Yes!

129
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,700
Li Xu.

130
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,460
Yes!

131
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,780
Yi He Yang.

132
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,420
Yes!

133
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,940
Yi Miao Miao.

134
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,620
Yes!

135
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,140
Wang Chen.

136
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,820
Yes!

137
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,540
Team leader.

138
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,220
Wu Si.

139
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,900
Yes!

140
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:07,940
Comrades.

141
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,260
This international competition

142
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,900
is a show of our military style,

143
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:26,840
but it's also a battlefield full of

144
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,320
the military power of the navy.

145
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,080
I heard that there are new soldiers

146
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,000
in this competition.

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,680
Report!

148
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,840
Report, team leader!

149
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,280
The navy's special forces

150
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,240
are coming to attack the south.

151
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,040
Please give us orders.

152
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,840
Good.

153
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,800
Please be quiet.

154
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,320
Attention!

155
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,920
Yes!

156
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,880
The old rule.

157
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,800
Before going abroad for the competition,

158
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,760
organize your study.

159
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,520
Go to the navy museum

160
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,600
to see the history of our ancestors

161
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,120
and feel the great development

162
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,960
of our navy from nothing to have,

163
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,960
from weak to strong.

164
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,720
Learn from them and learn from them.

165
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,760
Yes!

166
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,320
Oh, no.

167
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,600
Adjusting some force is not a big deal.

168
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,520
Cuz we're in the same force.

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,880
Wang.

170
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,160
The cheese rallies are calling me.

171
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,160
Has your training beend?

172
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,240
Just called,

173
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,440
p полез to see you.

174
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,000
Wu Si is in training site,

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,160
but there's no signal from him.

176
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,280
So they can't see him by the phone.

177
00:09:45,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Wu Si is taking the team to visit the

178
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,560
Xiaowei, are you happy?

179
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,120
You can leave now.

180
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,080
Hurry up.

181
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,040
I'm not going.

182
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
I have a lot of work.

183
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,680
Bye.

184
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,800
No?

185
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,200
I'll see if you go.

186
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,600
The painting tells a true story.

187
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,200
Once, Commander Xiao Jingguang went to Liu Gongdao to inspect

188
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,560
and rented a small fishing boat to the fishermen.

189
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,200
The fishermen asked,

190
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,640
why did you, the Navy Commander, borrow a boat from me?

191
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,320
Xiao Jingguang didn't answer.

192
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,360
He turned around and said to the patrol officer,

193
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,480
remember, on March 17th, 1950,

194
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,280
the Navy Commander, Xiao Jingguang,

00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,560
was in the boat.

196
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,920
He was in the boat.

197
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,120
He was in the boat.

198
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,400
He was in the boat.

199
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,200
The Navy Commander, Xiao Jingguang,

200
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,080
was in the boat to inspect Liu Gongdao.

201
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,760
On August 10th, 1950,

202
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,400
the Navy held a meeting with the Navy

203
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,360
to clarify the early-stage of the Navy's defense.

204
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,800
It was to build a modern,

205
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
advanced,

206
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and clean-cut naval combat force.

207
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,520
This is the Wang Wei TV sculpture

208
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,200
presented by the Central Military Commission to the Navy.

209
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,240
On April 1st, 2001,

210
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,520
the 25th Regiment Captain Wang Wei

211
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,520
drove the 8192nd fighter jet

212
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,600
and followed up on the US military electronic reconnaissance aircraft

213
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,720
in the South China Sea.

214
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,720
He was hit by it and was injured.

215
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720

216
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720

220
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Wang Wei was injured.

221
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
Wang Wei was injured.

222
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,040
He and his fighter jet

223
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
never returned to the ship.

224
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
Every April,

225
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,120
the 8192nd missile missile

226
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,440
was a memorial event

227
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,240
for the people

228
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
who had participated in the war.

229
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,720
The 8192nd missile missile

230
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
was ready to return to the ship.

231
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
I could not return to the ship.

232
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,720
You must continue to move forward.

233
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,240
The 8192nd missile missile

234
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,240
recorded the helplessness and sadness

235
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,720
of our country

236
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,720
and смspr out creativity.

237
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Do not turn left half way!

238
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Contestants to be brought to attention!

239
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,480
Concentrate!

240
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,920
if you don't disappear,

241
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,400
I think

242
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,960
you'll go back to Xi's state,

243
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,060
as the

244
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,520
User.

245
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,680
sue

246
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,040
It was the first time that the first-time South Shaxiang Huayang Jiaojiao

247
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,040
was built in the style of the 1980s.

248
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,840
Back then, Shaojianmin and the hand-painted

249
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,040
were holding the guns and fighting and living in

250
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,520
this less than 10-meter high-rise building.

251
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,320
This is the second-generation high-rise building

252
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,880
for the hand-painted soldiers.

253
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,560
A letter of letter is what every South Shaxiang soldier

254
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,120
most expected.

255
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,280
Due to the poor communication,

256
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,440
letters of letter are sent by a few months' supply ship.

257
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,200
Each person is a tower.

258
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,080
This is the wooden mailbox of Yongshuxiao.

259
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,400
The small mailbox is full of the love of South Shaxiang

260
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,600
for the motherland and the family.

261
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,480
This is the loyal South Shaxiang.

262
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,400
This is the love of the country

263
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,760
for the loyal soldiers of the first generation of the first-generation hand-painted soldiers.

264
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,960
In April 2018,

265
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,960
the Central Military Commission held the largest-scale

266
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,400
sea-battle in the history of the new China

267
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,600
on the South China Sea.

268
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,560
The 48 ships of the People's Navy,

269
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,200
76 battleships and 10,000 officers and officers

270
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,000
were inspected.

271
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,400
This is a powerful demonstration of the power of the Chinese nation

272
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,840
in the sea.

273
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,360
It is also a solemn declaration of the people's navy

274
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,000
to the first-generation navy of the world.

275
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,360
Salute!

276
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,600
Turn left!

277
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,960
Turn right!

278
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,520
Turn right!

279
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,920
Comrades, the front-line officers standing next to me,

280
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,800
please give us the front-line officers.

281
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,000
Comrades,

282
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
the large object in front of us

283
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,680
is the first regular front-line ship

284
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,720
developed by our country.

285
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,160
It is the Long-distance 200th Fleet.

286
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,040
It is known as the first-line launch test ship.

287
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,080
It has a significant scientific meaning

288
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,880
for launching the Julang-1 and Julal front-line missiles.

289
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,280
It also marks the constant increase

290
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,680
in the power of the Chinese navy.

291
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,960
When launching the Julang-1 front-line missile,

292
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,800
we will first launch the Julal-1

293
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,280
through the pressure of the water.

294
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,720

Face left.

318
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,040
Right and left!

319

Further to the right!

320

Qingyuan Goubu

321
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,000
Hello

322
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,160
Why did you come to the Navy Museum?

323
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,760
Navy Museum?

324
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,080
You can come, but I can't?

325
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,840
I thought you came to see me.

326
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,840
Well,

327
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,160
have you read the script I sent you?

328
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,560
I haven't got any news.

329
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,160
Sorry, I'm busy recently.

330
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,360
Because we're going abroad soon

331
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,480
to participate in the military competition.

332
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,560
The training is tight.

333
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
You're going abroad?

334
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,960
Where are you going? How long?

335
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,600
I'm asking you

336
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,320
how long it will take you to finish the script.

337
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,680
Reporter Tang,

338
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,240
your script

339
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,680
is definitely reliable.

340
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,720
I don't need to read it.

341
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,560
Compared to the script,

342
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,760
I hope you can think about

343
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
what I said that day.

344
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,720
I'll be waiting for your reply.

00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,600
Attention!

346
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,400
Are you leaving now?

347
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,080
Anything else?

348
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,720
No.

349
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,760
I've never been to the museum.

350
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,240
I want you to show me around.

351
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,360
You can leave in a hurry.

352
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,600
Attention!

353
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,200
OK.

He's certain that

355
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,600
I'm a sly man

356
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:40,860
who

357
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,880
is almost

358
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,040
as smart as a wisp of the wind.

359
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,920
Give me the chopstick

360
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,860
Am in a mess

00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,060
North Star.

382
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,300
I just graduated.

383
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,180
I am a postgraduate student.

384
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,060
In the future?

385
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,180
I will show you

386
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,820
from a medical perspective

387
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,420
I'm not sure if it's normal or not.

388
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,380
So today,

389
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,700
I'll tell you about

390
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,380
the daily sunscreen.

391
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,980
Let's get started.

392
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,780
First,

393
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,300
you may not know

394
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,260
the difference between chemical sunscreen

395
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,780
and physical sunscreen.

396
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,860
It's actually very simple.

397
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,220
There are only two concepts.

398
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,500
There are two components in it.

399
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,580
The two-phase and the two-phase

400
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,180
are physical sunscreen.

401
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,780
Without these two components,

402
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,980
and even after these two components,

403
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,380
there is chemical sunscreen.

404
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,980
After using chemical sunscreen,

405
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,300
the skin will form

406
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,780
a flat surface like a mirror

407
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,660
and reflect UV rays.

408
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,940
Chemical sunscreen

409
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,420
will absorb UV rays

410
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,660
directly from the inside of your skin.

411
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,300
Now you should understand

412
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,780
the difference between these two components.

413
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,980
So I suggest

414
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,660
you use physical sunscreen.

415
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,620
Captain.

416
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,780
Sit down.

417
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,420
What are you doing?

418
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,580
Are you hurt?

419
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,980
Why would I be hurt?

420
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,260
I'm preparing a package.

421
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,180
He's not going out.

422
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,420
Is it necessary?

423
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,740
It's his business

424
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,740
to prepare or not.

425
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,700
And I'm worried about

426
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,900
his behavior.

427
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,620
A face mask, a hair dryer, a comb,

428
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,460
and a needle.

429
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,940
What are you doing?

430
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,540
Just looking around.

431
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,460
Just looking around?

432
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,940
Someone

433
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,900
is going to prepare

434
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,700
a face mask for Xin, right?

435
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,540
No.

436
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,780
But let me tell you.

437
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,660
Xin is now

438
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,980
an investigative reporter.

439
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,460
She might go to some places

440
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,700
where people are calling for her.

441
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,980
Do you think she's

442
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,500
very special now?

443
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:40,180
I

444
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,900
Didn't you go well out of the lunch?

445
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,180
Evening desktop,

446
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,140
it's getting dark.

447
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,940
No one makes the time even

448
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,340
when she's drunk out.

449
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,340
When you grog me,

450
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,020
you'll be crying.

451
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:02,940
I know

452
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,700
you're anyways.

453
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,580
Yes I do

454
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,580
Move

455
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,500
Videogame

456
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:22,980
Attack

457
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,620
Did you forget our purpose?

458
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,680
You said after directly communication,

459
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,780
Maybe sharing an ordinary doubt.

460
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,580
rules you.

461
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,020
수,

462
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,660
I,

463
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,400
No,

464
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,680
Crystal and Professor Hear.

465
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,380
That night,

466
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,480
Su Shut U.

467
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,560
According to your tasks.

468
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:35,020
resort with the

469
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,600
Mixed gathering community leader.

470
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,760
Hello, fairy girls.

471
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,040
We have arrived in Angu.

472
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,080
This is the hotel we stayed at.

473
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,720
How is it?

474
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,480
The environment is so nice, isn't it?

475
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,920
The swimming pool is so beautiful.

476
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,960
Have a rest.

477
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,000
Let's go.

478
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,360
Okay.

479
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,320
Now,

480
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,560
let's get back to the point.

481
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,640
Please look at my skin.

482
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,000
I've been wearing makeup for four hours.

483
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,680
It's not oily.

484
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,440
It's also very suitable.

485
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,200
It means that the foundation

486
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,280
can be used well.

487
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,360
Now, let's see

488
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,400
what it looks like

489
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,600
after eight hours.

490
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,560
Bye.

491
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,600
You're good, Ms. Mei.

492
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,720
You haven't told Wang Yi

493
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,240
about your flight.

494
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,600
You should talk to your fans first.

495
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,320
No need.

496
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,760
My mom is my biggest fan.

497
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,480
She watches my live broadcast

498
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,920
more than my WeChat.

499
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,200
Let's go.

500
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,160
Let's find a room.

501
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:29,960
Let's go.

502
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,880
Let's go.

503
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,600
This is it.

504
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,720
Hurry up, Xin Xin.

505
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,480
It's so beautiful.

506
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,840
Xin Xin.

507
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,120
This room is so beautiful.

508
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,880
It's not bad.

509
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,080
I've already made it.

510
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,360
It's still a new bed.

511
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,480
No.

512
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,720
I'm so tired after a whole day of flying.

513
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,680
I'll take a rest.

514
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,480
No.

515
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,480
Let's take a photo.

516
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,520
Don't sleep.

517
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,520
I don't want to take a photo.

518
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,560
I want to sleep.

519
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,680
I'm so tired.

520
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,120
I want to sleep.

521
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,840
Come out and play.

522
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,520
I don't want to sleep.

523
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,720
Let's go.

524
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,480
Okay, I've taken a photo.

525
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,760
Brother, take a photo for me.

526
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,520
I want to take a photo of the pool.

527
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,280
You look short when you sit like this.

528
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,600
You're good at it.

529
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,160
Take a photo.

530
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,600
Thank you.

531
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,480
Thank you.

532
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,600
Come on, Xin Xin.

533
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,480
Cheers.

534
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,760
Cheers.

535
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,280
Cheers.

536
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,560
Three, two, one.

537
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,040
Eggplant.

538
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,840
Come on.

539
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,360
Change your pose.

540
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,000
Be happy.

541
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,440
No more pose.

542
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,920
Xin Xin.

543
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,280
You see the swimming pool.

544
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,200
They sell cosmetics and skin care products.

545
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,960
You must study it.

546
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,600
Come on.

547
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,560
Hi, lady.

548
00:28:59,720 --> 00:28:59,960
Hi.

549
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,000
Can I help you?

550
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,680
We would like to buy some...

551
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:27,580
What did the

552
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,720
local honey recipe say?

553
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,680
It's very good.

554
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,800
Honey recipe?

555
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,000
So magical.

556
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,040
Where can we buy...

557
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,160
this kind of plant fruit?

558
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,440
You don't have to buy it.

559
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,720
You can pick it yourself.

560
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,280
In our forest.

561
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,520
Pick it yourself?

562
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,560
Yes.

563
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,000
Is this forest far from here?

564
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,200
Can we find it if we keep going?

565
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,680
I'm not sure about that.

566
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,520
You can ask the receptionist.

567
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,560
Okay, thank you.

568
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,800
Xin Xin, let's go.

569
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,000
What are you doing?

570
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,520
Go and ask.

571
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,040
Excuse me.

572
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,760
Hi.

573
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,600
Is the forest far from here?

574
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,480
Very close.

575
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,400
Only takes a few minutes to drive.

576
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,440
Are you going?

577
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,560
Yes, of course.

578
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,600
It's famous.

579
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,800
Yeah, but tourists don't usually go.

580
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,080
Do you have a guide?

581
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,800
It's okay.

582
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,840
She's just kidding.

583
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,480
Thanks.

584
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,360
You're welcome.

585
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,440
Xin Xin, just go with me.

586
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,560
It's rare to be so close.

587
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,600
I can still get some fans.

588
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,880
What fans?

589
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,680
Stop joking.

590
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,640
It's abroad.

591
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,920
You're not familiar with it.

592
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,520
And Princess Laiyang.

593
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,200
Do you have a little bit of

594
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,640
survival knowledge?

595
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,200
I do have a little bit.

596
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
Zong Qing taught me to

597
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,000
write in the book.

598
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,240
Just a little bit.

599
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,240
Xin Xin, just go with me.

600
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,280
Hi.

601
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,600
Do you know where is

602
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,360
Outside Supply Store?

603
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,960
You can turn right,

604
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,080
pass the street,

605
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,600
and you arrive your destination.

606
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,640
Okay, thank you.

607
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,280
Let's go.

608
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,080
You're so...

609
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,640
It's better not to stay there overnight.

610
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,280
Secretary Dian.

611
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,000
Mr. Han.

612
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,400
I saw the friend circle of the Tang reporters.

613
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,680
She's abroad now.

614
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,880
Go and check for me

615
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,880
when she went there.

616
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,680
Okay.

617
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:46,460
Little

618
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,640
Monkey, slow down.

619
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,360
I must find you.

620
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,760
Where are you hiding?

621
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,920
I am here.

622
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,360
I'm here.

623
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,000
Wait for me.

624
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,200
Take care.

625
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,440
Hello, little cuties.

626
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,800
Hello.

627
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,640
Today, Mr. Lan

628
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,160
will take you

629
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,360
on a trip

630
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,440
of the Outside Supply Store.

631
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,640
Let me show you.

632
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:18,840
Here.

633
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,040
Don't take a picture of me.

634
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,080
Here is the very famous

635
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,440
natural forest of Angu.

636
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,880
Something's gone missing.

637
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,640
I can't go back.

638
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,600
Well...

639
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,120
The car was on me.

640
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,120
That's why I was so worried.

641
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,880
I got worried so much that

642
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,400
I can barely come back.

643
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,600
I'll leave for a moment.

644
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,080
Let me get my magnolia just for case you didn't present system in the field.

645
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,640
I can't come back.

646
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,640
Let me contact you.

647
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,440
I hope you can continue to provide clues.

648
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,640
I'll investigate for him.

649
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,200
Can I ask

650
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,760
what you do?

651
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,800
I do business.

652
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,840
I have a wide network.

653
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,080
I can help reporters in many ways.

654
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,360
I used to help me.

655
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,320
Did Tang reporter give you my email?

656
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,040
Yes.

657
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,120
Can you give me the clue now?

658
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,320
Reporter Tan.

659
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,480
Someone sent us

660
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,200
the email box we used to contact.

661
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,520
He said he was your friend.

662
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,080
He asked me to provide clues to him.

663
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,240
Is that true?

664
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,080
Yangyang.

665
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,240
What does your fruit look like?

666
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,400
I sent you a photo.

667
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,520
Really?

668
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,200
Yes.

669
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:22,960
Let me see.

670
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,720
This stone.

671
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,760
Where is this?

672
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,600
No.

673
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,520
This?

674
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,800
This?

675
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,360
Look.

676
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,840
It just clues to you.

677
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,640
Why do you want to find some paper airplane?

678
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,000
You can't even rewind the land.

679
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,080
It's okay.

680
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,160
It's just the beginning.

681
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:56,720
Go on.

682
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,640
Go forward.

683
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,840
Go.

684
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,440
My little cuties.

685
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,840
Now,

686
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,080
we've encountered a little difficulty.

687
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,360
We haven't found it yet.

688
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,560
But, but,

689
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,600
if we find it,

690
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,920
I'll show you

691
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,200
what it looks like

692
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,160
as soon as possible.

693
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,760
Okay?

694
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,120
Please look forward to it.

695
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,280
Xin Xin, look at my card.

696
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,520
Is there no signal?

697
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,680
Look at your phone.

698
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,400
Yang,

699
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
how about we stop here?

700
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,680
There's no signal here.

701
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,800
Let's not go further.

702
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,760
No.

703
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,680
Maybe the signal

704
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,720
is already there.

705
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,400
How can we find it if we don't go in?

706
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,200
Let's go.

707
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,280
It must be there.

708
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,080
Do we have to find the fruit?

709
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,960
Yeah.

710
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,920
I'młe.

711
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,320
One, two, three.

712
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,320
Youyang, wait for me.

713
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,320
This mission is about submerged search.

714
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,720
We have installed few mission boxes

715
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,320
all over the bottom of the ocean.

716
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,520
You must find them all.

717
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,120
According to the time and route,

718
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,720
the shortest way is

719
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,920
you cannot sweep people.

720
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,320
And if you have risk situation,

721
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,320
you call the rescue team.

722
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,920
If you call the rescue team, you lose.

723
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,520
Sir, do you understand me?

724
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,120
Yes, sir.

725
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,720
Hey, hey, I can hear you.

726
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,320
Do you understand me?

727
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,520
Yes, sir.

728
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,320
Wang Chen and I are the first team. It's hard to catch up.

729
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,120
Wang Chen, go down and act separately.

730
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,320
Three, two, one, go, go, go.

731
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,320
Wang Chen, go down and act separately.

732
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,320
Wang Chen, go down and act separately.

733
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,320
Wang Chen, go down and act separately.

734
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,320
Go down and act separately.

735
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,320
Go down and act separately.

736
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,320
Captain has a dark suit.

737
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
What's wrong with him?

738
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,320
I don't know.

739
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,320
Go down and act separately.

740
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,320
Go down and act separately.

741
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,320
The blue sky is so blue.

742
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,320
My heart is so cold.

743
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,320
I miss you.

744
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,320
You block the clouds for me.

745
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,320
You always act so innocent.

746
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:43,320
The long road can make me feel at ease.

747
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:48,320
People always act romantic.

748
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,320
The dream is so ordinary.

749
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:59,320
But in your heart, there are more expectations.

750
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,320
I really understand.

751
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:06,320
You say love is too vague.

752
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:12,320
But you give me the answer with your eyes.

753
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:19,320
I can meet you with all my heart.

754
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:27,320
Thank you for waking up the courage that used to be weak.

755
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,320
Let all coincidences become a wish.

756
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,320
Let all simple things become a partner.

757
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:39,320
Open the light of the years after the past.

758
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,320
People still can't separate us.

759
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,320
You are waiting for the heart to warm up.

760
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:53,320
I will never forget my promise.

761
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,320
The lonely time you spent with me.

762
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,320
I will never forget the memories of you.

763
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:05,320
I will never regret.

764
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,320
The courage to be a man.

765
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,320
You are the one who has my heart.

766
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,320
Thank you for being by my side.

767
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,320
The cold snow and the cold rain.

768
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,320
The bigger the world, the more lonely it is.

769
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,320
Only standing by your side,

770
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:34,320
I can feel the warmth in my heart.
