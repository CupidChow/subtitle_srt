1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,520
The world may be small

2
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,520
But I've never been desperate for a second

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,800
I've crossed the waves of the world

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,520
And stepped on the deep corners of the dark

5
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,400
To face the more fierce wind

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,760
The wound is covered with the wind

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,560
The night is engulfed by the starlight

8
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,200
We embrace this bacteria

9
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,000
Everyday the me

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,280
I never change

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,640
The dust that isn't comforted

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,680
The fearless face

13
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,760
To lose what belongs to myself

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,560
With friends yet to part

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,960
No one to be forgotten

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,080
Is worth nothing

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:35,380
The Long Ballad

18
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,060
Episode 21

19
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,680
Zeng Qing.

20
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,780
Stop MAN trying this game.

21
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,980
He might break his skin.

22
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,660
How about that?

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,080
What will we do

24
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:47,860
when this smell gets worse?

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,360
Mr. Su.

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,660
This smell

27
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,180
is about to scare us out.

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:52,980
Stop hanging around.

29
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,060
But you smell good.

30
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,060
The key is that it smells so good.

31
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,060
I'm so annoyed.

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,060
You're so annoyed, are you okay?

33
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,060
Are you okay?

34
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,060
Yes.

35
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,060
Smell it.

36
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,060
It smells like a lollipop.

37
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,060
Captain.

38
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,060
The pilot today

39
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,060
made my ears very deaf.

40
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,060
Are you okay?

41
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,060
I'm fine.

42
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,060
Next time you jump off the parachute,

43
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,060
remember to lower the volume of your ears.

44
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,060
I understand.

45
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,060
It's good that you're okay.

46
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,060
Ye Meng.

47
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,060
Yes.

48
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,060
This is the first lesson for you as a new soldier.

49
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,060
I'm telling you,

50
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,060
all your experience should be drawn back with blood.

51
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,060
Am I right, member?

52
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,060
Yes.

53
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,060
Brother.

54
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,060
Hello.

55
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,060
Today, I saw that

56
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,060
the pilot made his ears very deaf.

57
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,060
What's wrong with that?

58
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,060
That's our Blue Team's pilot.

59
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,060
I'm lucky that I didn't say anything wrong today.

60
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,060
If I say something wrong,

61
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,060
I'll have to eat that box of chicken.

62
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,060
What are you afraid of?

63
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,060
It's not your future husband.

64
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,060
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,060
Are you hurt?

66
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,060
No.

67
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,060
Really?

68
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,060
I've been observing you for a long time.

69
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
I twisted it.

70
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,060
Come with me to the hospital.

71
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,060
No, leader.

72
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,060
It's not a minor injury.

73
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,060
You don't have to go to the hospital.

74
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,060
Did the doctor say so?

75
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,060
Let's go.

76
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,060
No, leader.

77
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,060
Look, I'm fine.

78
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,060
I'm really fine.

79
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,060
It's not a big deal.

80
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,060
You don't have to open the armor bar.

81
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,060
I really don't have a sore arm.

82
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,060
I can't even lift my hands.

83
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,060
You don't have a sore arm, right?

84
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,060
Go back and tell your squad leader

85
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,060
to let him train you alone.

86
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,060
I think it's enough to make a few sets of skates.

87
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,060
Captain Wu.

88
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,060
Can't you lift it?

89
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,060
Isn't it pretty sharp?

90
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,060
These kids are getting more and more

91
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,060
into pretending to be sick.

92
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,060
You two are rare.

93
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,060
What's wrong?

94
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,060
The member's leg is injured.

95
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,060
Which leg?

96
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,060
The leg.

97
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,060
It's not a big deal.

98
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,060
It's just a small injury.

99
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,060
Does it hurt?

100
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,060
Does it hurt here?

101
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,060
No.

102
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,060
You're really good at this.

103
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,060
It should be a joint condition.

104
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,060
You have to go to the hospital for a surgery first.

105
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,060
Come back and see.

106
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,060
Sit down, Master.

107
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,060
I'll go report to you.

108
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,060
Thanks.

109
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,060
Captain Tang.

110
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,060
What a coincidence.

111
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,060
You came to the hospital.

112
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,060
I'm not well.

113
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,060
I have an old problem.

114
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,060
It's okay.

115
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,060
It's okay.

116
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,060
You go sit over there first.

117
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,060
Why are you in the hospital?

118
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,060
I have a wound.

119
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,060
I'm here to compensate.

120
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,060
Remember this.

121
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,060
Car number Wen Wei 67321.

122
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,060
Find it separately.

123
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,060
You look so good today.

124
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,060
When am I not good looking?

125
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,060
Tomorrow is better than tomorrow.

126
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,060
Next time I leave home,

127
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,060
I must wear more clothes.

128
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,060
I'm not good at anything except for dressing.

129
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,060
Don't try to trick me again.

130
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,060
Do you think I'm very willful?

131
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,060
You don't understand at all.

132
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,060
I'm so old.

133
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,060
I've never made any decisions for myself.

134
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,060
Even my parents chose me to be a professional.

135
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:34,740
When I first entered the

136
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,060
I'm now just trying to do something I like to do.

137
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,060
How can I be willful?

138
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,060
Lan Yang Yang.

139
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,060
Of course I support you

140
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,060
to do what you like to do.

141
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,060
I don't even know what I like to do.

142
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,060
You're so smart.

143
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,060
Look, you don't like to study medicine.

144
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,060
You can graduate from a high school.

145
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,060
Is it hard to find something you like?

146
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,060
But I don't know how to find it.

147
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,060
What?

148
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,060
You just have to find it with your heart.

149
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,060
Then you can find half of my strength.

150
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,060
You'll find it soon.

151
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,060
My high school classmate

152
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,060
gave me a push to be an PR officer.

153
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,060
I'm about to have an interview.

154
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,060
But I don't even know what PR is.

155
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,060
You'll know when you go.

156
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,060
Wait.

157
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,060
You just said I was looking for you.

158
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,060
I was chasing you.

159
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,060
You were chasing me?

160
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,060
Go after me.

161
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,060
Did you chase me?

162
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,060
You do it again.

163
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,060
You do it again.

164
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,060
I was in the 80s when I was in the army.

165
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,060
I was the leader and went to Nansha.

166
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,060
I was just getting started

167
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,060
on the first wave of high-altitude footpath.

168
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,060
The local fellow villagers

169
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,060
called it

170
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,060
the Watermelon Pond,

171
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,060
the Mou Er Cave,

172
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,060
and the later Eight-Foot Pond.

173
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,060
In the daytime, we'd watch the ice.

174
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,060
At night, we'd watch the stars.

175
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,060
Imagine this person

176
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,060
living in this watermelon pond

177
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,060
and iron pail for a few months.

178
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,060
He was so sick

179
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,060
and had a bad cold.

180
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,060
Mr. Ye,

181
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,060
you've worked so hard.

182
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,060
I'm so sorry.

183
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,060
I'm sorry.

184
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,060
Look at you now.

185
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,060
You're not getting any better.

186
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,060
You're old.

187
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,060
Or you'd have to

188
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,060
have Tang Xin

189
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,060
take care of you.

190
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,060
Tang Xin came to pick you up?

191
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,060
She's parking in the basement.

192
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,060
What's going on

193
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,060
with all the silence?

194
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,060
I'll make a call.

195
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,060
Hello, Dad.

196
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,060
Hello, Zongluo.

197
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,060
If you don't come up,

198
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,060
I'll be sick.

199
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,060
I've heard that.

200
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,060
I'm going up with you.

201
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,060
What?

202
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,060
What?

203
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,060
What?

204
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,060
What?

205
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,060
What?

206
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,060
What?

207
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,060
What?

208
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,060
What?

209
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,060
What?

210
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,060
What?

211
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,060
What?

212
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,060
What?

213
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,060
What?

214
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,060
What?

215
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,060
What?

216
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,060
What?

217
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,060
What?

218
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,060
What?

219
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,060
What?

220
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,060
What?

221
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
What?

222
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,060
What?

223
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,060
Why is your voice so low?

224
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,060
Is your signal bad?

225
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,060
Hey.

226
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,060
Turn up the volume.

227
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,060
I can't talk.

228
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,060
I'll talk to you later.

229
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,060
Tang Xin,

230
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,060
why did you hang up?

231
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,060
Mr. Tang,

232
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,060
sit down for a while.

233
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,060
Mr. Tang,

234
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,060
I found it.

235
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,060
It's here.

236
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,060
Renv67321

237
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,060
is him.

238
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,060
Stop playing around.

239
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,060
It's here.

240
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,060
Come on.

241
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,060
Let go of me.

242
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,060
Who are you?

243
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,060
Wu Si.

244
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,060
I don't know him.

245
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,060
Hey.

246
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,060
Block the wind and glass.

247
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,060
Smash it.

248
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,060
Your car?

249
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,060
Come in and smash it.

250
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,060
Don't go over there.

251
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,060
Stay here and wait for me.

252
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,060
Smash it.

253
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,060
Hey,

254
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,060
it's none of your business.

255
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,060
Mind your own business.

256
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,060
Do what you should do.

257
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,060
Is it appropriate to smash someone's car

258
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,060
in public?

259
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,060
I smash cars

260
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,060
in different places.

261
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,060
What are you thinking about?

262
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,060
Get lost.

263
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,060
I'm not anyone's.

264
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,060
But I saw it.

265
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,060
I must get lost.

266
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,060
You want to get lost?

267
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,060
I saw you were

268
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,060
itchy.

269
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,060
I'm not.

270
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
I'm not.

271
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,060
You're itchy.

272
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,060
Show me your face.

273
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,060
Smash him.

274
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,060
No.

275
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,060
You're not young anymore.

276
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,060
You should get married.

277
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,060
Otherwise, his dad

278
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,060
always calls me

279
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,060
and asks me to come over to accompany you.

280
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,060
It's mainly your brother.

281
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,060
He's quite busy at night.

282
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,060
Okay.

283
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,060
In order not to waste

284
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,060
my brother's time at night,

285
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,060
I'll try my best.

286
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,060
Is it still the female reporter

287
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,060
from last time?

288
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,060
She's a reporter.

289
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,060
Why is she still a reporter?

290
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,060
Of course.

291
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,060
What do you like about her?

292
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,060
I've never seen

293
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,060
a girl like her before.

294
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,060
Take the fish-trap fire last time,

295
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,060
everyone

296
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,060
took the female reporter

297
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,060
and ran away on their own.

298
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,060
But only she

299
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,060
only she

300
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,060
was willing to risk her life

301
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,060
and come back to save me.

302
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,060
But this point

303
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,060
I'm not sure

304
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,060
if I'm interested in her.

305
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,060
So you mean

306
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,060
you're going to marry her?

307
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,060
What do you mean by that?

308
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,060
It's not that simple.

309
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,060
I'm just

310
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,060
thinking of

311
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,060
having more chances

312
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,060
to get to know her more.

313
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,060
Get to know her more.

314
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,060
But

315
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,060
she's willing to come back to save you.

316
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,060
It does show

317
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,060
that she's a kind girl.

318
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,060
But

319
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,060
I've seen her interviews

320
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,060
and it's very dangerous.

321
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,060
How can a person

322
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,060
who doesn't even care about his own safety

323
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,060
care about you?

324
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,060
How can you two have a future?

325
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,060
Really.

326
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,060
Listen to me.

327
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,060
Change one.

328
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
What for?

329
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,060
I haven't even started.

330
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,060
Where can I change?

331
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,060
Your brother is a passerby.

332
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,060
You two are not suitable.

333
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,060
Why not?

334
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,060
I think we're a good match.

335
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,060
You're a passerby.

336
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,060
You're on your own.

337
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,060
That doesn't mean

338
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,060
I'm going to follow you.

339
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,060
Right?

340
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,060
Why don't we have a future?

341
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,060
Everyone has a different future.

342
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,060
Besides,

343
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,060
we haven't even started.

344
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,060
Anyway,

345
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,060
we have to start together

346
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,060
and then test each other.

347
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,060
Explore each other.

348
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,060
Manage each other.

349
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,060
Maybe

350
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,060
he'll have a good future.

351
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,060
Your love theory

352
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,060
is very good.

353
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,060
I've never

354
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,060
talked to you since I was a kid.

355
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,060
Okay, okay, okay.

356
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,060
Come on, let's drink.

357
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,060
Your brother can't win you.

358
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,060
I can't win you either.

359
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,060
Okay.

360
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,060
What are you thinking?

361
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,060
You're so into it.

362
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,060
You don't even change your clothes.

363
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,060
Is that beautiful woman

364
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,060
a joke?

365
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,060
What are you talking about?

366
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,060
Don't say that.

367
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,060
I think you

368
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,060
shouldn't

369
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,060
find any princess to hug you.

370
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,060
You're so into

371
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,060
running away from her.

372
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,060
Yang Yang,

373
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,060
tell me,

374
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,060
is it because

375
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,060
she looks like that person

376
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,060
or

377
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,060
I want her to be that person?

378
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,060
So I brainwashed myself.

379
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,060
This

380
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,060
can become real

381
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,060
by washing.

382
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,060
Have you ever heard of

383
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,060
love with God?

384
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,260
I have written this down.

385
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,740
You can've a look.

386
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,420
Oh my god.

387
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,500
I have a heart attack.

388
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,100
Mom, why did you say that?

389
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,700
Li Xu said it.

390
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,780
He said the ambulance is here.

391
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,860
Brigadier.

392
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,460
You're all armed.

393
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,620
No small injuries.

394
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,780
This is the dessert my wife made.

395
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,020
You can share it.

396
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,900
Brigadier, is your wife here?

397
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,940
Yes.

398
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,220
You guys are lucky.

399
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,820
She won't leave this time.

400
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,340
Wu Si,

401
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,020
did you tell the reporter

402
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,540
about your wife's interview?

403
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,620
Yes.

404
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,380
Tang Xin said she was preparing.

405
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,700
The interview was approved by the audit.

406
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,140
It's also a work task.

407
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,100
Be careful.

408
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,380
March.

409
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,460
Salute.

410
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,420
Turn left.

411
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,860
Salute.

412
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,740
Salute.

413
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,260
Salute.

414
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,700
Stand properly.

415
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,260
aviation fleet.

416
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,020
chat

417
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:23,940
chat

418
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,460
chat

419
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,260
You're starving to death.

420
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,260
You can't even leave in ten minutes.

421
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,260
I was too tired from training last night.

422
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,260
I didn't eat anything. I'm very hungry.

423
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
Leave after you finish eating. Don't cause trouble.

424
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,260
Squad Leader Hao, I'm not here to steal.

425
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,260
Let's discuss something.

426
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,260
What good thing can there be? Tell me.

427
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,260
Isn't it my turn to help this weekend?

428
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,260
I'll change shifts with Li Xu.

429
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,260
I've already talked to him.

430
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,260
I'm here to say hello to our Cui's Squad.

431
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,260
When did I become Cui's Squad with you?

432
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,260
Why are you changing shifts?

433
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,260
If you don't make it clear, I won't adjust it for you.

434
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,260
Why do I have to make it clear?

435
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,260
You're from here.

436
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,260
I understand.

437
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,260
You're meeting a young lady this weekend, right?

438
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,260
What do you mean? She's my girlfriend.

439
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,260
I knew you'd play this trick.

440
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,260
I know you well.

441
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,260
So you agreed?

442
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,260
Thank you, Squad Leader.

443
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,260
Go.

444
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,260
You're here in person, Manager Tian.

445
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,260
What can I do for you?

446
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,260
What else can I do?

447
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,260
You didn't drive today, did you?

448
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,260
This guy is the fastest.

449
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,260
Are you okay?

450
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,260
I'm fine.

451
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,260
I'm just taking advantage of you.

452
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,260
Who did this?

453
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,260
I don't know.

454
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,260
I've called the police.

455
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,260
Let's wait for the results.

456
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,260
Tang Xin, they're all dead.

457
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,260
They can do anything.

458
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,260
The closer you are to the truth, the more dangerous it is.

459
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,260
I can't just let people drive my car.

460
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,260
How can it be so cheap?

461
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,260
Just let me save my heart.

462
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,260
It's just scaring people.

463
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,260
That's all.

464
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,260
It's okay.

465
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,260
Don't do anything stupid.

466
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,260
I know.

467
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,260
Thank you, Manager Tian.

468
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,260
How is it?

469
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,260
It's pretty good.

470
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,260
What are you doing?

471
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,260
Propose to her.

472
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,260
With whom?

473
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,260
You're asking me.

474
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,260
Who else is there besides Lan Yangyang?

475
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,260
Have you thought it through?

476
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Actually, I've been thinking about this day.

477
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,260
I'm just afraid that it's going too fast.

478
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,260
I didn't dare to tell her.

479
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,260
But after getting in touch with her,

480
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,260
I found that her goal is the same as mine.

481
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,260
Since everyone has the same goal,

482
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,260
and are old enough,

483
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,260
we should make it soon.

484
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,260
You can think about it.

485
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,260
As long as you think about it,

486
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,260
everyone supports you.

487
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,260
If you need any help,

488
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,260
just say it.

489
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,260
No.

490
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,260
How dare I delay you?

491
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,260
You're the big red man in the eyes of the Brigadier General.

492
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,260
You can't delay your precious training time.

493
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,260
Don't worry.

494
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,260
There are many proposal companies online.

495
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,260
I'll read it.

496
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,260
I'm so sorry.

497
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,260
There's a traffic jam on the way.

498
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,260
Miss Lan.

499
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,260
Yes.

500
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,260
Close the door.

501
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,260
Please close the door.

502
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,260
Okay.

503
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,260
Please introduce yourself.

504
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,260
Hello.

505
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,260
I'm Lan Yangyang from the Public Relations Department of the Gui Si.

506
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,260
I just graduated from the University of Wenzhou Medical School.

507
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,260
I'm majoring in anesthesia.

508
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,260
During my school days...

509
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
My...

510
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,260
Excel, PR, English,

511
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,260
are you proficient in them?

512
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,260
I've used them during my school days.

513
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,260
English is fine, too.

514
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,260
You've used them?

515
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,260
Fine?

516
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,260
That's a new topic.

517
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,260
What do you think your biggest advantage is?

518
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,260
I think my biggest advantage is that I can learn new things quickly.

519
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,260
Although I don't have much experience,

520
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,260
I'm willing to study hard.

521
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,260
Miss Lan.

522
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,260
We're an enterprise, not a school.

523
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,260
Other than studying,

524
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,260
do you have any other advantages?

525
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,260
I...

526
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,260
I was an intern team leader in the research department.

527
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,260
I have a strong leadership ability.

528
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,260
I can find and solve problems with the team in time.

529
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,260
For example?

530
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,260
For example...

531
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06,260
Public relations is responsible for the public relations maintenance of the enterprise.

532
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,260
There are a few negative reports from the industry.

533
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:15,260
Miss Lan, please give your opinion on public relations from the perspective of media supervision.

534
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,260
I think...

535
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,260
Sorry.

536
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,260
I'm sorry.

537
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,260
I think...

538
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,260
First of all...

539
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,260
Okay.

540
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,260
That's all.

541
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,260
In fact, it's important to find out your own problems.

542
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,260
Although I don't know how Miss Lan got the inner-view quota,

543
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,260
our job is about public image.

544
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:03,260
What we need is a person who is diligent and flexible,

545
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,260
who can help the leadership to reduce,

546
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,260
but not increase the workload.

547
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,260
Perhaps you are more suitable for a team that is more suitable for the hospital.

548
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,260
I think Miss Lan is also busy.

549
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,260
I hope you won't be stuck in traffic on your way back.

550
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,260
Thank you.

551
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,260
Hello, Captain Wu.

552
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,260
Has anyone been bothering you recently?

553
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,260
No.

554
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,260
Thank you for your concern.

555
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,260
You're welcome.

556
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,260
But you need to increase your security awareness.

557
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,260
You should play less with your phone when you're walking.

558
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,260
Well, there's something important I haven't told you.

559
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,860
I didn't tell you something important.

560
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,420
I was afraid that the table had been mistaken.

561
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,100
So I asked him to send me another one.

562
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,260
It's different from my computer.

563
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,940
But he insisted that he sent this one last time.

564
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,140
So if he was right,

565
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,220
then my computer must have been touched.

566
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,540
Then think about it carefully.

567
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,300
When will your computer be gone?

568
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,300
Too many. I can't remember.

569
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,100
How about this?

570
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,220
You change the password of the mailbox.

571
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,860
And when you go out,

572
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,460
you must carry your computer with you.

573
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,780
I changed the password.

574
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,340
Don't tell anyone about the new landmark.

575
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,740
I'll go with you on the weekend.

576
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,460
I won't cause you trouble, will I?

577
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:32,900
Don't worry.

578
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,420
I'll report to the army.

579
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,660
I'll tell you when I get home.

580
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,860
I can't wait.

581
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,980
I'm worried about how I'll go out for the third time.

582
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,020
Master, I want to ask

583
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,380
where the boat rental is nearby.

584
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,020
Just go ahead.

585
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,820
You can go out even if you haven't been a refugee.

586
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,740
Okay, thank you.

587
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,540
Let me see.

588
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,700
Uncle, are you busy?

589
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,020
No.

590
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,620
What's up?

591
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,660
I want to ask if there are any boat rental nearby.

592
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,260
I have one at home.

593
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,340
What do you rent the boat for?

594
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,380
Fishing?

595
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,540
That's good.

596
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,820
I think the weather is good today.

597
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,540
I want to take my girlfriend to Dayanjiao

598
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,620
to go diving.

599
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,940
Dayanjiao?

600
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,500
It's not close.

601
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,260
Yes.

602
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,460
Uncle, my boyfriend is busy.

603
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,540
It's hard to ask my family out to play with me.

604
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,100
You can contact them.

605
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,220
It's easier to discuss.

606
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,780
Okay.

607
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,340
I'll go and arrange it for you.

608
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,220
Wait a minute.

609
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,020
Thank you.

610
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:43,900
What's wrong?

611
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,260
Nothing. Let's go.

612
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,580
Are you kidding me?

613
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,380
Bye-bye.

614
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,540
Go.

615
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,580
It's okay. I'm just walking around.

616
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:24,980
What's wrong?

617
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,900
You seem to be in a bad mood today.

618
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,420
Yes.

619
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,780
I'm not happy.

620
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:31,900
It's okay.

621
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,700
I'll find a way to make you happy.

622
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,460
Well,

623
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,780
I'll send you the address now.

624
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,700
Come here as soon as possible.

625
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,780
Why do you have to make it clear?

626
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,540
Don't ask so much.

627
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,700
Just come here as soon as possible.

628
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:43,860
See you later.

629
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,980
So secretive.

630
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,820
Captain Wu,

631
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,940
thank you anyway.

632
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,700
You finally have a day off

633
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,060
and come to go out with me.

634
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,980
Actually, for me,

635
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,860
this is the best rest.

636
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,340
When did you become so good at talking?

637
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,980
I'm telling the truth.

638
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,900
I also want to investigate this matter.

639
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,380
I'm here today not only for you,

640
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,260
but also to end my own heart.

641
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,340
I'm sorry.

642
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,180
I'm sorry.

643
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,940
Your heart?

644
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,740
What do you mean?

645
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,020
My dad was also a Navy officer.

646
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,300
Navy officer?

647
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,460
Just like the old captain,

648
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,940
he never went home.

649
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,860
When I was a kid,

650
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,980
I was sick in the sanatorium.

651
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,420
I almost didn't come back.

652
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,820
My dad thought about it again

653
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,580
and decided to move to another place

654
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,540
for my mom and me.

655
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,900
He went to the sea officer's office to report the situation

656
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,980
and became a police officer.

657
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,380
My dad also had combat experience,

658
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,020
so he went to the first line

659
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,660
and entered the speedy escape.

660
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,700
He was in the undercover for nearly ten months.

661
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,820
But at the last moment,

662
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,060
he was caught in the sea

663
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,020
without a trace.

664
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,500
What about your father?

665
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,060
He was gone.

666
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,140
So sometimes I think

667
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,380
if I wasn't sick at that time,

668
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,220
would he not have transferred to the first line

669
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,620
if he hadn't been in the first line?

670
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,340
If he hadn't transferred,

671
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,340
would it not have happened in the future?

672
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,420
We can still be happy together.

673
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,580
What your father did

674
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,900
was a great thing.

675
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,780
So,

676
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,980
no matter how involved

677
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,060
the case between Piao Ning and my dad is,

678
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,940
I have to go after him.

679
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,260
No problem.

680
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,020
From now on,

681
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,460
I will share all the information with you.

682
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,940
Hello, guys.

683
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,740
Are you here?

684
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,380
Okay.

685
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,860
Wait for me at the destination.

686
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,860
You must keep the time well.

687
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,180
Don't be late.

688
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,740
Don't blame me for being lazy.

689
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,380
All the happiness in my life

690
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,660
is in your hands.

691
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,740
You must get it out.

692
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,820
Got it.

693
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:24,780
Okay.

694
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,740
There's a kid in the water.

695
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,940
There's a kid in the water.

696
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,660
There's a kid in the water.

697
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,300
Is there a police?

698
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,140
Hurry up.

699
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:36,660
Who's the kid?

700
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,220
Who is it?

701
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,580
Come here.

702
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,300
Is there a police?

703
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,020
There's a kid.

704
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,900
What's going on?

705
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,220
Where is he?

706
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:45,940
Where is he?

707
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,500
Where is he?

708
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,140
Where is he?

709
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,740
Where is he?

710
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,820
Where is he?

711
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,380
Where is he?

712
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:49,940
What's going on?

713
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,660
What's going on?

714
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,260
Where is he?

715
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:51,980
Where is he?

716
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,820
Where is he?

717
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,580
Get down.

718
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,340
Get down.

719
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,740
Don't chase me.

720
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,340
Be careful.

721
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,020
Be careful.

722
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,180
Don't chase me.

723
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,660
Do you know where the police are?

724
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,900
Look, they're coming.

725
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,220
Hurry up.

726
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,060
We're almost there.

727
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,060
Hurry up.

728
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,140
Don't move the kid.

729
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,100
Don't move him.

730
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,660
We're almost there.

731
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,660
We're almost there.

732
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,180
Where?

733
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:11,700
Up.

734
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,020
Don't fall into the water.

735
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,540
Hurry up.

736
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,140
Come on.

737
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,140
Up.

738
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,900
We're almost there.

739
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,580
Hurry up.

740
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,580
We're almost there.

741
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,380
Go on.

742
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,380
Lin Lian.

743
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,220
Lin Lian.

744
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,420
Lin Lian.

745
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,580
Hurry.

746
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,820
Sit on the boat.

747
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,900
Lin Lian.

748
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,300
Lin Lian.

749
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:29,900
Come on.

750
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,420
Lin Lian.

751
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,940
Lin Lian.

752
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,700
Where did they go?

753
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,660
Are you fine?

754
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,660
What's going on?

755
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,660
It's too dangerous.

756
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,660
Don't go there.

757
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,660
We can't see anything.

758
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,660
It's coming out.

759
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,660
It's coming out.

760
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,660
Where's the baby?

761
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,660
Where's the baby?

762
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,660
I can't find it.

763
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,660
It's coming out again.

764
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,660
Calm down.

765
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,660
Help me.

766
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,660
Help me.

767
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,660
Why hasn't it come out yet?

768
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,660
It's coming out.

769
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,660
It's coming out.

770
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,660
It's coming out.

771
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,660
It's coming out.

772
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,660
It's coming out.

773
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,660
Come on.

774
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,660
Is it a video?

775
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,660
He's awake.

776
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,660
Let him go.

777
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,660
Let him go.

778
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,660
No.

779
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,660
It's coming out.

780
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,660
Li Li.

781
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,660
Li Li.

782
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,660
Wake up.

783
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,660
Move aside.

784
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,660
Let us go.

785
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,660
Wake up.

786
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,660
Li Li.

787
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,660
I'm here.

788
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,660
Li Li.

789
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,660
Wake up.

790
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,660
I'm here.

791
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,660
Li Li.

792
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,660
Wake up.

793
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,660
Li Li.

794
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,660
Linlin, wake up, okay?

795
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,660
Mom is here. Wake up.

796
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,660
Linlin, wake up.

797
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,660
Wake up.

798
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,660
How is she?

799
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,660
She's fine.

800
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,660
It's okay.

801
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,660
Take her to the hospital.

802
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,660
It's okay.

803
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,660
Linlin, you have to save us.

804
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,660
Thank you, Linlin.

805
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,660
How is she?

806
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,660
She's fine.

807
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,660
She's fine.

808
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,660
She's fine.

809
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,660
She's fine.

810
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,660
I just asked Boss Chen.

811
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,660
He said he would only be in the hospital for two hours.

812
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,660
Two hours?

813
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,660
Okay.

814
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:38,660
Then, what should we talk about?

815
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,660
Actually, I have a question.

816
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,660
You won't just report an email

817
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,660
and go out to investigate, right?

818
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,660
Of course not.

819
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,660
Before I went out to sea,

820
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,660
I received a few emails.

821
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,660
At first, I didn't take it seriously.

822
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,660
Then, they sent me a letter

823
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,660
and told me that Chen Chuan's will

824
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,660
is in our Danyan River.

825
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,660
So, I went to the Cultural Affairs Bureau

826
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,660
to interview them.

827
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,660
The people in the Bureau told me

828
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,660
that there are indeed many

829
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,660
Chen Chuan's cultural relics

830
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,660
in foreign markets.

831
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,660
So, I decided to

832
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,660
go out to sea to investigate.

833
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,660
You know what happened later.

834
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,660
But it's hard to do

835
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,660
this by yourself.

836
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,660
Wang Chen's husband, Bai Zi Jian,

837
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,660
just transferred to

838
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,660
the Wenzhou Ocean Museum.

839
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,660
You can ask him.

840
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,660
It's best to let the Cultural Affairs Bureau

841
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,660
do an underwater inspection.

842
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,660
Captain Wang Chen?

843
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
I interviewed him in the army.

844
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,660
Great.

845
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,660
If we can find something today,

846
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,660
then this matter

847
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,660
should be done successfully.

848
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,660
Okay.

849
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,660
Zhong Qing.

850
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,660
Why are you so wet?

851
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,660
Young man.

852
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,660
I forgot to take my clothes.

853
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,660
Clothes.

854
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,660
Miss, are you his girlfriend?

855
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,660
A child fell into the water.

856
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,660
Thanks to this young man.

857
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,660
Yes.

858
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,660
It's not easy to save him.

859
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,660
He was caught several times.

860
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,660
He's great.

861
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,660
You're lucky.

862
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,660
He's great.

863
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,660
Thank you, aunt.

864
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,660
Bye.

865
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,660
Bye.

866
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,660
You saved him?

867
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,660
Is he okay?

868
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,660
Let's go.

869
00:36:47,660 --> 00:37:01,400
Take him to the

870
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,660
Wenzhou Ocean Museum.

871
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,660
Wenzhou Ocean Museum

872
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,660
Excuse me.

873
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,660
May I ask

874
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,660
why you are here?

875
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,660
I

876
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,660
put my slipper

877
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:29,660
in the ocean

878
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:33,660
when I saved them.

879
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,660
I'm standing in front of you now.

880
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,660
I've done everything your dad wanted to do.

881
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,660
Lai Yang.

882
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,660
Marry me.

883
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,660
For the rest of your life.

884
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,660
Think about it.

885
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,660
I'm too stubborn.

886
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,660
I'm not a good swimmer.

887
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,660
I don't know how to do housework.

888
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,660
I don't care.

889
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,660
Marry me.

890
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,660
I'm willing to.

891
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,660
I'm willing to.

892
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,660
Marry me.

893
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,660
I'm willing to.

894
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,660
Marry me.

895
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,660
I'm willing to.

896
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,660
Marry me.

897
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,660
I'm willing to.

898
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,660
Marry me.

899
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,660
I'm willing to.

900
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,660
Marry me.

901
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,660
I'm willing to.

902
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,660
Marry me.

903
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,660
I'm willing to.

904
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,660
Marry me.

905
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,660
I'm willing to.

906
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,660
Marry me.

907
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,660
I'm willing to.

908
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,660
Marry me.

909
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,660
I'm willing to.

910
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,660
Marry me.

911
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,660
I'm willing to.

912
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,660
Marry me.

913
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,660
I'm willing to.

914
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,660
Marry me.

915
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,660
I'm willing to.

916
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,660
Marry me.

917
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,660
I'm willing to.

918
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,660
Marry me.

919
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,660
I'm willing to.

920
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,660
I'm willing to.

921
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,660
Reporter Tang,

922
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,660
there are things we need to make it clear.

923
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,660
Say it.

924
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,660
This was your third visit to Dayan Jiao, right?

925
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,660
Yes.

926
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,660
Then you doubted someone using your computer

927
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,660
second time after going there

928
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,660
and alter the manufacturing target.

929
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,660
If your doubt was real,

930
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,660
it means

931
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,660
the other party already knew that you were investigating them.

932
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,660
And

933
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,660
the last time when my car was smashed,

934
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,660
those people must have been instructed by other people.

935
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,460
Those little rascals have been caught, right?

936
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,460
What did the police tell you?

937
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,060
The police only said that they were bribed.

938
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,660
But the people behind it are still in the investigation.

939
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,460
Then you have to think carefully.

940
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,460
Who knows about your investigation?

941
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,460
You.

942
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:01,460
President Tian, Hai, Han Yu Hao.

943
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,260
Han Yu Hao?

944
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,460
Is he the one who borrowed the boat to accompany you out of the sea?

945
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,460
Yes, it's him.

946
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,460
Why are you suspecting him?

947
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,460
He is the second son of Changzhou Group.

948
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,060
I once asked the informant

949
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,260
who was the one who was in the sea.

950
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,860
He didn't tell me, but he gave me a little clue.

951
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,060
I checked some information and went through some comparison analysis.

952
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:31,060
I found that only Changzhou Group is the most suitable for him.

953
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,060
You suspect Changzhou Group,

954
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,060
but you also asked his son to help you.

955
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,060
Didn't you pretend to be the one?

956
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,660
When I asked him for help, I didn't have any clues.

957
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,060
I wanted to go out to investigate,

958
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,860
but I happened to know him, so I asked him for help.

959
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,860
I didn't think it through.

960
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,660
Did he have a chance to use your computer?

961
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,660
No.

962
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,660
But recently, I thought of something.

963
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,660
But recently, I thought of something.

964
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,060
Was it about you being framed in the White Tunnel Bay?

965
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,060
That's right.

966
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,660
My computer was in the room in the homestay.

967
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,860
So they framed me and called the police.

968
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,660
They must have wanted to use this opportunity to enter my room and steal my computer.

969
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:16,260
Anyway, no matter what you think is right or wrong,

970
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:20,060
you can't let Han Yu Hang know about your progress in the investigation.

971
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:24,060
Also, be careful.

972
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,060
Thank you.

973
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,060
I'm sorry.

00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,060
