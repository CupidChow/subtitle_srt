00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
A'Cong,

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I know you came to Luoman with me.

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What exactly do you want?

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I know you're investigating

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
the case of Chen Chuan and Wen Mo in the prison.

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I wanted to help you, so I followed you.

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Can you share with me the clues you have in your hands?

10
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Tao Qing, I know you don't believe me.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But we don't know who will be the next victim.

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is there anything else you can hide from me?

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Then tell me the truth first.

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You followed me.

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What's your purpose?

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I know you suspect our family.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Wen Mo in prison.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I suspect him.

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
When did you start to suspect?

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
When I knew the email.

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I met and talked to someone before.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But we didn't meet.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You'll know everything in the future.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I want to find out the truth, but I have no clue.

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So I have to follow you.

26
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What if...

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What if you find out

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
that your family was in the prison?

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll try my best to stop them.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Love, but far away

31
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Hello, the subscriber you have dialed cannot be reached.

32
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,640
when you're at home?

33
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,920
We're not alone.

34
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,040
I offered you a little advice before.

35
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,600
When you're training,

36
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,540
please remember to

37
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,240
meet us at the station.

38
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,820
Do tail me when you get yourself satisfied.

39
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,880
No offence.

40
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,720
Really?

41
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,920
I'll see you, Managerlins.

42
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,220
About our meeting,

43
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,460
Wang Wenです I'll keep this a secret,

44
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,680
and nominate you.

45
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,760
First of all,

46
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,880
I want you to contact Mr. Fang.

47
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,400
Voici comment מה

48
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,220
Come on.

49
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,940
Dad, you must be careful outside.

50
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,420
Don't get lost again.

51
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,900
Dad.

52
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,100
Did you find Duan Di Di?

53
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,780
He hasn't returned to the hotel.

54
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,460
Secretary Ding doesn't know where he went.

55
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,500
How about I call home again?

56
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,700
I called.

57
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,780
I didn't see him at home or at the company.

58
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,460
Secretary Ding is still in Luo Man.

59
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,940
Yu Hang probably hasn't returned.

60
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,420
He's a grown man.

61
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,620
How can he be so blind?

62
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,660
Dad, don't worry.

63
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,340
I'll arrange more people to check on him.

64
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,340
Hmm.

65
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,740
Hey! Hey!

66
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,060
Can we talk?

67
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,100
We can pay you.

68
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,620
You name the price.

69
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,340
Hey!

70
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,980
You don't want the money?

71
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,980
Hey, bro!

72
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,180
It's useless.

73
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,980
Before you woke up,

74
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,860
I tried everything.

75
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,420
But he just didn't talk.

76
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,580
I don't know if we'll be taken there.

77
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,420
I don't know if we can go out.

78
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,180
If it weren't for me,

79
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,380
you wouldn't have to go through all this.

80
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,620
I did it willingly.

81
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,580
Just like the time when the ship was on fire,

82
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,980
you saved me.

83
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,660
I asked you for help that time.

84
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,660
I was in danger later.

85
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,340
This time, it's different.

86
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,180
You know I'm checking on your family.

87
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,580
You can ignore me.

88
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,060
Regardless of the final result,

89
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,740
whether it's related to our family,

90
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,380
I won't let you die.

91
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,460
Hello, everyone.

92
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,980
Your medical department representative,

93
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,980
Lan Dawang, is back.

94
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,980
I have good news for you.

95
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,980
I have my own baby.

96
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,980
So,

97
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,980
our theme for this episode

98
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,980
is the special topic of pregnant mothers.

99
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,980
First of all,

100
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,980
I don't recommend

101
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,980
you use highly stimulating products

102
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,980
during this period.

103
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,980
For example, acidic products.

104
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,980
This one.

105
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,980
This one.

106
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,900
This one.

107
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,300
This one.

108
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,300
This one.

109
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,300
And this one.

110
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,300
And the big bottle.

111
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Remember,

112
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
before you buy cosmetics,

113
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,100
you must read the ingredients carefully.

114
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,100
Don't buy those

115
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,100
containing vitamin A,

116
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,100
vitamin A2,

117
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
Avogadro,

118
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,220
and water-alcoholic acid.

119
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,220
Finally,

120
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,220
I suggest you

121
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,220
not to put on too much makeup

122
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,220
during the pregnancy.

123
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,220
Because it's good for our baby

124
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,220
and mother's health.

125
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,220
And I think

126
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,220
our baby

127
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,220
is the most beautiful thing.

128
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,220
Thank you,

129
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,220
the last 37 people

130
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,220
for accompanying me here.

131
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,340
I hope

132
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,340
you can

133
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,340
have a new journey.

134
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,340
And I hope

135
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,340
you can

136
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,340
do your best

137
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,340
in your own field.

138
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,340
Thank you.

139
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,340
Report.

140
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,340
Come in.

141
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,340
What's the order?

142
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,340
The fleet received

143
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,340
the notice from the International Naval Bureau.

144
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,340
A foreign cargo ship

145
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,340
was intercepted by the pirates.

146
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,340
The International Naval Bureau

147
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,340
asked the Coast Guard

148
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,340
to go to rescue it.

149
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,340
According to the principle of humanitarianism,

150
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,340
the team commander

151
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,340
decided to give up his role

152
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,340
after being informed by the superior

153
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,340
and gave us

154
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,340
the rescue mission.

155
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,340
This is the coordinates

156
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,340
of the cargo ship in the sea.

157
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,340
I'll go to the assembly team now.

158
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,340
Wait.

159
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,340
The team commander

160
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,340
sent a drone to check in in advance.

161
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,340
The cargo ship has stopped.

162
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,460
If the team commander

163
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,460
is in the cargo ship,

164
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,460
it means that the pirates have boarded the ship.

165
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,460
They may have

166
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,460
intercepted the hostage.

167
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,460
In order to ensure the hostage's safety,

168
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,460
you must board the ship secretly

169
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,460
and act accordingly.

170
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,460
Yes.

171
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,460
According to the intelligence analysis,

172
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,460
the ship may be

173
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,460
locked in the cockpit by the pirates.

174
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,460
The number of people is small.

175
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,460
Be sure to ensure the hostage's safety.

176
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,460
Hey.

177
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,460
Hey.

178
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,460
What is going on?

179
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,460
Where are you going?

180
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,460
Hey.

181
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,460
Don't leave us here.

182
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,460
Here are supposed to be

183
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,460
pirates on the board.

184
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,460
I'm leaving.

185
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,460
Good luck, guys.

186
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,460
Sir.

187
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,460
Sir.

188
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,460
Sir.

189
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,460
Sir.

190
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:25,820
Shall we go back,

191
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,260
King of Save,

192
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,140
late to return,

193
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,740
I am late to return.

194

203
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,140
The pirate will definitely be searched in dog house

204
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,500
So we have to find software store of this car before

205
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,160

The target is not placed

214
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,780
We can't deny this

215
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,280
But can you prove to Mr. Thinking

216
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,120
What should we do?

217
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,040
Find other exits.

218
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,480

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,040

They're coming in from the outside.

246
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,040
We need to find a place to hide.

247
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
They're coming.

248
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,040
OK.

249
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,700

263
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
This is Chinese Navy

264
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,840
Don't worry

265
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
All safety, all search

266
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Captain, captain

267
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840

Number 2, overboard, found a pirate

269
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
He's holding a gun and a grenade

270
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
He's holding two hostages

271
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
It's Tang reporter and Han Yuhe

272
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840

273
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840

Wang Shan, follow me to the deck

278
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,840
The rest, be careful

279
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,840
Make sure the hostage is safe

280
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
This is Chinese Navy

281
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
Put down your gun

282
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
Put your guns down

283
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,840
Or I'll stay back

284
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
Captain

285
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
We can't target

286
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Tang reporter is blocking

287
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,840
Try to get him out

288
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,840
I said guns down

289
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,840
Ok ok fine

290
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Relax

291
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
Ok fine

292
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,840
I'll put down my gun

293
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,840
And let you off the boat

294
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
8 seconds to shake

295
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,840
32 degrees to clear

296
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,840
Shoot at 1.5 seconds on the left

297
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,840
You can shoot before the explosion

298
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Action

299
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
Fire

300
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,840
How's the operation?

301
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
The operation was successful

302
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
But the anesthesia hasn't been effective

303
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,840
He needs to sleep

304
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,840
How's the wound?

305
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
The root is not a small thing

306
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,840
Even if the operation can be repaired

307
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,840
The damage may also cause

308
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
The development of the root heat and shrinkage

309
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,840
How much can it be recovered

310
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
It's still a unknown number

311
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,840
Lin Junyi, he's a special team member

312
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,840
Don't worry

313
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,840
I'll try my best

314
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,840
I'll go back first

315
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
You heard it

316
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
The operation was very successful

317
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,840
Wang Chen needs to rest

318
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
You too

319
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
Let me think

320
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
What else can I ask you?

321
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,840
There are north to south

322
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840

323
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840

324
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,840

330
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840

332
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
North Sea

333
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
South Sea

334
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840

North Sea

339
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,840
North Sea

340
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,840
South Sea

341
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,840
North Sea

342
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,840
North Sea

343
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
North Sea

344
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,840
South Sea

345
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840

347
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840

348
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
North Sea

349
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
North Sea

350
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840

351
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
South Sea

352
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,840
North Sea

353
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
South Sea

354
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
The operation is over

355
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
I have a new idea

356
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,840
I will make five

357
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,440
Sail-to-sail homing

358
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,840
Meiji Island, Chu Bi Island, Yongshu Island, Huayang Island

359
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,840
Chigua Island, Nanxun Island, Dongmen Island

360
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,840
I said seven

361
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,680
Why didn't you tell me

362
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,560
when he came back?

363
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,360
I wouldn't have told you

364
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,560
if he came back.

365
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,600
You didn't

366
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,120
call him?

367
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,720
He's in the ocean.

368
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
There's no signal.

369
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,720
It's been so long.

370
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,680
Can't he even call

371
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,600
once?

372
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,720
It's not that he can't call.

373
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,640
Sometimes, he'll call me

374
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,440
with a satellite phone.

375
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,520
That's good.

376
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,320
Zi Jian,

377
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,440
if he calls again,

378
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,000
tell him

379
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,960
to take care of his health

380
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,880
and don't tire yourself out.

381
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,080
When you finish your task,

382
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,440
go home earlier.

383
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,360
Don't worry, Mom.

384
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,480
I'll bring your words.

385
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,760
Captain Wu,

386
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,080
wait until he wakes up

387
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,160
and sees you.

388
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,160
Qiu Xiao,

389
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,800
I'm sorry

390
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,600
to bother you.

391
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,080
Help me call him.

392
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,560
He hasn't been on a boat.

393
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,160
I'm afraid he can't take care of himself.

394
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,440
I can take care of him.

395
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,920
But he wants to see you.

396
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,760
I have to see Wang Chen.

397
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,760
I'll go now.

398
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,800
I'll go now.

399
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,560
The fetus is normal.

400
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,200
The fetus is a bit frequent.

401
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,840
There's a possibility of premature delivery.

402
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,400
When you go back,

403
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,160
pay more attention to the fetus.

404
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,760
Once you find

405
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,680
the fetus bleeding,

406
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,640
you have to come back to the hospital immediately.

407
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
You've been

408
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,400
looking bad lately.

409
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,280
Are you worried about

410
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,800
the result of the breast-feeding?

411
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,640
The pregnant woman's mood

412
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,960
will affect the fetus.

413
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,040
A first child like you

414
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,640
and your husband

415
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,040
are not around.

416
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,080
We suggest

417
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,560
you try not to be alone.

418
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,240
You have to keep your mood

419
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,880
bright and happy.

420
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,720
I'll pay attention to that.

421
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,840
Sister-in-law,

422
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,960
the pregnancy period is coming.

423
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,000
Don't come to work.

424
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,960
It's only a few days away.

425
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,560
Wang Zhao Yang likes here.

426
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,680
It's good to walk around here every day.

427
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:33,680
Come on.

428
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,160
Sit down.

429
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,520
Here.

430
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,160
Be careful.

431
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,840
Okay.

432
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:41,960
Yao Yao,

433
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,000
you're pregnant too.

434
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,960
You shouldn't always go around.

435
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,440
You don't have to come every day.

436
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,320
Song Qing is not at home.

437
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,480
I'm also a free person.

438
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,200
I have nothing to say to you.

439
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,440
Remember two things.

440
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,480
First,

441
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,120
you have to keep a happy mood.

442
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,160
Second,

443
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,920
you can't be too tired.

444
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,760
Do you understand?

445
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,240
Okay.

446
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,680
Sister Yang Yang,

447
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,920
what's her name?

448
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,320
Her name is

449
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,000
Zong Xi.

450
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,640
Xi is a good name.

451
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,920
She's much better than the one in our family.

452
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,680
What's the name of the Brigadier?

453
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,760
Jin Qing.

454
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,880
Wang Jin Qing.

455
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,600
Is there anything to say?

456
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,680
Of course.

457
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,600
Jin Qing is a island.

458
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,280
It's a island

459
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,520
in the South Sea.

460
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,680
The island has a long tail.

461
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,840
It's like a mermaid.

462
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,400
My father said

463
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,760
the daughter of the navy

464
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,360
is also the daughter of the sea.

465
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,320
That's a little mermaid.

466
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,800
Let me tell you.

467
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,600
The navy is a straight line.

468
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,200
The four lines are all straight.

469
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,320
You can't beat it.

470
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,200
It seems that the Brigadier

471
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,680
often gives you a geography class at home.

472
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,800
Isn't it?

473
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,600
I'm so angry.

474
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,120
He didn't come back for ten days and a half.

475
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,400
When he came back,

476
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,480
he thought about

477
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,920
the things that he didn't write.

478
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,280
It's strange.

479
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,440
Wang Zhao Yang

480
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,720
likes to listen.

481
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,160
Zhao Yang.

482
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,080
Dad is always away.

483
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,040
Are you angry with him?

484
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,200
A little.

485
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,440
But I know

486
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,920
he doesn't mean it.

487
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,200
Yang Yang.

488
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,800
Are you worried that

489
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,240
Xi Xi will hate him

490
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,760
when he can't see Zong Ji?

491
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,160
A little.

492
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,920
When Xi Xi grows up,

493
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,960
I'll tell him

494
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,800
Zong Ji is not mean

495
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,760
to him.

496
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,280
My son is so sensible.

497
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,280
You're not your father's good son.

498
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,040
I'm not.

499
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,720
Hello.

500
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,320
What?

501
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,520
Uncle Wang Chen fell down?

502
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,160
Slow down.

503
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,440
Sister-in-law, slow down.

504
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,320
Come on.

505
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:47,880
Sister-in-law.

506
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,600
Sit down.

507
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,960
How is Aunt Bai?

508
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,600
The doctor said

509
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,840
she'll be fine.

510
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,920
She'll be home

511
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
after the wound is treated.

512
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,840
It's really not good

513
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,960
to leave the old man alone at home.

514
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,360
Xiao Bai and Wang Chen are not at home.

515
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:02,840
Right.

516
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,040
I'll go and spend money.

517
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,080
You rest.

518
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,560
Don't move.

519
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,440
I'm going.

520
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,240
Yang Yang, don't run.

521
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,120
Your body.

522
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,320
This kid.

523
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,400
Mr. Han.

524
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,120
Don't get too close to the barge

525
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,920
at sea.

526
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,880
It's not safe.

527
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,400
You'd better go back to the warehouse.

528
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,040
I've been through the most dangerous part.

529
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,680
Thank you.

530
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,840
This is your second time to save me.

531
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,400
This is what we should do.

532
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,600
Captain Wu, do you know

533
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,320
why I appeared on that boat?

534
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,560
Although I don't know how to sell things,

535
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,400
I still thank you

536
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,800
for taking care of Tang Xin for me.

537
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,520
You don't know how to sell things?

538
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,400
You're her boyfriend.

539
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,720
Don't you know she's going to Luoman?

540
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,200
I don't know.

541
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,720
If I knew,

542
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,640
I wouldn't let her go alone.

543
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,240
Besides,

544
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,440
she doesn't need my consent

545
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,040
in terms of work.

546
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,840
I just hope she can be safe.

547
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,120
Captain Wu.

548
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,440
She's an investigation reporter.

549
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,280
The investigation is

550
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,200
a matter of the eye.

551
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,720
How could it be safe?

552
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,480
Let's take this chance to say

553
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,240
if we didn't meet

554
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,600
your escort and come back,

555
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,040
the consequences would be unimaginable.

556
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,840
I'm sorry.

557
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,400
I...

558
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,720
I'm not blaming you.

559
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,320
I'm just worried about Tang Xin's safety

560
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,600
and hope that

561
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,440
you can make her safer in the future.

562
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,840
Thank you for your reminder.

563
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,360
Yang Yang.

564
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,800
The doctor said Aunt Bai is fine.

565
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,320
I'll go and see her with Wang Zheng Yang tonight.

566
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,720
You've been working all day.

567
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,800
Go back and rest early.

568
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,240
No.

569
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,320
I have to watch you and Zhao Yang.

570
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,720
You're like Aunt Bai.

571
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,800
You're the main protector.

572
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
Why do I have to be the main protector?

573
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,480
Come on.

574
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,320
Driver, please drive slowly.

575
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
My mom is a rich man.

576
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,080
Wang Zheng Yang.

577
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,520
Why are you like your dad?

578
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,200
You always say I'm a rich man.

579
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,840
How could I be a rich man?

580
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,160
Don't worry, kid.

581
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,600
Uncle is a very stable driver.

582
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,560
That's right.

583
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,680
Amao Teng.

584
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,560
You their boss?

585
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,280

586
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,200
Mom, don't cry.

587
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
I'm fine.

588
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,720
Attention, shops.

589
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,360
Say Cheese was right.

590
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,220
Get ready to have the bringing out of the car sleep.

591
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm sorry.

592
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,720
I'd like to ask

593
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,400
if you know Captain Wu Si?

594
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,320
Captain Wu?

595
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,200
Yes.

596
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,040
Do you know where he is?

597
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,600
He's practicing the double-edged sword.

598
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
Okay, thank you.

599
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,800
Hello?

600
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,360
Hello, Mr. Wang.

601
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:26,400
Your lover is finally born.

602
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,960
Hello, Mr. Wang.

603
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,400
Your lover is already born.

604
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,560
Hello, Mr. Wang.

605
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,600
Hello.

606
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,200
Wanya,

607
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,680
and help me to look for the needle.

608
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,640
Is there a � logo within this pattern?

609
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,400
Help me get up.

610
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,080
I want to check my leg.

611
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,400
ées.

612
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,360
This job can't help you,

613
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,400
I need to help know your movie director

614
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,040
then I'll pull your skin off.

615
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,200
No worries,

616
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:04,840
Captain Chen.

617
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,600
Actually, I'm here

618
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,640
to ask you for a favor.

619
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,800
What is it?

620
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,920
There's a custom in our hometown.

621
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,560
A baby has to be recognized as a godmother

622
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,640
after it's born.

623
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,440
Look.

624
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:34,760
Captain Chen.

625
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,920
His right leg is broken.

626
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,680
His calf bone is broken.

627
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,920
The situation is worse than expected.

628
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,840
Lin Junyi has asked the Brigadier

629
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,160
to stop telling him the truth.

630
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,920
Captain Chen is a strong man.

631
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,680
He knows it's not good for him to recover.

632
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,320
No matter what,

633
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,440
Captain Chen will recover, right?

634
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,280
He will definitely recover, right?

635
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,760
Is there any other way?

636
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,680
We've tried our best.

637
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,840
But medical care can't solve all the problems.

638
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,160
We don't know

639
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,000
what the final result will be.

640
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,200
I can't comfort you now

641
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,560
that there will be a miracle.

642
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,640
Dr. Qiu.

643
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,800
From a medical point of view,

644
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,720
how much can Captain Chen recover?

645
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,360
After systematic recovery training,

646
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,400
he can walk

647
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,440
with the help of the machine for a while.

648
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,200
Thecheers!

649
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,400
Let it go.

650
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,360
Eat.

651
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,680
What are you doing?

652
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,840
I'll leave first.

653
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,160
Okay.

654
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,640
I'll put you here,

655
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,200
marks your placement.

656
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
I'll leave first, Captain Chen.

657
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,360
Zong Qing.

658
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,560
I know

659
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,120
you're here to comfort me.

660
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,760
Captain Chen.

661
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,560
Sh canceling

662
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,000
Ms. Lin, please be careful.

663
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,920
Uncle Zhong重汝 will go right over, huh?

664
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,040
I'm going to clean up.

665
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,440
Can make me feel at ease

666
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,440
Let everything look romantic

667
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,440
The dream is also very plain

668
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,440
But in your heart

669
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,440
There are more expectations

670
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,440
I really understand

671
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,440
You say love is too vague

672
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,440
But the eyes gave me the answer

673
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
Courage all the lucky

674
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,440
Can meet you

675
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,440
Thank you for waking up

676
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,440
That once weak courage

677
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,440
Let all coincidences become distant

678
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,440
Let all the simple things become common

679
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,440
Open the door of the future

680
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,440
How can I still not let us separate

681
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,440
You wait for the heart to warm

682
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,440
In memory, why don't you answer me

683
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,440
The time is too far away

684
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,440
I still have the yearning

685
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,440
I don't want to break up

686
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,440
Courage all the lucky

687
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,440
Let all coincidences become distant

688
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,440
Thank you for being by my side

689
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,440
The cold snow and the cold

690
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,440
The world is getting bigger and lonely

691
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,440
Only standing by your side

692
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,440
I feel warm in my life
