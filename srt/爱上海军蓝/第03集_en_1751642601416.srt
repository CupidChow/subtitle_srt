1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,100
J QUAN Guys, what the hell are you doing?

2
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,660
What the hell are you saying?

3
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,900
Can't we find some other places

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,860
to sleep?

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,900
Did you also find a place to Spread the word?

6
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,080
I also found a place to Wednesday Nights.

7
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,000
How about being late?

8
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,420
Shit 똥ares.

9
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,440
I don't want to be late anymore.

10
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,200
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,560
Please sit.

12
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,560
Sir, what can I do for you?

13
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,720
It's Saturday.

14
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,280
It's the usual time.

15
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,360
It's six o'clock in the evening.

16
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,160
The restaurant is open.

17
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,840
Please make the price good.

18
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,400
Sir.

19
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
About the blind date,

20
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,520
you should tell the chief.

21
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,880
Is it necessary to tell me?

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,560
You should be careful.

23
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,400
Be careful.

24
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,400
Captain Song.

25
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,960
You look handsome.

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,120
Are you going on a blind date?

27
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,080
Don't ask me if you shouldn't.

28
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,640
Where's my camera?

29
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,800
Why do you need a camera for a blind date?

30
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,600
I'm going to meet someone.

31
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,080
Hello?

32
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,640
Who is that?

33
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,320
Okay.

34
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,600
Yes.

35
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,480
Who are you?

36
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,980
I'm from the land Bob,

37
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,620
for the last time.

38
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,360
The camera has been fixed.

39
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,440
I could drop by to you tonight.

40
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,840
Or if you feel awkward,

41
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,740
I'll get it delivered.

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,020
Let meee meet you then.

43
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,640
I have something to tell you.

44
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,280
I know.

45
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,920
I know.

46
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,960
Don't worry.

47
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,880
I've been very hardworking since I was a kid.

48
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,360
My father is also a soldier.

49
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,120
When I came back last time,

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,400
he taught me a lesson.

51
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,920
I feel embarrassed.

52
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,960
You don't have to feel embarrassed.

53
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,680
I'm the one who feels embarrassed.

54
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,480
Let's not push each other.

55
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,280
How about this?

56
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,920
Send me an address.

57
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,640
I'll go find you.

58
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,960
Pingcheng Restaurant.

59
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,600
I'll contact you when I'm done.

60
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,320
I'll go find you.

61
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,240
I'll go find you.

62
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
I'll go find you.

63
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
I'll go find you.

64
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
I'll go find you.

65
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
I'll go find you.

66
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,680
Jeggy Zhang

67
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,440
What's wrong with you?

68
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:03,840
J Capella

69
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,880
Have you asked the closest cousin?

70
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,840
I told her already.

71
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,760
No, no.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,920
You asked her already.

73
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,400
I clearly won't go.

74
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,280
Pingcheng Restaurant…

75
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,880
Have you changed it?

76
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,880
Changed clothes

77
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,080
is more complicated than pushing a bus.

78
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,040
I've changed it.

79
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,760
Please enter.

80
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,600
Hello there!

81
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,000
I-I...

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,560
I asked you to change into a Straight pants.

83
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,840
Yes. What's up?

84
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,800
You have an appointment again?

85
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,320
Little wild monkey, let me tell you.

86
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,640
You don't want to go anywhere today.

87
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,960
Dad, why are you so tight?

88
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,080
Tight?

89
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,840
I'll let you go when I get into the room.

90
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,400
I won't pull you if you want me to.

91
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,360
After you get in,

92
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,080
be polite and call someone first.

93
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,480
Don't clap your teeth.

94
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,120
Or else, I'll talk to you

95
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,000
about my daughter, Tang Yuanchao.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,160
I heard you. I heard you.

97
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,640
Ah.

98
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,640
Come on.

99
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,360
Would you like him?

100
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,200
He has a PET patient right now.

101
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,000
society

102
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,720
What are you doing?

103
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,960
I'm randomly looking for him recently.

104
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,080
Walk carefully.

105
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,200
I can go against them.

106
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,480
I'm not so good with walking.

107
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Go back now.

108
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,040
Don't...

109
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,760
Don't come any closer.

110
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,720
My leg is not good.

111
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,400
Slow down.

112
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,000
I...

113
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,760
Dad.

114
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,160
Chief Zhang.

115
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,640
Don't call me by my name.

116
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,840
Chief.

117
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,440
What are you doing?

118
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,560
Hello, Uncle Wang.

119
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,440
Xin Xin is more beautiful than usual.

120
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,440
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

121
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,160
Sit down.

122
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,760
Okay.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,760
Where is Wu Si?

124
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,000
Dad.

125
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,240
Do you have a secret code?

126
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,880
What secret code?

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,520
His name is Wu Si.

128
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,520
Stop joking.

129
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,280
Who gives such a strange name?

130
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:18,840
Don't...

131
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
Don't be so nosy.

132
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,800
It's okay.

133
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,000
Xin Xin.

134
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,920
His name is Wu Si.

135
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,400
He is the captain of the Blue Town Assault Team of the Navy.

136
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,720
I brought the best soldiers.

137
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,320
He will have dinner with the old captain today.

138
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,640
Where is he?

139
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,440
He went to the bathroom.

140
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,080
He will be back soon.

141
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't worry, old captain.

142
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,800
Then I...

143
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,640
What are you doing?

144
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,600
You are poisoned.

145
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,120
It's useless. He didn't come.

146
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,240
I have to make up for it.

147
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,840
I have put on a lot of makeup.

148
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,920
How will I look like later?

149
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,360
No.

150
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,040
Uncle Wang, look.

151
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,920
Old captain.

152
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,200
Let Xin Xin go.

153
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,200
Girls are all about their image.

154
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,680
Uncle Wang is so considerate.

155
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,560
What are you doing?

156
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,240
Hand over the phone.

157
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,120
What if you don't come back?

158
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,960
Here you are.

159
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,880
Here.

160
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,520
My goodness.

161
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,040
You are more handsome than a soldier.

162
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,960
Don't be angry.

163
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,240
They are here.

164
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,040
Ms. Tang.

165
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,960
Did you

166
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,760
encounter any accident?

167
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,080
It's hard to explain.

168
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,800
Forget it.

169
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,360
Why do you look like you are in trouble?

170
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,480
This is for you.

171
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,880
See if there are any problems.

172
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,880
You didn't see what's inside, right?

173
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,640
No.

174
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,640
My comrades-in-arms fixed it.

175
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,280
Okay.

176
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,640
Any other questions?

177
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,280
Yes.

178
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,560
I still want to ask.

179
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,240
The one who carried out the bulletin and rescued the wounded

180
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,960
is the person you know, right?

181
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,400
You haven't answered my question.

182
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,840
Why do you want to know?

183
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,560
Because I was there that day.

184
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,840
I know

185
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,200
how dangerous it is.

186
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,320
The one who was reported

187
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,560
shouldn't be a female superman.

188
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,800
It was the soldier of the navy that day.

189
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,240
I want to report the truth.

190
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,080
Please give me this chance.

191
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,800
The duty of a soldier

192
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,280
is to obey orders and complete tasks.

193
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,400
According to the rules,

194
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,960
I can't tell you.

195
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,560
You can't tell me the rules, right?

196
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,560
Can't I give you a little hint?

197
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,240
If you don't give me a hint, I'll leave.

198
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,800
Is that so?

199
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,160
Your demonstHello is in my team now.

200
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,880
What can I do for you?

201
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,720
A hint?

202
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,600
Yes.

203
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,440
Okay.

204
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,880
A head size.

205
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,800
Fair skin.

206
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,000
Wide shoulders.

207
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,320
Enough?

208
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,280
That's all.

209
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,560
That's all?

210
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,440
Are each marine soldier

211
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,600
exactly the same?

212
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,600
You are making me feel Duty-Free.

213
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,440
Sorry.

214
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,320
I'm busy.

215
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,560
Have to go now.

216
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
I heard that Lin Lan's case with the army has been approved.

217
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Yes.

218
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,360
She has already resigned from her job.

219
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,760
She will be here in a few days.

220
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,360
Finally, she is a member of the family.

221
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,960
If two people are together,

222
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,560
it's only a family.

223
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
I'm looking forward to this day.

224
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,960
Oh my god.

225
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,760
Mr. Tan.

226
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
Si.

227
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Hello.

228
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Hello.

229
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Hello.

230
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
Hello.

231
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
Hello.

232
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
Please sit.

233
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Come, Si.

234
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Come here.

235
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,360
Dad, I'm back.

236
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,360
Why are you here?

237
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,960
Reporter Tang.

238
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,760
Do you know each other?

239
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
No.

240
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,560
Have you ordered?

241
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,560
No.

242
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,360
Go, go, go.

243
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,760
Go and order.

244
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,160
This is a big thing.

245
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Come.

246
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,160
Mr. Fang.

247
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,560
Mr. Fang, it's not suitable.

248
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,560
Yes, it's not suitable.

249
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
You're a good girl, so it's suitable for you.

250
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,160
No, it's not suitable.

251
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,280
this?

252
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,320
Buy your cell phone.

253
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,240
Come on.

254
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,520
But all in one.

255
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,680
Why are you here?

256
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,640
I'm here to date someone.

257
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,480
Who is talking?

258
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,440
Can't hear.

259
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,760
Hurry up.

260
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,040
I'm the captain of the Blue Team.

261
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,320
So you didn't take part in the rescue operation

262
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,840
of the Big Rocks?

263
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,200
I didn't expect that

264
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,760
the blind date this time

265
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,960
would be a reporter Tang.

266
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,680
Since you're here,

267
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,520
let's have a good chat.

268
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,200
Sure.

269
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,680
But don't get me wrong.

270
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Don't worry, Captain Wu.

271
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,160
I won't.

272
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
I'm here.

273
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,240
It seems that

274
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,120
you really care about the blind date.

275
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,480
You cut your nails,

276
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
put on your shirt,

277
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
and shaved your beard.

278
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,880
But you don't want people to see

279
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,520
your importance.

280
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,360
So you pulled

281
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,520
the shirt sleeve out just now.

282
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,120
You want to look casual.

283
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,440
I heard boastens onions

284
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,120
didn't grow up in the twilight.

285
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,960
So you nutritionally

286
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,600
chose them from estado.

287
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,560
It's natural for sea sculptor

288
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,560
to give any training

289
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,080
without being minded.

290
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,760
But how did it come

291
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,800
to this?

292
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,640
Although numerical

293
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,840
model has been

294
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
reproduced in China,

295
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,240
but not Hu Xuzhou.

296
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,120
It has never been

297
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,760
Captain Wu, to be honest,

298
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,120
I did come here

299
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,320
to ask you out.

300
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,240
But you always ask me out.

301
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,600
We can't continue.

302
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,200
You have a boyfriend.

303
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,200
Why do you want to ask me out?

304
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,840
Han Yuhang said so himself.

305
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,280
I never admitted it.

306
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,160
I'm sorry.

307
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,640
But Captain Wu

308
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,040
is very suitable for my standard.

309
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,160
What standard are you?

310
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,600
Fresh.

311
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,720
Good-looking.

312
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,160
Not bad.

313
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,800
Since we're so fated,

314
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,760
why don't we

315
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,720
try to be friends?

316
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,440
It's been so long.

317
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,200
Why hasn't he come back yet?

318
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,880
I'm still worried.

319
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,480
How about calling him?

320
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,920
Why call him?

321
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,000
He's with a soldier.

322
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,120
He'll be fine.

323
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,280
Maybe they'll have a good time.

324
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,240
Say it.

325
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,640
We met for the first time,

326
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,600
but we didn't meet in secret.

327
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,560
First time meeting.

328
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,520
First meeting.

329
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,560
We met in a row.

330
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,600
And then?

331
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,200
Stupid.

332
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,160
Very stupid.

333
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,960
Smart.

334
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,920
Kind.

335
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,720
Very interesting.

336
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,600
You can't leave the secret rule in three sentences.

337
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,640
You can't leave the big deal in every question.

338
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,720
You don't want me to know

339
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,880
who saved me from the big deal.

340
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,240
No.

341
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,000
You've been talking for a long time.

342
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,280
You've been talking for a long time.

343
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,440
Will you two go out together?

344
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,720
Will we?

345
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,200
Yes.

346
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,080
Captain Wu.

347
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,920
Since we're so fated,

348
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,880
why don't we

349
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,320
try to date?

350
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,120
Okay.

351
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,800
So quick.

352
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,560
I know you don't like blind dates.

353
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
But we need to continue to be friends.

354
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,920
Because you have to complete your blind date mission.

355
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,000
My name is Wu Si.

356
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,880
I'm a professional soldier.

357
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm a junior in the battalion.

358
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,120
I'm the captain of the assault team

359
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,480
of the current navy special forces.

360
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,080
I entered the army in high school

361
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,440
and got into the military school.

362
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,960
Why do you say that all of a sudden?

363
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,720
Didn't you say we need to keep in touch?

364
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,160
We need to be fully prepared

365
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,360
and prepare for the situation in advance.

366
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,320
Don't be confused.

367
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,160
Because your profession is special,

368
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,200
during the relationship,

369
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,640
I can't go shopping with my girlfriend.

370
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,000
I'll often get lost.

371
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,920
And I can't share my life.

372
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,880
At any time,

373
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,560
I'm a soldier first.

374
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,480
Then I'm a boyfriend or husband.

375
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,120
Okay.

376
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,760
Captain Wu.

377
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,840
Let's talk about it later.

378
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,200
Let's talk about it later.

379
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
Why do we decide to date?

380
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,120
Didn't you say I met your standard of responsibility?

381
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,480
No.

382
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,440
My dad knows

383
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,520
the soldier is never in my range of responsibility.

384
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,600
Unless there's an exception.

385
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,080
What exception?

386
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,360
Unless

387
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,520
you're the one who saved me

388
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,560
in the battle.

389
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,120
The one who saved you can't be repaid.

390
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,800
You can only learn from him.

391
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,320
What a reasonable reason.

392
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,120
I disagree.

393
00:16:48,000 --> 00:17:00,440
It has nothing to do with the

394
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,400
You just agreed to have contact with me.

395
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,000
Really?

396
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,000
Okay.

397
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,280
Deal.

398
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,200
No.

399
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,000
No.

400
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,360
I now officially announce

401
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,480
that Captain Wu and I

402
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,240
will have a friendship

403
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,840
as a premise.

404
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,760
Really?

405
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,560
Great.

406
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,040
Goodbye.

407
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,480
Be reserved.

408
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,480
Let's have gingerbread chicken for dinner.

409
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,360
He is handsome.

410
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,280
What a boss.

411
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,040
Thanks.

412
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,380
You can come if you want to.

413
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,280
Mmm.

414
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,080
Mmm.

415
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,160
Mmm.

416
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,960
Excellent!

417
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,360
Hello, divisor.

418
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,160
Salute.

419
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,280
Why are you standing here?

420
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,200
To investigate or contact?

421
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,720
philosophy,стprepare for investigation.

422
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,200
and running in the corridor.

423
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,320
You're always making a fuss.

424
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,320
How dare you

425
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,200
hit the gun?

426
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,680
Report.

427
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,680
Get up.

428
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,520
Yes.

429
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,960
Do you know what I'm here for?

430
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,680
Yes.

431
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,760
I'm here to talk about the media.

432
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,520
Go on.

433
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,760
Yes.

434
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,760
During the training this week,

435
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,080
the Department of Defense received a request

436
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,720
to stop the rescue team

437
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,400
from attacking the special forces

438
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,240
according to the superior's instructions.

439
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,000
Stop the rescue.

440
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,760
I don't know about it.

441
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,120
Yes.

442
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
During the rescue,

443
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,040
a reporter fell into the water by accident.

444
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,240
The rescue team

445
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,360
reacted quickly on site.

446
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,200
They were in danger.

447
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,200
The rescue team was safe.

448
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,520
After that,

449
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,040
the relevant staff

450
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,000
conducted a summary reflection.

451
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,520
It's a good idea.

452
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,600
You should pay attention

453
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,760
to avoid the media's excessive publicity

454
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,200
from causing unnecessary trouble.

455
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,000
Yes.

456
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,600
Chief,

457
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,680
there are indeed

458
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,360
some small differences in this incident.

459
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,680
If there is any negative impact,

460
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I will take full responsibility.

461
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,880
You don't have to avoid it all the time.

462
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,280
You can discuss it

463
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,440
with your political commissar later.

464
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,040
The official media interview

465
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,920
can be arranged appropriately.

466
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,320
The publicity team is a good thing.

467
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,240
But you should pay attention to your cousin's work.

468
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,320
Don't be out of line.

469
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,240
Yes.

470
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,160
Hello, Chief.

471
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,840
Chief.

472
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,600
Chief,

473
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,960
I'm not angry.

474
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,760
How old are you?

475
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,760
19.

476
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,800
Are you tired?

477
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,760
No.

478
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,400
Are you hungry?

479
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,200
Yes.

480
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,040
Why don't you let him eat first?

481
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,800
Yes.

482
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,840
Tomorrow morning,

483
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,160
report to me here.

484
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,440
Yes.

485
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,000
Go.

486
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
Ding

487
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,680
is one year younger than the other.

488
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,080
He is 19 years old.

489
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,160
He looks like a grown-up.

490
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,920
My daughter

491
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
will always be grown-up.

492
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,160
Chief,

493
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,760
Yangyang should graduate.

494
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,680
The graduation ceremony has just been organized.

495
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,120
The small society meeting is coming soon.

496
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,520
So fast.

497
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,800
What's your plan?

498
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
What's his plan?

499
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,660
We can try our best to knock United States over.

500
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,880
Is it this one?

501
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,360
Dear,

502
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,840
I know marriage is not easy.

503
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,440
One day I will never soak in regret

504
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm so happy to see you.

505
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,800
Thank you.

506
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,200
It's our honor to have a talent like you.

507
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,400
It's my honor too.

508
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,520
Let's go.

509
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,640
Let's go to the office.

510
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,200
Okay.

511
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,280

You're being asked for time

520
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,120
to pick up my lTE push notifications reporting.

521
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,600
Because we're not a professional team,

522
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,120
we can talk tofu-pl장

out of the lady's YouTubely.

524
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,640

Please stay informed.

530
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,760
I'm sorry for your sincerity

531
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,000
The sea of ​​Danyuan Island is too vast

532
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,760
This time I will give you the sea of ​​Danyuan Island

533
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,480
I drank too

534
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,080
Say it

535
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,600
I still need a boat

536
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,440
Use the boat

537
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,440
What are you doing

538
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,600
Go out to sea

539
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,000
That is, I and reporter Tang

540
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,720
I have to go to Danyuan Island again

541
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,760
You just got out of the sea

542
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,200
Now go out to sea again

543
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,800
I told you last time

544
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,120
Don't get involved in this

545
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,320
Moreover, dad is abroad

546
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,560
What are you going to do

547
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,800
How do I explain to the old man

548
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,360
Come on, don't be excited

549
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,440
If this is someone else, I will not do it

550
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,080
But I have to care about reporter Tang

551
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,080
You think

552
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,280
I helped him borrow a boat

553
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,600
It's our boat in Changzhou

554
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,400
Lost the fire

555
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,080
I almost put his life in the sea

556
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,640
right

557
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,000
I feel guilty

558
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
plus

559
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,120
Our face in Changzhou can't be lost

560
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,960
I have to find another chance

561
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,440
I can't find my face back

562
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,600
How do you care

563
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,280
Such a big sea

564
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,640
Where to find

565
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,320
Don't joke

566
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,560
This time it's different

567
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,600
This time I have a coordinates

568
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,680
That person

569
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,800
Give reporter Tang an email

570
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,040
A precise location

571
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,600
We just go there

572
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,800
I also thought about it

573
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,120
This is the last time

574
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,240
I found it

575
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,160
Great joy

576
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,080
Right, I don't find it

577
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,920
I also think

578
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,560

But for a captain

606
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,040
mentality is slow

607
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920

to get back to the camp.

615
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,000
Forget it.

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,680
Don't ask.

Captain,

619
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,600
we have a notice from the superior.

620
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,080
Please go back to the camp immediately.

621
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,320
Roger that.

622
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,480
Get in the car.

00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,120
Go.

624
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,480
Report that

625
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
the department of heat

626
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,720
has accepted the Technique Web鐲 immediately.

627
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,120
Turn to your right.

628
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,040
Turn to your front.

629
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,440
At ease.

630
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,920
Attention.

631
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,960
Turn to your right.

632
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,160
Look to the left.

633
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,320
Let's go.

634
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,680
Let's go.

635
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,200
Let's go.

636
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,240
Seems sobewwy.

637
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,920
Simon.

638
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,880
Simon, be careful.

639
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,080
According to the D GT shortly after,

640
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,160
many fishermen

641
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,520
have MAYH了

642
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,440
nuptialhou Fucking

643
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,760
and they are presumptuous

644
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,160
about the acquisition.

645
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,680
and are considered to be outsiders.

646
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,280
They sneaked in to investigate.

647
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,600
It's about the safety of the sea.

648
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,840
The marine police

649
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,960
asked us for help.

650
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,960
The superior ordered my team

651
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,720
to return to the base of the sea

652
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,600
and work with the marine police

653
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,080
to strengthen the special operation of the underwater shrimp.

654
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,240
Do you understand?

655
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,160
Yes.

656
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
Turn right.

657
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,440
Turn left.

658
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,680
Turn right.

659
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,320
Liu Qi,

660
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,000
why did you bring me

661
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,080
to such a far place?

662
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,160
You don't know, right?

663
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,000
Baitun Bay

664
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,720
is a newly developed tourist attraction.

665
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,640
The homestays here are very popular.

666
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,800
I want to ask you to take a look.

667
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,080
If it's possible,

668
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,200
I want to have a look too.

669
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,560
You want me to take a look?

670
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,440
Then you really trust me.

671
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,000
You are a reporter who travels to the north and south.

672
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,800
Your taste must be better than mine.

673
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,120
Don't say that.

674
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,440
There are really specialties here.

675
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,280
Let's find a homestay

676
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,080
and put down our bags first.

677
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,840
Then we can go out.

678
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,080
Okay.

679
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,600
How about it?

680
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,720
This is your room.

681
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,200
How about it?

682
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,760
Okay.

683
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,240
Put down your things first.

684
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,520
My room is next to yours.

685
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,280
Take a rest.

686
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,920
We'll eat something later.

687
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,960
Okay.

688
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,920
I'm hungry too.

See you later.

690
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,400
Okay. See you later.

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,520
Come on. Cheers.

695
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,480
Let's go.

696
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,080
Tang Xin,

697
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,640

698
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,800
Come with me.

699
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,360
Let's go.

700
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:38,880
You...

701
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,560
I want to buy it for my husband.

702
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,720
I haven't seen him for a few days.

703
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,720
I miss him so much.

704
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,960
How do you open a store?

705
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,400
Bring him here.

706
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,120
Thank you.

707
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,520
Officer,

708
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,960
how many times have I told you?

709
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,920
That's not mine.

710
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,560
Is this bag yours?

711
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
The bag is mine.

712
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,280
What's that?

713
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,480
How would I know?

714
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,200
I said the bag is mine.

715
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,400
This is not mine.

716
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,360
Please accompany us

717
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,760
to the office and investigate.

718
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,480
Let's go.

719
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,200
I have a friend who came with me.

720
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
He's washing the bathroom.

721
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,040
Liu Qi.

722
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,960
Liu Qi.

723
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
Gu Si.

724
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
Why are you here?

725
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,360
Tell them

726
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,040
that I have a forbidden item in my bag.

727
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040

Comrade Jiefang Jun, you have to believe me.

Ask him. He knows me.

730
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,240
I'm his girlfriend.

731
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
Honey.

732
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Honey.

733
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,160
I was caught.

734
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,920
Say something.

735
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,680
Comrade.

736
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,960
We have a mission.

737
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,160
Please understand.

741
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,200

742
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,920
Let me see.

743

Gu Si.

744
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,040
Say something.

745
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,240
You don't know me?

746
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,080
Gu Si.

747
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,720
Say something.

748
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,840
What do you mean?

749
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,720
What do you mean?

750
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,400
I'm his girlfriend.

751
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,040
What's going on?

752
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,080
Girlfriend?

753
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,160
Mr. Tang's daughter.

754
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,000
Who?

755
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,440
Mr. Tang's daughter.

756
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,400
Why don't you ask him?

757
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,000
You think I don't want to save her?

758
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,320
But at least I need to figure out

759
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,280
why she's like this.

760
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,100
I will make some money.

761
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,220
This isJust a paper.

762
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,700
Thank you.

Suspect.

00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,640
I've told many times on the way,

767
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,260
There isn't mine.

768
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,580
Who's it from?

769
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,420
How can you do this?

770
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,340
I'm sure you understand.

771
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,740
You've offended someone.

772
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,460
That's the nature of our job.

773
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,260
We often offend people.

774
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,980
We also hope to believe you.

775
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,260
But before we find the evidence,

776
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,820
you must cooperate with the investigation.

777
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,940
I understand.

778
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,300
I want to ask you something.

779
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:46,940
What happened to the girl

780
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,180
who was taken away by the police

781
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,060
here?

782
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,060
What happened?

783
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,500
Do you know her?

784
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,220
Yes.

785
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,740
She's the name of our old captain.

786
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,380
I know this.

787
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,180
She's suspected of hiding the illegal goods.

788
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,420
She's currently being questioned

789
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,380
by the police.

790
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,820
Hiding the illegal goods?

791
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,620
Captain Wang,

792
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,020
I know her.

793
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,740
She shouldn't be hiding the illegal goods.

794
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,660
Someone must be the one who's framing her.

795
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,260
This is a false statement.

796
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,380
We need evidence.

797
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,660
Captain Wu, what are you looking for?

798
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,740
A camera.

799
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,300
You don't need to look for it.

800
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,300
I know this place very well.

801
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,460
There's no camera here.

802
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,700
Thatetz.

803
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,860
Do you need a camera?

804
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,020
I've already used it on my withdraw range.

805
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,420
Is there still any高 hunt?

806
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,540
No, there is still one hunt,

807
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,820
and we haven't caught anything yet before morning runs out.

808
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,900
I'll immediately kgte

809
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,940
your knowledge to Evacuate.

810
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,540
WW list.

811
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,260
Please get it.

812
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,780
We will step bymyse.

813
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,260
Officer Han,

814
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,980
this is the image taken

815
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,980
you're the man in the picture, Commander Huang.

816
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,060
At this moment,

817
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,920
something unknown is being put into boca 많은

818
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,860
Tang Di Zhe's臥室.

819
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,600
What are you looking at?

820
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,540
Chief Seriously, this won't pass.

821
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:54,700
I MANTH put this in the pocket if you can get it when I leave the guardhouse.

822
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,740
Chief Really.

823
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,300
Chief Make the trouble.

824
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,060
According to what your brother said,

825
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,900
our man confirmed to me in front of the officer.

826
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,060
Isn't it good to think of him as one of your father's allies?

827
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,340
you can tell them that you know me.

828
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,900
I'm not a bad person, right?

829
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,900
Didn't you tell them that

830
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,060
you've been yelling at them?

831
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,300
I've been yelling at them.

832
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,380
You didn't help me.

833
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,700
Let me apologize to you.

834
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,140
Tang Di Zhe.

835
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,740
No need to apologize.

836
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:39,940
But

837
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,820
you have to tell me

838
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,020
who you're kidding with

839
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,660
when you're in the big family.

840
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,660
Impossible.

841
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,940
Then you're not sincere

842
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,700
when you're making an apology.

843
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,540
You have to be sincere.

844
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,180
If you have to be sincere,

845
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,580
you can ask someone to take me away.

846
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,380
Let me tell you.

847
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,180
Thanks to you,

848
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,820
I've done my second time in the public service.

849
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,100
If they can't find the evidence,

850
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,180
I'll be sentenced to

851
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,460
a crime of stealing drugs.

852
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,260
I'll be responsible for you in prison.

853
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,580
Will you take care of my parents?

854
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,660
I won't be able to get into the public service in the future.

855
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,700
Are you going to find a job?

856
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,180
Tang Di Zhe.

857
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,060
Let me analyze it for you.

858
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,380
First,

859
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,620
the police officer took you away

860
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,020
because there are unknown

861
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,220
illegal items in your bag.

862
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:16,980
Second,

863
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,540
as long as you have illegal items,

864
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,220
you're one of the suspects.

865
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,100
Third,

866
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:21,980
you won't go to jail.

867
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,140
Because I will find the evidence.

868
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:24,980
No doubt.

869
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,780
You're even

870
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,540
on the first and second to third place.

871
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,740
But Tang Di Zhe is pretending to be a military girlfriend.

872
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,180
It's not enough to be a cowardly behavior.

873
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,820
When you're in the police station,

874
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,660
I'll take care of you

875
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,860
and your aunt.

876
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,500
As for the child,

877
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,460
when you have it,

878
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,820
you can consider its direction of employment.

879
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,580
Wu Si.

880
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,740
Wu Si.

881
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,620
Don't tell me.

882
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,540
Tell me.

883
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,900
I'll go to find the person who saved me.

884
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,380
It's a very important thing.

885
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,740
No matter what you do,

886
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,900
you should talk to me first.

887
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,980
You're talking too much.

888
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,860
To be honest,

889
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,140
I'm sorry for today.

890
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,500
Whether you accept it or not,

891
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,500
I have to apologize to you.

892
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,020
I have something to do.

893
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,860
I have to go back.

894
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,420
I'll go first.

895
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,300
You can't go.

896
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,860
You were so embarrassed that day.

897
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,980
The police took me away.

898
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,820
I don't want to be embarrassed.

899
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,900
Tao Jinzhe,

900
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
what do you think we should do?

901
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,860
I've already made a deal with my parents

902
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,100
to keep in touch with you.

903
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,260
Even if it's acting,

904
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,300
you have to act.

905
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,580
Act?

906
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,660
See you this weekend.

907
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,660
Mr. Han.

908
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,820
Mr. Han, you called me.

909
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,220
Find out as soon as possible

910
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,780
who is the owner of this email.

911
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,180
The sooner, the better.

912
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,380
And,

913
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,500
don't tell anyone about this.

914
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,180
I understand.

915
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:04,900
I understand.

916
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,420
Go.

917
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,580
I'll go.

918
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,300
I'll go.

919
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:09,980
I'll go.

920
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,700
I'll go.

921
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,500
I'll go.

922
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,260
I'll go.

923
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,060
I'll go.

924
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,940
I'll go.

925
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,700
I'll go.

926
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,500
I'll go.

927
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,140
I'll go.

928
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,460
You fizer to do this when I was leaving?

929
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,460
Well .

930
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,340
You're just a grasshopper.

931
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,020
Mr. Han.

932
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,580
Dad.

933
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:40,980
Where did you go?

934
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,620
White-tongued Pass.

935
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,460
Why did you go there?

936
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,900
To have fun.

937
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,460
Is this place fun?

938
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,820
How did you know?

939
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,740
Wang Lang called me just now

940
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,820
to ask if you're back.

941
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,540
Dad, I tell you,

942
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,780
I'm not coming this time.

943
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,180
I was framed by someone.

944
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,020
You're framed again and again.

945
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,260
The army is on a mission.

946
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,220
Why are you so messy?

947
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,940
Who's messing around?

948
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,860
I just happened to meet them.

949
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,060
It was just a coincidence.

950
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:13,860
Do you understand?

951
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,460
How can I know

952
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,820
where they are on a mission?

953
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,300
Luckily, you didn't disturb

954
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,300
your army.

955
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,180
Or I'll get you back five times.

956
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,060
I'll send you back.

957
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,180
I'll lock you up for days.

958
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,020
Come on.

959
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,620
You go in first.

960
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,380
You send me back first.

961
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,380
So stubborn.

962
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,900
I'm going to rest.

963
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,580
I didn't sleep all night.

964
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,380
Let me take you back.

965
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,060
Fine.

966
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,420
I can't pull out my hand.

967
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,580
There are still a hundred left.

968
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,340
Hold on.

969
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,540
I'll go.

970
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,180
Get up.

971
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:04,860
Get up.

972
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,340
Squad leader Zhou,

973
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,100
did you still

974
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,100
take a bottle of water last time?

975
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,260
You can't sign it after this time.

976
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,460
Qi Li.

977
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,500
Where's Yi Nan Wang?

978
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,580
Report.

979
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,060
Captain Yi Nan Wang was taken away.

980
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,460
What's going on?

981
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,220
You want to give the newbie

982
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,580
a good training?

983
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,260
I just made him a training cake.

984
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,740
We also prepared a good meal.

985
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,660
And we're in line.

986
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,700
Yi Nan Wang's training schedule

987
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,100
has been arranged until the day after tomorrow.

988
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,020
It's called the city team.

989
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,940
I'll be the one who's going to be the one the day after tomorrow.

990
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,300
I'll be the one the day after tomorrow.

991
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,180
You'll be the one the next time.

992
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:46,940
Captain.

993
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,460
Sit.

994
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,820
How's it going?

995
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,220
It's fine, captain.

996
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,220
It's just a small injury.

997
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,300
Practice something else this afternoon.

998
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:00,980
Yes.

999
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:01,780
Sure.

1000
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,140
I got that.

1001
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,140
Thank you, captain.

1002
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:17,940
Captain.

1003
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,940
Am I the worst promise I made to you?

1004
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,700
I didn't tell diesel skates that I'm the worst.

1005
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,060
You're not bad.

1006
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,380
except your position that needs to be considered.

1007
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,420
Zhizhi, don't.

1008
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,700
I'm serious.

1009
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,460
You'll try hard.

1010
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,380
What's wrong?

1011
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,540
I picked you out of the company.

1012
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,540
I'm serious.

1013
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,460
I'm willing to give up my life for you.

1014
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,340
I'm willing to give up my life for you.

1015
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,460
Thank you for being by my side.

1016
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:16,700
I'll give you my blood and my love.

1017
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,260
The bigger the world, the lonelier it gets.

1018
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,820
Only by standing by your side

1019
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:30,980
can I feel the warmth in my life.
