The Long Ballad

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yuheng.

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yuheng.

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yuheng.

6
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Dad, brother.

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You two are back.

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
When did you come back?

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Where did Sun Jin go?

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Why can't I get through to you?

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Luo Man group.

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You knew it.

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Why did you break up?

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why are you laughing?

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Say something.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Dad and I are looking for you all over the world.

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We can't find anyone.

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We're all going to find international police.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Do you know?

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Such a big deal.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I didn't think you two were so concerned about me before.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What's going on?

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What's going on?

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why do I feel like you're emotional?

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What happened?

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tell me and your brother.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Dad, you're thinking too much.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm not in the mood.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You don't have to worry too much.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Anyway, I'm back, right?

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Tell me.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Where did you go?

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What happened?

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's what happened.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I met an old classmate on Luo Man group.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Then I followed them to the sea for a few days.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You know, there's no signal on the phone.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
When I came back,

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He Da accidentally put his phone in the sea.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So it's ten o'clock.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Then you don't know to call your classmate

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and tell us, brother.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
My phone is not on the sea.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
My classmate's phone has a signal.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Is that right?

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Think about it.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No, no.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're back this time.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Obviously, you're in a bad mood.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What happened?

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Tell me.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Maybe it's because I played too much on the sea.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm tired of physical strength.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But it's nothing serious.

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's good to be back for a few days.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hello.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I've come back from Luo Man.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Thank you very much for the clue you gave me.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I know who you're talking about.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I didn't know why you were so cautious before.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Now I understand your difficulties.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Changzhou is very powerful in the industry.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No solid evidence.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's really difficult to expose them.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Congratulations.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It seems that I was wrong about you before.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You are indeed a great reporter.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You must protect yourself.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The closer we are to the truth, the more dangerous it may be.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Keep in touch.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You take care too.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I hope we can find the evidence and settle the case soon.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
To get rid of them.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Xiao Man is here.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm here to see you.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Where are the captain and Qiu Xiao?

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
They are all gone.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I applied for them.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll stay here alone.

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't say sorry to me.

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why should I say sorry to you?

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'd better sit down.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Don't move.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Don't move.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Are you sleepy?

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm fine.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's good to see you.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let me tell you something.

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What have you been doing these days?

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm out of work every day.

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
At night, I'll think of you.

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But I know you can't come back even if I send it out.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll send it.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I once saw the videos you took at home.

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Mom ran out of the room.

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Did Chen come back?

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I said no.

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
She said how could I hear Chen's voice?

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I said look.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm watching Chen's video.

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm afraid you'll come back suddenly.

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So I put a book at home every day.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I also learned some cooking skills.

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll teach you when you come back.

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Sorry.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's okay.

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Don't say that.

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's good to see you come back.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You'll get better.

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Actually, I'm afraid too.

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What if I can't keep it well?

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It won't be bad.

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Even if it's not good,

115
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
you can't say it.

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If you can't make it up,

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'll be your leg in the future.

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If your hands are not good,

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll be your hand in the future.

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If you can't keep your liver and stomach well,

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll be your liver and stomach.

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
If your brain is not well,

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll be your brain.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If you are not good,

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll be your brain.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's okay.

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Honey.

128
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Our captain

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
told me everything about you.

130
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm proud of you.

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Say something.

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Say it.

133
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Close your eyes.

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Do you want to lie down for a while?

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
No, I'll stay here for a while.

136
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Honey.

137
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Honey.

138
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The team gave you a special 10-day vacation this time.

139
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So I came back to accompany you.

140
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's all my fault.

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I don't want to get you involved again.

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Why don't you go back?

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I can do it myself.

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What are you talking about?

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Why is it your fault again?

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I just came back.

147
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You're going to drive me back.

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What do you want to do?

149
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I didn't drive you away.

150
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Look.

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We only stayed in the hotel for two days.

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The team took me back.

153
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This 10-day vacation,

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'll make up for it anyway, right?

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You think you can make up for it?

156
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Of course I can.

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Say it. What do you want to do?

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'll make up for it for you.

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't want to go out.

160
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You don't want to go out for ten days?

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I have an idea.

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Then we'll make up for this honeymoon at home.

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
How about it?

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Do you think the kids are home?

165
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Or I'll call them.

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Give me your phone.

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Stop calling.

168
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Let them handle it themselves.

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's such a big deal.

170
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
How do they handle it themselves?

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm worried about them.

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's no use worrying about them.

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No matter how big the problem is, it can be over.

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No matter how uncomfortable it is,

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
they have to slowly digest it by themselves.

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The most basic problem that the husband and wife have to face

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
when they are not around

178
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yang Yang also has to learn

179
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
to adapt to this kind of life.

180
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Or home?

181
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Of course.

182
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Otherwise, where else do you want to go?

183
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Wu Si, have you eaten?

184
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I just went to a butter bread shop

185
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
to eat two street foods.

186
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Don't say that.

187
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
They are really delicious.

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's a pity that you won't eat them.

189
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What should I do?

190
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll have to wait for you.

191
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm going to ask them.

192
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What about you?

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'll wait for you here.

194
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm going to ask them.

195
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'll wait for you.

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You can ask them.

197
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Just ask them.

198
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Just ask them.

199
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,440
What should I do?

200
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,400
Well,

201
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,240
I'll tell you.

202
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,080
Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow.

203
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,840
Wu Si,

204
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,960
every time I call my family,

205
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,080
my dad asks me,

206
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,800
Wu Si, how are you?

207
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,800
I don't know.

208
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Where are you?

209
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,560
Are you sick?

210
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:12,920
No,

211
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,240
how can you be sick?

212
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,080
I'm sick.

213
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,240
Wu Si, let me tell you.

214
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,600
I bought a water handkerchief

215
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,680
for my baby today.

216
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,960
Look at the photo.

217
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,680
Isn't it cute?

218
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,240
When she wears it,

219
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,000
she'll feel good

220
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,000
when she rolls it up.

221
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,360
How about this?

222
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,440
It's a good size.

223
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
Wu Si.

224
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,720
Wu Si Wu Si Wu Si Wu Si Wu Si Wu Si Wu Si.

225
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,720
If I read

226
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,320
your name 100 times,

227
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,000
will you

228
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,880
be like a

229
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,320
peashooter?

230
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,280
The 32nd day of Captain Wu's absence.

231
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,760
I'll be waiting for you.

232
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,080
Are you making a video for Captain Wu again?

233
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,760
After you two

234
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,720
fall in love,

235
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,480
do you share so much?

236
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,680
Captain Wu,

237
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,200
I have a good news.

238
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,600
When she was sleeping in the car,

239
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,600
she was peeing.

240
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
I'll go get her.

241
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,800
Look,

242
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,880
this is a super big one.

243
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,840
I bought it

244
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,240
after a long queue.

245
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,400
But you're late, too.

246
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,520
Let me give you a taste.

247
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,920
Here you are.

248
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,840
You...

249
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,480
Hey.

250
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,960
Captain Wu.

251
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,080
You're a little heavy.

252
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,760
Come on.

253
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,200
It's delicious.

254
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,340
Hey, Master Uncle.

255
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,160
Are you in pain?

256
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,760
I'm fine.

257
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,680
Oh my goodness.

258
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,000
Zhi He.

259
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
What are you doing?

260
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,360
I'm taking you to medicine history class.

261
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,160
She can't wait to see me

262
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,160
even when she's unconscious.

263
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:07,960
It's fine.

264
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,640
Damn!

265
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,120
What are you doing now?

266
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,560
I just came to say hi to you.

267
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,200
Mom.

268
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,680
You're a kid.

269
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,840
You're hiding something from us.

270
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,200
Tell me.

271
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,320
How are you?

272
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,400
Does it still hurt?

273
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,760
No, it's fine.

274
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,040
I just don't want you to worry

275
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,640
so they don't tell you.

276
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,560
I'm your mom.

277
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,960
When will you stop hiding from me?

278
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,880
Remember.

279
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,680
No matter what happens in the future,

280
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,360
you have to tell me.

281
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,360
The family is your back.

282
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,960
We'll take care of it together.

283
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,200
I'm sorry, mom.

284
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,360
I made you worry.

285
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,760
Don't say anything.

286
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,040
Let's eat.

287
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,840
These are all your favorites.

288
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,360
I've been working in the hospital for my whole life.

289
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,400
I'll take care of your leg.

290
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,040
One, two, three.

291
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,840
Three, two, one.

292
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,800
Be careful.

293
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,920
Wait.

294
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,040
Be careful.

295
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,680
Captain.

296
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:08,960
Captain.

297
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,600
Can't you take me to see Captain Chen?

298
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,640
No.

299
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,040
Why?

300
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,920
You'll have time to see Captain Chen.

301
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,680
Go back and practice.

302
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,040
Do what Captain Chen wants to see.

303
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,160
Yes.

304
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,440
We'll discuss it when we arrive.

305
00:17:45,240 --> 00:18:02,320
You're soTT

306
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,320
Xijian.

307
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,840
I want to start a rehabilitation.

308
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,000
It's hard to recover.

309
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,080
If I don't hurry,

310
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,440
even if I return to the Blue Team,

311
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,640
it's hard for me to keep up

312
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,200
with the training rhythm of the road battle team.

313
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,640
Qiu Junyi said

314
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,320
this matter should be continued.

315
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,920
Dr. Yang also said

316
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,200
you want to recover a normal movement

317
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,360
as soon as possible.

318
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,560
You should be replaced as soon as possible.

319
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,240
So,

320
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,800
we should be objective

321
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,240
in looking at this matter.

322
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,800
And

323
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,480
even if you recover all,

324
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,120
it's hard for you to

325
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,320
continue the high-intensity training

326
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,280
you used to do.

327
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,240
I want to see Dr. Yang.

328
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,480
You still don't believe me?

329
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,080
I didn't make this up.

330
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,440
Dr. Yang told me everything.

331
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,480
I know your situation very well.

332
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,280
Even if you recover all,

333
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,560
you can't go back to the front line.

334
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,760
What do you mean?

335
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,960
You want me to retire?

336
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,640
I don't object to your return to the army.

337
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,000
But we have to

338
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,760
respect the objective facts.

339
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,720
I don't want to hear this from you.

340
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,720
I want to be alone for a while.

341
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,400
I won't go out.

342
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,440
I'll stay here with you.

343
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,000
I'll call the doctor to tell you.

344
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,880
Hu Dalang.

345
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,560
Hu Dalang.

346
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,320
Hu Dalang.

347
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,400
Are you worried about something?

348
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,440
I'm not.

349
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,920
Stop pretending.

350
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
I can't tell

351
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,040
if you're worried.

352
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,520
You haven't seen Wang Chenjie, right?

353
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,120
Go now.

354
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,000
I'll wait for you at home.

355
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,000
Can I really go?

356
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,160
Go.

357
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Go and come back.

358
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,800
Honey, you're the best.

359
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,480
I have a favor to ask of you.

360
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,040
Okay, go ahead.

361
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,760
From now on,

362
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,520
don't fall for Tang Xin.

363
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,720
Who?

364
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,040
What are you talking about?

365
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
I know what you did.

366
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,880
I just don't want to pursue it.

367
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,320
But if you fall for Tang Xin again,

368
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
next time,

369
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,120
I won't talk to you like this.

370
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,360
Dad.

371
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,720
I've told you many times.

372
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,000
You two are not suitable.

373
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,960
Don't meddle in their business.

374
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,440
Have you

375
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,680
heard this sentence?

376
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,480
Gao Hao.

377
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,360
Don't think that you're the smartest person in the world.

378
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,680
Remember what I said today.

379
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,840
Captain Wang.

380
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,200
You said you wanted to start rehabilitation as soon as possible.

381
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,920
But from a medical point of view,

382
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,640
we don't recommend

383
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,560
you start recovery training

384
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,840
in your current physical condition.

385
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,040
Dr. Yang, I can do it.

386
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,720
What can you do?

387
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,160
Dr. Yang has said

388
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,320
you can't do recovery training

389
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,680
in your current condition.

390
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,600
If you don't let me try,

391
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,160
how do you know I can't?

392
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,880
Doctor.

393
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,240
Wang Chen.

394
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,280
You're not doing it.

395
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,440
Let go of me.

396
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,120
Wang Chen.

397
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,760
What are you doing?

398
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,560
Don't move.

399
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,920
Captain Wu is here.

400
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,200
Listen to what Captain Wu said.

401
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,120
Wang Chen is going to do recovery training.

402
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,240
The doctor has said

403
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,280
he can't do it now.

404
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,680
Doctor.

405
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,360
Can Wang Chen do

406
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,560
recovery training in his current condition?

407
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,280
I don't mind.

408
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,400
Recovery training is a continuous stage.

409
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,120
It's the most effective recovery routine

410
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,960
to cooperate with the doctor.

411
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,920
If you rush to beg for food,

412
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,720
you'll only cause trouble.

413
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,080
Captain.

414
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,600
I...

415
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,640
I can...

416
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,200
Wang Chen.

417
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,480
You're a soldier.

418
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,040
I order you

419
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,520
to obey the doctor's advice.

420
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:10,920
Yes.

421
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,280
I know you're coming back in time.

422
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,840
I believe you can come back.

423
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,000
I hope you can.

424
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,760
But I hope you can come back healthy.

425
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,600
When will you come back?

426
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,880
I will be here at midnight in five minutes.

427
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
There will always be

428
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,720
a place for you to stay in the효ッ algebra class.

429
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,120
We won't be busy for a day or two.

430
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,760
Can you understand?

431
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,840
Captain.

432
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,480
You know I can.

433
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,440
All you can do is one experiment.

434
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,600
I'm sorry.

435
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,880
Dr. Yang.

436
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,760
How about this?

437
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,680
I need to know

438
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,960
your recovery first.

439
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,280
I'll arrange for you to do a simple

440
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,640
training test in the recovery room.

441
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,560
Then, based on the test result,

442
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,400
we'll be sure

443
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,960
if we can start the recovery training.

444
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Thank you, Dr. Yang.

445
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,400
Okay, wait here.

446
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,040
Okay.

447
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,120
Ms. Tang.

448
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,840
Ms. Tang.

449
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,480
Ms. Wang Chen.

450
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,240
Mr. Bai.

451
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,200
I'm here to see you.

452
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,840
I brought these.

453
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,240
Thank you so much.

454
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,400
Mr. Bai.

455
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,000
Ms. Wang Chen.

456
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,400
I have to apologize to you.

457
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,800
Ms. Wang Chen

458
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,240
was hurt because she saved me.

459
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,360
Don't say that.

460
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,200
Tang Xin.

461
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,160
We all know

462
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,200
about this.

463
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,080
Wang Chen is a soldier.

464
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,720
This is his duty.

465
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,320
So, don't feel guilty

466
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,000
or feel guilty.

467
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,840
I'm fine.

468
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
Captain, Ms. Qin.

469
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Why are you here?

470
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,640
I'm here to see Captain Chen.

471
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,200
He should have been here

472
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,080
a while ago.

473
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
But he can't leave Yang now.

474
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,080
This little princess

475
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,080
is so old.

476
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,840
She's still playing with her mother's bottle.

477
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,440
Don't worry.

478
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,480
I'll teach her later.

479
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,280
But as a student…

480
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,800
Well?

481
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,560
What's wrong?

482
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,480
She's gone.

483
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,080
I'll leave the rest to you when I have time.

484
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,880
When?

485
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,240
Why did you have an abortion?

486
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,120
What is the product?

487
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm going to see him.

488
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,440
Tang Xin, Xin Yue.

489
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
Why are you holding me? I'm going to see Yang Yang.

490
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,440
I know you're worried about Yang Yang.

491
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,240
Can you go there after a few days?

492
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,120
How can I go there after a few days?

493
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,480
Her mood is very unstable now.

494
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,480
It's because of her unstable mood

495
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,800
that you're going to see her now?

496
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,840
When she was pregnant,

497
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,920
she was always alone.

498
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,880
She went to the pregnancy check-up alone.

499
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,240
She waited for you every day.

500
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,200
You finally came back now.

501
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,920
Xin Yue.

502
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,680
I...

503
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,960
I don't want her to remember this.

504
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,240
Are you that tired?

505
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,680
She didn't know this had happened.

506
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,280
Does her momentum change?

507
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,160
Master Tang,

508
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,920
I know you're worried about her.

509
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,480
So I need to know more about her.

510
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,320
I'm sorry.

511
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,640
Xing.

512
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,840
This is between me and Yang.

513
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,120
Give us some time.

514
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,320
I'm sorry.

515
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,720
How are you?

516
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,720
I'm fine.

517
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,520
Take care of yourself.

518
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,800
Take care of Yang.

519
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,320
Go back.

520
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,480
Yang told me.

521
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,320
I'll go when I see Chen.

522
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,800
Wang Chen is in the hospital.

523
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,440
Come back next time.

524
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,440
Go home first.

525
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,080
Yang needs you more.

526
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,520
Cheer up.

527
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,360
Go back.

528
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,320
See you.

529
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,840
Please.

530
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,320
Hello.

531
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,000
Hello, Miss Lan.

532
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,800
There's no irregular result

533
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,320
from the pompous water u dorsal backwards.

534
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,800
Rest assured.

535
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,840
The mucous area of 1's instructions are normal.

536
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,040
It's healthy.

537
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,400
There's no possibility of nimmt syndrome.

538
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,560
In the future, you don't need to accused anymore.

539
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,200
The reason I called today

540
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
is to tell you.

541
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,840
Do you think I'm a pen?

542
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,840
Take care of yourself.

543
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,880
Thank you.

544
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,160
2019.

545
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,400
Morning.

546
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,240
Four twenty three.

547
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,720
Song Xie.

548
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,720
Miss Lan, are you still here?

549
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,920
Hello?

550
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,040
Hello?

551
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,840
Thank you.

552
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600
Five, bye.

553
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,440
I'm sorry

554
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,480
It's fine

555
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,120
Get in

556
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,040
Wife

557
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,400
What's the matter? Who is it?

558
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,680
I made a mistake

559
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,240
I'll drink up the soup I made today

560
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,000
I'll drink two bowls later

561
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,120
I'll get you some soup

562
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,800
Translating

563
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,720
Mr. Han

564
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,280
Mr. Han

565
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,160
Dad

566
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,140
What's wrong with you

567
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,000
Tang Xin went back

568
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,640
She's back

569
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,240
She is lawless

570
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,760
Has started to go to work

571
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,080
Bad news

572
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,920
Bad news

573
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,540
in China.

574
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,420
Wait there.

575
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,020
I gotta see your first phone conversation.

576
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:25,800
Hello.

577
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,520
Hello V.

578
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,100
Where are we?

579
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,220
Alleh?

580
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,440
Seems very voices from China.

581
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,420
Hello?

582
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,340
Guilin?

583
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,100
What happened with the girl

584
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,800
your Luo Man took away from you?

585
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,240
Why is she back to China?

586
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,360
これで

587
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,880
The ship was hijacked by pirates.

588
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
They were all saved by Chinese navy.

589
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,120
The cargo ship was hijacked in the sea.

590
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,400
The Chinese navy of the Navy was rescued.

591
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,920
I see.

592
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,520
Okay, keep in touch.

593
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,600
Bye.

594
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,800
I know you've been through a lot recently.

595
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,320
I wanted to wait for you to get better

596
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,320
and then call you out after you've recovered.

597
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,400
I've been thinking about it a lot lately.

598
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,760
So I've been keeping some things in my mind.

599
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,040
Why are you so serious all of a sudden?

600
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,840
Do you remember

601
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,920
what I said to you

602
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,400
before you went to Long'an Island?

603
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,240
What?

604
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,360
I asked you to report to the relevant department.

605
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,480
Do you remember?

606
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,680
Yes.

607
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,560
I did.

608
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,640
I asked Mr. Tian for a leave.

609
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,240
He approved it and I went.

610
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,160
And I didn't go alone.

611
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,360
I took Ah Hai there.

612
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,520
You know what I'm going to say.

613
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,000
And I'm not kidding.

614
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,960
I don't know what you mean.

615
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,960
And I'm not kidding.

616
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,360
I'm not kidding.

617
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,120
I'm not kidding.

618
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
I'm not kidding.

619
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,200
Mr. Wu.

620
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,520
Let's just finish what we're talking about.

621
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,680
You don't have to be like this

622
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,640
and teach me a lesson.

623
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,320
I'm not teaching you a lesson.

624
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,920
I just think it's a good luck.

625
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,520
It's a good luck that I met you in that ocean.

626
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,320
Do you know how many merchant ships

627
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,640
do I need in that ocean every day?

628
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,200
As long as I miss a little accident,

629
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,040
it's really a coincidence that you met a merchant ship.

630
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,560
But I really can't expect

631
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
that I can happen coincidentally

632
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,640
when you're in danger.

633
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,520
And I can't expect

634
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,320
that I can be there when you need me.

635
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,000
I'm not blaming you.

636
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,320
I just hope that you can think more thoroughly

637
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,920
before you do something.

638
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,560
I know you're worried about me.

639
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,560
But please believe me.

640
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,360
I know what I'm doing.

641
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,560
I've been an investigation reporter

642
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,800
for more than a day.

643
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,440
I'm willing to take risks

644
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,760
for the profession I chose.

645
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,920
But you're irresponsible.

646
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,160
I know your professional characteristics.

647
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,680
I know what your original intention is.

648
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,120
I'm more sure of your professionalism.

649
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,080
But first,

650
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,160
you have to consider your own safety

651
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,480
before you can do better.

652
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,680
You can also take action

653
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,440
for the official's protection.

654
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,720
And you can also take action

655
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,720
for your own safety.

656
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,240
Don't you know what protection is?

657
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,720
Let me explain it to you.

658
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,120
When we're fighting on the front line,

659
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,200
the back line is our strong motivation.

660
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,240
They can know our coordinates

661
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,440
and positions accurately.

662
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,120
I don't need to know what's the protection,

663
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,320
what's the position, what's the position.

664
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,920
I'm an investigation reporter.

665
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,560
Our investigation job

666
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,160
is not like you guys who are just

667
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,760
trying to get in and out of the way.

668
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,720
The more people, the better.

669
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,720
Let me tell you.

670
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,600
Since I joined the industry,

671
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,640
I've done a lot of investigation jobs

672
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,000
independently.

673
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,120
That's how our industry is.

674
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
Sometimes, the more people we know,

675
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,120
the easier it is to do bad things.

676
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,280
Okay, Captain Wu.

677
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,520
If you think

678
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,920
I'm a hero,

679
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,160
I'm just being a hero on purpose,

680
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,000
then I'll do whatever you want.

681
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,080
I really don't...

682
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,880
Thank you for saving me.

683
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,320
Tang Xin.

684
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,360
It's really hard to predict.

685
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:17,880
Dad.

686
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,120
I don't think Yu Hang

687
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,400
went to Luo Man's place

688
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,560
because he didn't want to.

689
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,560
I'm not saying that

690
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,360
he went after that female reporter

691
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,560
just to get her.

692
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,360
Then what do you think?

693
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,360
I think

694
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,000
he should know

695
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,400
what's going on in our family.

696
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,320
Dad.

697
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,480
We can't let them get in touch with each other.

698
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,000
What if Tang Xin

699
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,040
gets interrogated?

700
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,320
You said you wouldn't let her get in touch with him.

701
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,360
So she won't get in touch with him.

702
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,560
It's not that serious.

703
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,680
Even if she knows,

704
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,240
she's just a little bit of a coward.

705
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,680
Besides,

706
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,040
she's a bloodthirsty woman.

707
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,200
Even if she knows something,

708
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,280
what can she do?

709
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,760
But this is not a chance to make a living.

710
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,160
How about I find someone

711
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,080
to give her...

712
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,240
Now,

713
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,040
the most dangerous person

714
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,360
is not that woman.

715
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,680
It's the person who gave her the clue.

716
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,520
I've been investigating that person.

717
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,680
But it's hard to find him

718
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,840
just with an email.

719
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,680
Yu Hang.

720
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,560
The person who really knows our family background

721
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,080
is not that many.

722
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,920
Yes.

723
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,560
You should start from

724
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,320
the core of the family.

725
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,680
Are you tired?

726
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,400
No.

727
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,560
Take a break.

728
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Let me massage your face.

729
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,720
It's sour.

730
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,720
Honey.

731
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,400
Do you remember

732
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,600
when we first came to this park?

733
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,680
Of course I remember.

734
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,360
This is where we first dated.

735
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,160
Right here.

736
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,120
You had an interview that time.

737
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,040
You came up and had a good time with me.

738
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,360
But we had a bad time.

739
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,240
The interview didn't go well.

740
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,440
The job didn't go well.

741
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,680
We didn't get the job.

742
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,280
But we married ourselves first.

743
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,920
This is the most wise decision you've ever made.

744
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,200
It feels like what happened yesterday.

745
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,520
Grandpa.

746
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,600
I'm sorry.

747
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,760
It was me and Li Yubing's fault.

748
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
How do you feel now that

749
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,960
we two met each other?

750
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,640
I don't know.

751
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,680
When the kid was so young,

752
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,800
people may have felt very lonely.

753
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,160
Though nobody knows that,

754
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,720
I have lived very lonely and lonely.

755
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,680
I think

756
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,560
it's better to let you know

757
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,480
little by little.

758
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,100
Wait a second.

759
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,960
She didn't come in?

760
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,680
Darling.

761
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,640
Let's walk around.

762
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,480
OK.

763
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:01,760
Come on.

764
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,480
The dream is also very plain

765
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,880
But in your heart

766
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,280
There are more expectations

767
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,280
I really don't understand

768
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,080
You say love is too vague

769
00:42:54,080 --> 00:43:00,080
But you give me an answer with your eyes

770
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:06,080
I can be with you with all my heart

771
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:11,080
Thank you for waking up

772
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:15,280
The courage that used to be weak

773
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,680
Let all coincidences become a wish

774
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,480
Let all simple things become a partner

775
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,280
Open the light of the years after the past

776
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,280
People still can't separate us

777
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,280
Every moment is warm

778
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,280
Memories are so lonely

779
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,280
The time that you are with me is so lonely

780
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,280
I want to be with you forever

781
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,280
I don't want to be hurt

782
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,280
The courage that used to be weak

783
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,280
Let all coincidences become a wish

784
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,280
Thank you for being with me

785
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,280
Even the snow and the darkness

786
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,280
The bigger the world, the more lonely it is

787
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,280
Only standing by your side

788
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:21,280
I feel the warmth in my heart
