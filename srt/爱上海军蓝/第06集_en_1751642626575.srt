1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,900
The Long- celebrated in waiting

2
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,880
Episode 5

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,960
later in school.

4
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,600
Hold on a minute.

5
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,480
I'll be right back.

6
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:25,740
Meet me at C-HR on저

7
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,660
Let's go back.

8
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,020
No.

9
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,060
Why are you in such a hurry?

10
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,820
Do you want me to go with you?

11
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,340
No.

12
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,820
I arrived ten minutes earlier.

13
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,900
Where are we meeting?

14
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,340
Send me the specific location.

15
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,980
I'm at the gate of Zhenyu on the sixth floor.

16
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,420
Come here to find me.

17
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,700
I'll be there soon.

18
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,260
Hello, are you there?

19
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,900
I'll pick you up.

20
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,220
Okay, I know.

21
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,900
Hello, I'm at the gate of Zhenyu on the sixth floor.

22
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,380
Come here to find me.

23
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,820
Send me the specific location.

24
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,660
Come here to find me.

25
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,620
Come here to find me.

26
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,140
I'll be there soon.

27
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,340
Hello, I'm at the gate of Zhenyu on the sixth floor.

28
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,940
Come here to find me.

29
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,740
Come here to find me.

30
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,740
I'm at the restaurant.

31
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,980
I didn't see you.

32
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,740
Gu Si?

33
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,580
Wang Xin?

34
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,220
Black baseball hat.

35
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,740
White handbag.

36
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,500
Do you know how many people

37
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,540
are in the mall

38
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,340
who are in line with these characteristics?

39
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,780
They're just

40
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,580
a normal person with a sense of justice.

41
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,180
They're definitely not that professional.

42
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,060
They're all like you.

43
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,620
They've been trained in military.

44
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,340
Why did he ask you out?

45
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,900
He said

46
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,700
he had deeper clues.

47
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,860
And

48
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,380
he has the documents on the shelf.

49
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,620
That's why I agreed to this meeting.

50
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
With the documents,

51
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,340
we can judge the value of the ship.

52
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,100
With more clues,

53
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,740
we can prevent the documents

54
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,620
from being stolen.

55
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,820
If he's telling the truth,

56
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,340
the customs are very strict.

57
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,900
So don't be discouraged.

58
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,260
Maybe you're in trouble

59
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,100
and you're hiding.

60
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,180
You can't meet the person you're supposed to meet.

61
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,020
There are always

62
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,380
weird people

63
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,860
who you haven't met.

64
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,020
You're good, Captain Wu.

65
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,220
You look quite well-bred.

66
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,420
I bought it for my mom.

67
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,540
Since I joined the army,

68
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,780
I've had time to spend with her.

69
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,660
Actually, I've been wanting to ask you a question.

70
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,740
Why did you choose to join the army?

71
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,820
Why did you choose the Captain's teasel?

72
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,420
Why did you take the experience

73
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,780
of being a bird button?

74
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,300
I'm fine.

75
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,380
I always read my dad's mind.

76
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,540
It's still a scolding.

77
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,020
Yes.

78
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,860
I think he always

79
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,020
goes crazy.

80
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,020
I have believes

81
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,060
and proofs

82
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:40,580
that this is the true

83
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,860
side ofReg son.

84
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,940
No, I'm not.

85
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,580
My mom died when I was a kid.

86
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,860
My mom raised me up.

87
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,660
I had to take care of my family and work.

88
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,900
I couldn't take care of it.

89
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,260
Later,

90
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,940
my dad's comrade said

91
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,060
he would put him in the army to train.

92
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,740
I wasn't used to it at first.

93
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,740
But later,

94
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,300
I couldn't leave.

95
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,980
I met you this time.

96
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,460
I'll return the tape recorder to you.

97
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,060
Wang Chen heard it.

98
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,260
He asked me to thank you.

99
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,020
You're welcome.

100
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,540
What does this mean?

101
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,020
It's just a self-introduction.

102
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,860
I'm not going to give you a book.

103
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,900
Because this is

104
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,420
the information and summary for the army.

105
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,700
So every word

106
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,740
is 100% real.

107
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,780
So?

108
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,580
So I want you to know me more.

109
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,540
And we can have a future relationship.

110
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,780
You want me to give you a resume, too?

111
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,540
Sure.

112
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,740
Just kidding, right?

113
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,620
Okay, okay.

114
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,580
I've also seen a lot of things

115
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,260
as a reporter.

116
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,620
I've never seen a resume.

117
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,700
But I said in advance.

118
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,260
Ordinary people like us

119
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,820
don't have a resume.

120
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,180
So I'll go back and send you a video.

121
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,700
Don't forget what you said.

122
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,340
It's just a coincidence.

123
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,100
The tape recorder is old-fashioned.

124
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,900
But why did Captain Wu

125
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,180
bring a resume

126
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,340
for me?

127
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,380
I should go back.

128
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,220
Take your time.

129
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,220
I've paid the bill.

130
00:08:59,380 --> 00:08:59,980
I'll go now.

131
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,740
Bye.

132
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,940
Don't forget the money.

133
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,620
Ha Ber opponent,

134
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,700
take you to Jialuo Hill to talk.

135
00:09:41,700 --> 00:10:03,460
ulo.com

136
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,500
Liang Yayun.

137
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,420
Take it in your college very early.

138
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,660
Don't make troubles, beds and substitution costs

139
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,540
is still inForm episode 39.

140
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,660
You I grown-up.

141
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,380
I can't be sad.

142
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,340
Write down your change of heart.

143
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,780
It'll serve us a better future.

144
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,460
I've given youど number of us and who?

145
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,700
Naturally.

146
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,380
physical abuse.

147
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,140
I've failed to protect you.

148
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,580
I have now fulfilled my desk.

149
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,580
You are too3.

150
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,340
When will you go?

151
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,060
Even when I Shaping the boot,

152
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,060
You're dead.

153
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,420
You're afraid of being a doctor.

154
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,500
I don't like being a doctor.

155
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,660
No.

156
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,780
You've been in the school for seven years.

157
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,500
You've graduated from the master's degree.

158
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,020
Why do you say you don't like it?

159
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,780
I don't think I'm fit to be a doctor.

160
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,020
Then what are you fit to do?

161
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,780
I don't know.

162
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,100
I said it when I applied for university.

163
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,060
Are you sure?

164
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,500
During the seven-year college,

165
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,140
you discussed with us

166
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,340
about Zeyue's problem.

167
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,620
Now you finally graduated.

168
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,780
You said you didn't like it.

169
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,220
You just stayed at home.

170
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,740
You've been in the school for seven years.

171
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,540
You want to cure people and save people.

172
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,660
You want to learn to use it.

173
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,220
I, Lan Weiguo's daughter,

174
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,340
want to be a good daughter.

175
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,900
Yangyang,

176
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,980
your father is also good for you.

177
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,300
You said Zeyue was a big deal for a lifetime.

178
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,900
It's not a game.

179
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,660
It's a family.

180
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,940
You missed this opportunity.

181
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,380
You don't have a chance.

182
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,900
I missed it anyway.

183
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,140
I'm still young.

184
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,900
Someone told me

185
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,220
that the way of life

186
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,300
can be followed by your own intuition.

187
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,820
Life is a big thing.

188
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,860
You have to be intuitive.

189
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,020
Who cares about you?

190
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,860
Why don't you answer it?

191
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,460
Just a friend.

192
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,100
Dad.

193
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,660
I don't want to see it.

194
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,300
What friend?

195
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,500
You tell me first.

196
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,580
Who is this person?

197
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,540
Is it you who found the right person?

198
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,020
Or is it he who

199
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,260
instigated you to do this?

200
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,300
What instigation?

201
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,540
That's my own idea.

202
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,300
I'm telling you.

203
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,860
Your idea now...

204
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,180
Weiguo.

205
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,580
...will...

206
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,020
Don't be anxious.

207
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,460
Look.

208
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,660
Tell him slowly.

209
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,060
When will I not be anxious?

210
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,940
Come on, calm down.

211
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,060
You talk to your daughter slowly.

212
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,740
Why are you anxious again, Weiguo?

213
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,540
Mom, look at my dad.

214
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,380
Why is he like this?

215
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:32,980
Enough.

216
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,340
You've gone too far this time.

217
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,900
You say from childhood to adult,

218
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,700
what don't we

219
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,580
care about you?

220
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,340
You can't be so willful

221
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,580
in this big thing.

222
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,660
This time, let alone your dad,

223
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,820
I don't even agree.

224
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,780
What I just said is true.

225
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,620
I've been in my heart for seven years.

226
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,220
I said it carefully before I thought about it.

227
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,260
What did you think about?

228
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,020
You learned this profession.

229
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,220
You don't become a doctor.

230
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,180
What can you do?

231
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,860
I can do anything.

232
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,100
If it doesn't work,

233
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,740
I'll go to Xin Xin's place to be a reporter.

234
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,460
You're a reporter?

235
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,260
What's wrong with you?

236
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,020
Anyway, God is hungry to death.

237
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,620
Dad.

238
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,620
Where's my phone?

239
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,380
Dad!

240
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:20,860
Dad!

241
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,420
Why did you take my phone?

242
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,340
Return it to me.

243
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:23,860
I...

244
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,500
How come you

245
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,220
have a photo of him?

246
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,740
Who is he?

247
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,660
It has nothing to關係 with you.

248
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,540
Return it to me!

249
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,300
Tell me first

250
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,260
who this young man is.

251
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,180
Hey.

252
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,400
You'd better get it.

253
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,620
Cheng.

254
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,600
Cheng.

255
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,800
I made some side dishes and soup in the pot.

256
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:30,780
The

257
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,540
wife went home.

258
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,860
Don't call me, what's wrong with you?

259
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,160
Zhen 你 agenda

260
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,540
In this game

261
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,620
Is there any way to start the game?

262
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,560
Our channel one

263
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,620
Rebread

264
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,020
No way

265
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,560
You know

266
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,080
This time

267
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,900
Get a technical help

268
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:25,980
I don't think he could

269
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,980
Get a technical help

270
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,140
Let's take the plan

271
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,060
Died

272
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:20,600

273
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,400

Come on, let's go.

277
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,720
Let's go.

278
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,080
Close the door.

279
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,640
Xin Xin,

280
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,120

281
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,840
Yes.

282
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,640
It's okay. Mom, go to sleep.

283
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,760
Then you should go to bed early.

284
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:14,100
Don't worry, I'll calm down my psychological

285
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,500
Give it

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,200

I'm Wang Cong

290
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,680
Why are you sleeping?

291
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,320
You're so lazy.

292
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,120
Get up.

293
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
Hurry up.

294
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,200
Go to the bathroom.

295
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,560
This is my bedroom.

296
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,080
Hurry up.

297
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,120
Don't be lazy.

298
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,640
Hurry up.

299
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Hurry up.

Xin Xin.

302
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,400
Xin Xin.

303
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,680
Mom.

304
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,880
Your aunt Wang called just now

305
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,880
and said Yang Yang ran away from home.

306
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,800
Did she call you?

307
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,160
I don't know.

308
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,960
Okay.

309
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,760
I'll reply to her.

310
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,800
Look at us.

311
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,760
We don't want our parents to worry about us.

312
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,720
Mom.

313
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,520
I'm not the one who should worry about us.

314
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,240
Go to bed early.

315
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,320
You too.

316
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,520
Tell me.

317
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,440
What's wrong?

318
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,800
I'm too sleepy.

319
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,040
Let's talk tomorrow.

320
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,360
Your quilt smells so good.

321
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,000
From today on,

322
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,960
I've decided that this quilt is mine.

323
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,480
But your quilt is smelly now.

324
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,280
I can't help you.

325
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,040
Little wild monkey.

326
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,240
What time is it?

327
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
What are you doing?

328
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,360
I'm so sorry.

329
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,880
Yang Yang made a mess for you.

330
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,920
Okay.

331
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,080
Goodbye.

332
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,160
Hurry.

333
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,480
I'll take Granddad back tomorrow.

334
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
In regulator Tang's place.

335
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,960
I'll pick him up tomorrow.

336
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,720
No.

337
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,680
You can leave the house if you can leave here,

338
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,240
don't come back if you can.

339
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,920
Are you Déjà-vu?

340
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,040
Look at what you just have okayed.

341
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,000
At least you're a tough man now.

342
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,080
Can't Your Father stop the situation?

343
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,720
Why did he left first?

344
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,800
What about Li Li?

345
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,800
Captain Hu,

346
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,400

347
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,400
Okay.

Attention!

354
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,760

Hurry up.

366
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,920
When will you come home?

367
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,880
I don't want to wash my hands.

368
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,480
Don't do that.

369
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,200
Your parents are worried about you.

370
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,440
And listen,

371
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,800
my parents are at home all day.

372
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,080
You're so precocious.

373
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,720
Stop lying to me.

374
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,080
You've betrayed me long ago,

375
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,840
right?

376
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,960
Listen,

377
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,400
you can't leave me.

378
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,120
I'm Tang Yangyang from now on.

379
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,600
Tang?

380
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,440
If you don't leave,

381
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,520
we'll be enemies.

382
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,840
If I don't come back,

383
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,040
I'll be a scapegoat

384
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,080
and a foodie.

385
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,120
Can't you live with me?

386
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,480
We're not a foodie.

387
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,000
It's not a matter of once or twice.

388
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,920
You're so pitiful.

389
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,440
If I go home now,

390
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,440
I'll definitely

391
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
argue with them

392
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
about Ziye.

393
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,800
So,

394
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,800
why don't we

395
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,320
be housewives for a few days?

396
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,880
It's shameful to run away.

397
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,160
As long as I run away far enough,

398
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,640
the problem doesn't exist.

399
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,120
Fine.

400
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,080
You want to be a housewife here, right?

401
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,960
It's not easy to be a housewife.

402
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,200
When you get up,

403
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,400
take off your clothes first.

404
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,680
Then, wash your clothes.

405
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,560
Cook lunch.

406
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,600
Listen to my dad's

407
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,080
two-hour battle story.

408
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,920
That's it.

409
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,840
That's it.

410
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,120
I'm off to work.

411
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,840
I'll think about it.

412
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,160
Report.

413
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,920
Come in.

414
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,800
Yes.

415
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,440
Wang Lang.

416
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,160
Yes.

417
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,400
You brought a good soldier.

418
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,160
Which one?

419
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,640
He's tall, has big eyes,

420
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,640
and has a little face.

421
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,520
He's tall.

422
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,960
How tall are you?

423
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,840
180 cm.

424
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,520
He must be 1.9 meters tall.

425
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,800
He's not 1.9 meters tall.

426
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,040
He's 1.88 meters tall.

427
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,720
He's tall, has big eyes,

428
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,960
and is 1.88 meters tall.

429
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,960
He's not like that in the 5th Division.

430
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,760
I don't even know your captain.

431
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,840
It's not him.

432
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,600
But he's close to him.

433
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,120
He graduated from the official department.

434
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,360
You mean Zong Qing,

435
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,840
the captain of the 5th Division,

436
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,600
a communications engineering major.

437
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,240
How is he doing?

438
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,680
He graduated from the military school.

439
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,640
He's capable,

440
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,520
has good physical quality,

441
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,440
is well-trained,

442
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,320
and has good tactical skills.

443
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,280
He's not bad.

444
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,640
He's not as good as

445
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,600
a girl with a red hair.

446
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,120
Zong Qing and Yang Yang?

447
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,320
How is his political performance?

448
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,240
For example,

449
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,640
is he talking nonsense,

450
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,120
thinking, or anything else?

451
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,640
Sir,

452
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,920
he's upright,

453
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,880
has good physical quality,

454
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,080
and is also very competitive in politics.

455
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,680
He's also one of the best soldiers I've ever led.

456
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,840
Captain Wang.

457
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,960
I got this letter from front of her.

458
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,200
She told me

459
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,800
Zong Qing broke her promise to you.

460
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,720
Not me.

461
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,360
I thought I had made a good choice.

462
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,920
It turns out that

463
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,160
I was not nice to Zong Qing

464
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,400
in the readings for Zong Qing.

465
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,320
And I've even

466
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,640
said it once.

467
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,120
I'm recognized by you

468
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,360
and I'm honored by your humanity.

469
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,320
Thanks, sir.

470
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,080
Good, good, good.

471
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,320
Yang Yang.

472
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,920
How can I let you work in my house?

473
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,760
Come on, give me a hug.

474
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,840
Auntie, just let me work.

475
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,200
Or I'll really be Yang Yang.

476
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,120
You're a guest.

477
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,080
I can't let you work.

478
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,680
Come on.

479
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,440
Go back to your room and rest.

480
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,480
Hurry up.

481
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,000
Go back to your room and answer the phone.

482
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,000
Okay.

483
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,640
I'll take a shower.

484
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:54,920
Hello.

485
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,040
Yang Yang, what are you doing?

486
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,760
Are you okay?

487
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,240
You know?

488
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,440
Are you really in trouble?

489
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,320
Don't scare me.

490
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,080
Tell me what happened.

491
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,640
Zong Qing,

492
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,480
my parents know about our relationship.

493
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,880
They even know

494
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,760
you don't want me to be a doctor.

495
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,080
When did I say that?

496
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,720
I have to follow my heart

497
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,360
Yes, I mean

498
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,080
Okay, okay

499
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,360
Whatever you mean

500
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,320
Anyway, I have already expressed my attitude to my parents

501
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,200
I won't be a doctor even if I die

502
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,560
What did they say

503
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,680
They don't agree

504
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,600
Then we quarreled

505
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,760
I ran away from home

506
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,560
Run away from home

507
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,640
rest assured

508
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,840
I'm living in Xinxin's house now

509
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,880
So happy

510
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,680
Song Qing

511
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,560
Are you angry

512
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,960
Why am I angry

513
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,080
Anyway, you have decided not to be a doctor

514
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,520
Then I will support your decision

515
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,800
just

516
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,160
what is this

517
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,920
Just I can't find you to see a doctor in the future

518
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,960
Why don't you have any formalities?

519
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,960
Really

520
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,160
I won't tell you, bye

521
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,960
When did I say this

522
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,680
By car

523
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,560
No

524
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,400
No

525
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,040
Coach

526
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,960
Now one fifty-seven

527
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,600
Start disembarking four minutes later

528
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,160
You must be behind

529
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,400
On-the- america mission

530
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,760
Understand

531
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,320
You're a part of the men now.

532
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,720
You have to show us

533
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,880
what a combatant looks like.

534
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,040
Yes.

535
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,120
forming aousique

536
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,240
I'ts in front of

537
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,880
230 last minute

538
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,680
and group Aists.

539
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,220
There should be someone in here

540
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,400
Do you know the numbers of bandits?

541
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,680
I see 13 people

542
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,100
And of course twenty people

543
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,260
They are noisy

544
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,520
The area is almost the same as central

545
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,800
the specific location of hostage and bandit.

546
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,760
There is a hole on the roof.

547
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,280
There can be a breakthrough point.

548
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,680
This operation

549
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,080
not only

550
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,440
ensures the safety of the hostage,

551
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,520
but also the safety of the bandit

552
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,000
who is the important witness.

553
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,560
If you want to complete the mission in 15 minutes,

554
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,120
you can't give the enemy

555
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,280
the chance to concentrate firepower

556
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,720
and take the risk.

557
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,160
You have to break in one by one.

558
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,640
According to the enemy's situation,

559
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,520
you four take one step at a time.

560
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,920
You take the three-step

561
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,720
and break in to rescue.

562
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,120
Then my team

563
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,480
will break in from the roof.

564
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,280
You, Li Xu, Zhou Guoyang, take one step at a time.

565
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:29,800
Yes.

566
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,120
Wang Chen, Yi Nanwang, Ye Haiyang,

567
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,880
you break in from the left side of the second floor.

568
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,240
Yes.

569
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,720
Zong Qing, Cheng Yuan, Peng Tiechao,

570
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,600
you break in from the right side of the second floor.

571
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,360
When necessary,

572
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,000
you have to show the advantage of the sniper.

573
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,600
But if you break in,

574
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
your team's strength

575
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,920
will be significantly weakened.

576
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,680
I understand.

577
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,280
I understand.

578
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,480
People in the camp,

579
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,920
follow me and break in from the front door of the first floor.

580
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,400
On behalf of me.

581
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,520
Let's go.

582
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,120
Take care of herself.

583
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,680
You!

584
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,520
Okay.

585
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,560
Group pro.

586
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,960
Commanders.

587
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,200
Request for grammatical definition.

588
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,800
Entry No.2.

589
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,760
Yes.

590
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,440
까지..

591
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,240
I menued up a large group of flowers.

592
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,240
Ugh!

593
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
Where's the man who passed the flower?

594
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,880
Where is he?

595
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:01,960
Where is he?

596
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,200
There's a man in charge,

597
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,360
details.

598
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,840
We're calling him.

599
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,880
Group Three, please.

600
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,920
Go.

601
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,400
Blow it out.

602
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,280
Come on.

603
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:38,920
Here.

604
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,000
Take it.

605
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,720
Here.

606
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,600
You scared me!

607
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,560
Here's a bottle.

608
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,000
Here, put it here.

609
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,800
I'll give it to you.

610
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:49,840
Song Qing.

611
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,880
How long does it take to practice?

612
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,840
Fourteen minutes and thirty seconds.

613
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,680
Fourteen minutes and thirty seconds?

614
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,760
It's only thirty seconds earlier than the scheduled time.

615
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,360
Come on.

616
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,200
Give me some more.

617
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,160
Okay, here it is.

618
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,880
Captain Wu.

619
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,720
I'll give it to you.

620
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,640
Your special battle team is too cruel.

621
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,240
You know it's a practice, but you still want to die.

622
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,800
Since it's a real battle,

623
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,200
we have to fight for real.

624
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,600
Didn't you also set up a lot of obstacles and troubles for us?

625
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,040
Troubles?

626
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,640
In the end, we didn't stop you.

627
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,240
The special battle team is different in terms of combat speed.

628
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,160
We have to learn from each other.

629
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,400
Learn from each other?

630
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,680
Report.

631
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,040
Captain.

632
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,520
I didn't drag you down this time, did I?

633
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,440
Yin Deng Wang.

634
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,600
You did a great job this time.

635
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,760
Captain.

636
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,720
A steal skill team has rescued a hostage.

637
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,040
The testified soldier has been rescued.

638
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,200
Marvin will be finished soon.

639
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,080

This time you have achieved

642
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,600
a wonderful job in donahue,

643
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,820
you have played a good group ,

644
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,280
fought skills direction,

645
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,560
and cooperative spirit.

646
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,240
You have actually managed to show that.

647
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,800
We can confirm that,

648
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,720
It's worth to be sure.

649
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,000
Team A's performance is also very good.

650
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,400
In order to ensure the effect of the exercise,

651
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,240
they didn't even show up.

652
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,920
They almost made the Blue Team lose.

653
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,880
They completed the task 30 seconds in advance.

654
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,000
Are you satisfied with it?

655
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,160
No.

656
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,600
What if you're not satisfied?

657
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,000
Report, Commander.

658
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,840
We still need to continue to work hard and train harder.

659
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,880
A team leader of the combat team inspected this exercise.

660
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,560
They just came from the command post to visit everyone.

661
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,680
Everyone,

662
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
get ready.

663
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,960
You got off work so early today?

664
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,560
My dad is having a check-up today.

665
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,440
I have to pick him up.

666
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,440
What's up?

667
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,600
The result of the first-ever negotiation of the jewelry store has come out.

668
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,760
They agreed to make up for the lawsuit.

669
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,080
But they asked us

670
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,680
not to conduct any kind of

671
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,240
stealth investigation on them in the future.

672
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,280
Isn't that just a guilty conscience?

673
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,800
If it's guilty conscience, then it's guilty conscience.

674
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,480
At least we saved 100,000 yuan.

675
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,080
What did Mr. Tian say?

676
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,840
It's a big deal.

677
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,840
I agree.

678
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,520
Okay, then you can agree.

679
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,440
Do you remember the colleague who helped us report Jian Yingwei last time?

680
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,880
My lyrics.

681
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,160
Give him the materials in our hands,

682
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,800
including the materials of the stealth investigation.

683
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,320
No.

684
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,560
You're playing this kind of game to save the country.

685
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,120
You won't be hit by revenge, right?

686
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,560
Why do I need a reason to hit you?

687
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,600
You just won't let me take the photo.

688
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,160
Fine, I'll find someone else to take the photo.

689
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,920
My sister, I just got my license.

690
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,000
Can you stop talking about me for the sake of the news?

691
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,160
My sister just got transferred from the station.

692
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,720
I'll take the photo with you.

693
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,520
I'm leaving.

694
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:00,760
No.

695
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,840
My sister.

696
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,840
Sister.

697
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,040
Sister.

698
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:47,080
The romance is like a dream.

699
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,840
But there are more expectations in your heart.

700
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,680
I really understand.

701
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,440
You say love is too vague.

702
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:07,600
But you give me the answer with your eyes.

703
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:15,040
I can meet you with all my heart.

704
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:22,560
Thank you for waking up the courage that used to be weak.

705
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,840
Let all coincidences become a wish.

706
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,680
Let all simple things become a partner.

707
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,680
Open the bright future.

708
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,720
People can't separate us.

709
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,280
You are the warm star.

710
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,960
I will never be alone.

711
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,760
You are the lonely one in the far away time.

712
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,520
I will never forget you.

713
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:01,080
I don't want to break up with you.

714
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,360
Let all coincidences become a wish.

715
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,040
Let all simple things become a partner.

716
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,280
Thank you for being by my side.

717
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,480
Let all coincidences become a wish.

718
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,880
The bigger the world, the lonelier it will be.

719
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,600
Only by standing by your side,

720
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:29,960
I can feel the warmth in my life.
