00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Report.

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The enemy's situation is very serious.

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You go to the command post with me.

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The rest of you, go to the camp and rest.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
There are about 30 soldiers in the whole island.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is Gangshuang.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
There are two of them.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Shandong is here.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There are at least six soldiers in Gangshuang and Shandong.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
There are also four people in the whole island.

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We have a group of ten.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Are the other twenty soldiers

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
all concentrated in Shandong?

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The Shandong on the left is the camp site of the soldiers.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There are many boxes.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's probably a cultural property.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The Shandong on the right is the residence of Han Changzhou's father and William.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The situation is not clear during the day.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
There are soldiers with them at night.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
According to our air traffic,

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
there are soldiers entering and leaving the Shandong during the day.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What is the general situation of the island's environment?

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The closer to the land, the more obvious the vegetation is, the more dense it is.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's hard to find anyone hiding in there.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Captain Wu,

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
based on the experience of your naval special forces,

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
is this operation appropriate during the day or at night?

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I think it's during the day.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Captain Yong, what do you think?

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Juju, I agree with my team's opinion.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We have already found the island from you through the unmanned reconnaissance.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We have already found the island from you through the unmanned reconnaissance.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Although it's not easy for us to find the soldiers of the mobilization activity in the daytime,

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
but they also find us.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Under the same hidden conditions,

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
we have an advantage

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
because we have prepared for you.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Once we find their harbor,

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
we have to secretly subdue them.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This can reduce the pressure of us attacking the cave.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Do you have any opinions?

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I agree with Captain Yu and Liu.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
They agree with the suggestions of the two captains.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We all agree with the suggestions.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Then we will act in the daytime.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
All units prepare in advance.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We will act officially at ten o'clock.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Mr. Han,

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I have checked the ship warehouse you asked me to check last time.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I didn't find anything.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay, thank you.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But when the Ministry of Finance was moving the cabinet,

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I found a shelf.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Lever?

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When we opened it,

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
there were some pink things in the shelf.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It should be the old chairman

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
who didn't have time to take it away.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Take me to see.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I think this was two months ago.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Two months ago.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
William.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Look at these guys.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Ladies, more.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
More.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What's wrong with them?

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Are they going to change their positions?

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, they are performing not too well.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So he is taking them for the training.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Make them stronger.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
They are not in a good state recently.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yuan Han asked them to do strength training outside.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This bastard.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Jincheng.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I am back.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh my god.

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Look at this guy.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You know how to play.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You guys are good.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Are you okay?

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You guys are really good.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You old guy.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You know how to have fun about your son.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You saw him running.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Like a bullet.

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Like a tiger.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Report, captain.

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The special police team succeeded in getting the map.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It has destroyed the camera.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
After taking down the port,

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
meet with the blue team quickly.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Captain, special police team.

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Go.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Go.

105
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Captain, captain.

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Get into position.

107
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Roger.

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Action.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Attack. Attack.

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Go.

111
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Go.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Go.

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Go.

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Go.

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Go.

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Go.

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Go.

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Go.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Go.

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Go.

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Go.

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Go.

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Go.

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Attack.

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Go.

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Go.

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Go.

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Go.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Go.

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Go.

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Attack.

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Go.

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Attack.

134
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Over there.

135
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Come, guys.

136
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Go.

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Go.

138
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Go.

139
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's Alpha.

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
On position.

141
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Go.

142
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Captain, cover us.

143
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The district chief has an order.

144
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You have to wait for the notice before entering the island.

145
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Let's go to rest in front.

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We'll wait for the battle.

147
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What are we going to shoot when we get there?

148
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There's no other way.

149
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's a rule.

150
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I hope you can withdraw.

151
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'll discuss with you later.

152
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Roger.

153
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We'll follow your arrangement.

154
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Captain, what's going on?

155
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Han Changzhou took people to escape from the secret passage.

156
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The drone of the command department found them in the west of the island.

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
They met with another wave of people.

158
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
There are about eight or nine army soldiers.

159
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Boss, they'll be here very soon.

160
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So, stay here.

161
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
All right.

162
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Bravo.

163
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Go.

164
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
William, can you protect us

165
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
with these people?

166
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
William, they're going to protect us, right?

167
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I guarantee you.

168
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You'll leave the island.

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'll protect you.

170
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Go.

171
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Go.

172
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Go.

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Go.

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Go.

175
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Go.

176
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Go.

177
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Report, Captain.

178
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
There are two directions ahead.

179
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Target found.

180
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Move towards the southwest.

181
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The distance is 300 meters.

182
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Go.

183
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Go.

184
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Go.

185
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The enemy is coming.

186
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Let's rush out.

187
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
We can't take that risk.

188
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
He said we can't take the risk now.

189
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
There will be more people coming from the west.

190
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Go.

191
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Go.

192
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Go.

193
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Go.

194
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Сегодня is a holy night.

195
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Water is good for the heart.

196
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Quickly go back to the batch Health Corp.

197
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Come on

198
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Leave tomorrow morning.

199
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Get in the corner.

200
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
No.

201
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Hurry to pass Asia's best darea.

202
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Close.

203
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,240
No one is looking

204
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,880
Look back

205
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,680
So you are still weak

206
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,200
Wu Wen

207
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,920
Why haven't they arrived yet?

208
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,880
They have other comrades accompanying them

209
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,080
Land in other directions

210
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,080
We will meet again after the battle

211
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,360
The battle is over

212
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,080
The reporters can go into the shooting

213
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,920
Note that the terrain on the island is complicated

214
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,080
Please do a good guide

215
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,160
Ok, I got it

216
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,440
Ok, let's go

217
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,840
Sister Xin

218
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,760
Isn't that the equipment of the Navy's landing team?

219
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,040
It seems to be

220
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,920
I think it's better to go to the island

221
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,800
I think it's better to go to the island

222
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
I think it's better to go to the island

223

I think it's better to go to the island

224
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
I think it's better to go to the island

225
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
I think it's better to go to the island

226
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
I think it's better to go to the island

227
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
I think it's better to go to the island

228
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
I think it's better to go to the island

229
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
I think it's better to go to the island

230
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
I think it's better to go to the island

231
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
I think it's better to go to the island

232
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
I think it's better to go to the island

233
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,800
I think it's better to go to the island

234
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
I think it's better to go to the island

235
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
I think it's better to go to the island

236
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
I think it's better to go to the island

237
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
I think it's better to go to the island

238
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
Go

239
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Go

240
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,200
Recently, the Public Security Bureau

241
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,720
Break through a major cultural relic search case

242
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,040
This is the former chairman of Changzhou Group

243
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,560
Han Changzhou and his wife Han Yutian

244
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,320
Suspended in stealing national relics

245
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
Mr. Han

246
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,360
You sit here

247
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Have you seen the news?

248
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,520
It's been a long time

249
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,840
I've told them to stop

250
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
Just don't listen

251
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,920
Since the matter has happened

252
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,960
What are your plans?

253
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Mr. Chang

254
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,840
There is something

255
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,240
I want to ask you for help

256
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,760
When is Lin Han convenient?

257
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,320
Can you see him?

258
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,200
I can see him

259
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Azhou

260
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:52,480
This is

261
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,320
China Real!

262
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,000
You should watch out for your sis.

263
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,000
Mishima!

264
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,520
I know appointed issue.

265
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,640
Say no more!

266
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,400
Hrants toaman!

267
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,400
Come on!

268
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,800
What are you waiting for?

269
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,640
What's going on?

270
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,480
I'm...

271
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,840
I'm back!

272
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,760
I'm back!

273
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,480
Wow, it's so clean.

274
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,480
What's wrong?

275
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
I was thinking

276
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,480
it's my first time to come to our house for the New Year.

277
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,480
It's so clean.

278
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,480
I need to improve the image of my old friend.

279
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
You're tired.

280
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
I'm fine.

281
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Who is it?

282
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
Hello.

283
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,480
You are?

284
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
I'm from the home service company.

285
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
What's up?

286
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,480
I just cleaned the house.

287
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
Don't talk.

288
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
Come back with me.

289
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
I can help you.

290
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
Help?

291
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Come on.

292
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
Thank you.

293
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Where did you put it?

294
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Here.

295
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Here.

296
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
Sorry.

297
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Sorry.

298
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Sorry to bother you.

299
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,480
Thank you.

300
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,480
The sun is coming out from the west.

301
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
You're good.

302
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
No, Tang...

303
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
Tang Xin told me.

304
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
And then...

305
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,480
I said you can't do it.

306
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
It's wrong.

307
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
Look at you.

308
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
You're sweating a lot.

309
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
No.

310
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
No.

311
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
What's going on?

312
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
You scared me.

313
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
You can stay with me tomorrow.

314
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
I'm grateful.

315
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
I'm grateful for you.

316
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,480
I'm happy.

317
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
Today is a day off.

318
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
Don't worry. I'll be with you.

319
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,480
I'll read the sunrise with you.

320
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
It's a deal.

321
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
It's not a deal. It's a dog.

322
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,480
It's a dog.

323
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Okay, baby.

324
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
Come on.

325
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,480
See if you have a pee.

326
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
It's okay.

327
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
You can wake up.

328
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,480
I...

329
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Why are you looking at me?

330
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,480
Pick it up.

331
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
It's me.

332
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
I see.

333
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,480
Go.

334
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
Stay with mom and sister.

335
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
Yes.

336
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
Mom went to play with you.

337
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,480
Dad went to work.

338
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Captain Chen.

339
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
You're back so soon.

340
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Didn't you go home to see?

341
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
No.

342
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
I took this opportunity

343
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
to appreciate the great mountain of the motherland.

344
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,480
I've been thinking about

345
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
what I should think about

346
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
and what I haven't thought about.

347
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
I've thought about it.

348
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,480
Have you come back?

349
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
They all miss you.

350
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
Especially Yi Nan Wang.

351
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
I know.

352
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
I'll go to him when I'm settled.

353
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,480
What's your plan this time?

354
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
You still decide to leave?

355
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,480
I'm going to

356
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,480
start over as a retired soldier.

357
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,480
Mr. Han.

358
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Sit.

359
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,480
I invited you here today

360
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
to ask you to do me a favor.

361
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
A few days ago,

362
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
I found a fake layer

363
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
in the company's financial room.

364
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,480
There are many documents

365
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
in the fake layer.

366
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
And some documents.

367
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,480
I took pictures of those documents.

368
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Mr. Han,

369
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
what do you mean?

370
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
I want you to

371
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
give these documents

372
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,480
and those documents

373
00:24:49,480 --> 00:25:05,160
to the

374
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
Mr. Han,

375
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,480
I can

376
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,480
go with you.

377
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
I think it's better

378
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
if you give these

379
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
to the relevant departments.

380
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,480
I'm afraid it's not convenient for me to go.

381
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
Besides,

382
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,480
I don't know

383
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,480
what I should say

384
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,480
when I go to the Public Security Bureau.

385
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
So I thought about

386
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
asking you to do me a favor

387
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,480
after I died.

388
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
Good job.

389
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,480
7 to 1 is the elimination rate.

390
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,480
You're more ruthless than Changyuan.

391
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Brigadier,

392
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
this time it's 3 to 7.

393
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
You can get the first place.

394
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,480
I'm not in a hurry.

395
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
The latest situation

396
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,480
requires a patrol mission.

397
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
You go back

398
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,480
and take care of the training.

399
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,480
Prepare to receive a new mission.

400
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
Yes.

401
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,480
What's the mission?

402
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
Report.

403
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Come in.

404
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,480
Captain.

405
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
Okay.

406
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,480
We'll talk about it later.

407
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,480
I'll announce

408
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,480
the task of the Blue Team.

409
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
According to the superior's order,

410
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
this time the South China Sea patrol

411
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,480
and the training on the sea

412
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,480
will be handed over to the Blue Team.

413
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Set off on the same day

414
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,480
and guard the South China Sea.

415
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,480
We'll complete the task.

416
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,480
We are the Chinese navy,

417
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
Wenzhou.

418
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,480
All our soldiers are in the South China Sea.

419
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
Guard the nation

420
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,480
and protect the sea.

421
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Here.

422
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
Here.

423
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Okay.

424
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
Please come in.

425
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
Please come in.

426
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,480
Hello.

427
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,320
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

428
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,160
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

429
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,880
Brother-in-law.

430
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,040
This is...

431
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,760
Come and have a look.

432
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,160
Three of them are here.

433
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,720
What's his name?

434
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,480
Luoluo.

435
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,280
How old is he?

436
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,400
More than half a year old.

437
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,400
Please have a seat.

438
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,520
Senior.

439
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,440
Please come in first.

440
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,040
Okay.

441
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,920
Chen Bai.

442
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,880
Sister-in-law.

443
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,400
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

444
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

445
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:37,960
Sister-in-law.

446
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,400
You're early.

447
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,200
Well,

448
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,360
how long will you be there?

449
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,000
Soon.

450
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,520
You must go to the wedding.

451
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,160
Did you hear that?

452
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,880
Please have a seat.

453
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,160
Let's go.

454
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,960
We're going to the wedding.

455
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,520
Congratulations.

456
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,160
Let's go.

457
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,080
Let's go.

458
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,880
Please come in.

459
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,960
Hello.

460
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:07,960
Hello.

461
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,800
Congratulations.

462
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,160
Thank you for coming.

463
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,080
It's my pleasure.

464
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,000
Let's go, Mr. Cheng.

465
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,600
Bernie,

466
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,240
when we first met,

467
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,440
I thought that

468
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,240
you've already left,

469
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,720
but you wore another day so 다х wisly,

470
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,540
to share with me

471
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,880
and other girls behind my back.

472
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,840
consoles me.

473
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,120
Though we met,

474
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,960
I still have feelings for him.

475
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,840
He's bizarre,

476
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,560
The love is too romantic

477
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:40,080
But your eyes give me an answer

478
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,760
I can meet you with all my heart

479
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,160
Bridegroom, wife, and cousin

480
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,480
Today, the parents, the senior and the comrades-in-arms

481
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,840
are here to witness your wedding

482
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
On behalf of the army and friends

483
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,320
I congratulate you on becoming a couple

484
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,720
Now, the parents, please

485
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,760
First of all, thank you for taking part in our wedding

486
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,160
in the midst of all the busy schedule

487
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,880
I'm the mother of Wu Si

488
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,480
Everyone says raising children is a very difficult thing

489
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,680
But to be honest

490
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,680
Wu Si never made me feel hard

491
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,320
He is the most beautiful shell in my life

492
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:49,560
Today, I'm going to give my most precious gift

493
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,320
to my daughter-in-law

494
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,880
Tang Xin

495
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,880
From now on, Wu Si belongs to the country and to you

496
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,880
I'm here to thank you

497
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,880
Thank you for being a wife of a soldier

498
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,880
Son, be happy

499
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
Thank you

500
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,880
My name is Tang Yuanchao

501
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,880
I'm a professional navy officer

502
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,880
I've been a soldier for half my life

503
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,880
I'm a piece of land in the navy

504
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,880
But Wu Si and his comrades are strong

505
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
Strong iron wall

506
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,880
I'm so happy to marry my daughter to such a soldier

507
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
Great

508
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,320
Little old woman

509
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,800
father

510
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:28,740
Tang Qi

511
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,820
You are father

512
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,640
This life

513
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,000
W panic

514
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,100
I found the best

515
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,260
The most beautiful Junior znill

516
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,020
Dad doesn't take good care of you

517
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,500
authorization

518
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,620
In the future

519
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:46,840
I was here

520
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,440
Protect my girl

521
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,100
Stop crediting it!

522
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,240
I want to use that chance!

523
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,280
Come out!

524
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,620
This is the common way.

525
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,400
This is the second time I see you in a wedding dress.

526
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,520
You're still so beautiful.

527
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,800
Thank you for marrying me.

528
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,320
Thank you.

529
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,680
Actually, when Cang Su proposed last time,

530
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,920
I already told you ten times.

531
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,240
Nothing has changed

532
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,640
since then.

533
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,240
We've been together for 661 days.

534
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,680
These days,

535
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,440
I always feel

536
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,640
that I love you more than the last day.

537
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,840
I'm a soldier.

538
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,160
I won't say romantic words.

539
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,120
I just want to add one more word

540
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,560
to the things I've done before.

541
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,800
If there's a next life,

542
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,680
I want to spend it with you.

543
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,160
I'll approve it for you.

544
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:22,840
And I'll find you

545
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,080
by my side as your wife.

546
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,280
Leader Wu,

547
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,120
first of all,

548
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,040
congratulations on

549
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,040
appearing

550
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,400
in a good-for-nothing record.

551
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,320
And

552
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,720
congratulations on

553
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,600
me being on the right track

554
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,360
and aiming for gold!

555
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,600
Zhou Xiaochun, go.

556
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,480
It has been two years

557
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,720
since Da Yan T dov

558
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:18,260
has been

559
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,260
I will be with you

560
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,260
I will love you forever

561
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,260
I will be with you forever

562
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,260
I will protect you

563
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,260
No matter you are by my side

564
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,260
or temporary separation

565
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,260
Every day in the future

566
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,260
I want to be with you

567
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,260
I am willing

568
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,260
to be with you

569
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,260
I am willing

570
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,260
to be with you

571
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,260
I am willing

572
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,260
I am willing

573
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,260
Bride and groom exchange rings

574
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,260
Let the north star

575
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,260
in the horizon of the dream

576
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,260
bring you memories

577
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,260
I want to be with you

I will protect you.

609
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,480
I'm afraid.

610
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,480
I really don't understand.

611
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,480
You said love is too vague.

612
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:43,480
But your eyes gave me the answer.

613
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,480
Courage.

All my heart can be with you.

Meeting you is a good exchange.

616
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:58,480
Thank you for waking up that once weak courage.

617
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,480
Let all the coincidences become a wish.

618
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,480
Let all the burdens become a burden.

619
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,480
Open the door of time.

620
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,480
The sea of people can't separate us.

621
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,480
Waiting for the heart to warm up.

622
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:25,480
Memories are not enough to make me.

623
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,480
The time of regret is not enough.

624
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,480
I will never forget the memories of you.

625
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,480
I will never regret.

626
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,480
With your heart, I will be brave.

627
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,480
The heart that wants me is not enough.

628
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,480
Thank you for being by my side.

629
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,480
The cold snow and the cold rain.

630
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,480
The bigger the world, the more lonely it is.

631
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,480
Only standing by your side.

632
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:07,480
I feel warm in my heart.
