1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,940
We seasonal

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I know your name

3
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,520
Then you must be in the army

4
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,360
Relation

5
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,320
The relationship can't be talked about

6
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,400
But I do

7
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,480
A few friends in the army

8
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,160
Let me ask

9
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,880
Ask what

10
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,760
Just ask

11
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,800
Which army of the navy was that day

12
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,440
Who are the people who go to rescue

13
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,800
Anyway, the more detailed the better

14
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,080
Tang Xin, what are you thinking

15
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,160
How can you ask this casually

16
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,440
I don't ask about military secrets

17
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,120
You just ask me privately

18
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,040
Row

19
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,880
I try

20
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,960
If I can't ask

21
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,440
You don't blame me

22
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,000
You ask first

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,600
Row

24
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,960
What are you drinking, I'll order it for you

25
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,920
It's okay, thank you

26
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,440
Row

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,720
Hello

28
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,920
You two are fine

29
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,800
it is good

30
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,800
Okay, okay, okay

31
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,000
I didn't mean that

32
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,120
it is good

33
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,280
Row

34
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,160
Okay, see you

35
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,920
how about it

36
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,760
No information can be told

37
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,240
I didn't ask anything

38
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,160
No word

39
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,800
得

40
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,440
Didn't I ask you for nothing today

41
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,360
I'd better go to the blind date

42
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,840
Hello

43
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,400
I am Tang Xin, a reporter from Minghua Network

44
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,760
I want to save the day's big salt glue action

45
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,960
Do a special report

46
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,920
According to the program

47
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,360
Come to the war zone propaganda bureau

48
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,520
Submit an interview application

49
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,800
You register first

50
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,200
Let's verify

51
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,600
I found

52
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,600
I found things

53
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,200
This thing

54
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,760
Thank you

55
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,000
There are so many people.

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,800
Yeah.

57
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,480
So many people.

58
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,560
The sea is beautiful.

59
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's take a picture.

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,640
Okay.

61
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,440
Come on. Stand there.

62
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll take a picture for you.

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,480
Okay.

64
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,840
Who?

65
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,400
Stand still.

66
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,480
Okay.

67
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,120
What's wrong?

68
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,240
Look.

69
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,120
This guy is so handsome.

70
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,560
He is.

71
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,520
We are meant to be together.

72
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,040
Why don't you add me on WeChat?

73
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,200
Go.

74
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,080
Hurry.

75
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,080
Hurry.

76
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,520
Hurry.

77
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,800
Something happened.

78
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,520
I'll be back soon.

79
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,800
Hurry.

80
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,960
Go.

81
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,800
Why did he run away?

82
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,640
Look at your mom.

83
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,080
She's gone.

84
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,960
How about your mom?

85
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,240
Where's your dad?

86
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,560
Where's the armory?

87
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,520
Get out first.

88
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,680
Here.

89
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,680
You fail too.

90
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,120
Minggu first.

91
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
I...

92
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
You've changed your legs.

93
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Changed?

94
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
You're a headshot.

95
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
You're something.

96
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
I...

97
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Captain Song,

98
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Xia Zhi is waiting to be eaten.

99
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Remember,

100
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
don't be a gentleman.

101
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,960
It doesn't matter if you eat it.

102
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Xia Zhi.

103
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Captain,

104
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
I want to eat.

105
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
I want to eat.

106
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Captain.

107
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Still not resting?

108
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Do I have flowers on my face?

109
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
What are you looking at?

110
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Come, come, come.

111
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Let's go, let's go.

112
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
Come on, comrade Wu Si.

113
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
Tell me.

114
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
What?

115
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
What's the blind date?

116
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
Dad.

117
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Dad, you can't be cold with me.

118
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
I admit,

119
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
I was just being mean to you today.

120
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
But it's not because of blind dates.

121
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,960
Because your target is a soldier.

122
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
I'll make it clear first.

123
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
I have no prejudice against soldiers.

124
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
I grew up in the military.

125
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
I admire soldiers the most.

126
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
But,

127
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
I'm from Chongqing.

128
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
To be a soldier is another thing.

129
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Besides,

130
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
If you want to introduce me to someone,

131
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,960
you have to ask for my opinion.

132
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,960
Did I ask for your opinion this time?

133
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Are you asking for my opinion?

134
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
Good guy.

135
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
The first time we met,

136
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
you and Uncle Wang

137
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
were like a couple.

138
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
That's to verify your own opinion.

139
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
I'm the only one who doesn't know

140
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
how to go on a blind date.

141
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
You're so naive.

142
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
Come on.

143
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
Why don't you remind me?

144
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,960
The 15-kilometer armed band is also on sale.

145
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
I dare to say.

146
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
Captain.

147
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
Is that girl pretty?

148
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
When did you pay so much?

149
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
Is it important whether she is pretty or not?

150
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
It's important.

151
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
You're so poor.

152
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
Are you so poor in front of Wu Ke'er?

153
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
All right.

154
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
Don't hide it from me.

155
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Pack it up.

156
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
I didn't see anyone at all.

157
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
I told you.

158
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
You asked Uncle Wang

159
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
to find the person who saved me from the big fire.

160
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
How many games are there?

161
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Tang Xin.

162
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Are you having a grudge against me?

163
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
What grudge do I have against you?

164
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
I have no grudge against you.

165
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
I have no grudge against the soldiers.

166
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
But you want me to find the soldiers.

167
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
I don't want to.

168
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Why?

169
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
All right. I'll ask you.

170
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Which school did I go to in primary school?

171
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Do you know that my middle school class teacher

172
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
is a man or a woman?

173
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
Do you know that I went to high school,

174
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,960
high school, high school, and high school?

175
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
All right.

176
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Don't say a few words.

177
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Mom, let me finish.

178
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Look.

179
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
You can't answer it.

180
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Come on.

181
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
Dad.

182
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,960
I love the country, the army, and the soldiers.

183
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
But

184
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
I can't be the heroine.

185
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Xin Xin.

186
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Do you remember

187
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
when I was a kid,

188
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
you went abroad for a few months.

189
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
You finally came back.

190
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,960
You went to kindergarten to pick me up.

191
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
I ignored you and called you uncle.

192
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
I'm four years old.

193
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
I don't even know who my father is.

194
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Mr. Tang.

195
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Do you know how long it took me to go back

196
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960
to change Mr. Tang into a father?

197
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Do you know how long it took me

198
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
to adapt to the existence of you in the family?

199
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Do you know that even after I saw

200
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
you and my mom sleep in the same room for the first time,

201
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
I almost cried?

202
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
I

203
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
I

204
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
I even wrote a letter back.

205
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
It's all negative comments.

206
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
I'm going to the police station to report you.

207
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,960
All these silly things were in my childhood memory.

208
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,960
But I don't want to copy and paste these memories

209
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
to my own child.

210
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Do you know what I think most in the army?

211
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
I miss you.

212
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
I miss your mother.

213
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
I think

214
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
it's because there are thousands of people like me

215
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,960
fighting in the air,

216
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
in the sea,

217
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
and in the border.

218
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
Only then can you live a peaceful life.

219
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
I know.

220
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
So I never blame you.

221
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
I was a kid.

222
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
I also took you to brawl with my friends.

223
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
I was a kid.

224
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
I was a kid.

225
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
I was a kid.

226
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
I was a kid.

227
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
I was a kid.

228
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
I was a kid.

229
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
I've been brawling with my friends.

230
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
But now I've grown up.

231
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
I have my own thoughts,

232
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
my own likes.

233
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
My own choices.

234
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,960
I don't want to find someone to arrange a boyfriend for me.

235
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,960
I don't want to live the life someone arranges for me.

236
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Even if it's you.

237
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,120
I've waitedAll for this moment

238
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,040
after we lookетhe long and endless road

239
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
You've had to wait

240
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,320
Just look

241
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,080
Go

242
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,720
I'm leaving.

243
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,520
I'm leaving.

244
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,920
You're not leaving, are you?

245
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,120
Fine.

246
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,160
Next time,

247
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,920
come on.

248
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,040
Go, go, go.

249
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,200
I'm begging you.

250
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,240
Can you try it again?

251
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,040
Can you?

252
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,400
How do you know

253
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,160
the person I like

254
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,400
is not good?

255
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,440
Aren't you curious?

256
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,120
Stop.

257
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,480
Don't give me that hard time.

258
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,680
Stop.

259
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,040
That's all.

260
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,000
That's all?

261
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
Try it.

262
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,880
Call him.

263
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,600
Okay.

264
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,200
What's wrong with my head

265
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,440
when pressed down by the ocean?

266
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,200
I keep remembering him.

267
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,620
Make me aware of her life

268
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,300
Intense

269
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,760
Turn around

270
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,760
I will tell you

271
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,880
What's this

272
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,880
This?

273
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,000
Is tr が form difficult for you

274
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,520
Yes

275
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,600
You should decide

276
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,560
You will have to do second shot

277
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,440
и

278
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,220
Dad

279
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:27,360
August

280
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,920
August

281
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,080
August

282
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,240
May you rest in peace

283
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,820
August

284
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,380
May you rest in peace

285
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:30,700
May you rest in peace

286
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,280
May you rest in peace

287
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,980
I may rest in peace

288
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,660
May you rest in peace

289
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,400
May you rest in peace

290
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:33,820
May you rest in peace

291
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,580
May you rest in peace

292
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,140
May you rest in peace

293
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,480
May you rest in peace

294
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,360
to pretend they don't even know about you.

295
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,120
Pretend

296
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,880
To point out

297
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
where not Everyone knows

298
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,040
So they won't know

299
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,160
that you're the one

300
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,120
who interfered to create an upheaval.

301
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,280
What is yours?

302
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,160
You,

303
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,540
You're the one who forever

304
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,160
doesn't even know

305
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,520
when you two can be together.

306
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,700
But I really don't know.

307
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,840
So

308
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,400
I have to prove it to you.

309
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,880
Captain, you've been sitting here since I came here.

310
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,040
Why are you looking at the pen?

311
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,200
Help me see what this name means.

312
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,560
Take the spare key.

313
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,600
Take the spare key.

314
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,560
I must open your door today.

315
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,320
Open it.

316
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Okay, okay.

317
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,760
No need.

318
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,800
I'll change it, okay?

319
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,640
Open it now.

320
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,720
Well...

321
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,040
I've made up my mind.

322
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,720
I'll be honest.

323
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,480
I'll be honest for 24 hours.

324
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,360
Why are you looking at the strange things?

325
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,960
Don't click.

326
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,760
I'll tell you if you click on the record.

327
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,720
That's more like it.

328
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,840
Enough.

329
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,320
No more spare keys.

330
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:57,060
This letter is from Master Tr 그러?

331
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,660
I'm not going to investigate this matter.

332
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,740
But the ship was caught on fire on the way.

333
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,060
There's no gain in this trip.

334
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,300
I'll keep following up on this matter.

335
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,940
But the range of salt and pepper sea fish is too large.

336
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,820
It's really hard to investigate without a specific location.

337
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,380
If you have a ship with a sea fish escort,

338
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,900
please provide it to me.

339
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,020
conocen

340
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,260
What's your name?

341
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,540
It's good to be labeled under my bank account.

342
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,940
This is the dried relations tree you ordered.

343
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,660
Thanks.

344
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,500
There is no need to know my Nous.

345
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,740
I'm not everything.

346
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,020
Hello

347
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,220
You come alone?

348
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,500
It's boring drinking

349
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,600
milk tea by yourself.

350
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,100
We should add each other

351
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,960
on Facebook.

352
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,820
We can have a single life together!

353
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,900
There's no need. I don't know you yet.

354
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,180
Just add me on Facebook,

355
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,860
on your local Facebook.

356
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,900
I'm not afraid of you.

357
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
I'm not a bad person.

358
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,900
Really.

359
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,900
What are you drinking?

360
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,900
Yangzhi dry deer?

361
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,900
You know,

362
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,900
every time I come here,

363
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,900
I always meet you.

364
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
Do you think this is a predestined fate?

365
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,900
I'm sorry.

366
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,900
I'm waiting for others.

367
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,900
There are so many empty seats here.

368
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,900
Can you go to another place?

369
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,900
I'm sorry.

370
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,900
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,900
But I like you.

372
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
The girl next to you.

373
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
Don't go.

374
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,900
I just want to know you.

375
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,900
I'm not a bad person.

376
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,900
Be civilized in public.

377
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,900
Who?

378
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,900
He's the one I'm waiting for.

379
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,900
Did you hear that?

380
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,900
No.

381
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Are you okay?

382
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,900
I'm fine.

383
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,900
Thank you.

384
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,900
It's my duty.

385
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,900
Wait.

386
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,900
Can we add a contact?

387
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,900
Okay.

388
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,900
My name is Zong Qing.

389
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,900
My name is Lan Yangyang.

390
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,900
Yangyang. I remember.

391
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,900
Goodbye.

392
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,900
Hello.

393
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,900
Is Tang Ji in our office?

394
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
Tang Xin?

395
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,900
Yes.

396
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,900
The second room on the left.

397
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,900
Thank you.

398
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,900
Mr. Han, you're here.

399
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
Hello, Mr. Han.

400
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,900
We have a meeting.

401
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,900
I'm here to see you.

402
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,900
What's the matter?

403
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
I'm here to see you.

404
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,900
What's the matter?

405
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,900
I'm here to see you.

406
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,900
I'm here to see you.

407
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
I'm here to see you.

408
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,900
I'm here to see you.

409
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,900
Hello, Hai.

410
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,900
We meet again.

411
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,900
You want to see Xin?

412
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,900
Yes. Is it convenient?

413
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,900
Yes.

414
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,900
Come with me.

415
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,900
Thank you.

416
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,900
I'm here

417
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,900
to thank you.

418
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,900
For what?

419
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,900
For saving your life.

420
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,900
The ship was on fire.

421
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,900
It was very dangerous.

422
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,900
But you chose to save me.

423
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,900
I didn't save you.

424
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,900
We were rescued by the navy.

425
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
It's different.

426
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,900
But I have to remember

427
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,900
our friendship.

428
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,900
Mr. Han, don't say that.

429
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,900
I'm embarrassed.

430
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,900
I asked you for help.

431
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,900
And I caused

432
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
such a big loss to your family.

433
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,900
If you say so,

434
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
I'm embarrassed.

435
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
It's all my fault.

436
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,900
I found such a bad ship.

437
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,900
I was too busy to help.

438
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,900
I almost threw you into the sea.

439
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,900
Let's not be polite.

440
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Anyway, I can't afford

441
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,900
your ship.

442
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,900
This has nothing to do with you.

443
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,900
We investigated it after the accident.

444
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
It was caused by the engine failure.

445
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,900
It was accidentally caught on fire.

446
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,900
Then I don't have to feel guilty?

447
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
Of course.

448
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,900
Do you have time tonight?

449
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,900
I'll treat you to dinner.

450
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,900
I found such a bad ship

451
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,900
to make up for it.

452
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,900
But I'm your official person.

453
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,900
Report.

454
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,900
One hundred thousand yuan of money

455
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,900
is ready to be paid off.

456
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,900
Three.

457
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,900
Don't be in a hurry.

458
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
Hurry up.

459
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,900
Hold your hands tight.

460
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,900
Look at your feet.

461
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,900
Take it easy.

462
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,900
Don't be in a hurry.

463
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,900
Hurry up.

464
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,900
Where are your hands?

465
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,900
Where are your hands?

466
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,900
Water.

467
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,880
Report,

468
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,900
Keep it in the way.

469
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
Report, Yang Yang's lock- Taeàn performance is complete,

470
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,900
Attendant Ouyang's lock- Taeàn performance is continued,

471
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,900
Without the conforming.

472
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,900
This is I don't need?

473
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,900
Report, Gao Yang similar to Yang Yang.

474
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,900
A situation just according toavian rugby B根Yang Yang

475
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,900
need to quit with their spray guns.

476
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,300
They gave us template.

477
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,020
You can go to work now.

478
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,460
If it's impossible to go to work,

479
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,580
we can even go to work tomorrow.

480
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,980
Just trust me.

481
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,020
Tomorrow I come to Wenzhou for a business trip.

482
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,820
and the last one for you

483
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,100
are not the same at all.

484
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,740
Okay.

485
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,820
Take this pure youth

486
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,980
to the financial department first.

487
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,380
And this sister,

488
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,500
if you need anything in the future,

489
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,580
remember to find me, okay?

490
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,460
The secretly shot is still safe.

491
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,020
This time, let's learn from Zhong Xiaowen

492
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,260
to do a live broadcast.

493
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,540
Okay.

494
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,020
How good is this?

495
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,140
This one.

496
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,300
This one is good.

497
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,300
Hello, Miss.

498
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,740
What do you want to buy?

499
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,820
I'll get you what you like.

500
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:56,980
Look at this.

501
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,940
This one.

502
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,300
Miss, you're so sharp.

503
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,820
This jade is imported from Myanmar directly.

504
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,780
Look at this color.

505
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,860
It's green.

506
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,620
There's no box at all.

507
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,260
Our house is 1888.

508
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,140
There are thousands of shops in other houses.

509
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,620
Really?

510
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,820
Like this general jade,

511
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,980
it's all through manufacturers,

512
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,100
salesmen, wholesale merchants,

513
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,660
and brand merchants

514
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,740
to get to the counter.

515
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,820
Our house

516
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,900
is a first-hand goods source in Myanmar.

517
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,580
Without these middlemen,

518
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,620
we can only get these

519
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,820
cheap and good goods.

520
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,860
How about one?

521
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:28,980
Okay.

522
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,420
This one.

523
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:30,900
Okay.

524
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,100
I'll wrap it for you.

525
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,980
Miss, would you like to take a look

526
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,740
at our jade bracelet?

527
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,860
It's a nice color.

528
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:38,940
You can take a look.

529
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,380
Okay.

530
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,900
Hello, sir.

531
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,860
This one?

532
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,820
This one. Take a look.

533
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,980
I'll wrap it for you when you pick it.

534
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,460
Okay.

535
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,500
Okay. Please wait a moment.

536
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,620
Let's go.

537
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,700
We're in trouble.

538
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,500
What's going on?

539
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,900
That girl took my jade bracelet away.

540
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,140
We're in trouble.

541
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,260
Don't run.

542
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,700
Are you okay?

543
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,420
I'm fine.

544
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,540
I'll talk to you when the police come.

545
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,620
Here.

546
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,660
Please register your personal information.

547
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,380
Write a word

548
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,580
and see who

549
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,100
gave this jade bracelet to someone.

550
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,620
If there's no problem, you can leave.

551
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,340
Officer.

552
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,140
Not only this jade bracelet,

553
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,500
but also my camera.

554
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
I'll take a look at it.

555
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:23,980
Okay.

556
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,500
Okay.

557
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,020
Okay.

558
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,580
Okay.

559
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,180
Okay.

560
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:26,780
Okay.

561
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,340
Okay.

562
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,340
Where's my camera?

563
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,220
And,

564
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,060
officer.

565
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:30,780
I'm asking you.

566
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,420
Why did you come to me?

567
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,100
I thought you stole someone else's stuff.

568
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,100
I didn't have time to take this bracelet.

569
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,300
Even if you're brave,

570
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,860
you should observe the situation.

571
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,940
And there's someone

572
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,580
running crazy ahead.

573
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,460
Didn't you see that?

574
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,460
I really didn't see the person ahead.

575
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,620
I only saw you

576
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,820
running around.

577
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:57,980
Okay.

578
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,740
Although you're busy,

579
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,460
you're a very hard-working person.

580
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,460
I don't want to make things difficult for you.

581
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,020
You're a soldier?

582
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,060
Which army?

583
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,060
The Lu's.

584
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,420
My cousin is in your team, too.

585
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,780
His name is Li Xing. Do you know him?

586
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,260
Officer.

587
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,980
You can't start a relationship

588
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,700
in front of me

589
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,740
because you're in the same profession.

590
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,860
What makes you think

591
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,860
I'm in a relationship?

592
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,500
Besides, we're in the same profession.

593
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,980
Li Xing.

594
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,500
He went to their girl.

595
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,940
This Nanguan.

596
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,940
Wait a moment.

597
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,300
I just said he went to the Lu's team?

598
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,860
The strike at Taiyan Camp

599
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,580
the other day

600
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,380
was iT meddlesome.

601
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,740
I'm sorry.

602
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,740
I'll pay for it.

603
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,220
Comrade Zhang,

604
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,260
I'll pay for it.

605
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,460
Then you should ask the shopkeeper for a price.

606
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,220
Comrade,

607
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,980
I brought this bracelet.

608
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,140
I'll pay for it.

609
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,300
I just came to ask for a price.

610
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,780
It's not a matter of money.

611
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,260
It's not about money.

612
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,660
After all,

613
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,140
it's a matter of a person's choice.

614
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,740
Don't let the good people be so cold-hearted.

615
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,380
Thank you for your kindness.

616
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,540
But our army has rules.

617
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,700
If you destroy something,

618
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,940
you have to pay for it.

619
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,380
Okay, then.

620
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,580
I'll pay for it.

621
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,620
But I have to trouble you

622
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,140
to fix my phone.

623
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,260
You're waiting for someone to come?

624
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,740
I'll fix it.

625
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,860
We'll contact each other.

626
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,140
Thank you.

627
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,220
My phone will be on for 24 hours.

628
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,340
I'll contact you when I fix it.

629
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,220
What's wrong?

630
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,980
You're paying for the bracelet?

631
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,620
Okay.

632
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,580
I'll pay for it.

633
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,260
Who are you?

634
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,380
Her boyfriend.

635
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,380
Why are you here?

636
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,500
The live broadcast is too boring.

637
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,540
So I came to see the drama.

638
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,060
I'll send you home later.

639
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,620
No need. I'll go back to the unit.

640
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,940
Then I'll send you back to the unit.

641
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,780
I may not be able to send the camera

642
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,500
after it's fixed.

643
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,580
Is it convenient to flash it?

644
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,940
No.

645
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,380
My camera is very expensive.

646
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,020
Let's meet face to face.

647
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,100
I can go to you.

648
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,020
I'll go to you.

649
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,340
Okay.

650
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,660
I'll contact you when it's fixed.

651
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,520
podcasts

652
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,340
wife

653
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,940
Let me take a look at you.

654
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,980
I miss you so much.

655
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,300
Stick the ticket on your forehead.

656
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,460
I want to tell you something.

657
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,540
want to seereview.

658
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,740
Will it be a new task?

659
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,940
What do you mean?

660
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,700
Honey,

661
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,540
I know it's hard to split up.

662
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,180
I'm busy with work.

663
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,860
I can't come to see you often.

664
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,940
Calm down first.

665
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,940
If you have any difficulties,

666
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,020
we can solve it together.

667
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,140
There's no way to solve it.

668
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,380
Our marriage

669
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,540
should have been over long ago.

670
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,940
What do you mean?

671
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,540
Our marriage should have been over long ago.

672
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,260
Why do we have to divorce?

673
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,500
All right, all right.

674
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,300
Don't be angry.

675
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,100
Don't say childish words.

676
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,740
I brought you a lot of things

677
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,780
you like to eat.

678
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,540
Come on.

679
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:39,940
I'm coming.

680
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,540
Come on.

681
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:41,980
Take a look.

682
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,060
Sit.

683
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,060
Sit.

684
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:48,700
Tian,

685
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,900
share this with your comrades.

686
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,620
And this.

687
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,340
And this.

688
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,540
We've been married for so many years.

689
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,940
We can count the days we spent together.

690
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,740
When you married me,

691
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,340
I knew very well

692
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,860
what you went through.

693
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,420
I don't want your life

694
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,900
to be affected because of me.

695
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,060
I'm telling you about this.

696
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,860
But you don't listen.

697
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,180
Well,

698
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,660
I'll call my parents

699
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,100
and ask them for their opinion.

700
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,460
Honestly,

701
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,660
we're both young.

702
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,380
You still have a chance to choose.

703
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,260
I don't find it strange

704
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,620
to have a girl who likes you.

705
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,660
Don't waste time on me.

706
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,220
I'm confident

707
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,780
to have a girl who likes me.

708
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,780
What if there's a guy who likes you?

709
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,700
Don't talk nonsense.

710
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,220
Since you're here,

711
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,300
let's settle this.

712
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,940
We're so close.

713
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,700
How can we talk about divorce?

714
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,460
Stop it.

715
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,140
I'm serious about the divorce.

716
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,940
I hope you can consider it seriously.

717
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,500
I'm leaving.

718
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,820
Stop right there.

719
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,540
I'm telling you, Wang Chen.

720
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,180
There's no way to get divorced.

721
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,020
I won't agree.

722
00:32:59,260 --> 00:32:59,740
I'm leaving.

723
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,740
I'm sorry, Zi Jian.

724
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,340
I can't be so selfish anymore.

725
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,340
We've been living in separate places.

726
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,980
I can't leave the army and live with you.

727
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,780
And I've been

728
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,260
unable to give you a child.

729
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,020
How long have you been chased?

730
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,180
At least eight meters.

731
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,100
Good.

732
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,580
You were still young.

733
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,500
Dad, I'm telling you.

734
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,340
There are so many people on the street.

735
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,940
Otherwise, I can't catch up.

736
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,580
You're good, right?

737
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,420
You're a soldier.

738
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,660
You can't be so hard on him.

739
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,180
What if you get into trouble again?

740
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:56,980
You're so stubborn.

741
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,900
What's the point of this injury?

742
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,740
A soldier's family can't be so hurt.

743
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,660
You're right.

744
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,380
Watch your TV.

745
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,980
Don't take a shower these days.

746
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,740
It'll be better if you get some water.

747
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,420
I want to.

748
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,500
I'm going to Yangyang's graduation ceremony tomorrow.

749
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,020
Is your uncle Lan going too?

750
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,980
He wants to go.

751
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,260
But Yangyang doesn't allow him.

752
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,060
He's afraid that he'll be scared.

753
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,260
So his family status is the same as mine.

754
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,100
You've been

755
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,060
doing this for four years.

756
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,660
Do you understand?

757
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,340
You know how to fix it?

758
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,300
I know how to fix it.

759
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,580
But I've been in college for four years.

760
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,700
I fixed it for you with my eyes closed.

761
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,700
Come down.

762
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,260
Why are you standing so high?

763
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,100
Are you tall?

764
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,580
I'll leave it to you.

765
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,500
Please fix it soon.

766
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,060
Please. It's not a good thing.

767
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,340
Who did you fix it for?

768
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,020
A friend who is brave.

769
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,220
Okay. Look at the camera.

770
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,300
Okay. Look at the camera.

771
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,940
Okay. Look at the camera.

772
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,860
One, two, three.

773
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,780
We graduated.

774
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,180
Okay.

775
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,620
One, two, three.

776
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,100
Great.

777
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,340
Great.

778
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,340
Great.

779
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,340
Great.

780
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,340
Great.

781
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,340
Great.

782
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
Great.

783
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,580
You finally graduated, little ancestor.

784
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,420
Xi Xi.

785
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,700
When did you come?

786
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,780
You're here early.

787
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,060
We've been watching you for a long time.

788
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,460
You promised to come on this big day.

789
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,300
Can you not come?

790
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,900
I finally graduated.

791
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,820
It's such a big day.

792
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,060
How can we celebrate it?

793
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,620
Let's go and have some milk tea.

794
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,580
Military doctor?

795
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,740
The South China Sea Army started recruiting.

796
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,220
My dad sent me an application form every day.

797
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,340
He wanted to send it to the army directly.

798
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,660
It's not easy to be a military doctor.

799
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,780
You're a big uncle now.

800
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,620
Can't you shake your hand?

801
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,420
I can.

802
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,260
I'm not just shaking my hand, I'm also dizzy.

803
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,540
You're a medical student.

804
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,100
You're dizzy.

805
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,180
You have the nerve to say that.

806
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,540
It's not fair.

807
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,260
Uncle Tang asked you to choose your own major

808
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,340
and choose your job.

809
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,660
The gap between dad and dad is too big.

810
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,780
How about we change it?

811
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,220
Let's let Mr. Tang urge you to marry every day.

812
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,220
Feel it.

813
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,300
Did you find the life-saving man?

814
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,660
It's not that easy.

815
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,740
The confidentiality rules are so strict.

816
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,620
Wait.

817
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,860
Give me the paper.

818
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,420
No.

819
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,900
It's for you.

820
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,460
50 pieces of paper, a good collection.

821
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,260
Get lost.

822
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:19,860
Okay.

823
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,940
I'll take it back to comfort Cheng Yuan.

824
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,940
He's not the only one in our team.

825
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,940
No matter how you pick,

826
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,660
Cheng Yuan can beat you without calling you.

827
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,100
Didn't you say I wouldn't mention it?

828
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,060
Have you fixed the camera?

829
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,740
Yes.

830
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,660
Guess what I found when I fixed the camera.

831
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,100
You found the owner of the camera

832
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,980
was the one who taught you how to shoot with big eyes that day, right?

833
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,020
I recognized it on the first sight.

834
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,900
You haven't recognized me yet.

835
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,900
You won't recognize me in the future.

836
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,980
The mission is over.

837
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,300
We have no relationship.

838
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,700
I don't want you to get into trouble.

839
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,660
He has.

840
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,620
I'll make you suffer.

841
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,180
I took the camera from Qing a few days ago.

842
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,340
I happened to break the camera.

843
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,100
I asked the crew to fix it for me.

844
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,900
After fixing it,

845
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,540
I asked him to send it back to me.

846
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,700
And then?

847
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,100
And then it came back.

848
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,780
I didn't have a chance to create a chance.

849
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,460
You're so stubborn.

850
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,540
You'd better join the military camp.

851
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,900
There are so many people waiting in line.

852
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,340
Isn't this just a milk tea?

853
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,420
Which one you want to drink?

854
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,020
Why are you even here, waiting for a bingo?

855
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,540
The store is different.

856
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,380
You don't know.

857
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,420
Fanggin, earlier I told you

858
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,380
that this is my lucky shop.

859
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,260
What lucky shop?

860
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,540
In the car,

861
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,180
I Tob enchanted you

862
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,420
with a guy I used to know well.

863
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,140
We met here once.

864
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,860
You this lucky shop.

865
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,500
A guy.

866
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,500
So lucky.

867
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,500
Look.

868
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,500
How is it?

869
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Isn't it very handsome?

870
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,500
It's very handsome.

871
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,500
But I remember that

872
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
you swore to marry a soldier since you were a child.

873
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,500
Did you understand the question

874
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
that the teacher just gave in class?

875
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
I didn't understand either.

876
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,500
I just didn't understand.

877
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
I think it's so difficult.

878
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Really? I think it's so difficult too.

879
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,500
What if I have an exam soon?

880
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
What should I do?

881
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Let's ask someone.

882
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Okay.

883
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,500
What's wrong with you?

884
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Help me take it first.

885
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,500
I can't take it.

886
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
I'm so tired.

887
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,500
I'm so tired.

888
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,500
I'm so tired.

889
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,500
I'm so tired.

890
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,500
I'm so tired.

891
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Captain Song.

892
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
It's almost time.

893
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,500
It's time to go back to the team.

894
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
Well, you go first.

895
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,500
I'll be right there.

896
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,500
I'm back.

897
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Are you a soldier?

898
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,500
I have a shopping today.

899
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Here you are.

900
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Thank you.

901
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,500
I'm leaving now.

902
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,500
You're leaving just after seeing me?

903
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,500
It's time to go back to the team.

904
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,500
Goodbye.

905
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,500
Bye.

906
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,500
Okay.

907
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,500
Don't laugh.

908
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Is it that hard?

909
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,500
You don't understand.

910
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Once love comes,

911
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
it's easy to be hurt.

912
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,500
I don't understand.

913
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,500
But the princess is happy.

914
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,500
We're happy.

915
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,500
Come on.

916
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,500
To celebrate that Lanyang

917
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,500
has achieved success in her new year,

918
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
she has a brother.

919
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,500
Romantic.

920
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
I'm so happy.

921
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,500
I have a brother.

922
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,500
Romantic.

923
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,500
Our military is so romantic.

924
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,500
Have you thought about

925
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
how your commander Lan

926
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,500
feels when he knows

927
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
you're in love?

928
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,500
He's been on the defensive for years.

929
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,500
He's afraid that Princess Lan

930
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
will join the early love.

931
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,500
Good.

932
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,500
She just graduated.

933
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,500
Tang Xin, I'm telling you.

934
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,500
You can't tell my dad about this.

935
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,500
I'll tell him myself.

936
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,500
Okay.

937
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,500
It's a secret.

938
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,500
No problem.

939
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,500
You have to help me.

940
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,500
If my camera

941
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,500
is not good,

942
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,500
I'll borrow

943
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,500
Ding's camera.

944
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,500
I'm so scared.

945
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,500
I'll borrow

946
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,500
Ding's camera.

947
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,500
I'm sorry.

948
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,500
I'm sorry.

949
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,500
I'm sorry.

950
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,500
I'm sorry.

951
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,500
I'm sorry.

952
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,500
I'm sorry.

953
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,500
