1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,580
The End

2
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,740
I think you should wrap it.

3
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,220
The finger is a heart.

4
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,080
It must hurt.

5
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,340
Finger is used to button up.

6
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,180
It must be active.

7
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,420
It won't be flexible if you wrap it.

8
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,020
Does it hurt?

9
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,220
If you look at me like this,

10
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,740
I'm embarrassed to hurt.

11
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,260
You Psaki.

12
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,780
You need to keep clear of An Xia.

13
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,460
So we try our best.

14
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,100
It's a little targeted.

15
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,240
Stop being so obvious.

16
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,540
An Hai.

17
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:19,780
Here.

18
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:23,860
What's wrong?

19
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,900
I told you to take something with you.

20
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,540
Bring it.

21
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,100
Here.

22
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,140
Here, Xinjian.

23
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,020
What's this?

24
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,100
Didn't you ask me to bring something

25
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,180
to save you?

26
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,060
You went out too early that day

27
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,820
and your waist didn't open.

28
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,340
I found this at home.

29
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,380
What about this?

30
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,060
It's just right.

31
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,900
I need this.

32
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,580
Give me your hand.

33
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,860
Pour the rice wine in.

34
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,020
All right.

35
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,980
I already put it on.

36
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,580
You shouldn't iron it, either.

37
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,020
There's no need.

38
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,540
How shameless you are!

39
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,100
Give me your hand.

40
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,300
I'm here to interview you.

41
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,220
You shouldn't have gone to work that day.

42
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,340
I'm fine.

43
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,140
You'll go up if I'm one step later.

44
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,060
But I'm already here.

45
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,340
You've seen all the elderly kids up there.

46
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,740
I can't help you when I'm in trouble.

47
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,540
Anyway,

48
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,340
don't do anything dangerous in the future.

49
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,340
I'm fine.

50
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,340
I'm fine.

51
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,340
I'm fine.

52
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,340
I'm fine.

53
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,340
I'm fine.

54
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
I'm fine.

55
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,340
I'm fine.

56
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,340
I'm fine.

57
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,100
I'm grateful for those kids.

58
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,420
You're welcome.

59
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,540
Mr. Han, you're back.

60
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,460
Help me check who's the owner of this mailbox.

61
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,660
This mailbox?

62
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,100
The owner of this mailbox

63
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,700
cheated my friend with money.

64
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,820
So I'm helping my friend with this.

65
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,580
Got it.

66
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,140
JN56789

67
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,940
at qq.com.

68
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,820
Such a simple account.

69
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,300
It's just a temporary one.

70
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,100
Do you think we can

71
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,900
start from the female reporter

72
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,260
to investigate this mailbox?

73
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,740
Only instant noodles.

74
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,940
Nope.

75
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,460
Don't look online.

76
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,860
Why don't you tell dad for me?

77
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,060
I want to go to the scene too.

78
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,300
What are you talking about?

79
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,620
Can the scene be a place

80
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,020
where you can run around?

81
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,540
You're making trouble for him.

82
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,700
I'm not making trouble.

83
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,460
I just want to see Zong Qing.

84
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,700
I'm worried about him.

85
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,300
No.

86
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,900
Mom, I'm begging you.

87
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,460
Zong Qing and I just got married.

88
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,100
You can't leave me like this.

89
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,540
Stop. Stop. Stop.

90
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,540
Let me lie down for a while.

91
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,900
Don't even think about it.

92
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,220
It's no use being so formal.

93
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,260
Stop.

94
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,660
Dispatch!

95
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,700
I'm here.

96
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,340
This is the reason of the resulting incident.

97
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,940
It's the northwest direction

98
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,740
of your cooperation zone.

99
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,420
Although there is a typhoon here,

100
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,060
people multiple areas have ar assunto…

101
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,500
The reservoir may turn a 2500m ml brepus

102
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
and seek undermining of the dam,

103
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,360
especially to the land

104
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
with vast earth cakes.

105
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,880
Most of the dam gate

106
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,320
has been emptied out.

107
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,760
Yes, we're leaving now.

108
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,640
Take the rest of the sandbags.

109
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,520
Yes.

110
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,920
I know.

111
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,920
Your team has been fighting for days.

112
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,800
It's exhausting.

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,320
But the more difficult the time is,

114
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,800
the more fearless we are.

115
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,720
We're not afraid of difficulties.

116
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,680
Keep fighting.

117
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,760
Yes.

118
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,320
Everybody.

119
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,800
Now you can see

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,800
the Navy Re irrelevant Team

121
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,040
Heyman Attack Team

122
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,360
getting cuandoked and given some chase.

123
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,920
To protect the city,

124
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,360
theFil principle is to liked

125
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,280
to stop any

126
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,100
regime that's Egyptian

127
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,800
ethnicity from entering the city.

128
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,080
Every time an clears the city,

129
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,920
it's the only way we can make it.

130
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,200
Sooner or later,

131
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,320
it's overlap.

132
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,520
Have you bought one you could escape to?

133
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,640
Let'S go

134
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,880

135
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,800
Come on

136
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,440
Autofocus

137
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
We can't hold on to them.

138
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,440
Commander,

139
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,040
there are not many casualties here.

140
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,240
We can't hold on to them.

141
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,080
We have to stop the water supply.

142
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,480
Otherwise, we can't hold on to them.

143
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,320
Yes.

144
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,040
If we can't hold on to them,

145
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,280
we can't hold on to the dam.

146
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,800
Send them to the garden.

147
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,360
Yes.

148
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,240
Get down.

149
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,040
There's a body poison.

150
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,680
Yes.

Well, thank you.

Hello.

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,960
Are you Mrs. Tang's friend?

196
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,840
Why are you looking for me?

197
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,360
Well…

198
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,360
Since Mr. Tang left for Ma to boards,

199
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,600
I can't reach him now.

200
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,920
And I have no understanding on the phone.

201
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,000
It's nothing really.

202
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,520
We've calledapp culminated with other journalists.

203
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,000
Mr. Tian, we donated the materials to the disaster area.

204
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,320
We can send the car later.

205
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,560
Okay, okay, send it now.

206
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,080
Send it now.

207
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,600
Okay.

208
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,640
Okay, that's it.

209
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,040
Mr. Tian,

210
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,720
I want to ask you a favor.

211
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,680
If you have a car to go to Ma's Town in the afternoon,

212
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,600
can you take me with you?

213
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,400
I'll let Mr. Tian come to Wuchangragel to find the true car.

214
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,120
My car also embedded the parts of a car.

215
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,120
Why can't I冷却吗

216
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,160
Firefighter,

217
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,840
send this stuff to Ma's Town.

218
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,520
Tell him to look back for me.

219
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,360
Okay.

220
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,320
I don't have any other choice.

221
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,920
Yang Yang

222
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,100
Come to eat

223
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,280
I haven't asked my mother to invite you.

224
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Yang Yang.

225
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,280
Where did this middle-aged man go?

226
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
Where is he?

227
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
Sir, please stop the car.

228
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Thank you.

229
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,480
Hello, Mr. Tao.

230
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,280
Excuse me.

231
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,880
Do you know where the center is?

232
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,280
The center is in the front.

233
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,680
Okay, thank you.

234
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,480
Thank you, sir.

235
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,480
Bye.

236
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,480
It's okay, Ms. Tang.

237
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,080
You can go now.

238
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,080
Okay, bye.

239
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,680
Okay.

240
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
Ms. Tang.

241
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Are you leaving?

242
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,880
We're going back.

243
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,680
Let's go.

244
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,280
Ms. Tang.

245
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,880
I have something to tell you.

246
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,480
You have something to tell me?

247
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,480
Yes.

248
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,080
Hurry up.

249
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,080
Sorry, sorry.

250
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,880
You guys talk. I'll wait for you in the car.

251
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,080
Goodbye, Ms. Tang.

252
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,680
Let's talk here.

253
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,480
This way.

254
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,880
You shouldn't jump down at that time.

255
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
It's dangerous.

256
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,480
I'm here.

257
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,880
I can't just watch.

258
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,680
Can you help me with something?

259
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,280
Is this what you want to tell me?

260
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
No.

261
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,480
What is it?

262
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,480
Actually, I want to ask you something.

263
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,680
What is it?

264
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
I want to ask you something.

265
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,280
Actually, I want to tell you.

266
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,280
The person who saved you in the big rock bridge that day

267
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,280
was me.

268
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
I'm sorry.

269
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,880
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

270
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,280
Then I'll ask you

271
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,280
why you kept it from me.

272
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
Because protecting the masses is the duty of a soldier.

273
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,880
I don't want you to thank me and repay me for this.

274
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,480
I don't want you to touch me

275
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,480
because I saved you.

276
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,480
I hope you can see

277
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,080
the real me in the life of the army.

278
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
How did it suddenly come to be?

279
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,080
You feel that I should have recognized you just now.

280
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,680
So I can't pretend anymore.

281
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,280
Actually, I've been with you for a while.

282
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,280
I've long felt that you were the one who saved me in the big rock bridge.

283
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,280
So now I know

284
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,280
I'm not afraid at all.

285
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,280
I don't want you to care about that uniform.

286
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
I understand.

287
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,880
So you've been hiding it from me.

288
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
I can understand.

289
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
OK.

290
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,080
Then I want to thank you officially today.

291
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,480
You don't have to thank me.

292
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,680
Thank you for saving my life in the big rock bridge.

293
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,280
And thank you for everything you did afterwards.

294
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
Thank you.

295
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Thank you.

296
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,080
OK.

297
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,880
Since we've made it clear, it's good.

298
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,480
I also want to ask you a question.

299
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,680
Go ahead.

300
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
At first,

301
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,680
you pretended to be in love with me

302
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,480
because of your leader's task.

303
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,080
So now

304
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,880
do you still need to continue this blind date?

305
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Hello, comrade.

306
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,680
Hello.

307
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,080
I want to find someone.

308
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Do you know where Zong Qing is?

309
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
Yang Yang.

310
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Why are you here?

311
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,880
You are...

312
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,480
I'm Yinan Wang.

313
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,280
Yinan Wang.

314
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,280
Where is Zong Qing?

315
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,480
Some people are injured.

316
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,880
The team is helping in the medical tent.

317
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,680
I'll take you there.

318
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,280
OK.

319
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,880
Here.

320
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,280
Captain Zong.

321
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,280
I'll play with you.

322
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,880
What's wrong?

323
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Guess who's here.

324
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,880
I finally found you.

325
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,080
Why are you here?

326
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,680
I miss you.

327
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,080
Let go.

328
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,280
No.

329
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,280
Let go.

330
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,080
No.

331
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,680
Come on.

332
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,880
Stand still.

333
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
Why are you here?

334
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,880
Do you know how dangerous it is here?

335
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,080
I'm on a mission.

336
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,880
Why are you here?

337
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,280
Why are you yelling?

338
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,880
Why are you yelling at me?

339
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,880
Do you know how difficult it is for me to come here?

340
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,680
I finally got the car.

341
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Then I'll tell you

342
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,080
how to get here and go back.

343
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,880
Captain Zong.

344
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Sister-in-law finally came here.

345
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,080
How about you stay with her?

346
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Do your job.

347
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,280
Yes.

348
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:22,880
Tong Xing.

349
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,480
Yes.

350
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,080
Captain.

351
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,880
What's wrong with you?

352
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Can't you talk to me?

353
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,080
Yang Yang.

354
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
You shouldn't stay here.

355
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,680
It's dangerous.

356
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,080
Go back first.

357
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,880
Yin Deng.

358
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,480
Yes.

359
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,680
Take Yang Yang out.

360
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,880
Yes.

361
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,680
Let's go, sister-in-law.

362
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,880
Sister-in-law.

363
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,680
Sister-in-law.

364
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,480
Go back to your position.

365
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,480
Yes.

366
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,880
Sister-in-law.

367
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
What's wrong?

368
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
What are you thinking about?

369
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
I'm just asking.

370
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,480
Is it related to the department?

371
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,080
Is your material okay?

372
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
Look at your material.

373
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,880
My material is definitely okay.

374
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,080
Don't change the topic.

375
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,080
Is it related to the department?

376
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,880
Yang Yang.

377
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,680
Yang Yang.

378
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,480
Sister-in-law.

379
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,680
Why are you here?

380
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
Sister-in-law.

381
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,480
What's wrong?

382
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,080
Who bullied you?

383
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,880
What's wrong?

384
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,280
Sister-in-law didn't tell the team.

385
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,880
So she came to the disaster relief scene.

386
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,880
She was punished by the team.

387
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
She was punished by the team.

388
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,280
I see.

389
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,080
You go back first.

390
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,680
Okay.

391
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
I'm leaving, brother Hai.

392
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,680
Sister-in-law.

393
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,680
The team is worried about you.

394
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,680
Don't take it to heart.

395
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,880
I'm going back first.

396
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,480
Bye.

397
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,880
Little princess.

398
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,080
I feel wronged.

399
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,680
They are all straight men.

400
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,880
They don't understand the style.

401
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,680
I'm sorry.

402
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
I'm sorry.

403
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,680
I'm sorry.

404
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
I'm sorry.

405
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,080
But I admire you.

406
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,480
How did you find this place?

407
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
I took your bus.

408
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,880
Have some water.

409
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,480
Listen to me.

410
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,080
But look at this place.

411
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,880
This is the real disaster relief scene.

412
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,080
Not your idol theater.

413
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,280
And you are married.

414
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,680
You are married.

415
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,280
You are not alone.

416
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,480
You have to think from the perspective of the royal family.

417
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,280
Don't you miss him?

418
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,480
But he is a soldier.

419
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,680
He has to do what he should do.

420
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,280
Hai.

421
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Bring the materials.

422
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,280
I'll go.

423
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
I'm sorry.

424
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Look.

425
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,080
These are the materials we took the other day.

426
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,480
These are all soldiers who risked their lives.

427
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,320
There may be no

428
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,320
trace of them here.

429
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,880
And no dead bodies.

430
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
But they

431
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,680
must be in a more dangerous place.

432
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,080
Come in and see

433
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,480
my new home in Wenzhou.

434
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
See how it is.

435
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,480
I have Hai here.

436
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,680
Hai police.

437
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
No.

438
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,280
If I didn't call you and ask you,

439
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,480
I wouldn't know you moved your work and home to Wenzhou.

440
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,280
I just want to wait

441
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,480
until I settle down here

442
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,880
and report to you.

443
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,080
I'm afraid you'll worry.

444
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,080
Sit.

445
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,280
I think

446
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,480
you are determined

447
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,080
to keep it a secret.

448
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,480
Your son is unreliable.

449
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,080
And your wife is more stubborn.

450
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,080
She left you behind.

451
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,880
Where is she?

452
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,080
Where did she go?

453
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,480
Mom, you can't say that.

454
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,680
We are living together now.

455
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
It's not wrong, right?

456
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,480
Yes.

457
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,680
It's not wrong for us to live together.

458
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,280
Why didn't she go to you?

459
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,280
Why did you come to her?

460
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,480
She has a career.

461
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,880
You don't have a career.

462
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,080
Son.

463
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,680
Tell me the truth.

464
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,480
Did she encourage you

465
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,280
to move your work to Wenzhou?

466
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,480
I'll tell you the truth.

467
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,680
I moved my work to Wenzhou

468
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,480
because I wanted to.

469
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,480
I don't believe it.

470
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
I think

471
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,480
you don't even want your mom.

472
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,480
You said that.

473
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,680
I won't leave you

474
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,080
wherever I go.

475
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,280
Don't lie.

476
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,480
I'm not lying.

477
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,480
I came to Wenzhou

478
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,880
to ask Wang Chen

479
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,480
to have a baby as soon as possible.

480
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,680
You mean

481
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,880
you came to Wenzhou

482
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,880
to have a baby?

483
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,480
Have you discussed it?

484
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,680
Yes.

485
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,480
I knew it.

486
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
I'm not young anymore.

487
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,080
I should have a baby.

488
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,880
Wang Chen is healthy.

489
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,080
It's not a problem.

490
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,880
But

491
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,880
he needs to be well-treated.

492
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,680
You must take care of him.

493
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,880
Are you happy now?

494
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
You're not angry

495
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,280
about my transfer, right?

496
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,680
You said so.

497
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,280
If I'm angry again,

498
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,280
I'll be unreasonable.

499
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,280
My mom

500
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,480
is the most reasonable.

501
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,880
But

502
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
you two

503
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,080
need to hurry up.

504
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,880
Don't fool your mom.

505
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,280
I won't.

506
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,680
I'll go to see the kitchen.

507
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,280
Hurry up.

508
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,080
This is the kitchen.

509
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,480
There are two rooms inside.

510
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,480
Let's go to the kitchen.

511
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,880
Okay.

512
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,080
Have you found out

513
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,680
about the email?

514
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,480
No.

515
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,680
It's hard to find out.

516
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,680
How about

517
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,680
I find a professional

518
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,280
and try it?

519
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,280
No need.

520
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,080
Okay.

521
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,080
I'll think of something.

522
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,480
Don't

523
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,680
worry about it.

524
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,680
Yang Yang.

525
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,080
Mom is coming in.

526
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,880
You're still angry?

527
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,880
Aren't you hungry?

528
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,680
Okay.

529
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,280
It's your fault.

530
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,280
But Zong Qing said you're not wronged.

531
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,880
Mom, you also said that.

532
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,680
You also said that.

533
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,880
Zong Qing said I was wronged.

534
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,080
You all said that.

535
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
I've said it many times.

536
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,080
I didn't go there to play.

537
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,480
We all know you care about Zong Qing.

538
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,680
You didn't go there to play.

539
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,080
But you need to

540
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,080
have a time limit.

541
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,680
That's a typhoon.

542
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,680
It's dangerous.

543
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,080
You suddenly ran away.

544
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,480
You make him worried.

545
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,480
Do you think Zong Qing is taking care of you

546
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
or busy with work?

547
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,680
I know the reason.

548
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,080
He had to

549
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,480
scold me in front of so many people.

550
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,880
Do I need to be embarrassed?

551
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,080
It's your fault.

552
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,280
You should be embarrassed.

553
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Besides,

554
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
he just got married.

555
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,480
He needs a time limit.

556
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,080
But Zong Qing came back.

557
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,880
I still have to send him to do

558
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,680
five hundred push-ups.

559
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,080
Let's see if he dares to scold me.

560
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,480
Okay.

561
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,880
I'll make him tired.

562
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,680
Comrades,

563
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
the team is assembled.

564
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
One to twenty people.

565
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,480
Ten to twenty people.

566
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,080
Please give instructions.

567
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,680
Okay.

568
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,280
Yes.

569
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,280
Comrades,

570
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
the team is assembled.

571
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,480
One to twenty people.

572
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,080
Ten to twenty people.

573
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:33,880
Please stand up.

574
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,880
One to twenty people.

575
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,880

You finally met your dad, right?

666
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
Hurry up.

667
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160

Okay.

670
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
You...

671
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
Look at you.

672
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,160
You're so bad at it.

673
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,160
I'm finally home.

674
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,160
Come on in.

675
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
Let's go.

676
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
Come on.

677
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Come on.

678
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
Come on.

679
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,160
Come on.

680
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,160
Come on.

681
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Be careful.

682
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,160
Okay.

683
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
Mom,

684
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
did you sleep well last night?

685
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,160
Can you get used to the weather here?

686
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
I think so.

687
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,160
I couldn't pick you up

688
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,160
after you came to Wenzhou.

689
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,160
No need.

690
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,160
You weren't here when you came.

691
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,160
Yes.

692
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,160
I just saw that we were going to the disaster area.

693
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,160
I was just about to go to the disaster area.

694
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,160
You can't make a scene here.

695
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,160
You can't.

696
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,160
You can't.

697
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,160
You can't.

698
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,160
I'm leaving.

699
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
Bye.

700
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
You have to go.

701
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,160
Go.

702
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
Okay.

703
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
Bye.

704
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,160
Go.

705
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,160
Bye.

706
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,160
Bye.

707
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,160
Bye.

708
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
Bye.

709
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,160
Bye.

710
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,160
Bye.

711
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
Bye.

712
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,160
Bye.

713
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
Bye.

714
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,160
Bye.

715
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Bye.

716
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,160
Bye.

717
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,160
Bye.

718
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,160
You're all back. Don't talk about those things.

719
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,460
Let's talk about something serious now.

720
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,960
You two,

721
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,160
please talk about having a child

722
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,960
on a daily basis.

723
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,560
While I'm still in good health,

724
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,560
I can help you two have more children.

725
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,560
Don't you think so?

726
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,760
Okay, don't worry.

727
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,160
I'm done eating.

728
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,760
You guys eat slowly.

729
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,960
Wang Chen, eat more.

730
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,160
Take care of your health.

731
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,360
Mom, be careful.

732
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,760
Tell mom that we're having a child?

733
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,160
Bai Zi Jian,

734
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,160
you know that the doctor clearly told us

735
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,760
that we can't have children.

736
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,560
The doctor didn't say 100% that we can't.

737
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,560
Bai Zi Jian, you can't lie to her like this.

738
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,160
You're just a big uncle.

739
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,360
You know that I'm happy.

740
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,360
I'm happy for you.

741
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,360
Eat a chicken leg.

742
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,360
Don't think too much.

743
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,960
You're going to break up again, Chen Pai.

744
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,560
Were we at the horse station

745
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,760
and you didn't call her?

746
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,960
Yes.

747
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,760
I called her but she didn't answer.

748
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,560
She called me back but I didn't answer.

749
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,360
This雙鞠躬 talk is really...

750
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,960
It's really annoying.

751
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,360
Is this kid so idle?

752
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,360
Five kilometers.

753
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,360
No.

754
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,360
Hurry up.

755
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,960
No, I just finished practicing.

756
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,760
Three kilometers, okay?

757
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,560
Hurry up.

758
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,360
Tell me.

759
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,960
Did you get anything from the war with Wu Si?

760
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,160
No.

761
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,760
Well, Dad.

762
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,560
I won't talk to Wu Si anymore.

763
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,360
Don't work with us anymore.

764
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,360
No.

765
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,960
Why?

766
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,760
Did Wu Si ask you out?

767
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,760
No.

768
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,360
We're not on the same side.

769
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,760
Let's split up and don't bother each other.

770
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,560
But there must be a reason.

771
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,960
Yes.

772
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,360
Mr. Su, I'm asking you.

773
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,560
This...

774
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,960
I told you.

775
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,360
You didn't listen.

776
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,160
I told you I won't find a soldier.

777
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,760
You have to find one for me.

778
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,760
I said I want an apple.

779
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,960
You have to get me an orange.

780
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,160
Did you listen to me?

781
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,560
Wu Si didn't ask me.

782
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,160
I admit he's good at everything.

783
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,960
But with me,

784
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,560
we can't be together.

785
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,760
Then I'll go ask Wu Si.

786
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,360
It's useless to ask him.

787
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,360
He doesn't know.

788
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,760
It's not his will. It's mine.

789
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,960
Give me your hand.

790
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Come on.

791
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,760
Come on.

792
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,160
Hurry up.

793
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,160
If you keep pushing,

794
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,560
what will happen to me?

795
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,560
My husband won't even listen.

796
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,760
Get ready to sigh.

797
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,160
What?

798
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,760
Huh?

799
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,880
It's more beautiful now

800
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,360
aha

801
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,360
Husband

802
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,040
Look, honey, it's so beautiful

803
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,360
I'm up.

804
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,320
Hello, mom.

805
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,800
Yangyang.

806
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Are you up?

807
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,200
I got up early.

808
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,120
I haven't got up yet.

809
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,200
I can't wake him up.

810
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,480
He just got back.

811
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,200
He's tired.

812
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Let him sleep for a while.

813
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,000
Have you eaten?

814
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,320
No.

815
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,720
I'm going to order take-out later.

816
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,280
Don't always eat take-out.

817
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,040
Learn to cook something yourself.

818
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,120
Take-out is not good.

819
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,600
Cook it yourself.

820
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,200
But I don't know how to cook.

821
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,440
I don't think I can cook.

822
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,240
Yangyang.

823
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,840
You're married now.

824
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,920
You have to learn

825
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,800
to be a good housewife.

826
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,720
Cooking is not that difficult.

827
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
Learn it.

828
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,680
Don't always order take-out.

829
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,840
Yangyang!

830
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,240
Yangyang!

831
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,200
Yangyang!

832
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,280
Yangyang!

833
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,080
Yangyang!

834
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,040
Yangyang...

835
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,080
Yangyang!

836
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,120
Who is it

837
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,160
What's wrong

838
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,560
What's wrong with you

839
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,400
Where's the soup

840
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,640
No

841
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,040
What is this

842
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,480
I just wanted to make you a porridge

843
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,520
Sorry

844
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,080
Then you forget it

845
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,960
I don't know

846
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,360
Aren't you afraid of the kitchen

847
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,400
Husband, sorry

848
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,800
It's good if you're okay

849
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,520
Agency

850
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,160
Hard work

851
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,080
Good next

852
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400
I'm a fool

853
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
The long road is slow

854
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,400
But it can make me feel at ease

855
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,400
Let everything look romantic

856
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,400
The dream is also so simple

857
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,400
But in your heart

858
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,400
There are more expectations

859
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,400
I really understand

860
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,400
You said love is too slow

861
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,400
But your eyes gave me the answer

862
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,400
Courage

863
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,400
All the heart can meet you

864
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,400
It's a coincidence

865
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,400
Thank you for waking up

866
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,400
The once weak courage

867
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,400
Let everything happen by chance

868
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,400
Let all the burdens become a burden

869
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,400
Open the door of time

870
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,400
The sea of people can't separate us

871
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,400
You are waiting for the heart to warm up

872
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,400
In the memory, why don't you answer me

873
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,400
The time I hate is not enough

874
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,400
I still have the memories of love

875
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,400
I don't want to take it back

876
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,400
Courage

877
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
All the heart can meet you

878
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,400
It's a coincidence

879
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,400
Thank you for being by my side

880
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,400
The bright snow and the dark night

881
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,400
The world is getting bigger and lonely

882
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,400
Only standing by your side

883
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,400
I feel warm in my heart
