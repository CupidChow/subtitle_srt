00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Honey,

4
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
you look very energetic today.

5
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm fine.

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Are you feeling unwell?

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No.

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What's wrong with you today?

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let me see your hand.

10
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm fine.

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No, you...

12
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Honey, don't move.

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Sit down and listen to me.

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I have something to tell you.

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
During the mission,

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I was caught by a little thief.

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And then

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
the other party might have a virus.

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Did you get tested?

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm not sure

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
if I can get tested.

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Did you get tested?

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm waiting for the result.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Did you report to the army?

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The army arranged for me to get tested.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The Brigadier and the Commissar

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
forced me to rest at home.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So,

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I think we should

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
keep a distance for now.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You sleep on the bed tonight.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll sleep on the sofa.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll stay for one night.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll go to the hotel tomorrow.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Did you forget I'm a medical student?

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let me help you with your research.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
As for the cancer...

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Don't say it. I know everything.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I've checked it.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why are you hiding when you've checked it?

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Aren't you just suspecting me now?

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Even if I do,

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll face it with you.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll be with you all the time.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll be with you.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll be with you.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't hide.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Mr. Han.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I've checked the case you asked me to.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Nothing is wrong.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But,

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
there's one thing that's very strange.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What is it?

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The biggest

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
remote-sail fishing boat in our company,

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Bo Xing,

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
has passed by

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Atoka Company

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
before you officially took over the company.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Atoka Company?

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Didn't Luo Man take it?

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes.

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Bo Xing has already found the sea of the ship.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And we'll get some water as soon as possible.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Hello?

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What?

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I have something to ask you.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
There was a remote-sail fishing boat

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
in our company before.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's called Bo Xing.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why did it pass by

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Atoka Company

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
before I took over the company?

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What's so strange about that?

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Your brother and I have quit our jobs.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We should at least

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
give our partners an explanation.

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
They've asked us

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
to take this boat as compensation.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Then why are you two still in Luo Man?

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Your brother and I

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
are handling this matter right now.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Once everything is done,

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
we'll go back to Hong Kong.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Dad.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The company has given it to him.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What else does he want?

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Your brother is not sure about it.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He doesn't know

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
if we'll be able to do this or not.

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He's also worried about us.

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Come back.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Mr. Han, what's the matter?

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Why did you come to me?

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I have a few questions

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
to ask you.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You know that I've been

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
chasing you all this time.

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But when you don't need

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
my help,

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
you never think of me.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So I want to know

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
what you think

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
of me.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Mr. Han, I...

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Mr. Han, I...

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
In your heart,

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm just a Mr. Han.

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You don't want anything I give you.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You only want Wu Si.

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Actually, you know very well

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
that I can give you

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
everything Wu Si can give you.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And I'll give you

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
more than he can.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But I can give him.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Wu Si can't give it to you.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So you can tell me

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
what you want.

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't need to tell you.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Because I want everything.

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I can tell you

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
what I want.

128
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And Mr. Han,

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I hope we can

130
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
keep a distance.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll get engaged to Wu Si Jin.

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'll leave you alone.

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let me finish.

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You know that

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I like you.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But I also know

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
that you're not going to

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
like me.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why?

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Because of our family's bad things.

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But I've told you

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
that I'm in charge

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
of managing

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Changzhou Group.

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll definitely create

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
a clean Changzhou Group.

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But I hope that

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
you can also participate

149
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
in the whole process

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and witness it with me.

151
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay?

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I believe in your promise.

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But that's your

154
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Changzhou Group's business.

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I've made it clear

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
just now.

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Please confess.

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Han Yun Hang, let me go.

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's okay.

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
When did you come back?

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Go home first.

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll see Mr. Han off.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Mr. Han,

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
don't you need me to see you off?

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Tang Xin said that you two are engaged.

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Is that right?

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yes.

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So,

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
don't look for my girlfriend

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
at night.

171
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But I can give her something better.

172
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I can also

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
give her something

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
that you can't give her.

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What can you give her?

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Like today,

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
did you suddenly leave

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and suddenly appear?

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Tang Xin can wait for you

180
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
once, twice,

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
ten times, twenty times.

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But what about you?

183
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Do you want her to wait for you

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
for thousands of times?

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Even if Tang Xin is willing to wait,

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
what about you?

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Are you so at ease?

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Do you know

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
what her computer screen

190
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
is?

191
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
In the world,

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
it's a screenshot of a memory.

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It has some words on it.

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Wu Si came back today.

195
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
On the days when you were not around,

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
she would stare at the computer screen every day.

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Counting,

198
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
reading,

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and waiting

200
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
for you to come back.

201
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But if one day,

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
in case,

203
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
you can't come back,

204
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
what about her?

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Her rest of her life

206
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
should be ruined.

207
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Have you thought about it?

208
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Thank you for letting me know

209
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
how much she loves me.

210
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What about you?

211
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Do you love her so much?

212
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
If so,

213
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
shouldn't you think about her?

214
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Tang Xin is still young.

215
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
She can have more

216
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
and better choices.

217
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
As the saying goes,

218
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
if you love her,

219
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
you shouldn't let her rest of her life

220
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
be ruined.

221
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Tang Xin.

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Why didn't you go up?

223
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I was waiting for you.

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Han Yu Hang left.

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Did anything happen to you?

226
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No.

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Don't worry.

228
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Are you okay?

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm fine.

230
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm fine.

231
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm fine.

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm fine.

233
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm fine.

234
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm fine.

235
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm fine.

236
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
When did you come back?

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Why didn't you tell me?

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let's go upstairs.

239
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm not going up.

240
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I have something to do in the army.

241
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm here to see you.

242
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What's going on?

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You haven't seen me for so long.

244
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Why are you not happy at all?

245
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You don't know

246
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
how I've been suffering these days.

247
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I even changed my computer screen.

248
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What's wrong with you?

249
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What's wrong?

250
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What's wrong with you?

251
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Wait.

252
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Wu Si.

253
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What's wrong with you?

254
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What happened to you?

255
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I've thought it over.

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,840
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,800
I was too considerate.

258
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,240
I didn't think it through.

259
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,600
What do you mean?

260
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,160
You mean

261
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,640
you've proposed to her

262
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,800
and you're not going to marry her?

263
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,840
You're regretting it?

264
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,720
Is that so?

265
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,840
I'm sorry.

266
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,200
Do you know how much I've

267
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,000
challenged myself

268
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
since I was with you?

269
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,800
All my friends know that

270
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,960
I've said it a long time ago

271
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,400
that I, Tang Xin,

272
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,760
will never find a man.

273
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,720
But I met you.

274
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,240
You were busy in the army.

275
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,600
I was waiting for you.

276
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
You were in the defense.

277
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,600
I was waiting for you.

278
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,360
You were in the drill.

279
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,320
I was waiting for you, too.

280
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,040
I know that I'm with you.

281
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,200
I just want to face it.

282
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,080
I can endure it.

283
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,480
I can tolerate it.

284
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
I can hold you back.

285
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,520
But I hope you understand that

286
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,520
I did all of this

287
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,040
because I love you.

288
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,600
I'm sorry.

289
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,680
I don't want to hear your apology.

290
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,720
I just want to ask you one question.

291
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,040
Before you left,

292
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,200
did you still want my answer

293
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
for the marriage

294
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,080
you proposed to me?

295
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,560
I think

296
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,800
we should

297
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,280
separate for a while.

298
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,520
I want to sort out myself.

299
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,560
Goodbye

300
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,440
Goodbye

301
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,720
When I travel the mountains alone

302
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,600
I only know where the distant place is

303
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,000
Why did you leave

304
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,780
Have some rest

305
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,400
Tianxiotu

306
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,720
Honey

307
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,240
I think

308
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,440
it's better to be like this.

309
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,120
The doctors have told me

310
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,880
that we should keep

311
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,320
the distance between us.

312
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,240
Do you know

313
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,960
what they mean?

314
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,720
Didn't you destroy the threaded μεs?

315
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,800
You can't have this.

316
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,160
I don't want others around me to suffer like you.

317
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,400
I just want to do what I want.

318
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,920
She is different from me from the way you talk to her.

319
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,080
Why are you here?

320
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
I just walked by.

321
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,280
You can leave me alone now.

322
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,920
Surprise?

323
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,280
I'm so surprised, honey.

324
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,240
I was almost scared to death by you.

325
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,200
It's a celebration.

326
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,440
You're so great.

327
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
You're so great.

328
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,600
So great.

329
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,640
Enough.

330
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,200
Let go.

331
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,240
You'll fall down.

332
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,720
Let go.

333
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,680
Okay.

334
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,240
Are you okay?

335
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,600
You're really a special force.

336
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,680
You didn't even make a sound when you walked.

337
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,480
Let's go.

338
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,480
Are you done?

339
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,040
You didn't even treat yourself

340
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,400
with any disease.

341
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,440
I've told you

342
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,480
all the lies, right?

343
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,840
Didn't you take the painkiller

344
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,720
in time?

345
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,160
You can control the cancer now.

346
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,880
Your wife is a doctor.

347
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,680
She won't lie to you.

348
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,760
What if...

349
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,040
If there's really a chance,

350
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,720
we'll treat you as we should.

351
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,480
Trust the doctor and science.

352
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,480
Okay?

353
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,160
David,

354
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:22,200
I must be a major

355
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,920
sixteenrock expert on the Professor.

356
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,160
A person who can pick guitars

357
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,240
only involves best friends.

358
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,280
Then who should I find?

359
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,080
Go find Wu Si.

360
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,560
Wu Si proposed to you.

361
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,800
I'm not going to let you go.

362
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,000
He's regretful.

363
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,680
How is Wu Si?

364
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,920
My captain's external injuries

365
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,000
have been dealt with.

366
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,840
But the more serious

367
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,440
is his emotional problem.

368
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,760
Qiu Xiao.

369
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,240
outsiders killed Wu Si

370
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
I wouldn't know

371
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,760
when he would have

372
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:20,740
to

373
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,980
stay outside.

374
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,000
We just spoke to the clients,

375
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,240
said that

376
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,120
the resource

377
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,840
to eliminate the possibility of infection.

378
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,760
Liu Zhong.

379
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,480
Mr. Liu.

380
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,360
Mr. Wang.

381
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,880
What's going on with Mr. Wu?

382
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,240
Mr. Liu, don't worry.

383
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,720
I'll ask Mr. Wu to find you now.

384
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,520
I'll go to him.

385
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,720
Tell me.

386
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,680
Where is he now?

387
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,800
He's in the hospital.

388
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,600
Surprise.

389
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,480
Xin.

390
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,360
Can't you see me with this sunglasses?

391
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,560
Why are you wearing sunglasses in the daytime?

392
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,920
If you see it,

393
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,400
can you give us a reaction?

394
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,600
Hurry up and share the engagement with everyone.

395
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,200
Share.

396
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,960
Share.

397
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:02,720
Share.

398
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
Thank you.

399
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,320
I'm so happy.

400
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,200
But...

401
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,480
I may let you down.

402
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,000
What do you mean?

403
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,960
I mean...

404
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,280
I'm so confused.

405
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,160
I'm sorry.

406
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,720
I let you down for nothing.

407
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,240
Tang Xin, don't be angry.

408
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,120
You can't joke about this.

409
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Or else,

410
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,200
you'll be too embarrassed.

411
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,200
You did a good job.

412
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,320
Let's split up.

413
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,320
Don't waste it.

414
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,400
Tang Xin.

415
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,760
Mr. Liu.

416
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,880
I'm not here to ask about the crime.

417
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,960
This relationship

418
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,360
is between two people.

419
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,280
You must have your own reasons.

420
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,280
But I want to know

421
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,640
what your reason is.

422
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,360
Can you still go back on your word

423
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,160
after you're married?

424
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,480
She...

425
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,200
She should have a better life.

426
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,000
Nonsense.

427
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,200
Dude.

428
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,960
What does your discriminatory behavior mean?

429
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,240
I don't believe

430
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,240
you did that.

431
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,400
It didn't lever you to be an finalist.

432
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,120
I was lucky.

433
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,240
I realize that

434
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,960
divorce is far from the same King of Chess.

435
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,040
Thus, I Aber twenty-nine years from right after marriage.

436
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,440
I would like my mother make decisions about

437
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,240
herив Emma's child.

438
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,440
I have.

439
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,160
I agree.

440
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,480
You shouldn't be so serious.

441
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,960
Women do not societies.

442
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,960
Women morning and evening

443
00:24:47,960 --> 00:25:00,140
Is the

444
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,540
All right

445
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,800
Better

446
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,120
Large

447
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,460
Big

448
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,660
Okay

449
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
I understand you as a soldier.

450
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,440
But as a father,

451
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,600
I want to tell you

452
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
that my daughter

453
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,800
married a soldier as a military wife.

454
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,240
She knew what she was going to face.

455
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,680
It's difficult to tell the difference between a man and a woman,

456
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,680
especially a soldier.

457
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,480
Don't take yourself as the so-called burden

458
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,800
and leave it to the one you love most.

459
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
If you do that,

460
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,560
you're not a soldier.

461
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,360
Captain Wang.

462
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,880
Dr. Miao.

463
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,320
How is it?

464
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,960
It's okay.

465
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,360
Move a little. Let me see.

466
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,400
A little higher.

467
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,480
Not bad.

468
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,360
Come on, sit.

469
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,680
Do you feel the pain when you walk?

470
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,560
How about the pain in the stomach?

471
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,600
It's a little bit if you train for a long time.

472
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,640
It's better than I thought.

473
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,440
There are not many cases

474
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,440
that recover as quickly as you.

475
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,880
Dr. Yang,

476
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,440
if I continue to strengthen the recovery training,

477
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,520
when can I return to the Reconnaissance Team?

478
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,760
I can tell you clearly.

479
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,320
You have recovered to this state.

480
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,960
It's a miracle.

481
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,440
Even if you strengthen the recovery training,

482
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,200
you can only recover to the normal life level.

483
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,920
It's almost impossible to achieve the physical requirements of the Reconnaissance Team.

484
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,960
Chen.

485
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,160
Chen, why are you in a daze?

486
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,520
It's so windy.

487
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,920
Don't catch a cold.

488
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,880
Come on.

489
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,000
Go to train.

490
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,560
Go.

491
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,680
I'm a little tired today.

492
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,440
I don't want to train.

493
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,120
How can that work?

494
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,840
Although you recover quickly,

495
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,080
you can't relax.

496
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,360
The recovery training golden period

497
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,000
is only a few months.

498
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,680
If you miss it,

499
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,480
it's too late to recover.

500
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,800
Go. Go. Go.

501
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,280
Mom, the doctor told me

502
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,840
that no matter how much I strengthen the training,

503
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,640
my body can only recover to the normal life level.

504
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,440
I can't go back to the Reconnaissance Team.

505
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,680
Hello, mom. What's wrong?

506
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
You're a kid.

507
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,920
Why didn't you tell us about Zongqing?

508
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,240
You all know it.

509
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,840
Your dad knew it from Wang Lang.

510
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,320
You kept it from us.

511
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,760
He just came back.

512
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,280
And he's waiting for the result.

513
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,680
I don't want you to worry about him.

514
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
We're your parents.

515
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,480
How can we not worry?

516
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,800
Dad, I'm going to work.

517
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,760
I won't talk to you.

518
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,240
Don't ask Zongqing.

519
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,480
I'll tell you after I get off work.

520
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,360
Look at this kid.

521
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,760
This kid.

522
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,560
No.

523
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,760
I'll call Zongqing.

524
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,160
Don't ask Zongqing before you hear it.

525
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,640
Wait for him to come back.

526
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,240
The old county chief is looking for you.

527
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,960
Yes.

528
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,240
How's He Tangxin?

529
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,840
Because of Cheng Yuan?

530
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,000
Because of myself.

531
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,080
Okay.

532
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,400
Take this time to have a good chat.

533
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,320
I've told you.

534
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,880
Three times a week.

535
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,720
Mental training.

536
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,680
Captain, I don't need it.

537
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,160
It's not up to you.

538
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,200
I'm not going to do it.

539
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,080
Take those things in your head.

540
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:45,840
Throw them away.

541
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,560
Yes.

542
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,560
The inspection time is only five minutes.

543
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,120
You can talk to him.

544
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,400
Okay.

545
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,000
Then later you can talk to him.

546
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,680
I'll feel good.

547
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:20,960
Cheng Yuan.

548
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,440
Are you still asleep?

549
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,960
Get up.

550
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,240
You're the best gun in my life.

551
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,560
Stop being like this.

552
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,840
Why are you taking a nap here?

553
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,800
I'll give you two days to sleep.

554
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,200
I'll come to see you in two days.

555
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,920
You have to get out of bed and get ready for the battle.

556
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,280
Cheng Yuan!

557
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,760
Every time I call you,

558
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,080
I haven't said what I'm going to do yet.

559
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,560
You'll answer me. I understand.

560
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,400
You're the best gun of the Brigadier.

561
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,880
You're also the most reliable soldier I've ever had.

562
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Very naive.

563
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,920
Do you remember when we first met?

564
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,320
We were the same age as King Yi Nan.

565
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,560
Time flies.

566
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,920
Zong Qing said that

567
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,960
I was like a bird's mother every time.

568
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,320
Really.

569
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,360
I was nervous every time I was on duty.

570
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,560
I was afraid that you were sick and hurt.

571
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,680
But...

572
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,680
You're the one who brought me into this world.

573
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,920
Stop it.

574
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,600
Don't say those useless things.

575
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,240
Brigadier.

576
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,480
Cheng Yuan was handed over to me by you.

577
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,400
He's your best sniper.

578
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,160
I didn't protect your best gun.

579
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,360
I didn't do it.

580
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,280
No.

581
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,440
Brigadier.

582
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,400
Cheng Yuan.

583
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,760
Cheng Yuan, can you hear me?

584
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,880
Brigadier, no.

585
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,120
Cheng Yuan.

586
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,800
Cheng Yuan, can you hear me?

587
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,120
Cheng Yuan.

588
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,400
The test is over. Get out.

589
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,640
Cheng Yuan.

590
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,480
Get out.

591
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,040
Cheng Yuan.

592
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,600
Cheng Yuan.

593
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,120
Can you hear me?

594
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,120
Cheng Yuan.

595
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,320
Cheng Yuan.

596
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,080
Listen to me.

597
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,040
I hope you can stay awake.

598
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,640
Can you do it?

599
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,000
Mom and Dad.

600
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,040
I told you.

601
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,600
Now,

602
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,440
I'm fine.

603
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,760
I'm waiting for the result.

604
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,680
Zong Qing is in a good mood.

605
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,760
We've made a deal.

606
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,840
No matter what the result is,

607
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,440
we'll face it together.

608
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,720
Who do you think

609
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,160
he's messing with?

610
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,720
How can he be wronged like this?

611
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,920
Mom, what are you doing?

612
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,000
You and Dad

613
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,000
have always taught me to be strong.

614
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Now,

615
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,800
I'm a qualified military sister-in-law.

616
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,040
We're prepared.

617
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,000
Zong Qing is strong

618
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,560
because he thinks so.

619
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,760
He's a qualified soldier.

620
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,360
Good for him.

621
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,200
Yang Yang has grown up.

622
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,320
He's a good man.

623
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,760
The situation is stable.

624
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,280
He'll be in the hospital

625
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,040
for 24 hours.

626
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,360
If everything is normal,

627
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,960
he can be transferred to an ordinary ward.

628
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,440
When are you going to

629
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,040
tell him about this?

630
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,640
The bandage

631
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,720
will be taken off for him tonight.

632
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,080

633
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,180

638
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,360
still nonsense.

639
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,560
Come in.

640
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,560
Ru Si.

641
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,400
is a veteran of the Blue Team.

642
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,600
Don't you think

643
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,760
before he was protecting you,

644
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,400
he didn't know what kind of danger

645
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,920
he would be in?

646
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,200
I don't know.

647
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,800
You don't know?

648
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,440
You've been on this mission for so many years.

649
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,680
You told me you didn't know?

650
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,320
That's the battlefield.

651
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,200
It's a place where accidents

652
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,960
and countless accidents happen at any time.

653
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,240
There's no one on the battlefield.

654
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,920
It's all your fault.

655
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,360
You don't need to

656
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,040
take up responsibility.

657
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,880
Just be lazy.

658
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,640
Yes.

659
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,520
Yes. What are you talking about?

660
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,880
You lost your job?

661
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,080
Stand on points!

662
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,760
Dong Qing has got off a leave.

663
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,120
Is there any reason?

664
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
His arm was lodged

665
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,000
when he was 실 Excuse Man,

666
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,240
a small mouth.

667
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,000
Nothing has happened.

668
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,960
Huashang's drug addict

669
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,960
may be a cancer patient.

670
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,080
The test report hasn't been released yet.

671
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,040
The virus is still in the incubation period.

672
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,160
Do you blame yourself?

673
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,160
I blame myself too.

674
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,080
But is it useful?

675
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
The same accident

676
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,520
may happen in the future.

677
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,920
What are you going to do?

678
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,880
You're not afraid to go?

679
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,440
You know the consequences, right?

680
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,200
Get out of here.

681
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,680
Listen to me.

682
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,680
During this period,

683
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,280
you should rest.

684
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,520
You should be trained.

685
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,920
Don't run far from the boat.

686
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,800
Stay away from Zong Qingyue.

687
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,320
Yes.

688
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,400
Get out of here.

689
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,080

690
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,880

Montops

693
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,840
You're thinner.

694
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,320
You're thinner.

695
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,200
You haven't had a good meal.

696
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,040
Come on in.

697
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:38,680
Come on.

698
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,800
Did you just come back

699
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,960
and tell Tang Xin?

700
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,560
When will you meet her?

701
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,200
Who?

702
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,160
Tang Xin's parents.

703
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,120
Silly boy.

704
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,560

you've made.

707
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,080
I'll be back

708
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,280
after you've made the engagement.

709
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,920
Right, Mom?

710
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,840
Mom,

711
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,640
why are you in a hurry?

712
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,880
I'm not in a hurry.

713
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,240
There's a call.

00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,360
She's busy four hours.

715
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,480
She hasn't called me.

716
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,160
Let's call her later.

717
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,320
Who's that?

718
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,120
Whose phone?

719
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,960
Why don't you answer it?

720
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,120
It's nothing.

721
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,840
I'll talk to you later.

722
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,920
Who did it?

How long are you going to hide from me?

730
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,640
Is it so difficult to talk to me?

731
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,400

I was impulsive when I proposed to you.

741
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,160
We didn't prepare well.

742
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,240
We need to think about it.

743
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,480
