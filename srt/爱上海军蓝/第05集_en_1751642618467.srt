1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,920
I'll tell you the truth.

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,160
The truth of the truth

81
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,360
is my job.

82
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,840
And

83
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,280
you may not know

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,720
what happened that day.

85
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,640
Actually, since I was a kid,

86
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,240
my dad and I

87
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,400
went on many shipwrecks.

88
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,880
I've never been

89
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,960
so scared that day.

90
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,320
So I can't help but care.

91
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,840
I can't help but go through it.

92
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,640
If you care

93
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,800
about this,

94
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,600
I can tell you responsibly

95
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,240
that he is safe and sound.

96
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,560
You've been asking me questions.

97
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,920
I also want to ask you one.

98
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,320
Why did you go out to sea that day?

99
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,040
I...

100
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
I actually received

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,240
an anonymous email.

102
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,040
The other party claimed that

103
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,640
someone was stealing

104
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,480
the illegal goods.

105
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,040
But he didn't have any evidence

106
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,760
to prove it.

107
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,920
So he wanted me to testify

108
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,200
to stop this illegal theft.

109
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
What a coincidence.

110
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,040
Xin Xin also went out

111
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,080
a few days ago.

112
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,120
She was in Dayan Jiao.

113
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,160
Did you watch the news?

114
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,000
Did she go on the news?

115
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,240
What news?

116
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,800
It's just online news.

117
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,600
I don't watch online news.

118
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Your army comrades

119
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,240
went there.

120
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Didn't you hear about it?

121
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,840
Well,

122
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,640
it's not allowed to discuss it.

123
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,440
I don't know.

124
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,240
I don't know.

125
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,120
I don't know.

126
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,920
I don't know.

127
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,640
I don't know.

128
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,920
It's not allowed to discuss it.

129
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,880
Just ask.

130
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,120
Mainly,

131
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,640
I don't like to ask questions.

132
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,720
I've been asking questions since I was a kid.

133
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,520
I don't know how to answer.

134
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,880
Zong Qing.

135
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,640
Here.

136
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,320
What's the matter?

137
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,880
Tell me the truth.

138
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,280
Is it because of the probability that you can't say it

139
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,600
or someone doesn't allow you to say it?

140
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,160
I'll be honest.

141
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,680
I don't like to ask questions since I was a kid.

142
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,280
Do you have a rule

143
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,560
that good deeds can't be kept in secret?

144
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,360
Otherwise,

145
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,920
why can't you admit it if you saved Xin Xin?

146
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,840
Save Xin Xin?

147
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,280
What happened to Xin Xin?

148
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,800
What happened to her?

149
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:08,780
It's me.

150
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,100
Place the hood on the back of the car and close the door.

151
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,180
Absolutely no planning for any accident.

152
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,880
Go.

153
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,440
Go.

154
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,400
Sit down.

155
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,400
Thank you.

156
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,280
Wait a minute.

157
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,240
They'll be here soon.

158
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,400
They?

159
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,880
Yes.

160
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,200
The people you want to interview.

161
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,720
I thought I was going to interview you.

162
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,760
You want to sneak out again?

163
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,760
No.

164
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,320
Our Blue Team has two famous dramas,

165
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,080
The King of the Dwarfs.

166
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,280
Don't you want to interview them?

167
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,320
The King of the Dwarfs?

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,040
Are they female soldiers?

169
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,560
Yes.

170
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,320
Report.

171
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,040
Good.

172
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,720
Come in.

173
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,840
Let me introduce.

174
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,040
Captain Zhong, Wang Chen.

175
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,720
Instructor, Jiang Yajie.

176
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,240
He's a reporter from the Minkhwa Network.

177
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,880
Tang Xin.

178
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,000
Hello.

179
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,680
Hello.

180
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,240
Hello.

181
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,240
You can talk first.

182
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,640
Ms. Tang, please sit.

183
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,800
Captain Wang,

184
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,840
I just heard from Captain Wu

185
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,200
that you also took part in the rescue operation

186
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,680
that Dayan gave.

187
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,720
Yes.

188
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,320
But I think

189
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,480
you've already interviewed

190
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,840
the captain and the members.

191
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
We know

192
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,200
basically the same situation.

193
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,680
Then let's not talk about the big talk today.

194
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,960
Let's talk about female soldiers.

195
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
There's nothing special about female soldiers.

196
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,240
There's no gender distinction on the battlefield.

197
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,640
We are all members of the Navy.

198
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,440
We are trained in the same special combat.

199
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,320
Wang Chen's professional quality

200
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,560
is also very good for male teammates.

201
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,000
The first person to be blamed by a male girl.

202
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,320
Captain Wang,

203
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,840
how many years have you been in the army?

204
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,120
Eleven years.

205
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,960
May I ask

206
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,200
if you are married?

207
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,840
Yes.

208
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,120
You've been in the army for so long.

209
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,200
You're on the front line again.

210
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,600
Your lover...

211
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,320
I'm sorry.

212
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,040
I can't talk too much about my personal matters at home.

213
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,600
I'm sorry.

214
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,440
I have to answer the phone in the team.

216
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,040
Okay.

217
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,640
Don't mind it.

218
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,520
Wang Chen,

219
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,880
it's not that he doesn't want to cooperate with the interview.

220
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,840
It's personal matters.

221
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,240
He really doesn't want to talk about it.

222
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,920
I'm sorry.

223
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,680
I'm sorry.

224
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,400
I'm sorry.

225
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,600
He really doesn't want to talk about it.

226
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,520
Recently,

227
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,200
he is also thinking about his family's affairs.

228
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,640
He and his lover are always on the same side.

229
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,400
They have a good relationship.

230
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,200
But,

231
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,680
they never have a child.

232
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,960
Reporter Tang,

233
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,120
you said you wanted to talk about female soldiers.

234
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,880
Do you want to hear

235
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
my psychological words?

236
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,800
Of course.

237
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,960
I just said

238
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,480
there is no gender difference on the battlefield.

239
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,640
We are trained

240
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,000
like male soldiers.

241
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,760
But I didn't tell you

242
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,320
that in order to complete

243
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,200
the same task as male soldiers,

244
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,880
female soldiers need to break through many physical limitations.

245
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,200
The responsibility is there.

246
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,720
No female soldier

247
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,040
will feel wronged by training.

248
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,440
But training

249
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,800
is not everything in life.

250
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,160
After training,

251
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
I will miss my family

252
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,880
and my husband.

253
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,920
As a soldier,

254
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,720
I should do my best

255
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,600
for the mission.

256
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,160
But I am also

257
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,840
a wife

258
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,440
and daughter.

259
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,720
Until now,

260
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,680
it's hard for me

261
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,160
to balance these roles.

262
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,400
Captain Wang,

263
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,360
although I have never been a soldier,

264
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,320
I am a woman.

265
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,920
I can understand your difficulty.

266
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,800
I can't solve

267
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,000
your marriage problem.

268
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,640
But if you are in a bad mood

269
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,200
and want to talk to someone,

270
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,800
you can call me.

271
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,320
I will call you anytime.

272
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,080
Thank you.

273
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,640
Captain Chen, hello.

274
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,960
A lady is looking for you outside.

275
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:53,920
Mr. Tang,

276
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'll go out and have a look.

277
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,240
You should do the procedures here.

278
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,720
OK.

279
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,720
I am Wang Chen.

280
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,520
May I ask who you are?

281
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,200
I am Mr. Bai's colleague.

282
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,720
I helped him get something.

283
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,000
So I have your address.

284
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,960
You must be Luo Tong.

285
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,960
Just tell me what's wrong.

286
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,800
What's the matter?

287
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,760
Sister, you misunderstood.

288
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,280
I am not here to make trouble.

289
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,280
I just want to meet Mr. Bai.

290
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,440
Mr. Bai is really nice.

291
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,200
If you really love him,

292
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,240
you shouldn't have to

293
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,840
let him live alone.

294
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,920
It's none of your business

295
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,960
whether I love my husband or not.

296
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
You don't have to

297
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,840
worry about our relationship.

298
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,640
Besides,

299
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,320
you can't stay near the camp.

300
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,400
You'd better go back.

301
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,320
Mr. Tang, I'm sorry.

302
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,560
I won't see you off.

303
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,120
Ms. Tang.

304
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,240
Today is also

305
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,440
Wang Chen's birthday.

306
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,200
Today...

307
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,640
We're going to meet him too.

308
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,040
OK.

309
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,400
May I have your words?

310
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,760
Who are you?

311
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
I am Wang Chen's friend.

312
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,880
I know

313
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,600
a lot about her.

314
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,520
I'd like to know.

315
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,240
Coach, director,

316
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,880
Wang Zhen.

317
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,880
What's wrong?

318
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,680
Did Tang Jing say something

319
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,560
that shouldn't be said

320
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,520
and upset you?

321
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,360
No.

322
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,120
It has nothing to do with Tang.

323
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,640
Tang is a nice person.

324
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,760
So what?

325
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,160
Why are you so upset?

326
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,120
Nothing.

327
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,960
Answer the question.

328
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,520
I saw someone

329
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,320
at the door just now.

330
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,640
I'm in a bad mood.

331
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,960
Who did you meet?

332
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,560
A girl who admires Bai Zi Jian.

333
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,920
She came to see me.

334
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
She's a silly girl.

335
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,440
Tang Xin is also there?

336
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,000
I just sent Tang to the press.

337
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,240
I met her.

338
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,480
What do you want to tell me

339
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,520
about Wang Chen?

340
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,000
How did you know Mr. Bai?

341
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,880
How long have you known him?

342
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,000
We're colleagues.

343
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
He was my

344
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,120
instructor in the internship class.

345
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,120
I didn't know he was married at first.

346
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,760
I followed him to study the subject

347
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,200
and went to the scene with him.

348
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,120
We worked overtime and discussed together.

349
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,440
Mr. Bai is professional

350
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,200
and gentle when he works.

351
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,920
There are many girls in our unit

352
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,880
who like him.

353
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,120
Does Mr. Bai know

354
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,160
that you like him?

355
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,480
What did he say?

356
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,160
He was scared away.

357
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,920
He ran away when he saw us.

358
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,040
I haven't found

359
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,560
a chance to confess to him yet.

360
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,120
He even told us

361
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,600
that he only loves his wife.

362
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,640
He took us as students and children

363
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,240
and advised us to study hard.

364
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,240
I didn't see him for a long time.

365
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,000
He hid when he saw me.

366
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,640
Mr. Bai's attitude

367
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,760
is very clear now.

368
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,280
Why did you run to Wang Chen

369
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,360
in the prison?

370
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,560
I just want to know who Wang Chen is.

371
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,400
I don't believe it.

372
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,120
Mr. Bai always

373
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,640
works for himself.

374
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,080
I thought getting married was his excuse.

375
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,960
I didn't expect Mr. Bai didn't lie to me.

376
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,080
He set me up.

377
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,120
So, I always

378
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,480
thought that

379
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,880
I should divorce Wang Chen answer Suit igle.

380
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,760
But if one day Wang Chen

381
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,800
lez极职

382
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,000
reports his marriage to him.

383
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:30,800
Iedan.

384
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,920
Then he will realize

385
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,680
he is not meant to marry Wang Chen for him.

386
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,560
I'm afraid

387
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,440
I couldn't give him a reasonable words.

388
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,040
Mr. Bai is well- sana.

389
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:40,920
You know what?

390
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,280
He should ask W所

391
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,840
to get a piece of the truth.

392
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,760
W Hollywood

393
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,680
is an art studio.

394
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,880
I only know

395
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,960
that these aunties

396
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,840
share what they know.

397
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,200
All the doctors

398
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,000
came the same day.

399
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,600
Have you heard mansion-mining?

400
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,160
When he selected字mining,

401
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:20,200
he

402
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,720
wasno status

403
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,240
What's the point of telling me this?

404
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,400
Wang Chen is a five-year-old

405
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,840
who is 18 years old.

406
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,200
He was promoted

407
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,080
to the special team step by step.

408
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,040
I asked the reporter where he went.

409
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,640
He went this way.

410
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,440
Okay, thank you.

411
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,840
Do you have anything to tell me?

412
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
What about those presidents

413
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
who have been playing thr иг,

414
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,120
going myself for years

415
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,400
and defending their country?

416
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,040
Go proggessing,

417
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,960
만들 women in the way of power,

418
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,920
and plan straight for years of antibodies.

419
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,880
Do you think perfect

420
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,640
and 好适吗去打这些军人?

421
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,680
You're so busy with work.

422
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,280
And you're taking care of the elderly.

423
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,280
What's wrong with him?

424
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,680
I respect Wang Chen.

425
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,440
But I care more about Mr. Bai.

426
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,960
I hope he can be happy.

427
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,080
I really don't see that you respect him.

428
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,520
I only see you hurting a soldier,

429
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,160
a family, a military marriage.

430
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,320
He has left his best time in the army.

431
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,680
He's always on the front line.

432
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,040
Don't such soldiers deserve our respect and protection?

433
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,160
But their marriage is not happy.

434
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,680
What does it have to do with soldiers?

435
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,560
What does it have to do with you?

436
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,360
And...

437
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,840
It's 2019.

438
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,360
I'm not going to be a scientist.

439
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,560
In our country,

440
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,720
military marriage is protected by law.

441
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,000
Any marriage that ruins the current soldier

442
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,520
will be punished by law.

443
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,960
The current soldier, you know?

444
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,560
Wang Chen is the current soldier.

445
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,640
The marriage that is protected by law

446
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,800
won't last long.

447
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,120
Wang Chen is not suitable for Mr. Bai.

448
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,760
Why do you always help him?

449
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,080
Because I'm a military man, too.

450
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm telling you,

451
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,640
what you're doing now is not only for the military,

452
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,320
but also for every soldier's family.

453
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,760
Sister, have you ever been in a relationship?

454
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,040
Just tell me the truth.

455
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,480
Have you ever loved anyone?

456
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,840
Do you know what love is?

457
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,480
Sister,

458
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,040
even if I haven't been in a relationship,

459
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,000
I can tell you what love is.

460
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,600
Love is an understanding without prejudice.

461
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,880
It's tolerance, it's responsibility, it's loyalty.

462
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,560
It's the cleanest thing in the world.

463
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,200
What you think is not love at all

464
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,920
is your curiosity,

465
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,400
desire to occupy and self-satisfaction.

466
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,280
Do you understand?

467
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,000
Sister, if you say so,

468
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,280
we can't talk anymore.

469
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,560
Excuse me.

470
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,360
Hello.

471
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,640
Who are you?

472
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,720
I'm Wu Si, Wang Chen's captain.

473
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,560
I want to talk to you.

474
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,400
Please sit.

475
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,880
Why are you here?

476
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,760
Wang Chen told me

477
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,440
that you wouldn't leave without permission.

478
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,800
Sister Lu,

479
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,800
you're here to see Wang Chen, right?

480
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,440
This is Wang Chen's captain.

481
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,280
If you have anything to say,

482
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,920
just tell him.

483
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm sorry, miss.

484
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,520
I didn't mean to eavesdrop on your conversation.

485
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But I have to know

486
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,600
about my comrades-in-arms.

487
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,520
I didn't do anything.

488
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,240
I'm just secretly in love with Mr. Bai.

489
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,200
Is it illegal to secretly love someone?

490
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,680
I'm sorry.

491
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,000
I didn't mean to eavesdrop on you.

492
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,320
It's illegal to secretly love someone.

493
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,600
But you like military men.

494
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,080
You're a family with military men.

495
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,000
Can't I get a divorce from the military?

496
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,560
Why should a decent man get a divorce?

497
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,960
Just because of your love?

498
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,160
Didn't you say

499
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Mr. Bai has nothing to do with you?

500
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,120
If Mr. Bai didn't see you as a young man,

501
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,280
he could have harassed you

502
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,160
and hurt Mingyu.

503
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,000
Is it useful to scare me?

504
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,400
I'm secretly in love with someone.

505
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Is it illegal?

506
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,320
Brother,

507
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,560
this old lady is threatening me.

508
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,320
It's none of your business.

509
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,040
Who is this old lady?

510
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,440
You're not the leader of the army.

511
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,760
Why should you educate me?

512
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,840
Old lady.

513
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,880
Say that again.

514
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
Sit down first.

515
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,760
Calm down.

516
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,200
Although she's not the leader of the army,

517
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,960
she's a military man.

518
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,000
She's my family.

519
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,880
She's your family?

520
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,000
Yes.

521
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,320
I'm Wang Chen's superior.

522
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,800
She's the superior's family.

523
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
I'm your family.

524
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,240
So I have the right to question you.

525
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,040
Did you hear that? I have the right to...

526
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,600
What are you talking about?

527
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Call me auntie.

528
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Why didn't you hear that?

529
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,520
I'll educate you later.

530
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,800
No.

531
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,840
Didn't you say you've never been in a relationship?

532
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,600
Why are you a family member again?

533
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,080
You...

534
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,960
never been in a relationship?

535
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,240
Can't we get married if we've never been in a relationship?

536
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,560
We're dating.

537
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,280
No?

538
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,920
We're in love at first sight.

539
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
We're married.

540
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,800
Is there a problem?

541
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,320
No.

542
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,320
Look.

543
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,640
You got married because you love each other.

544
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,240
Why can't Mr. Bai and I?

545
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,800
Bai Zi Jie loves Wang Chen.

546
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,800
Before they got married,

547
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,760
they knew what kind of soldier Wang Chen was.

548
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,280
Wang Chen also said that

549
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,360
after marriage,

550
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,200
they would face various problems.

551
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,720
But they still got together.

552
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,200
The army

553
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,480
doesn't disrespect the freedom of marriage.

554
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,080
Instead, it protects

555
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,880
the two brave people who got together.

556
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,680
After all,

557
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,920
we soldiers

558
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,680
are precious

559
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,240
when we meet someone we love.

560
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,200
You're young.

561
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,160
Your future is bright.

562
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,720
You'll meet someone you love

563
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,680
and love you.

564
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
But not Bai Zi Jie.

565
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,160
So,

566
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,760
we won't hurt you.

567
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,000
Please don't hurt Wang Chen,

568
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,360
okay?

569
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,120
Zong Qing.

570
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,440
Do you always know

571
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,840
what you want to do?

572
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,920
I...

573
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,520
I didn't think it through.

574
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,760
I liked guns and cannons when I was young.

575
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,480
I guess most boys are like that.

576
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,720
I studied in military school.

577
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,960
I studied in the engineering department.

578
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,520
I chose this

579
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,200
because I liked it.

580
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,920
I was quite confused when I was in the third grade.

581
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
And then?

582
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,840
How did you decide to join the navy?

583
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,640
I'll tell you. It was a coincidence.

584
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,520
The navy came to my school

585
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,560
for special training.

586
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,120
There was a speech.

587
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,280
I was so excited

588
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,360
and nervous.

589
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,760
It made my life clear.

590
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,840
That's amazing.

591
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,520
Did you go there immediately?

592
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,800
Not so fast.

593
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,040
I hesitated

594
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,520
for several nights.

595
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,960
But mainly,

596
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,160
Zhong Wei had to pull me

597
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,160
and say

598
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,240
that she would regret it for two years.

599
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,880
Not that she would regret it for a lifetime.

600
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,400
I'll tell you.

601
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,800
I was the president of the school's

602
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,000
national second-level athlete.

603
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,400
It was probably a fate.

604
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,440
That's great.

605
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,280
You're so lucky.

606
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,480
You know what path you're going to take.

607
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,760
Unlike me,

608
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,920
I have no feeling

609
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,760
about my future.

610
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,960
Why did you bring me back here?

611
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,680
I can't send you back

612
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,240
because I'm going to turn off the light.

613
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,160
So you're taking a taxi in the camp,

614
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,600
which is safer.

615
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,960
You're thoughtful.

616
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,640
The taxi is slow.

617
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,440
Let's talk for a while.

618
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,520
When did you knowChe's whereabouts?

619
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,680
You heard it

620
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,840
on our interview today.

621
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,720
We just bumped into each other at the gate.

622
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,520
I definitely will

623
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,560
if you did bump into me.

624
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,360
I тр Alright, I'll take it.

625
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,000
But what if

626
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,080
Luo Tong doesn't listen to you?

627
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,880
Exactly.

628
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,240
It's not only because

629
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,040
of that wish.

630
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,800
That's also my aunt's idea.

631
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Let's cheek each other.

632
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,000
Haven't you known

633
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,280
I'm not listening.

634
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,560
If you don't listen to me,

635
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,880
I'll introduce Han Yu Hang to him.

636
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,600
I'll let Mr. Bai go first.

637
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Just kidding.

638
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,440
Han Yu Hang is handsome,

639
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,240
but he's not suitable for a girl.

640
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,320
Is he that handsome?

641
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,400
He's really handsome.

642
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But in my opinion,

643
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,080
you're more handsome.

644
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,440
You don't know Wang Chen.

645
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,880
Why do you do this for him?

646
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,800
Didn't you say I'm also a leader?

647
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,560
I'll help you if things get worse.

648
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,640
Besides,

649
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,480
I've been a soldier since I was a kid.

650
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,720
I just think

651
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,160
I should do

652
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,840
what I should do.

653
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,040
I'm not close to Captain Wang Chen,

654
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,520
but I like him.

655
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,920
I think he's a great soldier

656
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,080
and an excellent woman.

657
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,480
So,

658
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,440
if I can do something for him,

659
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,520
I'll be happy.

660
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,600
I'm so touched.

661
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,560
I'm so touched.

662
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
I'm so touched.

663
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
I'm so touched.

664
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Don't do that.

665
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
You're burning ice.

666
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
No, I'm not.

667
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,000
I won't choke you.

668
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,960
Fine.

669
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
I won't tease you.

670
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,760
This is a pen.

671
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,560
Give it to Captain Wang Chen.

672
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,560
This is Luo Tong's hand.

673
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Give it to him.

674
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
It's okay.

675
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
Mr. Bai didn't do anything wrong.

676
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,560
I hope they don't misunderstand

677
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
because of this.

678
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,560
There are not many people who really love you.

679
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
Let's meet again.

680
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,560
What?

681
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
I was too hasty today.

682
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,560
I haven't fully grasped your information.

683
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,560
So let's meet again.

684
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
But what about you?

685
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
I'll be here.

686
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
I'll be here.

687
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,560
That's fine.

688
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
Deal.

689
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
I have no feeling

690
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
about my future.

691
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,560
Aren't you a medical student?

692
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,560
My father chose it for me.

693
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
Your father?

694
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Is he a doctor?

695
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,720
Thanks a lot.

696
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,960
Thanks.

697
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:56,840
What?

698
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,920
Simply unsaliness.

699
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,120
Are you supported in your photos?

700
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,040
I came here for

701
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,440
Cafe au L idol.

702
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,240
Being in your work?

703
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,320
I met her with my head high.

704
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,120
管家庭人家所有 lifeline

705
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,400
I can't help you with this.

706
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,400
You can just follow your heart.

707
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,640
We're still young.

708
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,360
We have plenty of time to correct it.

709
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,800
But if you insist on me,

710
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,640
I think it's good to be a doctor.

711
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,360
If you can only be a doctor after graduation,

712
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,240
I'll change my voice every three days.

713
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,840
I'll live with you.

714
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,520
Stop it.

715
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,120
You're just saying something unreasonable.

716
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,040
Come on, you're worried about me.

717
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,760
I'm not.

718
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,640
I'm not.

719
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,880
No one cares about me.

720
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,840
Poor me.

721
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm going to turn off the light.

722
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,680
I'll hang up now.

723
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:00,960
Go to bed early.

724
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,720
Good night.

725
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,080
Okay.

726
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,880
I'm going to bed.

727
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,760
Good night.

728
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,480
Here he comes.

729
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,760
Look.

730
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,520
A regular taxi.

731
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,240
All right.

732
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,200
Go back.

733
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,680
Reporter Tang has always been alone.

734
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,360
And you should turn off the light at this time.

735
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,640
Go back.

736
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,040
I'll go back first.

737
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,760
You have to send me messages after you get home.

738
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,160
Got it.

739
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,800
Hello.

740
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,440
Hello, sir.

741
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,160
Where are you?

742
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,880
Is your location accurate?

743
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,600
I've been looking for you for a few rounds.

744
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,400
I can't find you.

745
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,080
Can't find you?

746
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,000
Yes.

747
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,640
Right here.

748
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,560
Forget it.

749
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,200
Give me a location.

750
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,880
I'll go to you.

751
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,880
Okay.

752
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,880
Sorry.

753
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,160
I scared you.

754
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,920
You haven't been back?

755
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,880
Okay.

756
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,720
Thank you, sir.

757
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,640
Where is this?

758
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,400
Come with me.

759
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,600
Why did you bring me here?

760
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,880
You'll know later.

761
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,240
Come in and have a look.

762
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,160
This is...

763
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,120
This is my new rental house.

764
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,240
I rent it for a month.

765
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,240
I rent it for a month.

766
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,240
I rent it for a month.

767
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,240
I rent it for a month.

768
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,240
I rent it for a month.

769
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,800
This is my new rental house.

770
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,040
You rent it?

771
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
Yes.

772
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,840
This is our new home in Wenzhou.

773
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,640
Look.

774
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,760
Sea view house.

775
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,960
The sea.

776
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,840
How beautiful.

777
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,440
I've been working in Wenzhou's

778
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,280
marine museum for a week.

779
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,880
I've been busy

780
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,840
finding and renting houses.

781
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,240
I've also

782
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,720
arranged some things in the house.

783
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,640
It's pretty simple.

784
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,760
Just check it out.

785
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,800
See what else is missing.

786
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
Just make it quick.

787
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,040
I'll leave the honor

788
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,800
to you, the hostess.

789
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,800
Why didn't you discuss this with me

790
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,880
when you came to Wenzhou?

791
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,800
I wanted to discuss it with you.

792
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,560
I came here last time

793
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,960
to discuss this with you.

794
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,560
You always said

795
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,240
we were too close.

796
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,080
This time,

797
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,720
I came to your city.

798
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,160
There's no problem.

799
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,440
I can solve

800
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,480
our problems.

801
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,320
Look.

802
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,560
Look.

803
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,440
Actually, you don't

804
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,880
have to do this.

805
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,120
Are you touched?

806
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,440
Did you tell mom

807
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,480
about your work in Wenzhou?

808
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,600
I haven't told her yet.

809
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,880
But don't worry.

810
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
She can't stop me.

811
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,880
It's not about stopping her.

812
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
You transferred to Wenzhou.

813
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,520
It's a big deal.

814
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,280
If you don't tell mom,

815
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,280
what will she think?

816
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,560
She might think

817
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,680
I asked you to come.

818
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,840
I don't think

819
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,760
these things matter.

820
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:12,800
Chen,

821
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,560
the most important thing

822
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,320
is that we can be together

823
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,160
and have a complete family.

824
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,600
I suggest you

825
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,480
tell mom.

826
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,520
I'll leave first.

827
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,480
Chen,

828
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,360
wait a minute.

829
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,040
Wait for me.

830
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,160
You can go back to the unit.

831
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,600
You have to take the key.

832
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,120
The house you rent

833
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,960
is not suitable for me.

834
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,240
I rent the house.

835
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,520
But this house is ours.

836
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,760
From now on,

837
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,400
it's our home in Wenzhou.

838
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,040
Come in.

839
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,280
Comrade Shi Shuang,

840
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,200
the men's sniper team

841
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,240
is in the middle of the battle.

842
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,880
Please give us instructions.

843
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,840
All units, assemble.

844
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,440
Yes.

845
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,120
Assemble.

846
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,480

847
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,640
Right face.

848
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:23,840
Comrade Shi Shuang,

849
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,640
the operation is over.

850
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,240
Please give us instructions.

851
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,440
Be careful.

852
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:26,840
Yes.

853
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,560
Attention.

854
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,480
Do you have a bag?

855
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,680
Yes.

856
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:36,800
Stand up.

857
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:41,920
Do you want to know

858
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,000
your test results?

859
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,200
No.

860
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,880
If you know

861
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,640
your test result doesn't pass,

862
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,960
what will you do?

863
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,640
No.

864
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,560
Keep practicing.

865
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,920
Keep practicing until you get into the blue team.

866
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,720
Do you want to get into the blue team that much?

867
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,800
Report.

868
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,840
I will get into the blue team.

869
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,120
I will definitely get into the blue team.

870
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,120

You're too late.

921
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,120
Come on, come on.

922
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,920
Come on, come on.

923
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,720

928
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,080
Yi Nangwang.

929
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,560
The surname Yi is not so common.

930
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,680
You're also called Nangwang.

931
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,480
Why?

932
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,080
This...

933
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,240
was given to me by the president of the welfare center.

934
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,560
Yi means

935
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,360
the kindness of the country.

936
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,600
Now, it's more meaningful.

937
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,200
I don't forget my comrades.

938
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,800
The army is my home.

939
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,560
You're my family.

940
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,600
Thank you, squad leader.

941
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,320
Ok.

942
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,080
Come on, come on.

943
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,200
Come on, come on.

944
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,040
1, 2, 3, 4.

945
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:21,720
1, 2, 3, 4.

946
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,200
I can issues them directly.

947
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,240
It must be cavity tissue.

948
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,320
I've probably looked up

949
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,760
sonern Zhou's marr amount is already improves a lot.

950
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,920
That's why I need the results from this for now.

951
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,840
All right, you go back.

952
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,240
I have to intervene.

953
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,120
OK.

954
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,100
Just wait a little bit

955
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,120
until it can improve.

956
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,200
You decide the time and location.

957
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,880
I'll wait for your news.

958
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,440
Didn't Mr. Bai transfer to Wenzhou?

959
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,200
Why are you still so quiet?

960
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,400
What's wrong with you two?

961
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,400
He transferred to Wenzhou

962
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,640
is a very romantic decision

963
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,600
for us.

964
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,320
But I don't know

965
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,600
if this is

966
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,080
the right decision.

967
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,680
That's all.

968
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,760
I've listened to the recording.

969
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,840
Help me thank Tang Jizheng.

970
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,480
I will.

971
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,320
Mom.

972
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,360
Son.

973
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,040
You're still in the unit?

974
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,400
I'm in the unit.

975
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,320
What's up?

976
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,920
Why are you so busy recently?

977
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,080
You don't go home for lunch on weekends.

978
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,160
I have a lot of things to do recently.

979
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,240
I have to go on a business trip

980
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,160
soon.

981
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,240
Come back after you finish your business trip.

982
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,640
Come here.

983
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,440
Don't worry.

984
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,320
I'll visit you again

985
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,200
when I come back.

986
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,040
I said

987
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,960
you're busy in the unit.

988
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,880
You should take care of yourself.

989
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,880
Your wife is not around.

990
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,600
All right.

991
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,320
I'm not a kid anymore.

992
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,960
I can take care of myself.

993
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,720
Don't worry.

994
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,760
We're fine.

995
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,960
Take care of yourself.

996
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,640
Li Han.

997
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,640
Brother.

998
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,360
Why are you here?

999
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,400
I'm here to send you wine.

1000
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,840
I know you like red wine.

1001
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,800
I've sent you two bottles of good wine.

1002
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,360
Thank you, Brother Han.

1003
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,760
Why are you looking so serious?

1004
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,560
Information about the ancient shipwreck.

1005
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,080
When did you become so interested in shipwreck?

1006
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,680
Or the female reporter?

1007
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,120
Do you really want to

1008
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,440
find a shipwreck yourself?

1009
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,320
Are you kidding me?

1010
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,520
You didn't even find it

1011
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,800
when you took the coordinates last time.

1012
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,800
That's right.

1013
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,720
I told you last time

1014
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,320
not to listen to the wind and rain.

1015
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,160
You still don't believe me, right?

1016
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,240
I think maybe

1017
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,400
the female reporter has offended someone

1018
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
and she's playing with him.

1019
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,000
That's not true.

1020
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,280
Brother.

1021
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,360
I've been looking into these materials recently.

1022
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,960
I've really found a lot

1023
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,200
about ancient Chinese shipwreck.

1024
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,800
They're all

1025
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,440
from experts of national level.

1026
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,800
They've been verified.

1027
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,040
And I've also found a lot of

1028
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,800
what's it called?

1029
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,000
Lies.

1030
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,120
In China, illegal

1031
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,000
fishing of our shipwreck relics.

1032
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,360
It's not a lie.

1033
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,360
It's all true.

1034
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,480
You've got a lot of knowledge.

1035
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,680
Let me ask you something.

1036
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,080
Last time, you asked me about the shipwreck.

1037
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,120
Didn't the female reporter say

1038
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,760
she'd give up if she couldn't find it?

1039
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,840
Did she give up?

1040
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,440
Did she think of other ways

1041
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,520
to continue investigating?

1042
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,640
It's not about giving up.

1043
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,240
It's not what the reporter said.

1044
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,440
It's me who said it.

1045
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,600
I guessed it.

1046
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,280
I thought she'd give up

1047
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,720
if she couldn't find it.

1048
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,720
But I'm not sure

1049
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,400
about this.

1050
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,360
I'm not sure.

1051
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,360
I'm your brother.

1052
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,680
You're lying to me, right?

1053
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,480
I'll ask you later.

1054
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,040
Don't ask.

1055
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,360
Don't mention it.

1056
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,960
If you do,

1057
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,280
I'll ask you to lend me the ship.

1058
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,360
You'll come to me again.

1059
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,480
Don't give me any more trouble.

1060
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,640
I can't stand it.

1061
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,680
Here's the wine.

1062
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,320
Continue your homework.

1063
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,720
Take care, brother.

1064
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,720
Let everything look romantic

1065
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,360
and the dream also looks ordinary.

1066
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,760
But in your heart,

1067
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,120
there are more expectations.

1068
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,920
I really don't understand

1069
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,920
why you're so confused about love.

1070
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,920
But you give me an answer with your eyes.

1071
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:33,520
I can exchange all my heart with yours.

1072
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,760
Thank you for waking up

1073
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,080
the courage that was once weak.

1074
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,600
Let all the coincidences become a wish.

1075
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,280
Let all the simple things become a partner.

1076
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,200
Open the door to the future.

1077
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:57,440
The sea of people can't separate us.

1078
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,000
You wait for the heart to warm up.

1079
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,240
In the memory, why do you take me away?

1080
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,520
In the vast space, can you

1081
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,120
let me miss you?

1082
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,600
I don't want to be hurt or regret.

1083
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,840
Let all the feelings become a wish.

1084
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,680
Let all my heart be a refuge.

1085
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,840
Thank you for being by my side.

1086
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,080
Let our blood become a river.

1087
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,600
The bigger the world, the more lonely it will be.

1088
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,160
Only by standing by your side,

1089
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:48,600
I can feel the warmth in my life.
