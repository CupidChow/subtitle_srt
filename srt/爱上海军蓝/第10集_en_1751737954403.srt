1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,520
The world may be small

2
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,520
But I've never been desperate for a second

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,800
I've crossed the waves of the world

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,520
And stepped on the deep corners of the dark

5
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,400
To face the more fierce wind

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,760
The wound is covered with the wind

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,560
The night is engulfed by the starlight

8
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,000
Let us hug with this Car cylinder

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,640
On the toothing end is my whichever I here

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,340
I won't hold on and not be scared

11
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,720
reassuring my friends and opponents

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,720
No one is looking forward to your look back

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,720
To be you is worth it

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,720
To be you is worth it

15
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,720
To be you is worth it

16
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,720
To be you is worth it

17
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,720
To be you is worth it

18
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,720
To be you is worth it

19
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,720
To be you is worth it

20
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,720
To be you is worth it

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,720
To be you is worth it

22
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,720
To be you is worth it

23
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,720
To be you is worth it

24
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,720
To be you is worth it

25
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,720
To be you is worth it

26
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Turn left and right

27
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,720
Comrade, the new person is ready

28
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720

Yes

36
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
The sea is right

37
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
The ship is wrong

38
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,720
To guard for life

39
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Never give up

40
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
Please welcome the new person

87
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Fight for the army

Please take a step forward, okay?

92
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720

From today

108
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
Except for the teacher

109
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
I have another name worth being proud of

110
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Mr. Jun

111
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720

00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Comrades

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,720
Today is the gathering of the wedding

00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Thank you these excellent girls

118
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Can marry our soldiers

119
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Become a military sister-in-law

120
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,720
This also includes my daughter Yang Yang

121
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,720
You didn't become a female soldier

122
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
I am very sorry

123
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,720
But you choose to become a military sister-in-law

124
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,720
In the sense of law

125
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Also chose military uniform

126
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
I am sincerely happy for you

127
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Thank you daughter

128
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Thank you military sisters-in-law

129
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,720
The duty of the soldier is to provide for the country

130
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Nationality and people

131
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Security protection

132
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Fight to fight

133
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,720
There will be sacrifices and dangers

134
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,720
This is also the same as all industries

135
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,720
Is the duty of the soldier

136
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,720
But for the military sisters-in-law

137
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Choosing soldiers to set up a family

138
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Setting up a family

139
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,720
It takes a lot of courage

140
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,720
You not only want to become a military sister-in-law

141
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,720
But also for the soldiers to fight for half a day

142
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
With your hard work

143
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
The rear of the soldier is stable

144
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
With your efforts

145
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
The military's faith is more solid

146
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,720
With your careful care

147
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,720
The life of the soldier has a better taste

148
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Your husband is the ten thousand miles of the Su State

149
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,720
And you are the strong backing of the Great Wall

150
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,720
Please accept my respect as an old soldier

151
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Salute

152
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
I don't want it, don't give it to me

153
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,720
Xinxin, take it

154
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
I really don't want

155
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
I can keep it for you

156
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
No no no

157
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
I don't want to get married so early

158
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
You have to take my new friend

159
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
You give it to others

160
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
Xinxin

161
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
Uncle Wang

162
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Just take it

163
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Your identity today is not only a technician

164
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
It's also Yangyang's half-bird

165
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
OK

166
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
I don't want it

167
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
I don't want it

168
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
I don't want it

169
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
I don't want it

170
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
OK

171
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
What else do you need for this interview?

172
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Find Wu Si to do it for you

173
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Where is he?

174
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
How do I know

175
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Over there

176
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Let's go over there

177
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
I'm not going

178
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,720
If Wu Si's father can see it

179
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,720
How happy everything should be today

180
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
please

181
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
How's the wedding

182
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
I know you're in a hurry

183
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
What about this

184
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
Eat some melon

185
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
You said you even grabbed the handkerchief

186
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
You are great

187
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
I don't have to grab it

188
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,320
I'm afraid everyone doesn't know

189
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,280
I'm not married

190
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes

191
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,520
Then you just get angry

192
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,840
You shut the other's mouths

193
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,600
Dad, you should really look at

194
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,960
Uncle Lan's heart today

195
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,480
You are struggling

196
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,080
Do you want to dislike me so much now

You look at your daughter's car

That's not all uncomfortable

201
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,400

There will be that day

You're awake?

323
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
What's the matter?

324
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Zong Qing is not at home.

325
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,040
No one answered the phone.

326
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Did you go with him?

327
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
I don't know.

328
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
But it must be an emergency.

329
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
I called him away.

330
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
My dad must know.

00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Help me ask him.

332
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Mom, someone knocked on the door.

333
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
I'll tell you later.

334
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Mom, Xin Xin is here.

Where did he go?

344
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Why didn't he tell me?

345
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Where did he go?

346
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,040
He went to take a risk.

347
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,040
It's such a big typhoon.

348
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,040
Only you can sleep.

349
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Are you going to the interview

350
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
in this dress?

351
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,040
Take me with you.

352
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,040
No.

353
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Xin Xin, I'm begging you.

354
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
I feel so sorry for you.

355
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
You haven't woken up yet.

356
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
Your husband is gone.

357
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
Okay, don't be so stubborn.

358
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
After you finish your work,

359
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
I'll go to the show.

360
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
I'll be there.

361
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,040
Go.

362
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,040
Change your clothes.

363
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
Let me go.

364
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
I'm sorry.

365
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
Open the door.

366
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Open the door.

00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040

Help.

370
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
The door can't be opened.

371
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
There's a child here.

372
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Help.

373
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Help.

We're in the rain.

375
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,040
We'll go to find the iron mine

376
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
to save you.

377
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Dear audience,

After the rain,

00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
Behind me,

386
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
that is about to be flooded.

387
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
There are some villagers

388
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040

00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
And according to

390
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
the latest forecast from the weather department,

391
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,040
the rain will continue to pour.

392
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
I hope all the victims

393
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,040
can be rescued in time.

394
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Hurry.

395
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Help.

396
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Help.

397
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Help.

398
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Hurry.

399
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Come on.

400
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
There's a child in the house.

401
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
Save the child first.

402
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
Wait for me.

403
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
Captain Chen,

404
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,040
there's a situation ahead.

405
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
Hurry.

406
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
Hurry.

407
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Be careful.

408
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
How are you?

409
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
We'll save you up right away.

410
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Don't worry about us.

411
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
There's a big bus ahead.

412
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Save them.

413
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Hurry.

414
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Hurry up.

415
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
What's going on?

416
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
All the water-related buildings

417
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
nearby have been cleared.

418
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
The volunteers are all here.

419
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
Put the child up.

420
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Wait.

421
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Wait, comrade.

422
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
And...

423
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Is there any other way out?

424
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
The hostage has been rescued.

425
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
But

426
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,040
my stuff is still in the water.

427
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Comrade,

428
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,040
our first task is to save people.

429
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,040
I'm a special school art teacher

430
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,040
here.

431
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
A few talented kids

432
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
in the class

433
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,040
all drew a painting of the Pinyin.

434
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
We wanted to take it to Beijing

435
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
for three exhibitions.

436
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
But before we went,

437
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,040
the typhoon came.

438
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,040
The school was gone.

439
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,040
We must send this painting

440
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
to Beijing in the next two days.

441
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
Where's the school?

442
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
It's not far from here.

443
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,040
You go first.

444
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Okay.

445
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
The water is not deep.

446
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
I'll try.

447
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
The typhoon is coming.

448
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
We're saved.

449
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Teacher,

450
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,040
how many people are in the bus?

451
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,040
There are sixteen people in the bus.

452
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
Is anyone hurt?

453
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
No one is hurt yet.

454
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,040
But there are several kids in the bus.

455
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,040
Please save them first.

456
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Auntie.

457
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Calm down, everyone.

458
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
Don't worry.

459
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,040
We'll figure something out.

460
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
The typhoon is coming.

461
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,040
The typhoon is coming.

462
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
The typhoon is coming.

463
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
The typhoon is coming.

464
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
We're saved.

465
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Don't be afraid.

466
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
We'll get you out right away.

467
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
What should we do now?

468
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
Go to the back window.

469
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Go find the tools.

470
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
Okay.

471
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Where's the painting?

472
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
In the cabinet of the office.

473
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,040
Which floor is the office?

474
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,040
On the first floor.

475
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
The first floor is one floor, the second floor is three.

476
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
Be careful.

477
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Comrades.

478
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Be careful.

479
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,040
Watch out.

480
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
Yes.

481
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
We won't fall back.

482
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
We won't fall back.

483
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
We won't fall back.

484
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Everyone, be careful.

485
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
We won't fall back.

486
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
Help us.

487
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Help us.

488
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Hurry up.

489
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Hold on.

490
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
The kids go first.

491
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,040
Be careful.

492
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
The old man and the kids go first.

493
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
Be careful.

494
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
The old man and the kids go first.

495
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
Hold on.

496
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Be careful.

497
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
Go over there.

498
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,040
Be careful.

499
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
Be careful.

500
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Sit here.

501
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
The old man and the kids go first.

502
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
Be careful.

503
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Be careful.

504
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,040
We won't fall back.

505
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
We won't fall back.

506
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Go back.

507
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,040
The kids and the woman.

508
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,040
And the old man and the kids go first.

509
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
Go.

510
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
Be careful.

511
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
Be careful.

512
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Are there any kids left?

513
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
No.

514
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Hurry up.

515
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
Thank you, sir.

516
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
Go.

517
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
Xia Yifeng, come here.

518
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Hurry up.

519
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Hurry up.

520
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
Be careful.

521
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
Be careful.

522
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Be careful.

523
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Be careful.

524
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
The house is dangerous.

525
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
Hurry up.

526
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Let's go.

527
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,040
Why is it so long?

528
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,040
Why don't you come out?

529
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Don't worry.

530
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
They should be here soon.

531
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Okay.

532
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,040
It's okay.

533
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Sit down.

534
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
Sit down.

535
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Where is the kid?

536
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
He's not here.

537
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,040
Let's go.

538
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
Is that him?

539
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,640
Your Majesty, we're saved!

540
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,040
The Navy soldiers who came to rescue us

541
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,960
have successfully rescued the people on the top of the hill.

542
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,400
Send them back to the shore.

543
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,960
This is the real-time report

544
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,600
of Tang Xin, the reporter,

545
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,120
who has done it for you.

546
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
Jin booth

547
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,880
Watch your step!

548
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:31,320
Watch your step!

549
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,360
Be careful!

550
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,120
Watch out!

551
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,040
Be careful.

552
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
It's enough.

553
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,040
Be careful.

554
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
Be careful.

555
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
Be careful.

556
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Slowly.

557
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Hold it.

558
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
Slowly.

559
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
Be careful.

560
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Slowly.

561
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Don't worry.

562
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
Be careful.

563
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
It's okay.

564
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
We're fine.

565
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Thank you.

566
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,040
Thank you.

567
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,040
Thank you.

568
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,040
Thank you.

569
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
You've worked hard.

570
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
Be careful.

571
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,040
Thank you.

572
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,040
Thank you, Jiang Tang.

573
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Don't worry.

574
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040
Be careful.

575
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
Be careful.

576
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
Be careful.

577
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
Jiang Tang is dead.

578
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
We can see that.

579
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
He's in great danger.

580
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
He hasn't stopped yet.

581
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
But our people

582
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
have successfully moved

583
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
the refugees to a safe place.

584
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
The soldiers from the Navy

585
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,040
are fighting day and night

586
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,040
at the first line of the rescue.

587
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
Recently,

588
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
photos of the soldiers

589
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
who were tired

590
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
from the wedding

591
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,040
have been posted on WeChat.

592
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Zongqing.

593
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Zongqing.

594
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
Where?

595
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,040
The pictures are called the most beautiful taxis.

596
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,040
Today,

597
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,040
we're lucky to find

598
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
more beautiful photos.

599
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Mom.

600
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
How come you can't even recognize Zongqing?

601
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
I saw them

602
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
and then I saw Zongqing.

603
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,040
The soldiers from the Navy

604
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,040
are all the same person.

605
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
The most serious

606
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,040
is the war in the Chima.

607
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
Most of the refugees

608
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
have been killed.

609
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
The rescue work

610
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
is under way.

611
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Behind me,

612
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
the pictures you see

613
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,040
are the soldiers from the Navy

614
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
fighting day and night.

615
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
The next situation

616
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
will be reported

617
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,040
by the news.

618
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
Be careful.

619
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
We've read

620
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,040
your live report.

621
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
It's good.

622
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
But,

623
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,040
the general introduction

624
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,040
of the disaster relief project

625
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
has been done by many other media.

626
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,040
I think it's almost the same.

627
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,040
If you can

628
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,040
interview some soldiers

629
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
who are rescuing the disaster

630
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
and let them talk about it,

631
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
I think it might

632
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
be more moving to the audience.

633
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,040
Of course,

634
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,040
the most important thing

635
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,040
is to make sure

636
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,040
that the people who are rescuing the disaster

637
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,040
are not only the people

638
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
who are rescuing the disaster

639
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
but also the people who are rescuing the disaster.

640
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
Mr. Tian.

641
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
Of course,

642
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
it's under the premise

643
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
of not affecting the work

644
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
and rest of the soldiers.

645
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,040
Okay, I got it, Mr. Tian.

646
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
How is it?

647
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Mr. Tian, are you praising us?

648
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
What should we do now?

649
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
Should we go to the interview

650
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
and let the victims know?

651
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
No.

652
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
Their property

653
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,040
has just suffered losses.

654
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
The interview

655
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
will make them feel

656
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
hurt.

657
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
It's not that serious.

658
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
I think other units

659
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
also have interviews.

660
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Others are others.

661
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,040
We do our job.

662
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,040
I think

663
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
we should go to the interview

664
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
and let the victims know.

665
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Okay.

666
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,040
I think

667
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,040
we should go to the interview

668
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,040
and let the victims know.

669
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,040
Okay.

670
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
I think

671
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
we should go to the interview

672
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,040
and let the victims know.

673
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,040
Okay.

674
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
I think

675
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,040
we should go to the interview

676
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,040
and let the victims know.

677
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
Okay.

678
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,040
I think

679
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,040
we should go to the interview

680
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,040
and let the victims know.

681
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,040
Okay.

682
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
I think

683
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
we should go to the interview

684
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
and let the victims know.

685
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
Okay.

686
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
I think

687
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
we should go to the interview

688
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
and let the victims know.

689
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
Okay.

690
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
I think

691
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,040
I can make a fool

692
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
I'm the analyst.

693
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,040
I can make a fool

694
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,040
I'm the analyst.

695
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
Good.

696
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
Good.

697
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,040
She doesn't know

698
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
Thanks.

699
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,040
Zhang Yuan.

700
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Yes?

701
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,040
Wind is unfrequent.

702
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,040
Packing up

703
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
The Lamb�

704
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
is warning the enemies

705
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
to slow down

706
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,040
to predict later

707
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,040
and rain bitterly.

708
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,040
So, they are waiting for

709
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,040
the more suitable Once the Lord be Pleased

710
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,720
Where are the cars?

711
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,240
I have wooden one.

712
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,000
Get someone a pin impact Medicare.

713
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,720
I don't have money.

714
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,600
The items will be all right.

715
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,240
All right then, los.

716
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,400
Let's hurry.

717
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:20,940
Alright.

718
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:29,860
Don't be a 11-year-old harvested

719
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,280
first

720
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:43,500
Chum

721
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,460
How about you

722
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,580
Zhou Xiao Man

723
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,940
then there will also be a chance for me sometime in another place.

724
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,740
How about it?

725
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,620
When I was at the police station,

726
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:14,820
the beloved 6-J Berkeley

727
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,300
what did you think of about teaching students?

728
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,060
I thought it was nonsense,

729
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,060
I'm not joking.

730
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,820
Stand here.

731
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,860
I'll give you a minute.

732
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,780
Let's try again.

733
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:27,740
Wait.

734
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,100
Zeng Qing.

735
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,420
The number of our troops' transfer

736
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,260
is not marked as a fraud call,

737
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,060
but an advertisement.

738
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,660
Did you tell

739
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,500
your princess the truth when you left?

740
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,500
I did.

741
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,780
Who did you forget?

742
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,020
You'll remember it later.

743
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,820
But, Captain.

744
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,820
It's good that he didn't tell the truth.

745
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,540
What if their princess

746
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,300
is crying?

747
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,540
Are you still thinking about

748
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,220
playing the war?

749
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,220
Captain, you can go.

750
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,500
Mom.

751
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,220
You go first.

752
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,500
Everything is fine here.

753
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:06,980
Please.

754
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,980
Don't worry.

755
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,060
Take care of yourself.

756
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,380
I won't say anything.

757
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:11,900
Bye.

758
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,700
I'll go.

759
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,460
Pusi.

760
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,100
Don't worry.

761
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,700
Are you okay?

762
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,100
I'm fine.

763
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,780
I'm fine.

764
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,700
How about you?

765
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,380
Are you all right?

766
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,300
I'm fine.

767
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,540
Where are you?

768
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,580
Hello, Mr. Han.

769
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,140
Hello.

770
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,580
Where's my brother?

771
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,500
Mr. Han is in the meeting room.

772
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,060
Wait a minute.

773
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,700
I'll go tell him.

774
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,020
No need.

775
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,660
You can go ahead.

776
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,660
I'll go find him.

777
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,100
Okay.

778
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,140
Why is it so difficult

779
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,300
to find someone?

780
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,140
Mr. Han.

781
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,660
We've checked.

782
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,420
This email

783
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,860
was registered at Honghai Internet Bar.

784
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,540
We also transferred the surveillance footage.

785
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,980
But there are too many people from Internet bars.

786
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,940
It's hard to tell

787
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,220
who is registering the email.

788
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,340
I analyzed that

789
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,060
this email was registered temporarily.

790
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,540
JN56789

791
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,100
at qq.com.

792
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,060
Such a simple account.

793
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,380
It's a temporary one.

794
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,420
Analyze.

795
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,860
I'm not asking for analysis.

796
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,340
I'm not asking for analysis.

797
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,660
I'm asking for the result.

798
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,660
What's the result?

799
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,180
Aren't you an IT expert?

800
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,300
What's your idea?

801
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,100
Mr. Han.

802
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,020
It's too difficult

803
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,460
to find the person

804
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,340
who uses this email

805
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,180
through this IP address.

806
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,380
How about I do it?

807
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:10,900
Mr. Han.

808
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,940
I didn't mean that.

809
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,900
I've also analyzed the user name.

810
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,500
The two PINs of JN

811
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,580
such as Jiangnan and Jiangning.

812
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,180
How about this?

813
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,420
Write down the names

814
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,660
of the two PINs

815
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,660
and check them.

816
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,540
Check them one by one.

817
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,460
Mr. Han.

818
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,420
I have a suggestion.

819
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,100
How about we

820
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,940
start from the female reporter

821
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,100
to investigate this email?

822
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,540
I need to check it.

823
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,180
If the female reporter

824
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,260
has any idea,

825
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,300
we can continue to check it.

826
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,740
Do you understand?

827
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,100
Get a glass of water!

828
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,140
Can I do this?

829
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:02,620
This...

830
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,700
Brother.

831
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,540
Yujang.

832
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,100
Why are you here?

833
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,660
Chstes said you were in the call room to have a meeting.

834
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,340
So I came over.

835
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,180
why

836
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,580
just rates

837
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,380
Still a bad thing

838
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,420
I and a friend were cheated

839
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,860
Let's help check

840
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:25,900
What was ikkeテ

841
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,460
Cheated some money

842
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
Then call the police to know

843
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,700
It's too dangerous to check yourself

844
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,500
Reported

845
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,460
But not a big force

846
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,140
Let's all help

847
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:38,820
too

848
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,820
What about this

849
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,020
Tell me the clue

850
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,260
I can help you

851
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,420
Don't joke

852
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,340
You are finally here

853
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,900
Let's have some tea and rest for a while.

854
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,020
Kid, how's the bike?

855
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,420
Here.

856
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,380
It's wrapped.

857
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,780
Be careful not to touch the water.

858
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,060
Good boy.

859
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,260
Give it to me. I'll go.

860
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,740
Okay, little girl.

861
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:06,860
Here.

862
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,300
Is this the medicine?

863
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,420
Captain Wu.

864
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,260
Let me wrap your wound.

865
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,340
No need.

866
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,300
Let me see your wound.

867
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,740
You should wrap it.

868
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,140
Your fingers are so cold.

869
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,020
It must hurt.

870
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,340
Fingers are used to tie the board.

871
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,140
It must be active.

872
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,500
It won't be flexible if you wrap it.

873
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,020
Does it hurt?

874
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,500
Let me go first.

875
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,380
Wait for me.

876
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,140
Come on.

877
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:31,460
Listen to me.

878
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,220
What happens before no one maxes it out?

879
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,100
What might be the purpose of my wound

880
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,780
and you getting serious?

881
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,660
What's the point of being serious?

882
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,900
Do not ask anymore.

883
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:51,340
But you gave me the answer with your eyes

884
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:58,860
I can exchange all my heart and soul for you

885
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:06,380
Thank you for waking up the courage that was once weak

886
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,820
Let all coincidences become a distance

887
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:13,580
Let all the simple things become a company

888
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:17,100
Open the door of the future

889
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:22,700
The blue sea can't separate us

890
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,300
You wait for the warm star

891
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:31,580
In the memory, why do you take me

892
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:36,780
You are alone in the vast space of time

893
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,380
I am still missing you

894
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,940
I don't want to regret it

895
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,220
The courage to sing a song

896
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,140
Let my heart be your support

897
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:55,260
Thank you for being by my side

898
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,420
The cold snow and the darkness

899
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,940
The bigger the world, the lonelier it gets

900
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,460
Only standing by your side

901
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:14,300
I feel the warmth in my heart
