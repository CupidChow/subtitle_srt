2
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,500
Episode 15

3
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,120
They're shooting live videos.

4
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,880
I have an answer for you.

5
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,600
I'm at the southwest gate.

6
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,800
I'm at thewest gates.

7
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,560
A catering window near the west gate.

8
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,200
A catering window?

9
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,480
is afraid that we can't

10
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,560
commit.

11
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,680
I want to sit down

12
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,840
and have a talk with you.

13
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,040
Why?

14
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,880
Do I mean by words?

15
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,240
Should be this one.

16
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,880
I'm sorry.

17
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,480
We're at the bridge.

18
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,840
Let's wait for her to come back.

19
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,240
Okay.

20
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,600
It's been a long time

21
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,640
since I've been to the Rainbow Park.

22
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,920
I feel like I don't know her.

23
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,920
Now,

24
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,440
our economy is developing too fast.

25
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,360
So,

26
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,720
many infrastructure

27
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,880
and related components

28
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
are following us.

29
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,040
Mr. Han,

30
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,160
do you care about

31
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,560
the country's economic development?

32
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,720
Of course.

33
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,440
It's said that a country has its own family.

34
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
The country's wealth is the people's strength.

35
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
The country's strength is the people's safety.

36
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,240
Actually, you're the same.

37
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,520
As a reporter,

38
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,560
don't you want to

39
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,520
maintain fairness

40
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,360
and justice?

41
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,680
Actually, I'm learning from you.

42
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,480
Mr. Han, you're overpraising me.

43
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm just doing this job.

44
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,680
I have no choice.

45
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,960
If you say so,

46
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,000
you're too modest.

47
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,080
Actually, I've always

48
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,200
admired you.

49
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,800
A girl is very courageous

50
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,200
and responsible.

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,760
It's hard to say no to you.

52
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,800
If you keep praising me,

53
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,240
I'm going to be a star.

54
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,000
Then go ahead.

55
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,120
Anyway, I'm just doing this job.

56
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,840
I'm not overpraising you.

57
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,000
Here is your mental health report.

58
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,440
Do you have any guests?

59
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,440
Let me look at it.

60
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,920
Now?

61
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,280
Do we have any uninfluення?

62
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,880
What do you want from me?

63
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,520
Sun father asked me

64
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,320
My name is Wu Si.

65
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,200
It's been 20 minutes.

66
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,440
You said you didn't reply to the email

67
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,520
and you didn't come.

68
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,520
How about I urge him again?

69
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,600
I think you'd better not urge him.

70
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,640
Let's wait a little longer.

71
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,800
Okay.

72
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,720
Anyway,

73
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,440
I rarely have time

74
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,520
and a chance

75
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
to spend more time with you.

76
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,800
Mr. Han is usually busy.

77
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,120
He doesn't have time to go to the park.

78
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,200
Tell me.

79
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,520
What's the relationship

80
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,200
between reporter Tang and Han Yuheng?

81
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,600
They have no relationship.

82
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,680
They just met in an interview.

83
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,000
And

84
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,600
what reporter Tang explained to you in the email

85
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,520
is true.

86
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,000
If they have any conflict,

87
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,080
they won't arrange this meeting

88
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,320
with great effort, right?

89
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,680
Right?

90
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,440
Give this

91
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
to reporter Tang.

92
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,000
These cultural relics

93
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,240
were found in the ocean of the Great Yan.

94
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,480
Yes.

95
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,440
Wait.

96
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,120
Tang Xin said

97
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,360
you have other new clues

98
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,160
to tell her.

99
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,600
Tell reporter Tang today

100
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,000
that I will continue to contact her

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,840
in the email.

102
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,840
Okay.

103
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,600
I will tell her.

104
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,960
Don't worry.

105
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,760
This matter

106
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,760
is not only Tang Xin who wants to investigate it,

107
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,600
I also want to investigate it.

108
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,360
Because...

109
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,560
I know who you are.

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,840
I know you.

111
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,960
I can see you today

112
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,960
not because you are

113
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,320
reporter Tang's boyfriend,

114
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,880
but because

115
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,080
you are the son of Uncle Wu Tong.

116
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,320
Although I don't know him,

117
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,640
I have heard about him.

118
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,160
He is a good man.

119
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,160
So we will meet again

120
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
if we have a chance.

121
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,800
Yes.

122
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,480
Mr. Han.

123
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,360
I think today is nothing.

124
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,000
Shall we go now?

125
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,280
We should not wait too long.

126
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,760
For such a long time,

127
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,920
you should have come earlier.

128
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,840
Send an email to him.

129
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
If he sends us a message on the way

130
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,080
We'll be back soon

131
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,240
All right, that's the only way

132
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,840
This person is too beautiful

133
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,680
Not reliable

134
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,640
Okay, where are you going? I'll send you

135
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,560
Who

136
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,200
The two of us are

137
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,000
Director Yuan

138
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,840
Introduce to you officially

139
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,760
Wu Si, my boyfriend

140
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
Come to pick me up from work

141
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,600
Hello

142
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,480
Hello

143
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,720
Well, in that case

144
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,320
I won't bother you

145
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,320
Goodbye

146
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,920
Goodbye

147
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,800
Bye bye

148
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,180
yg

149
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,400
Let's go to the cab

150
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,960
This is what she let me transfer to you

151
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,800
I'm sorry.

152
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,560
These are the pieces?

153
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,480
What about the big clues he mentioned?

154
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,760
I mentioned to him

155
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,480
that he thought about it for a long time

156
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,480
and decided to communicate with you through email.

157
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,280
He probably has some feelings for you

158
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,440
when he met Han Yuhang.

159
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,400
I can understand.

160
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,040
In his opinion,

161
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,840
Han Yuhang borrowed the boat twice to go to the sea with me.

162
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,680
He couldn't have just made friends.

163
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,480
He wouldn't think

164
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,040
Han Yuhang and I are a team, right?

165
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,280
That's not true.

166
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,040
If he really thought so,

167
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,680
he would have been in a bad relationship with you.

168
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,080
That's true.

169
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,880
Tell me about the meeting today.

170
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,640
He is very alert.

171
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,720
He also investigated me in advance.

172
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,680
He came to the appointed place in advance.

173
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,760
He secretly observed the meeting

174
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,640
for more than ten minutes.

175
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,720
He investigated you?

176
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,760
Yes.

177
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,840
He knew about my father.

178
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,400
What else did he say?

179
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,280
Nothing.

180
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,760
What about you?

181
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,080
Han Yuhang didn't see anyone

182
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,800
in your place.

183
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,040
He must be disappointed.

184
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,000
He was even a little depressed.

185
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,440
He kept asking me

186
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,440
why the person who exposed him suddenly became a double.

187
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,520
Can you feel

188
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,120
why he asked you to meet the person who exposed you?

189
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,520
Actually, I've been observing him

190
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,600
and the surrounding environment.

191
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,560
But I didn't find anything strange.

192
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,040
It's not like he wanted to

193
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,480
lure the person who exposed him out through me.

194
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,200
But I can feel that

195
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,320
he is very serious.

196
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,200
On the way back,

197
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,640
he didn't talk to me much.

198
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,320
At least this can prove

199
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,400
that you suspected

200
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,080
that Changzhou Group was right.

201
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,000
That's right.

202
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,720
Since the person who exposed me

203
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,440
is so worried about me meeting Han Yuhang,

204
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,880
it must be a common thing.

205
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,040
All right.

206
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,000
Things are getting better.

207
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,760
You can't be angry in the car.

208
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,440
Where are you going?

209
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,360
To see your girlfriend.

210
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,000
Are you going home or to have dinner together?

211
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,840
You just told Han Yuhang that

212
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,200
I'm your boyfriend.

213
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,480
I'm here to pick you up from work.

214
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,320
Okay.

215
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,560
Let's go home.

216
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:43,840
Let's go.

217
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Go back and have a good rest.

218
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,560
I'll wait for the news

219
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,000
about Han Yuhang and the person who exposed him.

220
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,080
Hello, dad.

221
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,680
Where are you?

222
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,400
Have you seen the company?

223
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,840
How's the date?

224
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,800
It's not a big deal.

225
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,800
I'll talk to you later.

226
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,040
Right.

227
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,200
We're downstairs.

228
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,960
Isn't it the same now?

229
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,280
No.

230
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,800
Wu Si is next door.

231
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,960
Well...

232
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,280
You should have told me earlier.

233
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,360
You...

234
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,440
You asked Wu Si to come to our house.

235
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,960
I didn't bring him back.

236
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,600
He sent me back.

237
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
You're so stubborn.

238
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,040
Give Wu Si the phone.

239
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,120
I'll talk to him.

240
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
Can you stop being so rude?

241
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,840
Wu Si.

242
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,400
Come to see him at home.

243
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,400
Okay.

244
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,160
Well...

245
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,280
My dad asked you to go up and have a look.

246
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,520
I heard it.

247
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,880
Dad, you're almost there.

248
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,960
When you're in love,

249
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,440
you should be reserved.

250
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,000
Don't make any mistakes.

251
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,520
Dad.

252
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,880
I'm telling you.

253
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,560
If you're so arrogant,

254
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,400
I'll be in love.

255
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,640
Hang up.

256
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,800
Hang up.

257
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,360
Hang up my phone.

258
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,640
When you're in love...

259
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,880
When two kids are in love,

260
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,640
you should be reserved.

261
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,680
Look at you.

262
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,360
I'm not reserved.

263
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,320
How can you be reserved?

264
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,760
I'm not reserved.

265
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,320
How can Wu Si come to our house?

266
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,480
What?

267
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,000
So...

268
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,040
We're really in love.

269
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,080
What?

270
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,040
You want to go back on your word?

271
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,160
No.

272
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,640
I'm afraid you'll go back on your word.

273
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,320
Why should I go back on my word?

274
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,880
I always go back on my word.

275
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,560
I'll confirm one last time.

276
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,560
You're really my girlfriend.

277
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,160
I look forward to your memory.

278
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,080
The sun is slowly rising.

279
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,880
It's getting darker than the sea.

280
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,760
The stars in my heart

281
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,040
will always be there.

282
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,800
You're the main theme of life.

283
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,200
Mr. Tang.

284
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,320
What are you doing?

285
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,600
I'm picking a fruit.

286
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,520
Are you really going to take advantage of it?

287
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,200
I did.

288
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,080
Why do you have to report it?

289
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,720
I think you should report it.

290
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,760
You have to report it.

291
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,200
Dad, why did you come down?

292
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,160
I hung up the phone

293
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,040
before I finished talking.

294
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,160
I just wanted to come down

295
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,120
and have a look.

296
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,240
Did you talk about it?

297
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,000
Go up there.

298
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,440
Mr. Tang.

299
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,280
I've sent Tang Xin back.

300
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,640
I'll go back to the team.

301
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,480
Okay.

302
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,320
Xing.

303
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,840
Promise me.

304
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,960
You'll never go to such a dangerous place again.

305
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,240
It's so nice to have you, Captain Hu.

306
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,280
Call me Brother 4.

307
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:35,960
Brother 4.

308
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,880
From now on,

309
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,160
we'll sell all the cans together.

310
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,600
Why does Brother 4 only say one word?

311
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,680
That's because Brother 4 is a robot.

312
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,440
He can only help me with one word at a time.

313
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,640
Zong Qing.

314
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,840
Wang Zhao Yang is a kid.

315
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,960
But he's not a fool.

316
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,680
Come on.

317
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,520
Have some fruit.

318
00:17:59,320 --> 00:17:59,720
Okay.

319
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,960
Come on.

320
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,520
Sit down.

321
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,160
Sit down.

322
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,040
Sit down. Have some fruit.

323
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,440
Why are you standing here?

324
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:07,920
Sit down.

325
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,400
Sister-in-law, I'm just doing my job.

326
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:09,880
It's okay.

327
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,440
Well.

328
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,600
How's your date with the captain?

329
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,640
Mom.

330
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,520
You're here.

331
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,200
You know you can scold me.

332
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,600
I know you're mad at us.

333
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,880
You think we're lying to you.

334
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,600
But it has nothing to do with Wang Chen.

335
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,760
He told me not to lie to you.

336
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,040
If you're mad,

337
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,320
you'll be mad at me.

338
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,800
Where are you going?

339
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,000
I came back to solve your problem.

340
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,000
Listen to me.

341
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,320
If you think what I said is unreasonable,

342
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,560
you'll be mad again.

343
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,240
Sit down.

344
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,680
Come on.

345
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,400
You've read Wang Chen's test report.

346
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
You know the basic situation.

347
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,760
But the doctor said

348
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,400
he can't be 100% pregnant.

349
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,200
He just needs some time to get better.

350
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,200
I want to ask you

351
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,000
how Wang Chen's body

352
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,920
became like this today.

353
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,360
Wang Chen's performance in the army

354
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,800
is very outstanding.

355
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,920
He's very outstanding.

356
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,000
So he was chosen to be a blue-collar.

357
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,240
What's the blue-collar?

358
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,480
It's a special place.

359
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,560
It's a special place.

360
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,560
It's the same as the soldiers in the army.

361
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,720
Most of them are blue-collar.

362
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,360
Only a small number of soldiers.

363
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,840
If they want to get there,

364
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,080
they need to work harder.

365
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,400
If others work hard five times,

366
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
they have to work ten times harder.

367
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,120
They practice diving in ice water.

368
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,440
It takes three or five hours to dive.

369
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,040
Why is he so tall?

370
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,520
Is he stupid?

371
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,120
What's wrong?

372
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,040
He's doing it for the mission.

373
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,840
Don't drag the comrades' weight.

374
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,280
He can't let the comrades take care of him.

375
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,200
Target on the sea.

376
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:43,960
Go ahead.

377
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,040
The mission they carry out

378
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,920
is very extreme.

379
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,480
We ordinary people

380
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,560
can't imagine it.

381
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,400
Wang Chen's special feature is diving.

382
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
He's under high pressure.

383
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,920
The speed of the human body

384
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,320
in the sea is 20 times faster than that of land.

385
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Not to mention the female soldiers.

386
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,440
The male soldiers are also challenging the limit.

387
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,000
This is our soldier.

388
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,880
Before marriage,

389
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,360
you opposed our Wang Chen.

390
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,200
You said soldiers are restricted.

391
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,920
They are not free in time.

392
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,840
They often don't have a home.

393
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,000
But sometimes we have to think about

394
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
if there were no soldiers like them,

395
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,360
would our life be so stable?

396
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,320
We can't say that

397
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,080
because they can't have children,

398
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,840
we have to divorce them.

399
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,080
We can't let them get hurt

400
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,120
and feel bad.

401
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,640
There's a saying that's very good.

402
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,560
There's no such thing as a good age.

403
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,080
It's just that someone is moving forward.

404
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,080
And Wang Chen is your daughter-in-law.

405
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,640
She's the kind of person she is.

406
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,000
If Wang Chen and I

407
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,440
can have our own children,

408
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,440
that would be great.

409
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,880
If not,

410
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,760
I've already decided.

411
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,320
I'll choose Ding Ke.

412
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,480
The two of us

413
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,240
can live happily together.

414
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,800
Mom,

415
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,440
as Wang Chen's father-in-law,

416
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,240
as a military secretary,

417
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,560
I won't divorce Wang Chen.

418
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,280
We won't divorce.

419
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,120
I'll only love him for the rest of my life.

420
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,880
Mom,

421
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,440
come home with me.

422
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,160
Okay?

423
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,400
I've received the things

424
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,600
you gave my boyfriend.

425
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,880
Thank you very much

426
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,520
for providing me with solid evidence.

427
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,640
Can you tell me now

428
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,240
what the new clue is?

429
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,080
I know

430
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,560
that you care about

431
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,240
my relationship with Han Yu Hang.

432
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,760
I can understand that.

433
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,760
But please believe me.

434
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,560
If I really want to hurt you,

435
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,040
I won't tell you

436
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,400
that the person I'm meeting with you

437
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,400
is Han Yu Hang.

438
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:32,380
You're

439
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,200
You...

440
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,880
You're not hungry after eating this,

441
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,400
you know?

442
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,000
Here.

443
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,520
Thank you, Mr. Song.

444
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,680
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

445
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,200
This is my informant.

446
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,520
He brought some

447
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,560
cultural relics.

448
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,760
Take a look.

449
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,840
And these are...

450
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,240
These are all

451
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,800
from the sea bottom of the salt and pepper.

452
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,880
He said so.

453
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,320
So I want to show you

454
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,160
what they are.

455
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,000
Let me show you.

456
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,040
If it can prove

457
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,920
that these fragments

458
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,240
are really cultural relics,

459
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,400
that's great.

460
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,080
We can promote the Cultural Relics Bureau

461
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,600
to bring up the issue of

462
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,640
the archaeology of the salt and pepper.

463
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,920
If the result is

464
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,360
that they are cultural relics,

465
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,400
please hand these

466
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,680
to the Cultural Relics Bureau.

467
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,240
Okay.

468
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,720
If I remember correctly,

469
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,160
I was the one

470
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,520
who recruited you to the company.

471
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,560
Yes.

472
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,640
You've been in the company

473
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,840
for several years.

474
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,640
So you usually

475
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,120
work hard

476
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,520
and know my dad

477
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,800
and my brother's business.

478
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,560
Do you know that?

479
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,560
I don't know much about business.

480
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,040
So these years,

481
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,960
my dad and my brother

482
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,880
are in the company.

483
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,040
Do you know that?

484
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,120
I know that.

485
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,520
We mostly talk about

486
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,520
the president's kindness

487
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,640
and kindness.

488
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,040
Yes.

489
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,680
Mr. Han.

490
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,480
I think you've been

491
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,520
very busy recently.

492
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,360
You've been missing many doctors.

493
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,200
Is there anything wrong?

494
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,960
Sir, the money is ready.

495
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,600
Sir, the money is ready.

496
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,000
Report.

497
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,360
The red team has returned to the base.

498
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,000
Report.

499
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,280
The left team has returned to the base.

500
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Now, the results.

501
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,880
Zhou Keyang, 2.87 seconds.

502
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,600
Dai Wei, 3.05 seconds.

503
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,800
Zhang Hua, 2.12 seconds.

504
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,720
Li Ming, 4.05 seconds.

505
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,760
Cheng Yue, 2.02 seconds.

506
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,560
Zong Qing, 2.57 seconds.

507
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,520
Wang Xiao Lu.

508
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,040
Okay.

509
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,160
We've talked about so much.

510
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,160
Now, I'll give you

511
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
a piece of advice.

512
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,800
On our faces,

513
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,360
besides the traditional

514
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,040
oil,

515
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,640
there are also some physiological signs.

516
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:31,840
cleanses

517
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,720
is a good thing!

518
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,640
Deep breaths,

519
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,840
my good friends.

520
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
Telehandler.

521
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,240
Open your―

522
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,280
Go.

523
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,620
Come on early.

524
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,520
Come on early.

525
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:04,920
justification

526
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,600
Come on.

527
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,160
you

528
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,800
Your water specifications

529
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,360
we

530
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,800
There are three blue Virginians

531
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,720
that you follow

532
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,160
go

533
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,960
go

534
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
quick

535
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,160
Yan Li

536
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,320
Yan Li

537
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:28,720
Yan Li

538
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,080
Thanks, Miss Tian.

539
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,480
Thanks.

540
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,960
Waiting for the other day.

541
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,760
We don't welcome any more.

542
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,280
Ok, Miss, bye.

543
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,120
Don't be angry.

544
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,000
Black black area...

545
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,840
Black!

546
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,520
Black black!

547
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,000
You look quite difficult.

548
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,240
So miserable.

549
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,480
Welcome.

550
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,960
Xin Xin.

551
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,480
I brought someone else.

552
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,360
Captain.

553
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,480
What's going on?

554
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,280
What kind of situation is this?

555
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,160
I'm stuck.

556
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,880
Are they

557
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,120
officially selected?

558
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,840
They're like parents.

559
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,480
They just came in with the dishes.

560
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,760
Alright, let's cook.

561
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,720
Done.

562
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,360
Any ideas?

563
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,960
I can help.

564
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,920
Help you check your peelers?

565
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,160
Hurry!

566
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,960
Go back.

567
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,400
How is it?

568
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,200
I can only

569
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,680
see the skin.

570
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,080
But it was on purpose.

571
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,840
You did it, Yu Tu.

572
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,840
Thank you.

573
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,720
Wifey,

574
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,480
Come on, you.

575
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,720
One moment.

576
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,480
Get in the car.

577
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,640
Yan Horn!

578
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
I'm back.

579
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,760
Look at how rotten I become.

580
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,760
I'll dig yourrine

581
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,160
later

582
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,560
into this pile of craps.

583
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,120
Prince Yan,

584
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,040
come and I'll help you.

585
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,680
I'll make a joke where

586
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,440
Our squad...

587
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,160
But you're dragging me down.

588
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,000
There's a good show.

589
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,120
Call your brothers to gather.

590
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,600
Drink some water.

591
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,520
Thank you.

592
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,920
Reporter Tang,

593
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,760
you usually interview others.

594
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,800
Today, you're here to be interviewed.

595
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,320
I'll answer the following questions honestly.

596
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,600
When did you like Captain Wu?

597
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,080
I'm late for dinner.

598
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,760
Stop it.

599
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,200
When did Captain Wu

600
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,880
like our reporter Tang?

601
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,440
Go away.

602
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,200
Don't touch me.

603
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,120
It's early.

604
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,960
It's over? Just two words?

605
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,960
Two words are enough.

606
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,720
Go on.

607
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
Captain Wu,

608
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,280
I'll ask you another question.

609
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,560
What magic did you use to give us Tang Xin?

610
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,840
Don't you know that Tang Xin

611
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,440
has been against soldiers since childhood?

612
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,640
Actually, I don't think she's against it.

613
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,520
She just...

614
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,000
She just wants to kill herself.

615
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,480
Say it again.

616
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
I've told you.

617
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,640
It's dangerous to talk about it in the field.

618
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,840
Let's start now.

619
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,800
The interview is in the distance.

620
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,720
Attention.

621
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,480
Captain.

622
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,000
OK.

623
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,280
Attention.

624
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,000
Hello.

625
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,880
Come on.

626
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,920
Introduce yourself.

627
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,560
Do I need to introduce myself?

628
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,720
Don't I know you?

629
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,880
I've seen you before.

630
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,480
You haven't seen us together before.

631
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,000
We've been together for a long time.

632
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,200
We're not on good terms.

633
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,120
Captain.

634
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,200
What's your relationship with him?

635
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,080
Introduce yourself.

636
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,160
Introduce yourself.

637
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,840
Introduce yourself.

638
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,560
OK.

639
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,400
I'll introduce myself.

640
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,200
This...

641
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,040
This is my girlfriend, Tang Xin.

642
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,920
Attention.

643
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,440
Hello.

644
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,840
Thank you for taking care of my captain.

645
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,160
I'm the one who took care of them.

646
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,400
Everyone,

647
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,760
bow to each other.

648
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,880
OK.

649
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,640
Mom, Zijian.

650
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,560
I'm back.

651
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:04,840
Hello.

652
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,680
Where are you?

653
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,480
Did you pick up your mom?

654
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,320
Yes.

655
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,080
I'm downstairs.

656
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,440
It's almost at the door.

657
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,640
Okay.

658
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,880
Chen, mom is back.

659
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,760
Mom.

660
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,000
Mom.

661
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,880
You must be tired.

662
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,000
Are you tired?

663
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,280
No.

664
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,960
Sit down.

665
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,080
Mom, it's all my fault.

666
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,760
I made you angry.

667
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,160
No, no.

668
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,400
Zijian told me everything.

669
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,120
If he hadn't told me,

670
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,080
I really don't know

671
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,440
that you suffered so much.

672
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,400
It's all my fault.

673
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,840
I thought

674
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
you two

675
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,240
were trying to fool me.

676
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,680
We didn't fool you, mom.

677
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,520
I didn't expect

678
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,480
you to be so ungrateful

679
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,800
and didn't take a day off.

680
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,080
You suffered so much outside.

681
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,160
No, mom.

682
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,880
We're all like this.

683
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,000
All like this?

684
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Why are there no other female guests

685
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,600
who are like this?

686
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,160
You're too strong.

687
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,960
I don't care about

688
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,880
your work.

689
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,480
You must

690
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,080
take care of your health in the future.

691
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,240
How do you say it?

692
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,480
Health is the foundation of revolution.

693
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,200
If you don't have a good body,

694
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,240
how can you work well in the future?

695
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,120
Right?

696
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,760
Mom, you're right.

697
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,760
We must

698
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,280
take care of our health in the future.

699
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:43,920
Right.

700
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,960
Don't worry, mom.

701
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,200
You haven't eaten yet, right?

702
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
I'll cook for you.

703
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,480
No, no.

704
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,680
I'm here

705
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,520
to take care of you two.

706
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
You two take a rest.

707
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,280
I'll go.

708
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:54,800
No, mom.

709
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,480
Let me do it.

710
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,000
Look, I've got my hands dirty.

711
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
I'll go.

712
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,320
Okay, okay.

713
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,760
You two, stop arguing.

714
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,280
Or I'll do it.

715
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,400
The kitchen is a big place.

716
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,520
Don't be so nosy.

717
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,400
You two

718
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,720
can chat on the sofa.

719
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,680
I don't need to help mom?

720
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,400
Mom said no.

721
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,920
Then you can sit on the sofa

722
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,040
and talk to her.

723
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,240
Mom, you're so annoying.

724
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,680
What did you say to mom?

725
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,720
I didn't say anything.

726
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,880
She was still

727
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,040
on the high-speed train with me.

728
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,400
She was playing with me

729
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,440
and thinking about something.

730
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,880
I'd better help mom.

731
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,000
In the previous episode,

732
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,480
I've shared some

733
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,560
thunder-picking products with you.

734
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,400
Today, I've arranged

735
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,760
a fan's private letter

736
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,360
to review this one

737
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,360
Meiduo's

738
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,840
smokey, beautiful, white and smooth.

739
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,720
As usual,

740
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,520
the conclusion is

741
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,120
one word.

742
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,040
Don't buy it.

743
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,280
Run away.

744
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,320
There you are.

745
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,400
How I hate!

746
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:12,720
entered time

747
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,600
We three

748
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,520
between ups and downs

749
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,000
spots

750
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,600
You're the only one

751
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
in our life

752
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,800
sobre Wrestling

753
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,720
Hei стоит

754
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,800
Roly-poly

755
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,200
It means

756
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,400
there is a sense of

757
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,360
sank

758
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,820
Wu Sa

759
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,360
Always

760
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,360
love

761
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,160
Forget it.

762
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,200
It's me women

763
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,400
but no one saw it.

764
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,960
Do you have any other clues?

765
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,840
If you do,

766
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,840
can we

767
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,760
start from somewhere else?

768
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,600
I only have one clue.

769
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,040
I don't have any other clues.

770
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,160
But Mr. Han,

771
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,720
you didn't answer me last time.

772
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,200
I have to know

773
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,600
which channel you are from

774
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,760
to get his email.

775
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
I'm really sorry.

776
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,120
I can't

777
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,560
tell you about this channel.

778
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,120
But I still want to say

779
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,440
that you must believe me.

780
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,720
I'm sincere and sincere to help you.

781
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,320
I have no evil intentions.

782
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,360
Okay.

783
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,520
Since you have a channel,

784
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,840
you may get more information than me.

785
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,400
Can you share it with me?

786
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,720
To be honest,

787
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,640
all my information

788
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,520
is only this email.

789
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
But I can promise you

790
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,360
that if I get more information

791
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,840
or information in the future,

792
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,600
I will share it with you

793
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,520
as soon as possible.

794
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,360
But as for the person,

795
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,480
why didn't he come that day?

796
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,120
I actually

797
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,720
didn't think it through.

798
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,000
Did you contact him later?

799
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,520
I did.

800
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,800
He didn't reply to me.

801
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,960
Tang Xin has too many hobbies.

802
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,280
She is like me.

803
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,000
I like to go to the museum.

804
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,800
What about Tang Xin?

805
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,000
Tang Xin

806
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,840
likes to go to the Navy Museum the most.

807
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:22,960
Okay.

808
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,080
I'll take her to the museum this weekend.

809
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,240
Okay.

810
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,760
After that, I'll go home to have dinner.

811
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,360
Your aunt and I will cook for you.

812
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,880
Okay, Mr. Tao.

813
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,440
I see.

814
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,880
What's this?

815
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,200
This is for you.

816
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
That sounds good.

817
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:41,600
Really?

818
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,080
What?

819
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,120
This.

820
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,040
This is

821
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,400
the dress microphone.

822
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,800
She must have chosen it herself.

823
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,080
Wait.

824
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,800
Why did she give me this?

825
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,760
Are you stupid?

826
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,880
Of course I wanted you to wear it,

827
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,880
take a picture, send it to your friends,

828
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,600
and show your love.

829
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,480
Go and change it.

830
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,400
I...

831
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,760
I wear this?

832
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,360
I'm so ashamed.

833
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,440
Do you have the heart to let me down?

834
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,240
What's wrong?

835
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,160
Yineng.

836
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,000
Yes.

837
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,320
Tell everyone to gather here.

838
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,920
Yes.

839
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,000
Hurry up.

840
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,600
Yes.

841
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
I really understand.

842
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
You said love is too vague.

843
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,400
But you gave me an answer with your eyes.

844
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,400
I can be brave enough to meet you in my heart.

845
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
