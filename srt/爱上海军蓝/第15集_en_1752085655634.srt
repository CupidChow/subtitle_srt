The Long Ballad

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Are you okay? Let me see.

4
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I...

5
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I...

6
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm not dreaming.

7
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Why are you here?

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We're having a military competition in Anguo.

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We just received a notice from the embassy.

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Two Chinese citizens were missing nearby.

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So they rushed here.

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Are you hurt?

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm fine.

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You haven't eaten anything in the past few days, have you?

15
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Do you know?

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
When I was sure that the two Chinese citizens were missing were you and Yang Yang,

17
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I was so worried that you would know.

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm so glad that I can meet you and exchange my life with you.

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thank you for waking me up from my old weakness.

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let all coincidences become a wish.

21
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let all partners become partners.

22
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's light up the bright future.

23
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Doc, is there something wrong?

24
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No, it's just a problem with her legs.

25
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
She needs only two days rest and doesn't move.

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's all.

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Thanks.

28
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're welcome.

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Thank you.

30
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Please.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I see.

32
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Sister Xin, sit down.

33
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
How are you?

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Are you hurt?

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm fine.

36
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's just a little dehydrated.

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll go eat something and rest.

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Where is the dance team leader?

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The dance team...

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
She's been too tired from the competition these days.

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We let her stay there for a while.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What did you get?

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The dance team's hearing aid.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Hearing aid?

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What's wrong with it?

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You don't know yet.

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
When we were competing the day before yesterday,

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
the dance team was diving too fast.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We heard a short loss.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We were so worried.

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The diving was too fast.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We heard a short loss.

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Is it serious?

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's very serious.

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I can't hear what she's saying.

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But she's willing to wear it.

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He looks handsome when he's asleep.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
After coming back from the horse's house,

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,360
I've been avoiding you.

94
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,320
Do you find it strange?

95
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,680
You're a big-time man.

96
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
You must not understand.

97
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,720
I'm not avoiding you

98
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,440
because of the endorsement.

99
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,720
I'm not angry with you

100
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,040
because you're hiding it from me.

101
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,280
I'm not.

102
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,000
It's because you made me

103
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,480
be humiliated for the first time in my life.

104
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,280
Do you know that?

105
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,160
Why do you have to

106
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,400
abandon me?

107
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,920
My dad, my mom,

108
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,400
and all my friends know that

109
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,760
I've already said it.

110
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
I, Tang Xin,

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,920
will never

112
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,480
abandon anyone in this life.

113
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,240
Now

114
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,080
my mom

115
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
and I

116
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,000
only think of her.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,440
It is up to you

118
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,800
Did it get caught on theст Miracle Tour?

119
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,680
Did it get caught.

120
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,600
Speaking of which,

121
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,000
I remember the last time

122
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,400
that when Yang You was getting married,

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,920
he wore

124
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,080
military uniform.

125
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:29,120
the

126
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,880
You

127
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,000
You can't hear it now?

128
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Anyway,

129
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,960
thank you.

130
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,040
You always appear by my side

131
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,520
when I need you the most.

132
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,280
Just now in the woods,

133
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,480
I didn't hold back to kiss you.

134
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,600
I'm sorry.

135
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,480
It's okay.

136
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,160
Why are you awake?

137
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,640
You didn't hear me, did you?

138
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,840
They said

139
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,960
you can't hear it.

140
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,240
You need to use a hearing aid.

141
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,960
You didn't hear me?

142
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,320
I did.

143
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,720
But it's okay.

144
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,400
I can pretend

145
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,800
that I can't hear you.

146
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,440
You said it?

147
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,760
Anyway, you didn't hear

148
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,880
what I said.

149
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,800
I didn't say anything.

150
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,120
What did you say?

151
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,040
Listen to me.

152
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,080
Put on an a Covid convince

153
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,000
and release your charm

154
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,080
and find some high-tech drugs first.

155
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,280
I'm not hungry.

156
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,440
I checked them all.

157
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,040
You're the same as Cheng Yuan.

158
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,560
Instructing each other,%$$

159
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,880
and merchant seller, right?

160
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,600
And...

161
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,160
Can it be true?

162
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,400
I believe that

163
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,340
Rong is her favorite person in the TV.

164
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,640
I left the ball...

165
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,920
against the choice of a vigorous person.

166
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,360
But Rong's life has changed too.

167
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,940
That'sIt!

168
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,180
She's going to the poop,

169
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,600
and my audience is going to poop.

170
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,920
She has a reason but I'm afraid

171
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,160
we will resent him in a12%

172
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,480
Honey

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,720
I know you are these days a little scared

174
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,320
But I need to talk to you

175
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,560
What's wrong with you

176
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,560
So serious

177
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,240
You see

178
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,440
I don't object to your coming to Amguo

179
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,360
or the branch.

180
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
This is also a foreign country.

181
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,920
You don't know

182
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
anything about it.

183
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,760
How dare you

184
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,440
drag Xinjie into the original forest?

185
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,800
Have you considered the consequences?

186
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,120
Who knows

187
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,680
such a thing will happen?

188
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,240
I don't know

189
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
that the forest is so big

190
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,160
and so hard to walk.

191
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,680
Yes.

192
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,080
You don't know

193
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,960
or know.

194
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,160
You don't go to do your homework.

195
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
Fortunately, you went with Xinjie.

196
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,760
Fortunately, you consulted with him.

197
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,040
The reception was held in time.

198
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,200
Fortunately, the embassy agreed to

199
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,560
send Xinjie to the forest.

200
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,880
Fortunately, these three are together

201
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,520
so you can stand here safely.

202
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,520
Baby.

203
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,760
If you make any mistakes,

204
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,040
I dare not imagine the consequences.

205
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,360
Why are you still scaring me?

206
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,080
I don't know

207
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,400
we will get lost.

208
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,280
Baby, I'm not scaring you.

209
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,920
I'm really worried.

210
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,200
Song Qing.

211
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,920
Are you here to see us

212
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,040
before the competition is over?

213
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,240
You are missing.

214
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,280
I'm in a hurry.

215
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,120
I'm sorry.

216
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,960
I know I was wrong.

217
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,480
I won't trouble you again.

218
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,880
What are you talking about?

219
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,080
I'm not afraid of you.

220
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,120
I'm not afraid of you getting hurt.

221
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,000
Do you know that?

222
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,880
Then

223
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,800
I promise

224
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,720
I will do my best.

225
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,760
You promise you will do your best?

226
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,280
Yes.

227
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,200
Look at me.

228
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,040
I'll give you a massage.

229
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,640
No need.

230
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,480
You should rest first.

231
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,280
You look very tired.

232
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,520
I'm going to sleep soon.

233
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
I don't have much time.

234
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,400
I'll be back soon.

235
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
I'll rest first.

236
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,840
Lie down.

237
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,880
What are you doing?

238
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,040
Do you remember

239
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,800
what I told you in Wenzhou?

240
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,600
I said I would give you

241
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,480
all the rights to choose.

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,960
I did what I said.

243
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,760
If you haven't thought it through,

244
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,320
I can

245
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,360
pretend that

246
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,520
I didn't hear what you said

247
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,600
and give you more time.

248
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,640
I grew up

249
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,880
with my mom

250
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,400
in the military.

251
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,520
My dad was transferred to Taiwan.

252
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,560
So the army

253
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,400
gave me

254
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,880
a sense of security.

255
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,320
Now that I think about it,

256
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,200
I still have a lot of regrets

257
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,240
when I was young.

258
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,000
But I've never

259
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,080
blamed myself for being so hard on my parents.

260
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
So I know

261
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,760
I've always said

262
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,720
I'm a soldier without a husband.

263
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,680
I'm just a person

264
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,800
who is too stubborn.

265
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,320
I know.

266
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,120
I understand your worries.

267
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,880
I respect your worries.

268
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
I won't force you.

269
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,920
You don't have to force yourself.

270
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,560
I'll treat it as you've made up your mind.

271
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,000
But when you regret it,

272
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,080
choose me.

273
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,240
You are the most ordinary and unique in the world.

274
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,880
You are the most precious moment of my life.

275
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,080
The promise I made to you

276
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,240
is still warm in my chest.

277
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,320
It makes me chase after the next galaxy.

278
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,280
You are the only one who knows me.

279
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,640
I will never regret my choice.

280
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,120
I'll be brave and brave.

281
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,080
I just want to hug you.

282
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,080
Captain Hu,

283
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,240
you can leave now.

284
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,680
But I...

285
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,320
Wait.

286
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,120
I have everything.

287
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,120
Get ready.

288
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,000
Okay.

289
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,400
You're leaving?

290
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,680
The police will send you back.

291
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,920
I have to go back to the base.

292
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,640
Well...

293
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,440
I'll leave later.

294
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,440
Anything else?

295
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,360
Nothing.

296
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,520
Just ask me.

297
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,200
What else?

298
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,760
Well...

299
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,400
Ask me if you have any questions.

300
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,120
Think about it.

301
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,160
Tang Xin, can you find my girlfriend?

302
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,080
Is it this question?

303
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,960
You...

304
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,760
You...

305
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,800
You don't feel bad about asking me a question, do you?

306
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,560
Well...

307
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,760
Can you answer me

308
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,840
after I finish my question?

309
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,720
I...

310
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,120
If you don't answer me,

311
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,960
I'll go back to the team.

312
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,920
I...

313
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,160
I...

314
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,360
I...

315
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,560
I...

316
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,440
I...

317
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,880
I can be your girlfriend.

318
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,680
How can I?

319
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,320
Why are you so fast?

320
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,380
He FRENCH SU embargo

321
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,880
No way.

322
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,600
Please take it slow.

323
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,680
Sample it for me.

324
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,520
I'll help you.

325
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,600
I'm fully karciu

326
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,600
five

327
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,520
three

328
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,800
two

329
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,040
one

330
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,560
Good bye

331
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,000
See you

332
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,760
Watch out.

333
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Go back.

334
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,960
Go back.

335
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
Right line.

336
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,200
I still hope you have a good sum of money.

337
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,480
Also,

338
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:46,160
don't let Lu Y consecutive

339
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,640
improvement under the supervision of Yang Hornets.

340
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,240
Otherwise,

341
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,160
they'll be just like those 300 acts,

342
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,840
and get thrashed Can't let

343
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,880
divide our efforts.

344
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,240
is more important than the title of the champion.

345
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,760
Especially,

346
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,120
it's the first time for a young man to compete in a competition.

347
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
Don't be overwhelmed by honor.

348
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,800
You should hit him more.

349
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,920
Don't knock his tail.

350
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:12,920
I understand.

351
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,200
Why are you laughing?

352
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,320
I remember when I first entered the dance,

353
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,000
you said the same thing to me.

354
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,360
Don't jump too high.

355
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,600
When you first entered the dance,

356
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,080
you knocked the tail higher than anyone else.

357
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,120
Now it's good.

358
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,200
It's your turn to knock your soldiers.

359
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,960
Don't worry, Captain.

360
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,400
Yi Nan Wang is a good soldier.

361
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,680
He will be better than me in the future.

362
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,480
Listen,

363
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,000
it looks like you're training yourself.

364
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,080
If you're going to be a guard,

365
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,560
it won't be a matter of one or two days.

366
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,280
In the meantime,

367
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,200
I won't look for you.

368
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,080
You'd better not be in front of me.

369
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,680
Do what you should do.

370
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,880
Do you understand?

371
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,760
Yes.

372
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,600
Okay, take it.

373
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,520
Stop. Stop.

374
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,480
What are you doing?

375
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,880
Give me the shoes.

376
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,880
You're a man.

377
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,000
You must go on a date.

378
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,040
I promise you'll have a sweet date tonight.

379
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,000
What date?

380
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,080
Tang and Yi Nan are waiting for me at home.

381
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,360
Really, Tang Xin?

382
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
You went back to China for the first time.

383
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,960
How could you go back to see your parents?

384
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,680
You don't want Captain Wu anymore?

385
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,760
Okay, stop pretending.

386
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,560
Zong Qing told me everything.

387
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,800
You're so happy.

388
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,120
You still want to fight?

389
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,920
Can't you be rude to Captain Wu?

390
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,960
Rude?

391
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,120
Who's rude?

392
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,520
I'm...

393
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,120
What are you?

394
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,280
Do you like him or not?

395
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
Look at you.

396
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,280
You're so handsome.

397
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
You're so handsome.

398
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
You're so handsome.

399
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
You're so handsome.

400
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
You're so handsome.

401
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
You're so handsome.

402
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,720
Look at me.

403
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,800
I'm not in a hurry.

404
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,960
Why are you still waiting?

405
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,240
I don't know who always said

406
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
I don't want to marry a soldier.

407
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,920
But I'm so professional.

408
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,600
I'm so polite and polite.

409
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,080
What?

410
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,040
You didn't see me.

411
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,560
You're so shy, right?

412
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,600
You're so shy.

413
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
That's what you think.

414
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,960
Yes.

415
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,680
It's the first time I've seen you so shy.

416
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,560
You're so handsome.

417
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,960
Do you want to...

418
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,040
What do you think?

419
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,680
You're so handsome.

420
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm so handsome.

421
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,480
One, two, three.

422
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,800
One, two, three.

423
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
You want to play hide-and-seek with me?

424
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,320
Sure.

425
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,240
Is your salary paid?

426
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
Let's go.

427
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,440
Follow me.

428
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
What are you waiting for?

429
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
What are you waiting for?

430
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Let's go.

431
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,560
Captain Song, I'm not going.

432
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,560
I want to save money and transfer it to Zhu's mother.

433
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,560
I don't dare to go.

434
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,560
My girlfriend's birthday is next month.

435
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,560
I don't need money.

436
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,560
New skin.

437
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,560
Buy a new skin.

438
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
Yes.

439
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
I'll pay the car loan.

440
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
Don't look at me.

441
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
I'm a loan shark.

442
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,560
What loan do you pay?

443
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
Gun loan?

444
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,560
Go away.

445
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,560
Captain Song.

446
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,560
His money is stored clearly.

447
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,560
This is one-third of the family

448
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
that can't be hit.

449
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
One-third of the card.

450
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,560
And the third.

451
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Do you know what it is for?

452
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,560
This is for his future son.

453
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
The education fund.

454
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,560
My daughter also has it.

455
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,560
Hurry up.

456
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,560
I'll get married first, okay?

457
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,560
Why isn't mom out yet?

458
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,560
She's not in the room.

459
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,560
Mom's been acting strange these days.

460
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
What's wrong?

461
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
I can't say.

462
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,560
She seems to be in a bad mood.

463
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
Call mom to eat.

464
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
Mom, it's time to eat.

465
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
The meal is ready.

466
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,560
Mom, hurry up.

467
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Hurry up.

468
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,560
Hurry up.

469
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
Hurry up.

470
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,560
Hurry up.

471
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,560
Hurry up.

472
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,560
Hurry up.

473
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
Hurry up.

474
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,560
Hurry up.

475
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,560
Wang Chen's cooking.

476
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
What's wrong?

477
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
What happened?

478
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
What's wrong?

479
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,560
You two

480
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,560
are lying to an old lady.

481
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
Is it interesting?

482
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
What are you talking about?

483
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
What are you talking about?

484
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
I know what you're doing.

485
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
It's a lie to have a child.

486
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
How is it a lie?

487
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Chen and I have been

488
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
in a hurry to be pregnant.

489
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,560
Don't lie to me.

490
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,560
You two can't have a child.

491
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,560
Wang Chen

492
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,560
can't give birth at all.

493
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,560
I saw the pregnancy test report.

494
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,560
Child labor was injured.

495
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,560
The sexual hormone secretion level is extremely low.

496
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
The blank black words on this check

497
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,560
are written clearly.

498
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
Can I not understand?

499
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
How did you turn us over?

500
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Don't worry.

501
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Is this the truth?

502
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
How can you

503
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,560
be pregnant?

504
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,560
Mom, actually...

505
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Don't say it.

506
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
You two

507
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,560
don't act in front of me.

508
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
Why are you lying to me?

509
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,560
You lied to me.

510
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,560
You lied to an old lady like me.

511
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
I only have one wish.

512
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
I want to see Zijian

513
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
have a child.

514
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
But you

515
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
are lying to me.

516
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,560
I'm just an extra here.

517
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
You two

518
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
can live your own lives.

519
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,560
I will put up with your good will.

520
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
And I will keep saying

521
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
involve in your child.

522
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
What?

523
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
Don't take me wrong.

524
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,560
I will find someone to deal with.

525
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,560
So that they don't cheat on you.

526
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,200
I'll be back after sending Yangyang

527
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,800
Look at what time it is

528
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,480
No, otherwise you

529
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,760
You go to the door to win

530
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,640
You sit here all day and eat oranges

531
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,560
I'm not going

532
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,800
Who is worried about who goes

533
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,560
I'm not worried

534
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,520
You don't worry about what you shoot

535
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,360
You don't shoot

536
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,320
what to do

537
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,640
Mom, mom, mom, come back

538
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,000
Old Tang Comrade

539
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,520
Your gold little cotton wool is back

540
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,760
What is it

541
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,040
You can read newspapers without wearing flowers

542
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,840
Ignore the little cotton wool, right

543
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,120
Then I will think about it

544
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,960
How to date the five-four

545
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,840
Stop there

546
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,800
Don't

547
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,640
You stand there

548
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,240
Reporter Tan

549
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,080
Someone gave us

550
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,040
Email box for previous contact

551
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,240
Say it's your friend

552
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,320
Let me provide him with the clue

553
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,160
Is there a chance

554
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,320
I have been abroad recently

555
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,440
I haven't opened my computer much

556
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,720
There is also a problem with the phone

557
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,760
Can only answer

558
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,920
No one has contacted you

559
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,680
You didn't give him the clue, right

560
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,600
I didn't give him

561
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,120
That's weird

562
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,320
He said you gave him my email

563
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,320
And my email

564
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,680
Only you know

565
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,920
I promise I haven't given anyone

566
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,800
Moreover

567
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,520
If I let him contact you

568
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,720
How can I give him your previous email

569
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,480
I'm sorry

570
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,120
It's empty again

571
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,480
You said he will be with other comrades

572
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,560
Went out to celebrate his birthday

573
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,680
Chen Bai

574
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,200
How about calling Ke'er again

575
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,760
Don't

576
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,000
Three

577
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,040
One two three

578
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,160
One two three four

579
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,520
One two three four

580
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,840
Chen Bai, Ke'er

581
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,600
One two three four

582
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,920
One two three four

583
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,360
One two three four

584
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,480
One two three four

585
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,400
One two three four

586
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,240
One two three four

587
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,160
One two three four

588
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
One two three four

589
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,280
Ke'er's birthday

590
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,760
I should have called him just now

591
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,040
He should hear it

592
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,880
Young man, you have a good energy

593
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,560
Go back and add a meal for you

594
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,640
I'm not helping you

595
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,440
One two three four

596
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,280
One two three four

597
00:29:59,280 --> 00:29:59,960
Let's go

598
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,440
One two three four

599
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,800
One two three four

600
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,200
One two three four

601
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
One two three four

602
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,560
Think about it and say it

603
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,240
You are walking far away

604
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,160
Just pulled me

605
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,520
Relax

606
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,840
Give me some strength

607
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,960
Down

608
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,000
Four points soon

609
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,800
Come on

610
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,600
Almost almost

611
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,880
Stand up

612
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,280
Captain

613
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,080
Captain

614
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,720
it is good

615
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,080
What are you doing

616
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,280
Jiaxun

617
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,520
He asked for it himself

618
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Lin Zhenbo's gun

619
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,160
Come

620
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,080
Check the marine subject

621
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,360
Dig it down

622
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,400
I'll take a look

623
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,600
Love time

624
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,840
Two hours on Wednesday

625
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,160
Only eat for two hours on Friday

626
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,840
Four hours on Saturday

627
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,800
Two hours for lunch

628
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,840
And watch movies

629
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,320
Arrangement is quite clear

630
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,080
I don't know who

631
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,160
When I was in love

632
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
I lost one of my muscles

633
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,280
Love pig man

634
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,080
Captain

635
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,320
When did you fall in love

636
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,920
Come

637
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,000
You can't know in the south

638
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,240
The reporter must know

639
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,560
Did you make up

640
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,560
Of course

641
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,040
Confirmed relationship

642
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,640
Tang Xin

643
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,920
Can you find my girlfriend

644
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,960
I

645
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,120
You can just agree

646
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,880
What do you mean by agreeing

647
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,320
Can this be done

648
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,520
Must be determined and confirmed

649
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,080
The sense of ritual in love

650
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,760
Both sides reached consensus

651
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,680
That's love

652
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,320
Otherwise, your cousin is also detailed

653
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,280
The head is warm on the side

654
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,440
She kissed me

655
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,400
I kissed them

656
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,440
Captain, I support you

657
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,760
Keep going

658
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,640
Keep going

659
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,440
You can't tell

660
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,800
First, the subject

661
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,800
Mom still doesn't answer the phone

662
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,400
It's not worth it

663
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,560
I should have listened to you at the beginning

664
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,040
Why did you lie to me

665
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,120
Said I was going to have a baby

666
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,160
The matter has already happened

667
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,600
The current top priority

668
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,280
Is how to get mom back

669
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,400
This is all my fault

670
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,720
What are you talking about

671
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,120
I'm also wrong about this

672
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,240
By then, I will go with you

673
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Take mom back

674
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,040
But have you thought about it

675
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,640
If we three people in the future

676
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,800
Live together

677
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,520
There will still be contradictions

678
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,680
All family

679
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,440
This is what we did wrong

680
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,200
Can't let mom be disappointed

681
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,880
Be patient

682
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,840
So that the two of you can live happily

683
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,720
Mom

684
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,200
Mom

685
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,480
You Porco

686
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,600
What's the matter

687
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,840
already

688
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,720
Be patient

689
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,200
Don't talk accessories

690
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,120
Don't listen all their own

691
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,800
This brother

692
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,280
Regardless of the hatred

693
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,720
What to do

694
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,960
It's gathering

695
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,600
Has to be rescued

696
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,600
The

697
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,600
What's the hurry

698
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,760
I met me all of a sudden

699
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,400
Sit down

700
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,880
Is this

701
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,120
during my infirmary abroad

702
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,960
There is a mysterious person

703
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,760
He sent e-mails to my exposure

704
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,600
I'm sorry.

705
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,240
He claimed he was my friend.

706
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,000
He said I was busy in other places

707
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,920
and asked the informant to give him the clue.

708
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,040
He came to investigate for me.

709
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,920
He also asked my informant to meet me.

710
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,160
In this case,

711
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,120
didn't your informant check it?

712
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,600
He sent me an email.

713
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,960
But I didn't receive it abroad.

714
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,600
I saw it after I returned to China.

715
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,160
Then, remember carefully.

716
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,760
When you sent him the email,

717
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,800
did anyone accidentally see me?

718
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,200
No way.

719
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,280
The most important thing is

720
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,080
I can't let anyone see it.

721
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,880
I won't tell anyone about the email.

722
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,680
I remember you said

723
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,080
someone touched your computer

724
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,320
and changed the coordinates.

725
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,320
If your suspicion is true,

726
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,200
then this person

727
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,520
will definitely know his email.

728
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,960
Besides,

729
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,920
I didn't expect anyone else to do it.

730
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,520
He met him in the name of your friend.

731
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,920
It's obvious that he used you

732
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,360
to get this informant.

733
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,440
I think so too.

734
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,320
I really want to know

735
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,320
who the person is.

736
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
But I'm afraid

737
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,960
the informant will be in danger.

738
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,040
So I want to know your opinion.

739
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,680
Will you meet him or not?

740
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,680
How about this?

741
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,760
Go tell your informant

742
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,920
if this person

743
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,240
still wants to meet him,

744
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,400
promise him first.

745
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,880
The time is probably on the weekend.

746
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,000
But don't set a specific time and place.

747
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,360
Wait for me.

748
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,280
I'll go with you.

749
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:45,760
Okay.

750
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,160
Do as you said.

751
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
We must figure out

752
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,800
who this person is.

753
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,720
By the way,

754
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,640
ask your informant

755
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,480
to bring his mailbox here.

756
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,280
Got it.

757
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,040
You're going back to the army?

758
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,800
So soon?

759
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,320
Okay.

760
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,920
Then you

761
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,720
take care of yourself.

762
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,200
Okay, Mr. Sheng.

763
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,760
No problem.

764
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,680
Okay, Sunday.

765
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,160
See you on Sunday.

766
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,640
Okay.

767
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,080
Bye.

768
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,880
Mr. Han.

769
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,560
Tang is back from abroad.

770
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
He's already at work.

771
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,240

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,920
Han Yuheng,

790
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:38,800
Mr. Han.

791
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,520
Why are you here?

792
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,280
I ran because I had no schedule.

793
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,720
I know it's rude.

794
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,000
I have to tell you face to face.

795
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,320
What's so urgent?

796
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,160
When you were abroad,

797
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,640
as your friend,

798
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,160
I contacted the person who provided you

799
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,280
with the clues about the underwater relics.

800
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
How did you contact him?

801
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,840
Just like you.

802
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,560
By email.

803
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,240
You...

804
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,000
How did you get his email?

805
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,040
You know him?

806
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,160
I don't know him,

807
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,720
but I have my own channel.

808
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,520
What channel?

809
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,760
It's not important.

810
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,640
What's important is that I've made an appointment with him

811
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,960
to meet him as soon as possible.

812
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,280
Did he agree?

813
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:13,920
Yes.

814
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,360
And we made an appointment on Sunday.

815
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,280
He will notify me

816
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,800
the exact time and place in advance.

817
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,120
But he has a requirement.

818
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,520
You must be there

819
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,160
when we meet.

820
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,960
I still have to ask you.

821
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,240
How did you get his email?

822
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,760
I'm sorry.

823
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,320

824
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,600
But please believe me.

825
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,280
I just want to help you.

826
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,320

No hurry

881
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,820

Wait for him to come back.

Makes no difference.

890
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,820
Let all the burdens become a burden

891

Open the door of the future

00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:24,820
The sea of people can't separate us

00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,820
You are waiting for the heart to warm up

894
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:33,820
In the memory, why don't you take me

895
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:38,820
The time of regret is not enough

896
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,820
I still have the memories of my love

897
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,820
I don't want to regret it

898
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,820
Let the heart become a person

899
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,820
Leave my heart

900
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,820

Bright blood and light

902
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,820
The world is getting bigger and lonely

903
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,820
Only standing by your side

904
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:16,820
I always feel warm in my heart
