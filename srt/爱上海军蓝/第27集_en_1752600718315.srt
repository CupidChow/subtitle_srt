1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,200
The end is a never-changing me

2
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,200
No need to endure, no need to be afraid

3
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,600
Be your own friend and opponent

4
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,600
No one is looking at you

5
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,800
Be yourself

6
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,600
Be yourself

7
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Be yourself

8
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,000
Where are you to others?

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,600
The captain is not here these days

10
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
The captain has always trained us

11
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
All go back to teach

12
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
I am not very angry

13
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
I can't even eat

14
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Go to me alone

15
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,000
The member also went back to sleep

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,800
He didn't

17
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,200
He went to the hospital to talk to the captain about something new

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,400
I can't sleep because of my girlfriend recently

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,200
I want to have a return dance in the college entrance examination

20
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,400
Who told you to teach the rope

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,600
The adults don't understand

22
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,600
The first five soldiers

23
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,800
It will be fine after the return dance

24
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Still say return dance

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,000
All the return dancers

26
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,200
The original place should be returned in September

27
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,400
Later, the injury was delayed

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,000
Cheng Yuan

29
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Originally because of Wu Ke

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,800
I feel guilty about his entry into the valley

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Now it's good to doubt life directly

32
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,400
Who advises is not good

33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,000
I hope the captain can make it clear to him

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,000
Cheng Yuan won't return

35
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Of course he won't

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,800
But I want love and career to be hard to do

37
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,760
You can't say

38
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,200
Can my eyes look at me

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,600
When I say you are so chubby

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,200
You can't talk well

41
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Look at it

42
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,600
Tang Xin

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,920
You better be good

44
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,200
Your dad knows you're ill

45
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,520
It's almost too much for you, do you know

46
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,800
dad

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Sorry i'm wrong

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,440
Didn't tell you and my mom

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,720
Be careful next time.

50
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,920
This...

51
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,200
Just a mistake and you're done.

52
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,760
Are you a wild monkey?

53
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,040
You're always making trouble outside.

54
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,960
You never do anything wrong.

55
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,200
You're a kidnapper.

56
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,240
Why did you mess with her?

57
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,040
I was kidnapped this time.

58
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,520
I didn't kidnap anyone.

59
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,160
You can't give me such a bad name.

60
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,880
Look at her.

61
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,720
She's still talking.

62
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,520
You...

63
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,080
I'm just trying to make sense.

64
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,480
You can't come to the hospital

65
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,040
and make trouble for me.

66
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,920
I...

67
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,440
Wu Si.

68
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,720
You saw it, right?

69
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,480
Is it right to talk to your parents like that?

70
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,400
She's only

71
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,200
10 words to me.

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,720
You know your daughter doesn't like to hear you talk.

73
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,040
Just say a few words.

74
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,320
You can't tell who she likes to hear.

75
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,320
Fine.

76
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,720
I won't say it.

77
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,280
Wu Si, say it.

78
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,400
What did I say?

79
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,040
Mr. Tang didn't understand.

80
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,320
He asked you to teach me.

81
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,600
Don't be afraid.

82
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,840
I'm here.

83
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,160
Say it.

84
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,600
Right, you.

85
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,240
Write a letter.

86
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,000
Come on.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,720
Say it.

88
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
Mr. Tang only listens to our captain.

89
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,440
I'm not talking.

90
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,320
I'm leaving now.

91
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,560
What? You're leaving?

92
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,920
What did you say? You're leaving?

93
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,160
You have to say it.

94
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,800
Mr. Tang.

95
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,080
Aunt.

96
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,560
Your family is here today.

97
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,280
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

98
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,600
Let's have a good chat.

99
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,400
Let's have a rest.

100
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,120
I won't bother you.

101
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll deal with him for a while.

102
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,560
I think Tang Xin

103
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,400
made no big mistakes this time.

104
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,720
When she makes a mistake next time,

105
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
I'll criticize her and educate her.

106
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,560
You.

107
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,360
Look.

108
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,040
You're so scared

109
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,200
by that young man.

110
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,040
You're scared.

111
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,400
He's in a bad mood.

112
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,640
I think you should be more careful.

113
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
I'm sweating.

114
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,280
You're so...

115
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,640
What's up? Say it.

116
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,280
Nothing serious.

117
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,360
You've been my comrade-in-arms for so many years.

118
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,080
I know what you're like.

119
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,800
There's a problem.

120
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,240
Is it about Ke'er?

121
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,520
About the fight.

122
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,000
She forced you?

123
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,720
She never forced me.

124
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,320
Dad.

125
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,560
Dad.

126
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,640
You're wrong.

127
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,920
Continue to lecture her.

128
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,240
I promise I won't break my promise this time.

129
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,120
Me?

130
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,240
Can I lecture you?

131
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,480
Can I teach you?

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,040
Dad.

133
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:14,920
Look.

134
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,400
I'm in the hospital.

135
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,920
Why are you so fierce?

136
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,440
You're in the hospital.

137
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,400
Where did you get hurt?

138
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,960
It's okay.

139
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,880
I'm almost recovered.

140
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,240
Tell me. Where did you get hurt?

141
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,040
My neck.

142
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,640
The doctor asked me to take off the coat today.

143
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,840
He said I could take it off.

144
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,520
Does it hurt?

145
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,760
It's okay now.

146
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,960
Look at it.

147
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,480
It's okay.

148
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,440
It's in front and back.

149
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,200
You move it.

150
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,080
Does it hurt?

151
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,960
Look.

152
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,000
How is it?

153
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,840
You're a good talker.

154
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,200
Come on.

155
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,840
Look.

156
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,640
You can eat.

157
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
It's okay.

158
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,440
It's okay.

159
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,480
It's okay.

160
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,080
During the college entrance examination,

161
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,240
we agreed to go to the same university.

162
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,640
But I changed my mind and joined the army.

163
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,960
She went to school by herself.

164
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,520
She waited for me to retire.

165
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,200
But I like Junying so much.

166
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,920
She didn't leave.

167
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,640
She can't stand the one-man army.

168
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,120
She came to the army impulsively.

169
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,360
Hello, Ke'er.

170
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,000
What's up?

171
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,360
Cheng Yuan.

172
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,320
Guess where I am.

173
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,560
Where are you?

174
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,680
Where else can you be if you're not at school?

175
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,200
Listen.

176
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,480
Your girlfriend, Wu Ke'er,

177
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,120
is now in Wenzhou

178
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,200
for the training of college students.

179
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,880
Wenzhou for the training of college students?

180
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,160
Are you in Xinmei Lian?

181
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,160
Yes.

182
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,120
I finally got the phone from the monitor.

183
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,240
Are we close?

184
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,560
Will we

185
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,680
meet every day in the future?

186
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,160
Ke'er.

187
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,640
Our camp is not in the same place.

188
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,160
I've been with her for almost ten years.

189
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,040
I didn't give her anything.

190
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,680
How many ten years can a girl have?

191
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,720
That's the ten years of you two.

192
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,560
You're thinking about

193
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,040
your relationship alone.

194
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,960
What are you thinking of?

195
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,080
You don't tell anyone.

196
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,520
You must ask someone to understand you.

197
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,480
Why?

198
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,320
So harsh.

199
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,520
You and Ke'er have been in love for more than ten years.

200
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,400
No one is sorry to anyone.

201
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,920
But Ke'er has done more than you.

202
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,760
You have to explain to her.

203
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,080
Ke'er has been retired for a while.

204
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,000
Think about it.

205
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,920
No matter what happens,

206
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,080
try not to hurt her.

207
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,800
What's going on in China?

208
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,800
It's peaceful and quiet.

209
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,280
The police have never been to the company.

210
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,760
I think it's not a good thing.

211
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,200
I think so.

212
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,960
It seems that

213
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,120
Xu Genshui

214
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,200
doesn't have anything

215
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,840
that's practical.

216
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,280
Yes, Dad.

217
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,280
We've been out for so long.

218
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,840
When will we go back?

219
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,560
We'll see.

220
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,400
I'll go back.

221
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,560
I won't be too hard on you.

222
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Let's get started.

223
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,320
Our anesthesia department is special.

224
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,520
We have to stop at noon.

225
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,600
We have to start right away if necessary.

226
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,720
We don't have time to give you too much time to adapt.

227
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,320
You lacked practical experience before.

228
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,720
I'm worried that you're not prepared enough.

229
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,960
Director, when I was an intern,

230
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,400
I had a surgery with the whole department.

231
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,200
I'm prepared.

232
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,240
You're just a student

233
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,720
during the internship and the surgery.

234
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,360
Your teacher and senior

235
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,480
are responsible for the patient's life.

236
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,960
It's very different from

237
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,480
going on stage by yourself.

238
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,800
According to the custom,

239
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,400
I have to give you a question.

240
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,480
When anesthesia is in the outside of the immune system,

241
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,680
the incision needle enters the

242
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,800
judgment index of the external immune system.

243
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,520
The acute disease of anesthesia outside the immune system.

244
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,160
How to deal with Hou Jinglan.

245
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,880
Three questions, 15 minutes.

246
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,440
The first question.

247
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
The competition.

248
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,560
You have to hand in your paper.

249
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,840
The winter season combat training has come down.

250
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,360
This training is different from the past.

251
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,720
I'm going to pull you out.

252
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,360
The target is a southern training base

253
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,560
thousands of kilometers away.

254
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,640
Do you know what this means?

255
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,960
It means that in the traditional sense,

256
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,440
as a navy combat team of the two-stage combat troops,

257
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,960
we are turning into a elite army

258
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,000
that can carry out long-range missions

259
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
in many areas.

260
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,400
This time, you will have more interactive training

261
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,280
with other soldiers.

262
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,680
When necessary, we will arrange a south-south offensive

263
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,840
to fight against ten soldiers.

264
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Bring me the guys who are watching.

265
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,520
Don't be stingy.

266
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,880
As my daughter said,

267
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,720
the cut is big.

268
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,320
Yes.

269
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,680
Brigadier.

270
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,040
What are you looking at?

271
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,760
So serious.

272
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,840
Report.

273
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,520
These days, I have been training them on the sea.

274
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,960
I want to use an effective media

275
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,440
to let them be on the mobile device

276
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,720
like planes and ships

277
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,000
to keep the target stable.

278
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,920
Good idea.

279
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,680
Do you have a way out?

280
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,840
Not yet.

281
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,760
But I want to approach

282
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,400
the balance and locking equipment of the camera.

283
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,600
Be bold.

284
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,800
If you have a problem, just tell me.

285
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,360
But stop for today.

286
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,680
Go to the hospital with me to see Wang Chen.

287
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,880
And bring your captain back.

288
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,360
Yes.

289
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,200
Mom.

290
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:23,920
Mom.

291
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,120
Come on, quick.

292
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,160
Hmm, myself?

293
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,040
Hello, dear.

294
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,200
I am going to a job interview today.

295
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,040
How was it?

296
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,640
Was everything successful?

297
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,440
You may not know.

298
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,320
The person who wins the job interview

299
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,120
is smart with me.

300
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,480
It is the anesthetics doctor

301
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,520
I've got all the questions

302
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,800
I asked you.

303
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,960
I feel pretty smooth.

304
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
I told you.

305
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,960
My wife must be the best,

306
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,640
right?

307
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,800
Then,

308
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
would you like to

309
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,120
treat your best wife

310
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,240
to a big meal

311
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,640
as a reward?

312
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,080
Well,

313
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,920
wife,

314
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,600
I have something to tell you.

315
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,840
What's wrong again?

316
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,800
I'm going to

317
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,040
attend a new task soon.

318
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
How long?

319
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,360
I'm not sure about the time.

320
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,240
And I might have to

321
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,520
go to the hospital with the Brigadier

322
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,680
to see Captain Chen.

323
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,320
I may not be able to come back to see you.

324
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,400
It's okay.

325
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,640
You don't have to come to see me once.

326
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,920
I'm at my parents' house.

327
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,760
Don't worry.

328
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,320
I'm sorry.

329
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,080
I'm going out again.

330
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,920
It's really okay.

331
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,120
Come back early.

332
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
Be safe.

333
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,720
Well,

334
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,520
once you get the interview result,

335
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,160
send me a message, okay?

336
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,120
Don't be nervous. Trust yourself.

337
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
You can do it.

338
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,760
Love you.

339
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,280
I love you, too.

340
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,880
Come back soon.

341
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,320
Can I have those six months?

342
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,280
No, it's late.

343
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,040
Remember to buy some biscuits.

344
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,840
I haven't had smiled this evening.

345
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,440
I'm in a good mood.

346
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,120
Make some coffee before continuing with work.

347
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,400
That's it for today.

348
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,160
Dad.

349
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,560
Dad.

350
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,960
Brother.

351
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,200
I know

352
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,160
you two came back yesterday.

353
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,520
But you only told me to come to the company today.

354
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,960
It takes a day

355
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,440
to discuss

356
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,440
how to deal with me.

357
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,320
What nonsense are you talking about?

358
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,080
We're a family.

359
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,840
What can I and your brother deal with you?

360
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,040
Because what you did

361
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,960
I already know.

362
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,200
Tang Xin was kidnapped in Luoman.

363
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,760
No need to guess.

364
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,080
I knew it was you.

365
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,600
But I don't have any evidence.

366
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,720
I admit it.

367
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,680
But now I have

368
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,960
my brother's video

369
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,440
planning the whole kidnapping case.

370
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,120
You usually make some dirty money

371
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,720
and do dirty things.

372
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
I can admit it.

373
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,280
But I can't bear

374
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,800
to kill people.

375
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,280
Han Yu Hang.

376
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,240
What do you want?

377
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,520
Dad.

378
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,720
The Atoha Company in Luoma

379
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,480
was also opened by you, right?

380
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,320
This is also what your female reporter

381
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,200
told you, right?

382
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,760
Brother.

383
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,240
Do you think only Tang Xin is investigating you?

384
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,440
Since I heard that email

385
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,640
from your company,

386
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,200
I've started to doubt it.

387
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,480
I went to Luoma

388
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,520
not to pursue Tang Xin.

389
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,480
I went to investigate the truth.

390
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,480
Not bad.

391
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,080
I opened the Atoha Company

392
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,440
with them.

393
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:45,840
What's wrong?

394
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,760
Otherwise, why do you think

395
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,960
you have today?

396
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,040
What remains of Tang Xin

397
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,720
matters more than the parents' lives.

398
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,960
There are suspicious information

399
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,640
involved in the misunderstanding.

400
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,080
Out of such ears,

401
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,440
some of your friends

402
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,440
were 11 years old when they died.

403
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,240
I have见过

404
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
some lab 언니

405
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,720
who has played the role

406
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,000
of the picture-bending police.

407
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,440
She was the most experienced

408
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,800
in wrong瞓 that Joseph

409
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,200
had ever known.

410
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,960
I'm not involved in your business.

411
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,840
Do you understand?

412
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,080
Believe it or not,

413
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,560
I'm just saying it.

414
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,320
We're not telling you

415
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,520
to protect you.

416
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,000
Do you understand?

417
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,840
If you really want me to be good,

418
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,200
just quit Changshou Group.

419
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,720
Give Changshou to me.

420
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,440
Dad,

421
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,200
did I hear it wrong?

422
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,960
What does he want?

423
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,320
He wants Changshou Group?

424
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,920
Now I finally understand

425
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,560
why you did all this.

426
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,480
I want to reorganize Changshou

427
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,760
and turn Changshou Group

428
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,920
into a clean company.

429
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,080
I won't mess with

430
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,480
dirty things or money.

431
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,560
I'm just saying.

432
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,840
Do you really think you're a noble man?

433
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,400
If we hadn't earned this dirty money,

434
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,600
you wouldn't be where you are now.

435
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,280
Don't talk like that.

436
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,640
Dad,

437
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,480
Dad,

438
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
to be honest,

439
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,320
we can't

440
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,960
spend our money forever.

441
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,680
Why are you so obsessed?

442
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,440
Why don't you

443
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,080
just end it

444
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,000
and enjoy your life?

445
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,240
Besides, Changshou Group

446
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,840
is your life's hard work.

447
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,280
Do you want to

448
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,640
destroy it yourself?

449
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,720
Fine.

450
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,040
You have guts.

451
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,160
Just give the evidence

452
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,120
to the Public Security Bureau.

453
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,520
Do you think I don't dare to do it?

454
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,280
Go ahead!

455
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,920
Enough!

456
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,040
Get out.

457
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,240
Dad,

458
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,400
Dad.

459
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,240
Get out!

460
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,720
Lin Jing.

461
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,280
Xiaolai.

462
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,240
Thank you for your hard work.

463
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,280
How is it?

464
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,560
Are you listening to the meeting?

465
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,640
What you said

466
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,280
is ten thousand times better than what I said.

467
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,000
Right, Leader?

468
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,880
Dr. Yang said

469
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,440
it's a miracle

470
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,160
that he can recover like this.

471
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,240
Dr. Yang said it's a miracle

472
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,440
that he can recover like this.

473
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,200
Don't look at the five-four

474
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,480
and can't cure Tang Xin.

475
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,360
But they are

476
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,440
in a good shape.

477
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,000
Yes.

478
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,000
Mr. Lu,

479
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,400
why are you here today?

480
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,600
I'm here to see Dr. Yang.

481
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,320
Why are you here today?

482
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,360
The troops are going to set out.

483
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,880
I came to see you before I left.

484
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:28,960
Where are you going?

485
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,920
To the main office.

486
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,760
Wang Chen,

487
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,440
I know you feel bad.

488
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,600
But it's also a special task

489
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,200
to do well in recovery training.

490
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,360
Remember this, Wang Chen.

491
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,040
As long as you are willing,

492
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,680
you will always be the Blue Team.

493
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,200
I'm afraid I'll

494
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,160
drag the team down.

495
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,480
What are you talking about?

496
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,240
Who's dragging you down?

497
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,720
The soldiers of the Blue Team

498
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,680
are all strong.

499
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,600
Don't think I'm the old Blue Team

500
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,400
from twenty years ago.

501
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,200
But now,

502
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,120
they may not be able to beat me.

503
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,200
Yes.

504
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,880
Captain Chen,

505
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,440
don't come back in a hurry.

506
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,760
Give us some time to catch up.

507
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,320
Right, Captain Chen.

508
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,400
I only did thirty rounds today.

509
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,000
Zong Qing, you caught him for training.

510
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,360
You only did thirty rounds.

511
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,080
Captain,

512
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,800
we can catch up with the rest

513
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,840
in time.

514
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,320
And get some space.

515
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,600
Yes.

516
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,160
Xiao Bai,

517
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,960
we're all doing it this time.

518
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,000
For the recovery training,

519
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,920
please ask your mother and you.

520
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,120
If you have any questions,

521
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,440
please contact me at any time.

522
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,280
Captain, please don't say that.

523
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,000
This is what our family

524
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,920
should do.

525
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,960
Yes.

526
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Comrade Wang Chen,

527
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,400
after this period of recovery training,

528
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,040
you have reached the standard of being discharged.

529
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,720
You can be discharged soon.

530
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,120
That's great.

531
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,840
That's great.

532
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,760
Good.

533
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,520
You're happy.

534
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,160
Because of Yu Hang,

535
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,880
Sheng Qi is worried.

536
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,800
You're still angry

537
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,080
at Yu Hang's scuffling?

538
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,840
Yutian,

539
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,400
let me ask you,

540
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,040
what did you

541
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,200
think

542
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,320
about him that day?

543
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,440
Didn't you say

544
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,600
It's good to be angry

545
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,360
If you can't, you can pull it into the fire

546
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,160
He will understand slowly

547
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,000
No

548
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I haven't let him stick to the edge for so many years

549
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,040
You involve him at this time

550
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,920
No way

551
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,920
I thought about it for a long time

552
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,360
I think what Yu Hang said

553
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,400
Makes sense

554
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,880
dad

555
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What do you mean

556
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,880
Really want to give the group to Yu Hang

557
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,880
dad

558
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,040
You shouldn't be confused at this time

559
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,440
Have you thought about it

560
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,720
This matter has been so long

561
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,120
Why is there no movement from the police?

562
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,920
That's because

563
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,240
Whether it's that Wei Jiangnan

564
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,800
Xu Gengshui

565
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,200
And that female reporter Tang Xin

566
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,920
They don't have anything

567
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,240
Realistic evidence

568
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,400
It looks like this

569
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,600
But you think

570
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,240
Now the police have no evidence

571
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,120
Won't you continue to investigate?

572
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,600
I think so

573
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,680
Now is a

574
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,040
The best time to leave

575
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,680
simply

576
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,680
Just like Yu Hang said

577
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,800
Give him the whole group's salary

578
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,840
Let's go abroad

579
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,280
dad

580
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,480
I don't want to give the group to Yu Hang

581
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
just

582
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,920
If we go abroad

583
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,120
No group

584
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,040
If the current business is covered

585
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,760
It's not convenient for us to do things

586
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,640
What cover do you need abroad?

587
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,160
No need to cover up

588
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,640
dad

589
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,520
Such a big thing

590
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,280
Think about it again

591
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,760
I've been thinking about this for a long time

592
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,160
It's settled

593
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,880
You sit down and prepare

594
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,400
will

595
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,200
Ok

596
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,760
Tang Xin

597
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,680
Tomorrow

598
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,960
I'm going back to the army

599
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,600
A mission

600
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,960
I am the captain

601
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,160
Must wait late

602
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,480
I never need to explain.

603
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,080
So,

604
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,840
I can't go with you tomorrow.

605
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,080
Go home after you're done with the discharge.

606
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,160
Have a good rest.

607
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,280
I know.

608
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,600
Don't worry.

609
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,280
It's okay.

610
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,160
I'll go with you.

611
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
I'll go with you.

612
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,880
I have good news for you.

613
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,400
Really?

614
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,800
Wang Chen's recovery is very ideal.

615
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,600
He's already been discharged early.

616
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,160
He'll be home tomorrow.

617
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,080
At this rate,

618
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,640
he'll be back to Lanren soon.

619
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,680
Maybe

620
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,120
he'll come back next time.

621
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,720
Mr. Wang.

622
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,360
If he wants to come back,

623
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,600
he'll definitely come back.

624
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,320
I know you all hope he can come back.

625
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,120
But you've seen it too.

626
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,640
During this time,

627
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,120
Wang Chen

628
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,160
has been going through a lot.

629
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,560
In such a short time,

630
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,920
it's not easy for him to

631
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,320
recover to a normal person's level.

632
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,720
Do you really want him to come back?

633
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,480
Tang Xin.

634
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,920
I think you may not know

635
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,240
Wang Chen

636
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,280
and Junren's thoughts.

637
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,320
I may not know Junren well enough.

638
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,240
But I know people.

639
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,040
I know a woman.

640
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,120
Wang Chen has a family.

641
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,240
She has a lover.

642
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,000
After she's been through

643
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,680
such a big pain,

644
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,920
even if

645
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,800
she wants to come back to the front line,

646
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,040
it shouldn't be because

647
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,640
of your expectations.

648
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,600
She has the right to choose her own life.

649
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,200
Of course she has the right

650
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,640
to choose her own life.

651
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,400
She can choose to live in a small house

652
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,240
or a big house.

653
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,160
No one can criticize her.

654
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,640
As long as she can

655
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,080
take off her uniform.

656
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm sorry.

657
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,160
I just want him to come back.

658
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,800
I hope he can come back.

659
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,840
You have to

660
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,760
visit Wang Chen before you leave.

661
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,640
You should go.

662
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,800
I'll go with you.

663
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,000
I'm going to rest.

664
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,920
Wang Chen,

665
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,160
you're leaving the hospital tomorrow.

666
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,880
Congratulations.

667
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,760
You're leaving tomorrow too?

668
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,440
It's been a hard time.

669
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,040
Go home and have a good rest.

670
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,360
I can't rest.

671
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,600
If I rest,

672
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,880
I'll be transferred

673
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,080
to the next practice.

674
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,600
Cheng Yue,

675
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,120
do you remember?

676
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,520
In the past,

677
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,800
Yi Nan Wang was in the exam and transferred to the government.

678
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,600
He was crazy about training every day.

679
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,000
He didn't listen to

680
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,800
anyone who taught him.

681
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,840
He only listened to one person.

682
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,920
Captain Chen told him

683
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,640
that training is temporary.

684
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,600
The body is a lifetime thing.

685
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,520
Only if you keep going

686
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,320
and stay strong,

687
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,280
can you work harder.

688
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,200
I remember.

689
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,400
You're a role model for Yi Nan Wang.

690
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,080
So you have to

691
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,920
do what you said.

692
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,080
I'll leave tomorrow.

693
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,800
I can't send you out of the hospital.

694
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,680
See you later.

695
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:03,960
Captain.

696
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,800
Give us

697
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,640
the 700,000 yuan.

698
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,360
You're back.

699
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,440
Did I wake you up?

700
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,760
No.

701
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,000
You can get a bad

702
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,240
finger order first.

703
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,240
It's all order.

704
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,640
No matter where you go to act, there will always be water.

705
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,520
Let me their social media for you.

706
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,120
Let's Monster

707
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,560
Ask them to help you.

708
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,540
Frances,

709
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,920
you have something important to tell tomorrow.

710
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,620
I'll send you the details later.

711
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,140
I'm home.

712
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,780
I was just about to go downstairs to pick you up.

713
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,180
No need.

714
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,020
It's so fast.

715
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,180
Slow down.

716
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,060
It'll be fine when we get back.

717
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,700
We're home.

718
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,740
Look.

719
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,020
It's a bit heavy.

720
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,460
From now on,

721
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,180
we'll be doing recovery at home.

722
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:13,860
Look.

723
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,700
I've bought the equipment.

724
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,020
It's all assembled.

725
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,540
The conditions

726
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,940
are not worse than in the hospital.

727
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,740
But it's definitely more comfortable than in the hospital.

728
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,300
That's right.

729
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,500
How do you feel about

730
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,100
having a recovery chair at home?

731
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,140
Hold me.

732
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,380
Let's go.

733
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,820
What's so uncomfortable about it?

734
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,780
Just think of it as

735
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,980
we have a big toy

736
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,300
in our house now.

737
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,860
That's right.

738
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,340
In the future,

739
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,260
when Zi Jian goes to work in the day,

740
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,900
I'll be with you doing the recovery at home.

741
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,460
Okay.

742
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,100
I'll go cook for you.

743
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,260
Thank you, Mom.

744
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,260
It's fine.

745
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,300
It's fine, wife.

746
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,940
Don't be unhappy.

747
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,820
I'll be with you every day.

748
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,580
I'll practice with you.

749
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,820
It's great to work out together.

750
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,660
I want some water.

751
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,660
I'll pour it for you.

752
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,780
It's almost done. Look.

753
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,580
I think

754
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,860
it's better to cut this part to the front.

755
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,660
This music is for this part.

756
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,180
I'll make a call.

757
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:26,940
Okay.

758
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,700
Don't make a mistake.

759
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,340
Don't talk.

760
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:28,860
Okay.

761
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,980
This one is good.

762
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,500
Okay.

763
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,260
Hello, Xin.

764
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:42,860
It's me.

765
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,060
Hello, Zong Xin.

766
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,700
What's up?

767
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,140
Are you busy now?

768
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,500
I'm out of the hospital.

769
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,460
I'm going home.

770
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,300
Can you come over?

771
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,260
I have something to tell you.

772
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:53,780
What's the matter?

773
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,980
You can't say it on the phone.

774
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,700
I can't make it clear on the phone.

775
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,860
I have to tell you in person.

776
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,100
I'll send you the address now.

777
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,620
Cheng Yue and I will wait for you here.

778
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,820
You can leave now.

779
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,620
I think we should

780
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,020
change the music.

781
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,660
Don't mess it up.

782
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,860
My music is so good.

783
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,740
It...

784
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,300
It...

785
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,580
It doesn't work.

786
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,820
It's stuck.

787
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,220
You don't even try it

788
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,340
when you come out.

789
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,260
Of course I do.

790
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,660
I tried it before I came out.

791
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,220
Why...

792
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,980
What's wrong with you?

793
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,460
It's okay, Captain Zeng.

794
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,740
We still have time.

795
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,260
Here.

796
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,260
The number you have dialed is currently...

797
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,060
I'm almost there.

798
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,020
Why didn't you answer the phone?

799
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,780
...the number you have dialed is currently...

800
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,420
Sorry.

801
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,540
The number you have dialed is currently...

802
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,060
Sorry.

803
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,580
...the number you have dialed is currently...

804
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,420
Call 54.

805
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,020
Come on.

806
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,780
So weird.

807
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,620
It hasn't picked up.

808
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,060
I'm here to see you.

809
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,540
Isn't this a homestay?

810
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,860
Why do you want me to come here?

811
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,460
Zong Qing, Ying Cheng Yuan, I'm here.

812
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,620
Where are you?

813
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,780
Hurry up.

814
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,300
Don't rush.

815
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,300
Is anyone here?

816
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,020
I'm here.

817
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:30,900
Where are you?

818
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,020
Why don't you reply to my message?

819
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,620
Did you move?

820
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,220
Yes, yes, yes.

821
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,660
I said I can't move.

822
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,260
Let's see what you're missing.

823
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,580
Boss!

824
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,500
What is it?

825
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,620
Song Qing, three orders.

826
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,380
Drop us the money.

827
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,100
What's wrong?

828
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,180
After seeing the full records I've got,

829
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,360
I passed my check on her,

830
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,020
and then!

831
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,700
Put down!

832
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,420
generator.

833
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,020
Starting on the 1st morning,

834
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,060
I'll have a meeting with him at mid-night.

835
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,220
Here.

836
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,420
This oil.

837
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,380
Take it.

838
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:04,860
You can make me feel at ease

839
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:09,860
Let everything look romantic

840
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,860
The dream is also so ordinary

841
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:20,860
But in your heart, there are more expectations

842
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,860
I really understand

843
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,860
You say love is too vague

844
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:33,860
But you give me an answer with your eyes

845
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:37,860
With all my heart, I can be with you

846
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,860
When did you learn to play these tricks?

847
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,860
Zeng Xin and Cheng Yue helped me

848
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:50,860
Then what is this?

849
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,860
Propose?

850
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,860
Proposing requires a ring

851
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,860
I was too hasty this time

852
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,860
I didn't prepare

853
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:03,860
Just take this flower as a token

854
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,860
I will definitely come back before the end

855
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,860
Tang Xin

856
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,860
I'm wearing a uniform today

857
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,860
I can't go down alone

858
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,860
But I promise you here

859
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,860
Protected by time

860
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,860
I will protect you like my motherland

861
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,860
And our family

862
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:35,860
Loyal to the country, loyal to the people

863
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:40,860
Loyal to the mission, loyal to you

864
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:45,860
With all my heart, I can be with you

865
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,860
Effective for life

866
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,860
Hope you marry me

867
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,860
I'm glad you wake up from the past

868
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:56,860
Why do you suddenly want to propose?

869
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,860
I was going to come back for the mission

870
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,860
But I think about it all night

871
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,860
I don't want to wait any longer

872
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,860
I think there is a home now

873
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:10,860
There is a home that you have been waiting for me at home

874
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,860
Do you want to be with me?

875
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,860
Thank you for being with me

876
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:23,860
The cold snow and the cold rain

877
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,860
The world is bigger and more lonely

878
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,860
Only by your side

879
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:36,860
I feel warm in my heart

880
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,860
Is it a regular symptom?

881
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,860
Sorry, Xin

882
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,860
I didn't mean to interrupt you

883
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,860
Xinxin, the time is tight

884
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,860
The arrangement is a bit simple

885
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,860
Be considerate

886
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,860
Sister-in-law, the captain is sincere

887
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,860
Promise him

888
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,860
Promise him

889
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,860
Wu Si

890
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,860
I can't promise you now

891
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,860
Wait for you to come back

892
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,860
Wait for you to come back safely

893
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,860
Come and listen to my answer

894
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,860
I know this proposal is more sudden

895
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,860
I will give you time to think about it

896
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,860
Waiting for your answer

897
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,860
Give me your phone

898
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,860
I know the secret of the army

899
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,860
So I won't ask you where you are going

900
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,860
I won't ask you how long you will be there

901
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,860
What you are going to do

902
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,860
But I hope you can remember it when you are outside

903
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,860
Remember this greeting

904
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,860
Remember you are coming back

905
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:11,860
Come back

906
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,860

907
