00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The End

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The number you have dialed is not available for now

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Please redial later

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Sorry

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The number you have dialed is not available for now

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Please redial later

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Sorry

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The number you have dialed is not available for now

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Please redial later

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Honey

11
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Make the captain give away his friend

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's not acting

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,720
We're surrounded not far away.

14
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,120
He Three Level five

15
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:47,300
is close to the

16
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,120
captain,

17
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,320
I think we should delete it.

18
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,280
After so much time,

19
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,320
is it useful to delete it?

20
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,280
I've seen it.

21
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:55,880
Captain,

22
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,040
can you tell me

23
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,200
what you're thinking?

24
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,800
Zong Qing taught me.

25
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,160
I taught you like this?

26
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,040
I told you to make a public relationship.

27
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,640
Did I tell you to go on a trip?

28
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,360
Why did you send a photo?

29
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,600
To find a job for someone?

30
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,280
Isn't this a public relationship?

31
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,920
Is this a notice?

32
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,200
I think it's a notice.

33
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,560
If you want to post a case,

34
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,600
you need to issue an investigation order.

35
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,520
What should we do?

36
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,800
Do these plan well so that

37
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:32,920
No one can open the

38
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:46,880
momentary

39
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,520
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,240
Don't shake your head.

41
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,720
I've prepared it.

42
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,680
Read the question.

43
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,120
If there's any question,

44
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,760
please answer it.

45
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,400
Got it?

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,960
Yes.

47
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,760
Okay.

48
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,720
Come on.

49
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,680
Captain Gu.

50
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,880
I'm done.

51
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,960
Is it convenient for you to talk?

52
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,280
Yes.

53
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,160
It's convenient.

54
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,320
It's okay.

55
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,440
I just sent you a small package.

56
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,440
Remember to check it later.

57
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,320
Good night.

58
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,800
It's okay.

59
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,240
It's okay.

60
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,360
I sent the package.

61
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,000
It's okay.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,560
It's beautiful.

63
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,440
I like this one.

64
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,680
So you're a good-for-nothing.

65
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,280
Captain is attractive.

66
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,800
Sister-in-law is so kind.

67
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,760
Jiang Lin is here, too.

68
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,320
It's okay.

69
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,360
I like a good-for-nothing like you.

70
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,920
Yeah.

71
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,400
It's okay.

72
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,360
Family status.

73
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,920
It's good.

74
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,480
It's good.

75
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,440
It's good.

76
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,880
Three stars, two hundred million.

77
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,800
Yang Bian, Fen Ti.

78
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,240
One horse, one horse.

79
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
All-round, practical.

80
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,120
Brass, iron, iron, iron.

81
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,560
Performance, guarantee.

82
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,120
Okay.

83
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,680
Come on.

84
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,360
Come on.

85
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,080
Let's get started.

86
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,560
Ladies and gentlemen.

87
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,360
Would you like to try

88
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,240
the latest

89
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,200
Zichen's tobacco

90
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,400
with white perfume?

91
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,360
What brand is it?

92
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,240
It's Meiduo.

93
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,960
It's an international drug brand.

94
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,920
High-end, high-end.

95
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,040
Meiduo?

96
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,240
The brand with three lines

97
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,120
outside the brand name.

98
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,960
Didn't Yan Xian'an say

99
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,120
the formula is good for your skin?

100
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,920
No.

101
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,560
Our brand

102
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,160
is certified by the National Institute of Technology.

103
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,440
The reason you said

104
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,320
is actually because

105
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,440
our purifying solution

106
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,320
is very good.

107
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,280
After using it,

108
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,040
you can get the toxins out of your skin.

109
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,840
Come on.

110
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,720
What era is it?

111
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,400
You're lying with this kind of excuse.

112
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,160
At least watch Lan Dawang's video

113
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,520
and learn some professional language.

114
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,960
You've been into Lan Dawang recently, too?

115
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,360
Yeah.

116
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,840
I'm telling you.

117
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,120
I've been so obsessed with him recently.

118
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,000
Me, too.

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,280
His videos are full of dry goods.

120
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,840
Really.

121
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,040
Have you seen that video?

122
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,520
Really.

123
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,240
Let's go. I'll find you.

124
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,400
Manager.

125
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,560
With Lan Dawang here,

126
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,080
I think we can

127
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,120
keep the restaurant

128
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,000
as long as we don't lose our job.

129
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,520
Do your job well.

130
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,120
Leave the rest to the company.

131
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,240
Go.

132
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,480
How can you

133
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,760
be so stingy with your son-in-law?

134
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,200
When did our Xingxing

135
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,040
visit the Military Museum?

136
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,200
What do you know?

137
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,000
I asked Lin Nan

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,600
to get the tickets.

139
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,000
It's the 70th anniversary of the Navy.

140
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,720
It's just an exhibition.

141
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,640
I don't know what you're up to.

142
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,880
It's not an exhibition.

143
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,320
You know that.

144
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,680
I've been in the Navy for most of my life.

145
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,760
I've never regretted it.

146
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,520
The only regret I have

147
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,520
is to owe you two.

148
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,480
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,960
Xingxing is a daughter of a soldier.

150
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,800
She needs to know the soldiers.

151
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,560
If she chooses the 5th Division

152
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,000
and wants to go to the end,

153
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,720
she must pass this test.

154
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,440
How can a soldier's daughter

155
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,800
not know the soldiers?

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,520
She's always against me

157
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,440
about the blind date.

158
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,840
It's not because the 5th Division is bad.

159
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,120
It's because the 5th Division

160
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,400
is a soldier like me.

161
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,480
I've been in the army for years.

162
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,240
You're the only one

163
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
who can handle everything at home.

164
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,880
I wasn't there when you needed me.

165
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,240
But Xingxing...

166
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,600
She's not safe

167
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,920
as a soldier.

168
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,080
Instead of saying she's against the soldiers,

169
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,560
she might as well say

170
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,400
she's against

171
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,320
the incomplete growth

172
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,920
of her blind date.

173
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,560
That's my job. I know it.

174
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,400
That's my job. I know it.

175
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,280
It's good.

176
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,040
We don't blame you.

177
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,120
I don't want my daughter

178
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,960
to be worried about Xingxing.

179
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,160
She only has

180
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,480
5 thoughts in her mind.

181
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,800
So I asked them

182
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,240
to go to the Navy Museum today.

183
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,880
I...

184
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,640
I have my own thoughts.

185
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,560
Don't take it seriously.

186
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,520
I want to show her

187
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,360
what we did back then.

188
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,520
I want to show her

189
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,760
the responsibility of soldiers.

190
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,360
That's how she can accept this feeling.

191
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,560
I have a big heart.

192
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,440

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,440
my

196
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,360
owe

197
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,160
do

198
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,200
I believe

199
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
you will bring you home soon.

200
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,720
Okay.

201
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,560
Have Opera

202
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,680
heard of it?

203
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,440
Jinan Sword, No. 105.

204
00:09:38,880 --> 00:10:01,320
It's the first

205
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
It's a famous sword

206
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,400
that has a strong

207
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,040
and modern combat ability.

208
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,760
It's a lesson for him.

209
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,320
It's so powerful.

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,200
It's a bow and arrow sword.

211
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,360
The three Jinan Swords

212
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,640
are also the history

213
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,720
of the development of the Chinese navy.

214
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,880
In 1949, the White Horse Temple

215
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
has been developed.

216
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,640
The Hong 6K,

217
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,640
the Hommo Squadron,

218
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,720
and the Heshiantian.

219
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,000
The Chinese navy

220
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,960
has been developed

221
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,040
in terms of the number of battleships

222
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:38,200
and the wideness of the Heshiantian tow enabling carrier commerce big deal.

223
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,280
The more than 18000 kilometers

224
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,800
Mein front

225
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,160
and the Three-Million updating of water waste

226
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,600
do not seem to be losing their resolve.

227
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,240
We have to swear to the new recruits.

228
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,920
We are the sea armament of the Chinese people.

229
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
We defend the glory of the flag and the title.

230
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,960
We will always defend our country's dignity.

231
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,200
This poem

232
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,560
is not only for the military cavalry,

233
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,880
but also for the military warships.

234
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,420
The

235
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,360
Korean Army

236
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,160
Prae gas

237
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,640
The Korean Army

238
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,440
The Korean Army

239
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,840
Blue Sea

240
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,040
Cимas

241
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,280
The King.

242
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,520
The Star-yse

243
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,960
The Sun.

244
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,720
The scene in the sky.

245
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,360
The gospel of the Greek Empire

246
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,800
Are you Lan Dawang?

247
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,280
Yes. Why do you ask me?

248
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,400
We are employees of Meduo.

249
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,040
We want you to get justice back

250
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,200
and clear our company.

251
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,000
Why did you

252
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,360
publicly debunk our products online?

253
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,040
Right?

254
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,920
Did he publicly debunk

255
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,080
our products online?

256
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,960
Yes.

257
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,880
What do you mean?

258
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,200
It's all the truth.

259
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,480
Your company sells

260
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,520
fake products.

261
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,320
And they sell them at a high price.

262
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,560
Why can't I expose you?

263
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,120
Our products are not fake.

264
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,920
We sell the real products.

265
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,480
Why are you being unreasonable?

266
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,920
Lan Dawang.

267
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,920
We are all workers.

268
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,720
We work hard for our family.

269
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,840
We are not easy.

270
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,760
Look at them.

271
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,920
Not easy?

272
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,560
Have you ever thought about

273
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,800
whether it's easy

274
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,760
to use your products?

275
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,000
They are facing

276
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,240
a face of shame and remorse.

277
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,640
Can the face of shame and remorse

278
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,960
blame our products?

279
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,600
It's not necessarily

280
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,840
caused by our products.

281
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,480
If you say so,

282
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,720
can you bring out the evidence?

283
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,720
I don't want to.

284
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,800
Come back.

285
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,120
Give our company a clean break

286
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,840
and apologize to us.

287
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,600
Or you'll get compensation.

288
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,640
What compensation?

289
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,400
You can't leave.

290
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,800
Let him give our company a clean break

291
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,600
and get justice.

292
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Or you'll compensate our company.

293
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,000
Apologize to our company.

294
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,920
If you don't, you'll get compensation.

295
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,120
You're back.

296
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,520
What's wrong?

297
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,560
Look at them bullying others.

298
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,840
Who is this?

299
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,720
My husband.

300
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,960
Your husband?

301
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,680
What's he doing?

302
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,240
A soldier.

303
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,840
What's wrong?

304
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,920
Did you see that?

305
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,480
A soldier?

306
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,760
What's wrong?

307
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,840
Since he's a human being,

308
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,080
he should be the one

309
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,360
to make decisions for us.

310
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,680
Yes.

311
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,440
Tell your wife

312
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,840
to apologize to our company

313
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,760
and clear our company.

314
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,960
Stop belittling our products.

315
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,040
I won't apologize.

316
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,200
No.

317
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,040
Let our company...

318
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,280
Let go.

319
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,240
Let our company clear our company

320
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,000
and apologize to us.

321
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Or we'll get compensation.

322
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,880
Let my wife go.

323
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,440
Let's go.

324
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,720
Let's go.

325
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,840
Here, Wusi.

326
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
Eat while it's hot.

327
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,360
One more.

328
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,560
Dad.

329
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,640
You should add one more to me.

330
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,600
What?

331
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,680
You're a dog.

332
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,440
Leave after you finish it.

333
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,600
You like pork ribs, right?

334
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,520
Eat more.

335
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,360
Look.

336
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,000
You're still in my bowl.

337
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,080
Wusi.

338
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,480
You can't be so spoiled.

339
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,000
Eat.

340
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,240
I should.

341
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,080
I'm full.

342
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,600
Take it.

343
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,600
Don't delay it.

344
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,120
You're late.

345
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,640
Hello.

346
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,160
I'm Wusi.

347
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,120
When did you come back?

348
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:12,960
Captain.

349
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,320
I have something to report to you.

350
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,240
Report, Captain.

351
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,600
Report, Captain.

352
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,560
Who posted it?

353
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,920
Weibo and WeChat.

354
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,400
We can't find out

355
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,760
who posted it.

356
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,680
The camera is shaking like this.

357
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,600
It can be used as evidence.

358
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,880
There are witnesses who saw it.

359
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,000
This kind of news

360
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,120
is just a show.

361
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,960
It's just a stir.

362
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,240
No one thinks about evidence.

363
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,480
How much is the impact now?

364
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,080
The spread is not big.

365
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,960
But some people

366
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,360
who watch the show

367
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,160
have already been informed about it.

368
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,960
They haven't been able to reply for the time being.

369
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,040
You guys keep following the public opinion.

370
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,920
Then find out the news

371
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,080
about Zong Qing's rescue.

372
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,400
Change the channel and post it again.

373
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,360
Got it.

374
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,200
Dad.

375
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,080
Zong Qing is just trying to protect me.

376
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,360
I swear he didn't push that person.

377
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,240
Yang Yang.

378
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,160
It's useless to tell dad.

379
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,200
When you receive a complaint from the public,

380
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,760
the army should investigate it.

381
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,160
This is the army's rule.

382
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,160
There's nothing to say.

383
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,360
But Zong Qing didn't make any mistakes.

384
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,520
The army shouldn't be wronged

385
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,680
for a useless complaint.

386
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,360
Yang Yang.

387
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,240
Watch your words.

388
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,240
Before the investigation is over,

389
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,520
you have no right to blame anyone.

390
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,800
Besides,

391
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,960
as a soldier,

392
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
you should be more strict with yourself.

393
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,160
You should be more responsible for the supervision.

394
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
You should be more confident.

395
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,840
What are you afraid of?

396
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,800
They know it's a false accusation.

397
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,280
If Zong Qing is punished

398
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,040
for this,

399
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,960
you won't care about it?

400
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,760
I won't.

401
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
I have no right to feel it.

402
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,160
I won't feel it.

403
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,640
As a soldier,

404
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,800
I should have this awareness.

405
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,120
I should cooperate with the investigation.

406
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,440
Don't mention it

407
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,840
again.

408
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,800
Dad.

409
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,360
Eat more.

410
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,200
I'm full.

411
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,600
You're a kid.

412
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,080
Don't bother your dad anymore.

413
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,200
Your dad can't take care of this.

414
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,920
You have to figure out a solution yourself.

415
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,520
How can I solve it?

416
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,600
No matter he's misunderstood

417
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,920
or framed,

418
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,440
you have to figure it out

419
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,640
by yourself.

420
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,600
You have to communicate with him.

421
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,240
He was quite

422
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,680
unruly before.

423
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,440
Why...

424
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,680
Why is he so agitated?

425
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,000
Just tell me.

426
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,640
I was too excited before.

427
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,120
I was against you.

428
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,160
I'm sorry.

429
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,000
What's the use of being sorry?

430
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,360
He's lying here.

431
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,120
Yes.

432
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,040
I started this.

433
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,200
I'm responsible.

434
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,080
But it has nothing to do with my husband.

435
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,720
I hope you won't involve him.

436
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,400
How can it have nothing to do with him?

437
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,080
Isn't it illegal

438
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,440
to beat people in the liberation army?

439
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,000
But my husband

440
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,240
never met him.

441
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,080
What are you talking about?

442
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,480
If he didn't meet me,

443
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,640
why would I lie here?

444
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,800
Am I crazy?

445
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,040
I fell down on my own.

446
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,600
Have you seen the hospital's inspection report?

447
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,640
It's a bone fracture.

448
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,520
Yes.

449
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,880
How can you talk like that?

450
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,320
All the employees saw it.

451
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,320
Your husband

452
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,600
pushed our manager away.

453
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,280
The public's eyes are bright.

454
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,880
There are also video evidence.

455
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,000
Your army

456
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,840
is not blind.

457
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,760
Your medical bills,

458
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,640
nutrition and labor costs,

459
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,680
I'll compensate you.

460
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
But please

461
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,360
withdraw your complaint to the army.

462
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,400
Impossible.

463
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,840
Just that little money.

464
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
You've been

465
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,880
humiliating us on the Internet.

466
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,560
What do you want?

467
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,000
500,000.

468
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,080
The economic loss compensation

469
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,800
can't be spent on a single penny.

470
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,520
And

471
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,200
you have to apologize to the Internet

472
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,920
to save Meiduo's reputation.

473
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,520
My evaluation is all facts.

474
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Why should I apologize?

475
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,080
If you don't apologize,

476
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,080
your husband

477
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,640
will suffer.

478
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,280
I don't know how the army

479
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,440
will deal with the military officer's beating.

480
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,640
He didn't beat anyone.

481
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,240
I won't apologize.

482
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,120
I won't accept your blackmail.

483
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,360
Little girl.

484
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,280
I advise you to

485
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,320
fight for this idle attitude.

486
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,760
You can't get your husband

487
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,680
to go to jail.

488
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,200
Think about it.

489
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,640
A military officer who was complained and investigated

490
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,200
will he have a future?

491
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,520
He'll be punished for this.

492
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,000
I don't know.

493
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,560
Okay.

494
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,680
I can cancel my account

495
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,640
and quit the live broadcast.

496
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,360
But

497
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,040
please

498
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,520
withdraw your complaint to the army.

499
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,600
It doesn't matter

500
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,880
if you quit the live broadcast or not.

501
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,120
Our demands

502
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,560
have always been clear.

503
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,480
That is,

504
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,040
compensation for economic losses

505
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,880
and public apology online.

506
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,360
This matter

507
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,040
is not discussed.

508
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,000
I believe the army

509
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,000
won't wrong a good soldier

510
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,560
for a black-and-white complaint.

511
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,880
It's not wrong.

512
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,760
What's the truth?

513
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,760
I believe the army will find out for us.

514
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,680
So I don't accept

515
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,040
this condition.

516
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,760
You're stubborn.

517
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,320
Okay.

518
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,040
See you in court.

519
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,560
See you in court.

520
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
You can't agree with them.

521
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,080
This is a blackmail.

522
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,600
I understand.

523
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,000
But they insisted

524
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,200
that you pushed them.

525
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,400
And they insisted on complaining to the army.

526
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,320
You can be later.

527
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,280
Calm down.

528
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,520
You have to think through it.

529
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,560
The same as you.

530
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,800
How can I figure it out?

531
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,640
It's my own business,

532
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,760
it's my own business.

533
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,640
I have been vote-strapped for five years.

534
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,800
There are specified salaries

535
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,320
and lack ofまず for FAR.

536
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,400
How to go about it?

537
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,440
during the vacation,

538
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,440
he had a conflict with the local people

539
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,880
and caused a woman to be hospitalized.

540
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,200
Lubao Department of Security has decided

541
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,440
to investigate your unit's personnel

542
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,440
according to the report of the public.

543
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,880
You're back.

544
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,120
How is it?

545
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,640
As you said,

546
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,080
I've talked to them.

547
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,680
If it's them,

548
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,200
they'll be the ones to be beaten.

549
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,400
I've told you, they're just talking.

550
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,240
It's useless to talk to them.

551
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,160
I have a solution. I can solve it.

552
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,360
Don't worry, Uncle Lan.

553
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,080
I'll do as you say.

554
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,560
It's reasonable and legal.

555
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,800
Don't worry.

556
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,840
Wait for my good news.

557
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,480
Uncle Lan, Aunt Wang,

558
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,200
I'll leave now.

559
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,040
Take care.

560
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,520
Dad,

561
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,080
Zong Qing has been

562
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,760
investigated by the organization.

563
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,640
I want to ask...

564
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,760
I didn't participate in the investigation.

565
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,160
It's useless to ask

566
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,920
if you don't know anything.

567
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,320
I don't want to ask about this.

568
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
I want to ask

569
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,000
since Zong Qing has been investigated,

570
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,360
what effect will it have

571
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,480
on Zong Qing?

572
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,960
The army won't wrong a good soldier.

573
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,560
The investigation will be clear.

574
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,720
If it's clear,

575
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,240
it won't have any effect.

576
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,520
But if he's really responsible,

577
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,800
there's nothing to say.

578
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,480
How many times have I told you?

579
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,840
He didn't do that.

580
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,400
It doesn't matter whether he does it or not.

581
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,760
What matters is

582
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,400
he's a soldier.

583
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,560
For a soldier,

584
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
a strict military discipline

585
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,880
can't fight with the masses.

586
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,240
That's the law of iron.

587
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,400
The hand is like iron, it's like wind.

588
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,480
The discipline of iron

589
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,080
can form an iron team.

590
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,560
Especially young cadres like Zong Qing.

591
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,040
They must be strict.

592
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,160
That's how they can

593
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,040
represent the soldiers.

594
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,840
The discipline is the life of the army.

595
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,920
To return to the right and to the people

596
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,240
is a must.

597
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,560
He should wear this military uniform.

598
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,120
And you married a soldier.

599
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,120
You should be able to bear it.

600
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,880
Yang Yang,

601
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,560
look at what your father said.

602
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,880
It's useless to worry now.

603
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,800
You should trust the organization.

604
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,280
I...

605
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,000
I trust my son-in-law, too.

606
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,680
But discipline is discipline.

607
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,880
You should also

608
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,600
obey the rules of the army.

609
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,000
Brigadier, I promise you

610
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,720
I will never violate the discipline of the organization.

611
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,000
Leave the rest to the organization.

612
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,760
Yes.

613
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,120
Zong Qing,

614
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,840
don't be too hard on yourself.

615
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
We all trust you.

616
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,040
You should also trust the organization.

617
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,120
Brigadier.

618
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,400
Brigadier.

619
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,880
I'm sorry.

620
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,480
I've caused Lv Li trouble.

621
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,600
Don't say those useless things.

622
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,640
Investigate.

623
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,360
And we must investigate it clearly.

624
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,200
We don't bully people.

625
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,560
But others don't want to bully us.

626
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,720
Hai.

627
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,920
Hello, Xin.

628
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,480
The news of Zong Qing's rescue

629
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,440
can be sent out today.

630
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,000
Okay.

631
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,680
Let me tell you.

632
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,360
The one who was not in the hospital

633
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,520
was investigated by you.

634
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,080
Do you think there's something wrong?

635
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,280
Do you think there's nothing wrong?

636
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,800
And

637
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,800
I remember that before,

638
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,000
many consumers

639
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,440
complained about bad cosmetics.

640
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,600
Do you have any taste?

641
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,160
Okay.

642
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:07,920
Anything else?

643
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,520
You should figure out these two things first.

644
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,560
How's it going with the task I assigned you?

645
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,200
My sister.

646
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,280
You're rushing me

647
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,320
after so long.

648
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,440
Just say it.

649
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,520
Is it enough?

650
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,280
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

651
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,480
Okay.

652
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,880
I'll be waiting.

653
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,280
Tell me when you're done.

654
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,320
Bye.

655
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,000
Hai.

656
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,760
This is the record of the accident

657
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,080
just transferred from the city administration.

658
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,760
Take a look.

659
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,520
Thank you.

660
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,560
It's okay.

661
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,360
You keep watching.

662
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,120
I'll leave now.

663
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,320
Hello.

664
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,600
Is this the second comprehensive hospital?

665
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,000
This is the Ximen department of Minghuang.

666
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,440
I'd like to

667
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,480
ask you a favor.

668
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:11,840
Hello.

669
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,680
How's the situation?

670
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,520
Are you okay?

671
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,200
I'm fine.

672
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,920
I'm fine.

673
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,640
I'm fine.

674
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,320
I'm fine.

675
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,080
I'm fine.

676
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,760
I'm fine.

677
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,520
I'm fine.

678
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,240
I'm fine.

679
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm fine.

680
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,800
I'm fine.

681
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,920
They will find the truth

682
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,080
around us.

683
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,120
Thanks so much.

684
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,920
I'll finish Dial Jaguar.

685
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,320
The investigation is ready.

686
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,960
We're under a lot of pressure.

687
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,880
Captain Wu.

688
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,440
Your investigation strategy

689
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:42,920
is유

690
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
as traded

691
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,800
without any steady lessons.

692
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,880
Just wait and see.

693
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,400
I have a way.

694
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,280
What's yours?

695
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,080
Don't worry.

696
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,000
Bye.

697
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,400
Zong Qing will be fine.

698
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,800
Eat well and have a good rest.

699
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,280
Don't think too much.

700
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,640
Mom, don't worry.

701
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,640
I'm eating.

702
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,040
I won't talk to you now.

703
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:10,840
You...

704
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,600
This kid...

705
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,080
Hello, I'm Wu Si.

706
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,080
I'm here on behalf of the army.

707
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,520
What do you mean?

708
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,960
Mr. Lan has publicly declares that he didn't hide.

709
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,400
The staff has been beaten

710
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,040
by malicious curses and rude beatings.

711
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,080
His husband did it.

712
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,200
You should keep it a secret.

713
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
Then I can only

714
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,280
announce it to the media again.

715
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,560
Yes.

716
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,280
Let me introduce myself first.

717
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,680
I'm a reporter from Minkua.

718
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,120
My name is Tang Xin.

719
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,160
Hello.

720
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,240
Hello.

721
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,440
This is the editor, Tang Hai.

722
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,240
Hello.

723
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,680
Comrade Wang Jun.

724
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,440
We saw a video

725
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,680
of a military soldier

726
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,760
beating someone online.

727
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,800
We want to know more about it.

728
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,840
Is it convenient?

729
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,760
Yes.

730
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,480
Finally, someone is reporting.

731
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,680
Thank you, comrade reporter.

732
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,040
It's convenient.

733
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,040
Miss Xu Ning, right?

734
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,880
Yes.

735
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,240
You're badly injured.

736
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,520
Yes.

737
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,280
Comrade reporter, look.

738
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,240
The waist is twisted.

739
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,840
It's a compressed fracture.

740
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,880
It was the soldier who hit me.

741
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,440
I did come here

742
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,440
to ask you

743
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,880
for a consultation with the doctor.

744
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,080
The report shows

745
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,400
that the body is deformed.

746
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,760
But it's strange.

747
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,720
The fracture is blurred

748
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,880
and the spine is intact.

749
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,560
There is no severe skin disease or a misalignment.

750
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,520
But there is a slight

751
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,560
bone fracture.

752
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,920
It seems that

753
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,360
you're an old injury.

754
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm sorry.

755
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,240
Look.

756
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,320
I have a medical record

757
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,280
of the second comprehensive hospital.

758
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,000
I got a medical record

759
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
of the same name and surname as you.

760
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,760
Xu Ning, a 33-year-old girl.

761
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,560
You're the manager, right?

762
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,120
On May 17, 2017,

763
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,520
there was a patient who had a bone fracture.

764
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,040
What a coincidence.

765
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,920
It's also a compressed fracture.

766
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,320
Look.

767
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,480
I also have

768
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
an accident certificate

769
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,920
that I got from the hospital.

770
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,000
I reported to the police on May 17, right?

771
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,080
Xu Ning, the victim of the car accident,

772
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,960
was sent to the second comprehensive hospital

773
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,920
with a bone fracture.

774
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,640
According to this,

775
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,040
we think

776
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,520
Mr. Zong Qing, who was accused by the authorities,

777
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,680
abused his wife

778
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,920
as a soldier

779
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,160
and made her injured in the hospital.

780
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,760
It's an untrue charge.

781
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,640
Well...

782
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,920
Do you have any

783
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,760
different opinions?

784
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,400
No.

785
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,040
That's great.

786
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,840
We're in the same boat so soon.

787
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,360
Okay.

788
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,440
We've talked about Mr. Zong Qing.

789
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,600
Now let's talk about

790
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,640
Meiduo and Lan Yangyang.

791
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,920
You're the manager.

792
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,520
I want to ask you

793
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,960
whether the false assessment

794
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
of Meiduo essence

795
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,200
of Lan Yangyang

796
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,440
on the false ingredients

797
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,000
of the essence

798
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,360
is true?

799
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,240
No.

800
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,080
Absolutely not.

801
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,040
Mr. Lan is defaming us.

802
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,160
Our products

803
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,120
are certified by the international quality system.

804
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,720
Okay.

805
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,520
Okay.

806
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,120
Let's listen to

807
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,600
the victims' statements.

808
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
What do you mean?

809
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,760
As you said,

810
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,480
our column often receives

811
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,120
complaints from consumers

812
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,160
about Meiduo.

813
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,080
Before we came here today,

814
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,280
we happened to find some consumers.

815
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,720
We can listen to them

816
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,560
in person

817
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,240
about the true feeling

818
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,360
of Meiduo essence.

819
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,080
Please come in.

820
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,320
What...

821
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,280
What are you doing?

822
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,240
Is this the magic effect

823
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,360
of Meiduo?

824
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,160
Look at my face.

825
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,120
Look at my face.

826
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,200
No.

827
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,280
You're just

828
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,120
spreading false information.

829
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,200
Take your time.

830
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,280
What's wrong?

831
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,520
It needs to be effective.

832
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,680
The evaluation of Mr. Lan

833
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,920
is kind enough.

834
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,240
If I

835
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,840
sue you for malicious harm,

836
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,560
you're right.

837
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,400
I only used it once.

838
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,280
Look at my face.

839
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,080
It's so rough.

840
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,440
How can I go out

841
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,360
with a red face?

842
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,200
Calm down.

843
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,920
Because of your Meiduo plan,

844
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
you're allergic to it.

845
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Your face is full of

846
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,000
sebum,

847
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,320
it hurts and it itches.

848
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,560
It's easier to have a laser surgery.

849
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,600
No.

850
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,680
Don't hide in the hospital.

851
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,240
We'll pay for it.

852
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,120
Don't worry.

853
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:26,800
It's none of my business.

854
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,720
Don't worry.

855
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
Don't worry.

856
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,480
It's your place.

857
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,200
Where are you going?

858
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,160
It's not a problem.

859
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,760
Li Li.

860
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
Go upstairs.

861
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
Where are you going?

862
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,480
Where are you going?

863
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,800
Don't worry.

864
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,600
No.

865
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,960
Don't run.

866
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,600
No.

867
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,400
Go upstairs.

868
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,640
I don't want to go.

869
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,320
You're hurt.

870
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,160
I'm hurt.

871
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,960
I'm hurt.

872
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,840
You're hurt.

873
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,760
I'm hurt.

874
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,320
I'm hurt.

875
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,640
You're hurt.

876
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,160
We've recorded

877
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,640
ten interviews with the consumers.

878
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,600
If they want to sue us,

879
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,360
we have to

880
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,040
give the interview

881
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,120
to the court

882
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,040
as the first one.

883
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,200
This is a

884
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,040
test report

885
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,840
of the research institute

886
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,040
in this city.

887
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,240
The report shows

888
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,320
that only the national

889
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,160
makeup brand

890
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,600
can use Meiduo products.

891
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,520
It's not enough to use the makeup brand.

892
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,440
This is the same as

893
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,360
the test results of Lan Yangyang.

894
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,560
Where are you from?

895
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
What do you want?

896
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,800
Just say it.

897
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,440
No.

898
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,520
I...

899
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,800
We have a portrait rights.

900
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,560
We can't...

901
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,360
Just...

902
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,520
We can not issue it.

903
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,360
We can give it to the PLA.

904
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,520
Okay.

905
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,520
Leader.

906
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,320
Look.

907
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,040
Leader.

908
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,840
Tell the reporters

909
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,720
that we can't

910
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,880
be sued.

911
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,720
This is not

912
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,680
within our scope of work.

913
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,400
Do you understand?

914
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,080
Mr. Fang.

915
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,040
Look.

916
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,920
It's just a misunderstanding.

917
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,440
Let's make it clear.

918
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,360
It'll be fine.

919
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,600
It's not necessary.

920
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:02,960
Yes.

921
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,880
It's not necessary.

922
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,840
It's a misunderstanding.

923
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,560
What misunderstanding?

924
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,600
A young officer's

925
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,240
professional business

926
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,840
almost got sued.

927
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,800
I just said it.

928
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,680
It's not necessary.

929
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,040
It's over.

930
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,320
Look at you.

931
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,240
Why are you so serious?

932
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,080
I'll tell you why I'm serious.

933
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,040
Because I'm a military officer.

934
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,120
My father is a military officer.

935
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,240
My boyfriend is a military officer.

936
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,120
My boyfriend's father

937
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,720
is a military officer.

938
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,960
I was raised by them.

939
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,400
Now I have the ability.

940
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,720
I have to stand up

941
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
and protect them.

942
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,600
I hate to be a soldier.

943
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,280
I'm trying my best today

944
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,200
not for you.

945
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,680
Fine.

946
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,400
You can talk about it

947
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,800
if you have the conditions.

948
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,600
We can discuss it.

949
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,280
First,

950
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,880
withdraw your complaint.

951
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,280
And

952
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,480
apologize to the army in public.

953
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,280
Apologize to Mr. Zong Qing

954
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,440
and Miss Lan Yang Yang.

955
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,840
Blue Team,

956
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,760
please go to the front.

957
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,360
On behalf of Lubao Security Department,

958
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,000
I announce

959
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,680
that your investigation is officially over.

960
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,360
Honey.

961
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,320
I have good news for you.

962
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,960
They've cleared it up.

963
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,800
I'm fine.

964
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,560
You're not jealous?

965
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,440
That's good.

966
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,800
What do you mean?

967
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,600
I'm fine.

968
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
Aren't you happy?

969
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
What's wrong?

970
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,120
Are you feeling unwell?

971
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,200
Are you feeling unwell?

972
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,040
I'm pregnant.

973
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,880
You're pregnant?

974
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
I'm going to be a father.

975
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,480
I'm going to be a father!

976
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,400
Zong Qing, do you really think

977
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,840
we're going to be good parents?

978
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,240
We just got married.

979
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,800
I don't know how to be a good wife.

980
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,360
How do you want me to be a mother?

981
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,240
And my mom always tells me

982
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,720
that I'm like a child.

983
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,800
If I haven't even grown up,

984
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,960
how can I take care of another child?

985
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,840
Honey, you're right.

986
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,560
You're not alone.

987
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,920
You have me.

988
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,760
If there's a problem,

989
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,080
we can help each other.

990
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,920
I'm fine.

991
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,880
If there's a problem,

992
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
we can face it together.

993
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,720
What are you going to face?

994
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,200
You won't even be able to find your partner.

995
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,840
That's not what I meant.

996
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,560
I'm just a little scared.

997
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,160
Honey,

998
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,160
I know raising a child

999
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,480
isn't an easy thing.

1000
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,240
And I also believe

1001
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,360
we might meet

1002
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,000
a lot of difficulties.

1003
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,680
But please believe me.

1004
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,600
I'll do my best

1005
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,400
to take care of you and protect you.

1006
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,480
What's the point of saying that?

1007
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,920
It's time to eat, honey.

1008
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,960
What do you want to eat?

1009
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,800
What do you want to eat?

1010
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,600
Tell me.

1011
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,240
Sour, sweet, bitter, spicy?

1012
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
Spicy and sour?

1013
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,440
I want to be alone.

1014
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,920
About Liang Yong and Huang Yun,

1015
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,640
his parents

1016
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
probably don't know about it.

1017
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,320
But I have to tell you something in advance.

1018
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,640
Lan Yang Yong

1019
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,240
has been spoiled since he was a kid.

1020
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,440
I can't imagine

1021
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,960
how you two will raise your child.

1022
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,520
You can't eat take-out food alone.

1023
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,000
You can get it on your own.

1024
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,520
I'm so busy,

1025
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,160
why don't we stay the night and Memorial Day together?

1026
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,760
Tell me.

1027
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,080
Which plan will you make?

1028
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,760
I don't think

1029
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,080
Yang Yang wants to have the baby

1030
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,320
yet.

1031
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,760
I can try to understand her.

1032
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,880
And then?

1033
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
Try to understand?

1034
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,680
Is this all your plan now?

1035
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,480
Captain Wu,

1036
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,920
does this ostrich care?

1037
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,000
Let her think about it.

1038
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:25,880
Okay.

1039
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,760
Find a place to help me think.

1040
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,200
Okay.

1041
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,720
That's it?

1042
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,520
It's a relief.

1043
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,480
Everyone has a different feeling.

1044
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,520
Ten episodes in total, eight minutes.

1045
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,800
If you can't hold on, you can stop anytime.

1046
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,320
Thank you.

1047
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,080
You can start when you're ready.

1048
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,240
Nurse,

1049
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,960
can you teach me how to operate?

1050
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,000
Please come here.

1051
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,960
Okay.

1052
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,720
Five episodes.

1053
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,760
Nine episodes.

1054
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,200
Ten episodes.

1055
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,280
Get ready for the ten episodes.

1056
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:39,880
Okay.

1057
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,640
Pregnancy,

1058
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,840
pain,

1059
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,440
what you just experienced is just a cold.

1060
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,120
Yang Yang is a doctor.

1061
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,480
She knows the pain of birth.

1062
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,680
So this is not her personality.

1063
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,000
You have to understand her.

1064
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,640
You have to know

1065
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,200
what she's really afraid of.

1066
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,960
The baby belongs to you two.

1067
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,600
You have to let her know your thoughts.

1068
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,880
And let her see your determination.

1069
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,440
Okay.

1070
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,480
It's two o'clock in the morning and there's no on Budget May 8th this year.

1071
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,480
I'm sorry.

1072
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,480
I'm sorry.

1073
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
I'm sorry.

1074
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
I'm sorry.

1075
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,480
I'm sorry.

1076
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
I'm sorry.

1077
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,480
I'm sorry.

1078
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,480
I'm sorry.

1079
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
I'm sorry.

1080
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,480
I'm sorry.

1081
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,480
I'm sorry.

1082
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,480
I'm sorry.

1083
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,480
I'm sorry.

1084
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
I'm sorry.

1085
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
I'm sorry.

1086
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,480
I'm sorry.

1087
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,480
I'm sorry.

1088
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,480
I'm sorry.

1089
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
I'm sorry.

1090
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
I'm sorry.

1091
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,480
I'm sorry.

1092
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
I'm sorry.

1093
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,480
I'm sorry.

1094
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,480
I'm sorry.

1095
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,480
I'm sorry.

1096
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,480
I'm sorry.

1097
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
I'm sorry.

1098
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
I'm sorry.

1099
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
I'm sorry.

1100
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
I'm sorry.

1101
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
I'm sorry.

1102
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
I'm sorry.

1103
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,480
I'm sorry.

1104
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
I'm sorry.

1105
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,480
Hello.

1106
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,480
Is there anything I can do for you?

1107
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,480
No, thanks.

1108
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,480
I just wanted to have a look.

1109
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,480
Yay!

1110
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
Yay!

1111
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:58,340
Get out or you'll miss the Pi's Fasten the

1112
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,040
Call me

1113
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,140
Then I answer the phone

1114
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,820
I can't find it

1115
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,260
Leader, what should I do?

1116
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,820
I really understand

1117
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:29,820
You said love is too vague

1118
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:35,820
But your eyes gave me an answer

1119
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:41,820
Courage, all the heart can meet you

1120
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,820
It's a coincidence, thank you for waking up

1121
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:50,820
That once weak courage

1122
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,820
Let all coincidences become distant

1123
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:57,720
Let all the

1124
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,720
Open the door of time

1125
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,720
The sea of people can't separate us

1126
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,720
You wait for the heart to warm

1127
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,720
I will not leave you in the memories

1128
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,720
The lonely time that is so bright

1129
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,720
I will not leave you in the memories

1130
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,720
I will not leave you in the memories

1131
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,720
Courage, all the heart can meet you

1132
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,720
It's a coincidence, thank you for waking up

1133
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,720
That once weak courage

1134
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,720
Let all coincidences become distant

1135
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,720
The lonely time that is so bright

1136
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,720
I will not leave you in the memories

1137
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,720
I will not leave you in the memories
