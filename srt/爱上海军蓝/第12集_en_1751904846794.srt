1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Go Go Squid!

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,400
Honey, don't eat. Is it really bad?

4
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,000
How about we order takeout?

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
How can that be?

6
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,800
A lady can cook herself. How can she say it's bad?

7
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll take care of these.

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,800
It's not perfect. Order it yourself.

9
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Honey, stop eating. Let's go out and eat.

10
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,200
No. What about these things? Aren't they all wasted?

11
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,000
A lady has never participated in any survival training in the wild.

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,600
Food is too precious.

13
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,000
Then I'll eat with you.

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Glad that you want to learn from the lessons today.

15
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,400
I'll train you from the opening mold.

16
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,760
Actually,

17
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,560
when the numbers are too many, it's not the last.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,120
Is it delicious?

19
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,960
Yes.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,200
I think...

21
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,560
I'm two years old with this ring on.

22
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,760
No, I don't think so.

23
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,360
I think we are handsome no matter what.

24
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,360
I think so too.

25
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,560
Stinky rascal.

26
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,240
Honey.

27
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,480
Do you have any plans

28
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,560
for our honeymoon?

29
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,520
Yes.

30
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,520
You think so much, we think so much.

31
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,720
Can't you have your own idea?

32
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,680
What idea do I have?

33
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
I'll listen to you.

34
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,400
You tell me where to go, we'll go.

35
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,880
I knew you'd say that.

36
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,600
Luckily, I was prepared.

37
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,080
Look.

38
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,680
Hangzhou Xin'an Dali.

39
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,200
Lhasa is fine too.

40
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,800
We'll meet each other.

41
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,280
How about it?

42
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,000
Honey.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,800
What?

44
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,880
The farther you talk,

45
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,320
the closer we get, okay?

46
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,160
Why?

47
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,400
Think about it.

48
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,920
When our honeymoon trip is over,

49
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,320
I'll have to go back to the army

50
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,120
with a sudden call.

51
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,920
How embarrassing.

52
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,520
That won't work either.

53
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,560
You can prepare it yourself.

54
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,280
I don't care.

55
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,440
Got it.

56
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,920
Don't worry, honey.

57
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,960
I'll definitely make you

58
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,760
a perfect honeymoon trip strategy.

59
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,600
You've been talking for too long.

60
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,040
It's easy to get lost.

61
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,240
Understand?

62
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Yes.

63
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,200
You really do.

64
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,800
The old captain called.

65
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,320
He said he wanted to see you.

66
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,400
Your training is over.

67
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,800
Call him back.

68
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,200
The number you have dialed is not available.

69
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,960
Please try again later.

70
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,200
Sorry, the number you have dialed is not available.

71
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,920
You are not necessary.

72
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,080
Dad is looking for you.

73
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,760
I priest the feast.

74
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Does that happiness

75
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,940
I'm not a wild

76
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,940
How can you walk slower

77
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,380
You are late by yourself

78
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,940
Didn't you say it started at six o'clock

79
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,940
Slow down, you can't catch up with anything

80
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,940
What are you doing

81
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,780
We are out of the winter

82
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,780
It's not a rush

83
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,780
I'm used to it

84
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,180
I'm tired

85
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,340
I'll be there soon

86
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,340
I'm tired

87
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,340
I'm tired

88
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,340
I'm tired

89
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,340
I'm tired

90
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,340
I'm tired

91
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,340
I'm tired

92
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,340
I'm tired

93
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,340
I'll go to the top of the mountain tomorrow

94
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,340
Take two steps

95
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,340
The scenery above is very good

96
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,340
Come on

97
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,340
No

98
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,340
That's it

99
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,340
I'll sing a song for you

100
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,340
How about fighting

101
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,340
Ready to go

102
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,340
Red flag drifts along the wind and sun

103
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,340
Our country is so beautiful

104
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,340
We are the winter people

105
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,340
Can you sing a little bit of love

106
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,340
Where did you take me to

107
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,340
Wild mountains and forests

108
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,340
Don't say that

109
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,340
I was in love before

110
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,340
Come here once

111
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,340
This day is much more yellow than now

112
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,340
All in the forest

113
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,340
And if you go out and play in the forest

114
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,340
The road you walked on

115
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,340
Just put some words on the road

116
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,340
I won't get lost

117
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,340
Who will get lost

118
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,340
Yes, you are the smartest

119
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,340
go

120
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,340
Look, there is a waterfall next to you

121
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,340
Come on, come on

122
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,340
Look at the waterfall

123
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,340
There is really a waterfall

124
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,340
You really have a waterfall

125
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,340
I can cheat you

126
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,340
Come on

127
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,340
Three two one eggplant

128
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,340
eggplant

129
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,340
Okay

130
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,340
Hurry up, let's fight together

131
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,340
Three two one

132
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,340
Come again

133
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,340
Pay attention to the movement

134
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,340
In this year

135
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,340
My brain is attaining aim

136
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,340
Visit the egg

137
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,340
tore

138
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,340
I take it

139
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:31,900
ко Syria

140
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,340
I've never seen him

141
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,700
feel bored in the horse station

142
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,500
after he got injured.

143
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,500
Lin Dao Dao.

144
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,060
Yes.

145
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,940
Stand up.

146
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,580
Yes.

147
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,540
Return the gun.

148
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,820
Go to the infirmary.

149
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,580
Come on.

150
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,540
Come on.

151
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,300
I can't stand it.

152
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,260
Come on.

153
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,260
Look, we're almost there.

154
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:04,820
Come on.

155
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,860
Look.

156
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,460
I can't stand it.

157
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,220
I can't stand it.

158
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,260
Look, there are so many stairs.

159
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:18,580
I can't stand it.

160
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,140
I can't get up.

161
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,780
I'm too tired.

162
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,820
Hold on.

163
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,860
The view is better up there.

164
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,180
Okay?

165
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,660
I don't want to.

166
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,700
I can't walk.

167
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,180
Hold on for a while.

168
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,820
Just for a while.

169
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,940
I don't want to.

170
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,620
What do you want?

171
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,700
I...

172
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,460
I want to find a homestay.

173
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,060
And sleep on the bed.

174
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,020
Honey, we're here for a walk.

175
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,100
We're here for a walk.

176
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,020
But we're in the honeymoon.

177
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,540
We can't be like a love story.

178
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,500
Right?

179
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,460
Let's find a homestay

180
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,660
and find a bed, okay?

181
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,780
I'm begging you.

182
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,380
Honey.

183
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,180
I'm begging you, honey.

184
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,060
Hurry up.

185
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,180
Honey, I'm begging you.

186
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:52,980
I'm begging you.

187
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,180
Okay.

188
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,980
Okay.

189
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,540
Hurry up.

190
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,220
Homestay, right?

191
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:03,700
Yes.

192
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,740
Does it hurt here?

193
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,300
No.

194
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,180
What about here?

195
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,820
No.

196
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,380
Honestly,

197
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,900
does it hurt?

198
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,460
Yes.

199
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,060
I'll give you some medicine for blood circulation.

200
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,900
Take care of your body and body temperature.

201
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,780
Reduce the weight of your arms.

202
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,540
And keep them for three or five days.

203
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,060
Three or five days?

204
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,740
But I still have to train.

205
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,060
Do you still want your arms?

206
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,660
Didn't you hear that there were some female soldiers

207
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,780
who had to

208
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,580
remove the muscle damage

209
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,940
into a few salt drops?

210
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,860
Well,

211
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,940
our female soldiers?

212
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,780
What are they called?

213
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,780
Why are you so nervous?

214
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,140
Cheng's girlfriend is in our department.

215
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,060
They've been in a relationship for days.

216
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,700
Don't go!

217
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,260
Let's go!

218
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,980
Let's go!

219
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,180
Do you have a girlfriend?

220
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,900
Yes, I do.

221
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,260
I don't know who she is.

222
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,220
I can help you with some information.

223
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,380
Okay.

224
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,500
Thank you.

225
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,060
Ms. Wu,

226
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,620
I'll tell you

227
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,340
the information that you just told us.

228
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,460
I need the confirmation.

229
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,300
You applied to the list

230
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,020
on the website.

231
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,900
They pushed you

232
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,020
The blind date

233
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,460
You are with one of the three

234
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,780
Is in touch

235
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,420
Yes

236
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,700
Then there are two in the three

237
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,980
Deceived your money

238
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,900
Disappeared after

239
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,380
Yes it is

240
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,220
These two people

241
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,380
One of them didn't cheat much

242
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,660
But the other one is particularly bad

243
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,900
Miss Wu

244
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,980
I think we should do this and that

245
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,860
You just say your name and phone

246
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,300
We also remember to contact

247
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,300
This name is fake

248
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,820
The phone number has also stopped

249
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,060
If I can find him

250
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,740
I won't come to you

251
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,500
Then the one who cheated you the most

252
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,540
How much did you cheat

253
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,340
Cheated seven or eight thousand yuan

254
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,740
That's really a lot

255
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,300
Did you call the police

256
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,420
I did

257
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,300
The police station also registered

258
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,460
But this person didn't find it

259
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,660
Then the person's appearance characteristics

260
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,740
Can you provide it

261
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,500
He is tall and thin

262
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,340
Looks pretty white

263
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,260
With glasses

264
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,060
Dirty

265
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,660
Doesn't look like a bad person

266
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,300
That mouth is sweet

267
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,620
Who knows what happened

268
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,940
So dark

269
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,300
Now many people are like this

270
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,860
You look at people and do nothing

271
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,700
Specially to cheat you

272
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,900
This kind of big sister

273
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,180
One two three

274
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,100
We all remembered

275
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,980
Otherwise, you go back first

276
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,260
Then you must put these

277
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,020
Big,ikesy face

278
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,900
Report

279
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,020
Don't let others attack you again

280
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,100
Don't worry

281
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,900
Then thank you

282
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Let's go back first

283
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,100
I'm leaving first

284
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,940
It's not easy to get it.

285
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,580
I know this website

286
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,660
is still holding blind dates.

287
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,460
How about we go meet her?

288
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,860
We can sit together.

289
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,820
Han,

290
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,380
get me some equipment.

291
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,380
This homestay is nice.

292
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,020
It's so pretty.

293
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:28,740
Let's take a look.

294
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,420
Let's go.

295
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,660
Slow down.

296
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,540
No one is robbing us.

297
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,980
What are you doing?

298
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,180
Bring me some more stuff.

299
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:05,820
Here!

300
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,660
Help yourself.

301
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,660
I'm a bird!

302
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,420
Honey.

303
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,420
Honey.

304
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,420
Zou Jian!

305
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,700
Why did you throw me on the ground?

306
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,420
Honey, I didn't mean to.

307
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,740
I didn't expect you to be so heavy.

308
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,380
What?

309
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,740
I didn't expect you to be so heavy.

310
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,180
Where does it hurt?

311
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,820
My back hurts.

312
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,020
Let me help you.

313
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,780
Help me up.

314
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,620
Let me help you up.

315
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,820
Are you okay, honey?

316
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,660
Come in.

317
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,020
Ai Xinfu.

318
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,460
Look.

319
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,980
You're dressed so beautifully this weekend.

320
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,380
Kiss you.

321
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,820
Your eyebrows are gone.

322
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,700
Almost made your eyes wide open.

323
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,540
Why did you get dressed up?

324
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,620
What special event did you attend?

325
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,260
Nothing special.

326
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,900
Just a downright little thing.

327
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,260
What small thing?

328
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,180
Can you stop asking?

329
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,940
I'm not a grown-up.

330
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,260
I couldn't be private about that.

331
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,260
Are you real,

332
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,780
Look.

333
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,060
What the heck!

334
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,620
Are you kidding me?

335
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:40,720
No.

336
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,240
Tang Xin, you also wanted toф it against me?

337
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,040
We should introduce you the best blood brother in a pack.

338
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,520
Don't get along with him.

339
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,000
With aangra interactions,

340
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,880
I don't believe that

341
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,740
you could find a guy

342
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,900
who is better-than a Ver Ż syndicto.

343
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,340
Not usually.

344
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,840
You are getting me so angry!

345
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:01,860
こんにちは

346
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:05,860
네

347
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:06,780
啊

348
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,100
While

349
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,620
T ast

350
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:11,980
Eh

351
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:13,780
Look

352
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,660
look

353
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,580
One two

354
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,260
Xi

355
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,300
Have a look

356
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,700
How is it

357
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,420
That's nice i choose

358
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:52,700
Beautiful

359
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
물론便利

360
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,380
See the future

361
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,540
Under the pillow over there.

362
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,420
Be careful. Don't touch it.

363
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,300
It's okay. I'll take a look.

364
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,500
Where is it?

365
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,500
Why is it under the pillow over there?

366
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,700
No.

367
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,780
How big is it?

368
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,220
It's this big.

369
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,140
This big.

370
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,820
How big is it?

371
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,780
This big.

372
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,020
Let me tell you.

373
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,980
When we were in the army,

374
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,820
we had to clean up such a big bed.

375
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,660
It's disgusting.

376
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,540
Let me tell you.

377
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,900
I'm not afraid of you.

378
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:30,980
Anyway, I told you.

379
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,860
The thing I was most afraid of

380
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,900
was to see the worms.

381
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,900
What's wrong?

382
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,580
I won't sit.

383
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,540
What if you bite me?

384
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,380
I can't bite you.

385
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,300
You have to bite me first.

386
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:38,860
Let's go.

387
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,580
Don't worry.

388
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,900
I promise that

389
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,660
before you go to bed tonight,

390
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,380
I'll eat all the worms.

391
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,740
Honey.

392
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,380
Why don't we

393
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,460
go home?

394
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,220
The teachers said

395
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,820
in the future,

396
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,180
at the age of 20 or so,

397
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,300
the teachers will be not only

398
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,180
teaching students

399
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,860
technology,

400
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:24,160
but also

401
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:24,860
ишь�

402
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,620
You...

403
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,020
What kind?

404
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,020
I might need training.

405
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,700
I'm sorry.

406
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,180
I'm sorry.

407
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,940
Little Princess.

408
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,620
Don't be like this.

409
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,580
I'm sorry.

410
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,220
How is your dream?

411
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,900
I'm not angry.

412
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,740
Go back.

413
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,300
Okay.

414
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,700
I'm going to ask for leave from the army.

415
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,580
I'm not going to the army training.

416
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,500
What are you doing?

417
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,180
Why can't you ask for leave?

418
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,020
Let my dad know

419
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,660
that you're the best.

420
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,860
You won't be naughty, right?

421
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,820
Listen.

422
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,980
You owe me a lot of money, you know?

423
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,660
A honeymoon, a trip, a movie,

424
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,140
snacks, and a camp.

425
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,700
There are three hours left

426
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,980
before I go back to the army.

427
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,460
And the journey

428
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,140
is two hours.

429
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,300
Two hours.

430
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,300
What are you going to do?

431
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,180
Two hours.

432
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,380
I think I'll take you to the camp now.

433
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,620
Thank you.

434
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,300
Can I meet you?

435
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,100
I'm sorry.

436
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,940
I'm here to find someone.

437
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,140
Can I make friends with you?

438
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:28,940
I won't disturb you.

439
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,060
I can't go down to the north.

440
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,020
Then I'll check your Weibo.

441
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,940
I'm sorry.

442
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,980
I don't have Weibo.

443
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,940
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:54,020 --> 00:22:08,720
Do you mean

445
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,580
your driven?

446
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,300
My dear.

447
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,380
Do you like the view?

448
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,580
Yes.

449
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,060
It's romantic.

450
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,060
Let's go.

451
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:17,600
Let's go.

452
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,300
Here.

453
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,060
So many snacks?

454
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,540
Many of them are your favorites.

455
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:45,980
Brother,

456
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,180
can I call you that?

457
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,260
I think I should be a few years older than you.

458
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,500
I'm not here for a blind date.

459
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,060
I'm here for someone.

460
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,980
It seems that you're here for someone.

461
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,340
Just a casual chat.

462
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,100
I think you just graduated.

463
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,140
You're in your twenties.

464
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,820
My surname is Li.

465
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,820
I started my own business in the early years.

466
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,860
Now I have a few small companies

467
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,620
and my own online programs.

468
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,740
The profit is good.

469
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,020
May I ask

470
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,380
what kind of job you do?

471
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:20,980
I'm a soldier.

472
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,300
A soldier?

473
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,580
What do you want

474
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,060
from this society?

475
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,660
I heard that the army training is very hard.

476
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,300
You can't even destroy your home.

477
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:31,900
Mrs. Li,

478
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,980
if you don't know about the army,

479
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,740
please don't comment.

480
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,780
I don't know about the army,

481
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,500
but I know about the society.

482
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,260
If you don't have any economic foundation,

483
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,500
you can't make a living.

484
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,500
I've seen a lot of young people like you.

485
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,420
Why are you a soldier?

486
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,660
I think you're quite smart.

487
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,140
You don't want to make a fortune.

488
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,100
I'm just kidding.

489
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,660
Honey,

490
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,860
we only eat snacks

491
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,420
for such an expensive hour.

492
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,660
Then why?

493
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,220
What are you looking at?

494
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:18,980
I'm looking at you.

495
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,620
Look at me.

496
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,740
Wait.

497
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,740
Honey,

498
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,100
your face is too dirty.

499
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,300
Close your eyes.

500
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,380
I'm ready, honey.

501
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:43,980
Come on.

502
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,260
Li, Li, Li, Li, Li, Li, Li, Li, Li, Li.

503
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,260
Don't move, don't move.

504
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,060
Li, Li, Li, Li, Li.

505
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,980
Don't move, Li, Li, Li, Li.

506
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,980
Li, Li, Li, Li, Li, Li, Li.

507
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,900
This is an emergency facial mask.

508
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,700
It has the function of nourishing, moisturizing

509
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,180
and soothing the skin.

510
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,180
Look at your face.

511
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,660
You're almost having pimples.

512
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,180
If you don't take care of it,

513
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,860
be careful that I don't want you.

514
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,460
I'm the thin-skinned one in our team.

515
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,780
They are much more vulgar than me.

516
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,860
No one said they didn't want them.

517
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,540
That's great.

518
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,380
Take all these facial masks back

519
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,460
and apply them with them.

520
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,740
Especially Captain Ming.

521
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,620
You really need to nourish your skin.

522
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,620
Otherwise, how can you get our salary?

523
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,420
But I'm really curious about your plan.

524
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,540
Young people are busy making money now.

525
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,420
What's the benefit of you working in the army?

526
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,740
There is a benefit.

527
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,860
I don't have to talk to you in the army.

528
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,220
Don't you look for an answer?

529
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,620
You thought that you listened,

530
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,300
but you still can't Godfather.

531
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,180
You have people who're more plants than potatoes providers.

532
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,540
They let you serve them in separate chairs with people,

533
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,420
but they are old and portions of it.

534
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,080
I think the Moon is also pitiful.

535
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,940
You

536
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,660
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

537
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,060
It doesn't matter

538
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,820
if this man is poor

539
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,780
when he is young.

540
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,780
We are both adults.

541
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,500
I'll be honest.

542
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,660
I think you look good.

543
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,660
I like you.

544
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,060
So I want to know you.

545
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,580
They say a girl is better off

546
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,500
than a man.

547
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,020
It's more important for a man to marry well.

548
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,060
I'm 35 years old.

549
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,140
I got married and had no children.

550
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,140
I started my own business since I was young.

551
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,820
Now I'm rich and free.

552
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,140
I like you

553
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,580
when I see you.

554
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,540
You don't have a high salary in the army, do you?

555
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,180
Just follow me.

556
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,780
It's better than staying in the army.

557
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,300
Even if we break up in the future,

558
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,860
you can be a soldier again.

559
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,500
Our senior

560
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,180
will still pay you.

561
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,220
You are so reasonable.

562
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,740
I've never seen you

563
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,700
so reasonable

564
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,420
since I was a kid.

565
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,940
But you've never heard

566
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,100
the law of military status

567
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,420
and rights.

568
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,500
The military's reputation and honor

569
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,860
are protected by the law.

570
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,820
Any organization or individual

571
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,460
has to be destroyed

572
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,380
in any form

573
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,180
to lose the military's honor.

574
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,540
We are talking here.

575
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,180
What does it have to do with you?

576
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,660
I'm also a single

577
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,260
young girl

578
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,860
who is here for blind dates.

579
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,140
But I just heard

580
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,580
your statement

581
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,460
that you want to rob people from the country.

582
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,100
I think it's too surprising.

583
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,340
What?

584
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,580
The soldiers owe you

585
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,060
because of these soldiers

586
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,660
who are in the army.

587
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,860
Otherwise, can you,

588
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,380
a person from the military,

589
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,020
talk here?

590
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,700
Okay.

591
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,820
Come on.

592
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,740
Sit down.

593
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,660
Okay?

594
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,940
I can't afford to be angry.

595
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,900
What?

596
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,580
You just sent me

597
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,300
your blind date resume a few days ago.

598
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,300
Now you only send

599
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,940
a new resume to someone else?

600
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,060
The resume is a wholesale one.

601
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,700
Tell me.

602
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,340
How many resumes did you send

603
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,460
and how many phone calls did you leave?

604
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,940
I didn't leave a resume

605
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,060
or a phone call.

606
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,780
I'm here to see you.

607
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,100
Don't lie.

608
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,340
Let's not lie.

609
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,940
You're here.

610
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,500
Why are you so afraid to admit it?

611
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,460
You even came to see me.

612
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,100
How do you know I'm here?

613
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,340
I came here

614
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,020
after receiving the information.

615
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,140
Fine.

616
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,620
Tang is the one

617
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,860
who is here to pay the penalty.

618
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,620
Fine.

619
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,940
Even if you came to see me,

620
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,300
you have to

621
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,020
tell me something

622
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,100
at the blind date.

623
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,300
I want to interview reporter Tang.

624
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,700
You just got married to me.

625
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,900
You're already in the next blind date.

626
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,620
I'm not here for the blind date.

627
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,220
Then what are you here for?

628
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,700
This is also my military period.

629
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,700
I can't tell you.

630
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,780
What's your hobby?

631
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,660
I usually like to play ball

632
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,700
and swim.

633
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,740
I just like these things.

634
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,940
Sometimes I see my friends

635
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,620
and want to go to the play-off.

636
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,340
Sorry.

637
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,060
It's time.

638
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,700
It's okay.

639
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,540
Hello.

640
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,740
Let's get to know each other.

641
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,220
Okay.

642
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,260
My name is Sun Qin.

643
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,540
I studied art design

644
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,580
in my major.

645
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,020
Now I'm a

646
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,220
independent designer.

647
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,460
My name is Li Xiangdong.

648
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,300
I'm 28 years old.

649
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,940
I'm a major in finance.

650
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,860
And now

651
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,260
I'm the general manager of Tongyuan.

652
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,540
That's a good job.

653
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,380
Okay.

654
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,460
Can I see your ID card?

655
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,020
Sure.

656
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,460
It's him.

657
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,220
The camera cheated me

658
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:32,900
for 60,000 yuan last time.

659
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,140
I finally caught him.

660
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,220
Who are you?

661
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:37,780
Tang.

662
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,420
Tang.

663
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,100
Tang.

664
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,220
Call the police.

665
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,260
Your task is done.

666
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,780
I have to complete my task.

667
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,900
Yinan Wang.

668
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,740
Why did you call me here?

669
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,460
It was said

670
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,220
a lot actually.

671
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,180
оkan.

672
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:17,900
Report.

673
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,420
It looks lovely.

674
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,380
Come in,

675
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,020
little regulations.

676
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,560
Is the food you brought us?

677
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,460
All I want is food.

678
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,460
Here, some coffee for you, please.

679
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,020
A gentleman

680
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,980
got zwy лич from his screamot weapon.

681
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,060
And now he's injured.

682
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,820
You say it hurts,

683
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,580
and you change the subject.

684
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,100
They're all yours.

685
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,500
I'll finish these.

686
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,620
Are you done?

687
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,940
You are a devil

688
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,500
Go and call the captain

689
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,380
Show you what Miao Shouhui Chun is

690
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,340
Yes

691
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,900
Captain Song

692
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,460
Did you have something

693
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,500
Didn't tell me

694
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,420
You still use this

695
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,580
Grand suspender

696
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,700
Grand surrender

697
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,340
What you want to hand in

698
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,940
I end up

699
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,620
Hiding with me

700
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,740
Da Yan今日はホheen

701
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,500
Da Yan van ver

702
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,540
I don't care

703
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,740
if you care about your uniform or me.

704
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,900
I don't care

705
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,420
if you're looking for me to thank me or to be curious.

706
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,620
But I care

707
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,260
and I care

708
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,140
that you're dating someone else here.

709
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,580
I like you.

710
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,580
I like you.

711
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,860
Now I'll leave the money to you.

712
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:29,900
Captain, I'm telling you.

713
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,900
This mask has a lot of benefits.

714
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,700
Listen to me.

715
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,740
Except for the beauty,

716
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,540
it can also repair your

717
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,740
knife-cut bone...

718
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,460
Enough!

719
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,140
You're yelling at me?

720
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,860
You're yelling at me?

721
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,220
Did I yell at you?

722
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,660
Did anyone hear me?

723
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,660
No!

724
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,580
Good.

725
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,620
You're eating the snacks I gave you.

726
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,900
You're eating and talking.

727
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,260
You're even spitting out water.

728
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,540
Here, try this.

729
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,780
I'll try yours.

730
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,380
Zhou Qing.

731
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,580
Keep the mask on yourself.

732
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,260
We promise not to bully you.

733
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,380
Don't cancel your comrades.

734
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,300
Did you hear me?

735
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,300
Yes!

736
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,860
I heard that Xin is a big fan

737
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,980
of men who like to wear masks.

738
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,820
Do you know what Yangyang told me?

739
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,900
He told me that Xin is a big fan of masks.

740
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,700
And

741
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,220
some people have a rough face now.

742
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,220
Do you think it's appropriate

743
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,460
to meet with their families?

744
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,740
Yes.

745
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,820
I have sensitive skin.

746
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,100
Why does my face feel

747
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,540
pain after I sleep?

748
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,980
It's because your skin is too dry.

749
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,540
The water-saving effect of this product

750
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,980
is very strong.

751
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,900
It can instantly

752
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,380
moisturize your face.

753
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,780
Of course, at first,

754
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,660
your skin may not adapt

755
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,660
and may have a little bit of pain.

756
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,060
But you can still do it.

757
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,340
You're talking nonsense.

758
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,260
It's not about the water-saving effect

759
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,780
or the adaptation of the skin.

760
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,780
It's because it contains

761
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,460
a very strong ingredient.

762
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,540
What ingredient?

763
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,500
This skin care product

764
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,900
does have a very strong water-saving effect.

765
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,820
But

766
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,900
it has a very strong

767
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,900
and strong ingredient.

768
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,100
Its principle

769
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,940
is to forcefully open your pores

770
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,020
and put these ingredients

771
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,460
into your skin.

772
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,260
It's very unsuitable for sensitive skin.

773
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,420
I graduated from a serious medical school.

774
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,980
I can be responsible for what I say.

775
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,500
Did you hear that?

776
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,020
The experts of the medical school

777
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,340
said that our product

778
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,740
has a very strong water-saving effect.

779
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,180
I recommend it to friends who are not sensitive.

780
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,220
And now you can buy it.

781
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,660
It's a 80% discount.

782
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,660
When did I recommend it?

783
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,620
Give me another bottle.

784
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,980
Give me another bottle.

785
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,700
Wait a minute, beauty.

786
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,020
What?

787
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,860
Thank you for what you did just now.

788
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,340
You are quick-witted.

789
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,100
You only listen to half of what you say.

790
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,420
You recommended the product

791
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,260
that you sent to me.

792
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,020
I admire you.

793
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,700
I think we

794
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,260
matched well just now.

795
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,940
How about we do it together?

796
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,700
Why?

797
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,420
I'm lying to you.

798
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,180
Now the online goods are the money.

799
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:18,860
What do you think?

800
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,220
I'll take you with me.

801
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,620
If you really want me

802
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,260
to open a public account,

803
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,420
I will expose

804
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,180
you, these useless beauty bloggers.

805
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,020
Sound of Sound

806
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,020
Huh,

807
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,740
is Mr. Song playing hide-and-seek on me?

808
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,860
He didn't cook the food well today.

809
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,940
The thrill of his heartpload.

810
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,460
Is the pain of love aside now?

811
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,620
Über- Monte Goodnight!

812
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,860
Back in line !

813
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,820
Stop singingiram.

814
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,100
is not bad.

815
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:10,820
Wait for me.

816
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,380
We can stay…

817
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:14,940
and wait.

818
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,740
When it's white,

819
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,300
why not use Brown sugar?

820
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,020
Will you come back after I'm done?

821
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,940
What do you mean?

822
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,500
Playing jokes?

823
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,540
It's my job to find you

824
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,420
and get to work.

825
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,060

It's not finished

837
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,540
I want to go abroad to play music

00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,740
Think pretty

839
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,220

00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,180
Anguo

841
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:20,020
I heard that the local

842
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,380
I want to open a skin care salon

843
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,100

844
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,780
I just want to open one

845
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,060
Use medical knowledge

846
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,220
I want to teach everyone

847
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,540
The program of science skin care

848
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,660
No goods

849
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,060
It's pure engineering

850
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,260
Where are you

851
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,500
What's the stimulus

852
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,420
When I was shopping before

853
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,500
Met a

854
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,540
Beauty blogger

855
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,820
She is in the sun

856
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,620
A lot of people are talking nonsense

857
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,460
After I went home

858
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,260
I specially studied

859
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,220
Her live broadcast

860
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,620
I don't know if I don't see it

861
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,820
I understand after seeing it

862
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,220
It turns out that skin care has so many IQs

863
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,540
So I decided to use magic

864
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,540
Defeat magic

865
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,140
Use scientific power

866
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,700
This time, Wang sister

867
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,300
Will they work from frost?

868
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,620
Come on

869
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,980

00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,420
Ooh

872
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,540

00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:52,620
All Starien

874
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:29,620
The long road can slowly make me happy

875
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:34,620
Let everything look romantic

876
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,620
The dream is also very plain

877
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:45,620
But in your heart, there are more expectations

878
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,620
I really understand

879
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:51,620
You said love is too vague

880
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:57,620
But your eyes gave me the answer

881
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:05,620
With all my heart, I can meet you and exchange it

882
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:12,620
Thank you for waking up that once weak courage

883
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,620
Let all coincidences become a wish

884
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:39,600
Let all the

885
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,600
The lonely time that I spent with you

886
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,600
I will always remember you

887
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,600
I will never regret

888
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,600
With all my heart, I can meet you and exchange it

889
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,600
Thank you for waking up that once weak courage

890
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:06,600
Let all the coincidences become a wish

891
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,600
The bigger the world, the lonelier it gets

892
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,600
Only standing by your side

893
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:20,600
I can feel the warmth in my heart
