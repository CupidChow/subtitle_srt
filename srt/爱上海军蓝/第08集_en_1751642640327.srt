00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'll take a photo of the sea.

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I won't stop you. You can take a photo.

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You can stand there.

11
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's okay.

15
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's going to be windy.

16
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's go back to the port.

17
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

18
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Such a big town.

19
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay, let's drink together.

20
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
See you tonight.

21
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Mr. Han, that female reporter and a man

22
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
rented a fishing boat out to sea.

23
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It should be going to the direction of the Yangtze River.

24
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But she's not lucky.

25
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's still windy.

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So they came back.

27
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What is the man who went out to sea with her

28
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
doing?

29
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't know yet.

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll check it right away.

33
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Captain Wu, thank you for accompanying me today.

YoYo English Channel YouTube

35
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You came to me in a hurry.

36
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You can use your phone when you come.

37
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Tell me what's up.

38
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Today,

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Song Qing proposed to me.

40
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I didn't expect you to propose this time.

41
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No.

42
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You said you got a job.

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Why are you proposing?

44
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What's wrong with you?

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Shouldn't you be happy for me?

46
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Marriage doesn't matter more than finding a job.

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What the hell is going on?

48
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Why did you propose suddenly?

49
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll just propose when the time comes.

50
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You agree?

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,440
and other people's lives.

52
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,120
I want to have this love

53
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,200
and propose to marry someone.

54
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,840
Then I can live a happy life.

55
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,880
Liang Yangyang,

56
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,280
do you really want to get married?

57
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
Tell me the truth.

58
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,640
Which one did you and Cong Qing

59
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,320
develop?

60
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,640
What are you thinking?

61
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,560
Do you suspect that we will get married?

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,720
No, I don't.

63
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,120
I just want to marry Cong Qing.

64
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,960
Is it hard to understand

65
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,040
that I want to marry Ai Qing?

66
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,120
Let go of your love first.

67
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,480
Marriage is different from dating.

68
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,760
There are many practical issues.

69
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,800
Have you thought it through?

70
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,280
I have.

71
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,520
I will tell my parents later.

72
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,800
Then I will go to see the wedding dress

73
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,760
and pick the wedding rings tomorrow.

74
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,120
By the way,

75
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,720
I have something to tell you.

76
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,560
Be a half-mother.

77
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,960
Just a half-mother

78
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,840
is just a small thing

79
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,560
for us reporters.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,080
I want you to help me plan

81
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,320
the most romantic wedding in the world.

82
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,240
When the time comes,

83
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,560
the beach,

84
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,400
the forest

85
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,360
and the grassland scenes,

86
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,720
please help me prepare

87
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,480
and contact me.

88
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,200
By the way,

89
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,440
I want to prepare a confession VCR

90
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,960
for the wedding.

91
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,680
Of course,

92
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,960
I need to ask for help

93
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,720
from my favorite reporter Tang.

94
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,600
Reporter Tang,

95
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,560
please put aside your dream

96
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,120
of the wedding first.

97
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,880
Let me ask you.

98
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,960
How many times have you been in love?

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,080
Just once.

100
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,000
Right?

101
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,760
You couldn't even tell

102
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,040
how much I loved you.

103
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,000
What about Zong Qing?

104
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,600
I'm afraid you can't

105
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,920
get married with him.

106
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,160
If you keep doing this,

107
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,400
you will get divorced.

108
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,920
You will get married

109
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,880
and beg for it.

110
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,640
Tang Xin,

111
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,440
you are so boring.

112
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,640
Anyway,

113
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,960
I won't regret it.

114
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,360
As long as Zong Qing is here,

115
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,760
I'm not afraid of anything.

116
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,800
Why are you looking at me?

117
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Did I look at you wrong before?

118
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,880
Lan Yang Yang,

119
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,880
you are so silly.

120
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,520
Anyway, I don't care.

121
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,080
You are my wedding planning

122
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
executive now.

123
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,200
When did he fall in love?

124
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,240
Why don't we know?

125
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,880
When did he fall in love?

126
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,760
I really don't know.

127
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,480
He is in a relationship underground.

128
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,520
But you two don't know.

129
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,160
Uncle Lan and he don't know either.

130
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,000
I think Lan Yang Yang

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,880
will explain to you later.

132
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,840
Lan Wei Guo is so lucky.

133
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,840
He can have another son-in-law

134
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,200
in his family.

135
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,120
Dad, what's your position?

136
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,000
Why are you so happy?

137
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,240
Is my expression happy?

138
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,560
I think,

139
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,760
little Zou Zou,

140
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,760
you can have Yang Yang half angry.

141
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,920
I'm happy about that.

142
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,120
Look at Yang Yang.

143
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,800
He is so boring.

144
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,680
What's wrong with you?

145
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,960
You met Wu Si

146
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,480
before.

147
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,680
Did you contact him?

148
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,080
I'm a career-oriented woman.

149
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,760
I don't have time to contact him.

150
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,120
Let's go.

151
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,720
Career-oriented?

152
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,280
I'm willing to.

153
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,440
Dad, Mom.

154
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,720
I'll report it to you.

155
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,960
This is Huai Tai Lang.

156
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
His name is Zong Qing.

157
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,960
He's from the Navy.

158
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,240
Navy?

159
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,320
The men's assault team?

160
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes.

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,120
He's excellent.

162
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,600
He joined the party in the second year.

163
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,520
He even won three times.

164
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
He's a good guy.

165
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,520
He's a good guy.

166
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
He's a good guy.

167
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
He's a good guy.

168
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
He's a good guy.

169
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
He's a good guy.

170
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
He's a good guy.

171
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
He's a good guy.

172
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,920
He even won three times.

173
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,520
Before we got married,

174
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,120
he was just a kid.

175
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,520
When I first met him,

176
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,520
I really liked him.

177
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,520
I thought he was really handsome.

178
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,520
Just like...

179
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,520
Just like when my dad was young.

180
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,120
He understood me,

181
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,520
protected me,

182
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
and tolerated me.

183
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
He was nice to me.

184
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,520
So I'm willing to marry him.

185
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
Dad, mom.

186
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,120
Say something.

187
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,520
We're serious.

188
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,920
You...

189
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,320
What do you want us to say?

190
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,520
You're serious.

191
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,920
It's such a big thing.

192
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,920
You can't just say it out.

193
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
But it happened so suddenly.

194
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,120
I won't regret it anyway.

195
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,920
I won't regret it in the future.

196
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,320
I'm really...

197
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
Yang Yang.

198
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,520
I'm sorry.

199
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,920
I shouldn't have peeked into your phone.

200
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,520
Dad.

201
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Don't be like this.

202
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
It's my fault.

203
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
I shouldn't have been

204
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,920
dragging Ze Ye's matter.

205
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,520
I shouldn't have told you

206
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,520
that I was looking for a boyfriend.

207
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
I shouldn't have

208
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
decided the wedding

209
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
on my own.

210
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
I've thought about

211
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,720
the matter of

212
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,920
our marriage.

213
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,720
You should have

214
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,720
the right to choose

215
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
your future and career.

216
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,720
But I don't understand

217
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
why you never tell us

218
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,520
what you really like

219
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,920
after so many years.

220
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
You don't even

221
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,120
mention the engagement.

222
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,920
We're not the Fengjian's parents.

223
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,120
We don't object to free love.

224
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
But we can't

225
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
entrust our daughter

226
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
to a man

227
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,720
who hasn't met him in person.

228
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,520
Have you thought about it?

229
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,920
He's

230
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
willful,

231
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
proud,

232
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,520
and selfless.

233
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,720
He can do housework.

234
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,720
I don't care.

235
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Marry me.

236
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,920
You two are alike.

237
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,320
Yes.

238
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Right?

239
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,120
Marry me.

240
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,920
Marry me.

241
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
Dad.

242
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,920
No matter what happened last night

243
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,920
or the engagement,

244
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,920
I never thought

245
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,720
to hide it from you.

246
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,520
I really don't dare to say it.

247
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,720
I know you still think of me as a kid.

248
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,120
You arrange this and that for me.

249
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,120
But I've grown up.

250
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,120
I want to walk my own path.

251
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,720
Like Xinxin.

252
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,520
Like Zongqing.

253
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,720
Do what I want to do.

254
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,120
Marry the one I love.

255
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,920
Do you know

256
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,720
what the engagement means?

257
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,720
Do you know what it means

258
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,120
to marry a first-tier combat soldier?

259
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,120
Do you know what the impulsive engagement means?

260
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,320
You just graduated.

261
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,520
You've been in the military for a few years.

262
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,320
Have you prepared

263
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,320
for your future life?

264
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,720
Life

265
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,120
is not as romantic as you think.

266
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,720
You...

267
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,320
Can you handle it?

268
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,320
Dad.

269
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,320
I really haven't had the time to think about it.

270
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,920
But I'm sure

271
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,520
Zongqing is the right person.

272
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,920
He's kind,

273
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,720
responsible and responsible.

274
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,920
He loves his job.

275
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,920
He loves the honor of being a soldier.

276
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,120
He loves me more.

277
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,320
So I believe him.

278
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,720
I'm not afraid of anything.

279
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,920
Let's move in.

280
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,920
Don't live in someone else's house.

281
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,320
What do you want?

282
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Yangyang.

283
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
Come here.

284
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,720
Do you really want

285
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,120
to marry a soldier?

286
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,120
Yes.

287
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,520
I want to marry Zongqing.

288
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,520
You've grown up.

289
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,920
You've grown up.

290
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,320
Congratulations, Mom.

291
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,920
Hello, reporter Tang.

292
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
What's wrong?

293
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Captain Wu.

294
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Captain Wu.

295
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,920
Zongqing and Lan Yang

296
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
are getting married today.

297
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,120
You know that, right?

298
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
I know.

299
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,520
What's your opinion?

300
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,720
I agree.

301
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,520
They're both willing to marry me.

302
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,720
What can I say?

303
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,920
What? You have a problem?

304
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,320
No.

305
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
But marriage is a big deal.

306
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,920
I'll have to

307
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,320
check it for him.

308
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,720
Zongqing is my soldier,

309
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,120
but I won't lie to him.

310
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,320
He's

311
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,320
excellent in

312
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
life and work.

313
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,720
He's capable and good-looking.

314
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,320
He's outstanding.

315
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,520
Although he's a good family,

316
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,320
he's not a spoiled brat.

317
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
He's hardworking and hardworking.

318
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,920
He's not arrogant and selfish.

319
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
He's kind.

320
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,120
He can do

321
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,320
what he wants to do.

322
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,120
He's the same person he knows.

323
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,320
Although Yangyang

324
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,920
hasn't known him for long,

325
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
he's there to get married.

326
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,920
He's been well-prepared

327
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,320
before he got married.

328
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,520
He wants to settle down with his lover.

329
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
He's not impulsive.

330
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,120
You're still saying he's not a pervert?

331
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,920
Isn't he just a good guy?

332
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,120
Don't you have any shortcomings?

333
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,320
Yes.

334
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
He's a soldier.

335
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,920
He's a soldier on the front line.

336
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,320
He's a soldier who needs to lead troops.

337
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,720
He's a soldier who wants to go to the battlefield.

338
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,520
He can't guard

339
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,520
the soldier he loves.

340
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
Other than that,

341
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,520
I can't think of any shortcomings.

342
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,320
I understand.

343
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,720
How is it?

344
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,320
Did Shen He pass?

345
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
He passed temporarily.

346
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,720
What do you mean by temporarily?

347
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,920
Pass means pass.

348
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,520
Captain Wu, good night.

349
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,920
I'm not a pervert.

350
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,720
I never thought

351
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,920
I was a soldier.

352
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,920
Weiguo,

353
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,720
just say it.

354
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,320
Don't hold it in.

355
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
We've been together

356
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,320
for five years

357
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
just because we get along.

358
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,720
It can't be compared with that time.

359
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,520
Now these kids

360
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,720
are against you

361
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
for what you said?

362
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Not against.

363
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,320
They don't like me.

364
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,120
We've been in love

365
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,520
for a few days at such a young age.

366
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,320
We're going to get married.

367
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Have you thought about the future?

368
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,920
You're the most familiar

369
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,320
and the most familiar.

370
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,120
Yangyang was raised by us.

371
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,920
Can he stand

372
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,520
the grievances you've been through?

373
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,520
Besides, Zong Qing is my soldier.

374
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,120
I also care about my soldiers.

375
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,720
Just love him like this,

376
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,920
can he be a good soldier's wife?

377
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,120
After listening to what Yangyang said,

378
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,920
I think Zong Qing is a good kid.

379
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,920
He's young and ambitious.

380
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
He saved a child.

381
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,920
He's a good man.

382
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,920
Kill them!

383
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,920
Hurry up!

384
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,720
Kill them!

385
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,920
Kill them!

386
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Kill them!

387
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,520
Kill them!

388
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,920
Kill them!

389
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,720
The mine has been marked.

390
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Go.

391
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Go.

392
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
Go.

393
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,320
I was working nearby.

394
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,120
So I came to visit you.

395
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
I'm sorry, Mr. Han.

396
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,720
I've been too busy lately.

397
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,320
Last time, I said I'd treat you to dinner.

398
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,520
I've never treated you.

399
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
That's not important.

400
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,520
How is the investigation

401
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,960
I've been out of the sea twice

402
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
and I still haven't found anything.

403
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,520
I guess even the reporters

404
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,400
don't believe that

405
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,720
I can continue the investigation.

406
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,800
Well,

407
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,880
how about this?

408
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,800
If it's convenient for you,

409
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,120
give me the mailbox

410
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,280
and I'll help you.

411
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,480
Anyway,

412
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,440
we have some social relationships.

413
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,040
It must be easier for me to do it than you.

414
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,840
Mr. Han,

415
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,680
our industry

416
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,720
still has some unwritten rules.

417
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,840
And the amount of information

418
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,840
he gave me was really small.

419
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,720
But I appreciate your kindness.

420
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,280
If you need anything,

421
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,800
I hope you can help me.

422
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,800
No problem.

423
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,800
If you need anything,

424
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,680
just tell me.

425
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,640
Thank you.

426
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,560
You're welcome.

427
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,680
Be careful.

428
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,040
Stop.

429
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,760
Comrade Shou Zhen,

430
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,040
the blue team

431
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,920
has gathered all the members of the team.

432
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,520
Please give the order.

433
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,520
Let's start.

434
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,200
Yes.

435
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,200
The topic of this test is

436
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,440
that our army is ordered to attack the island H.

437
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,680
The army has been on the road.

438
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,400
But it is under heavy fire pressure from the enemy.

439
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,560
We need to call the army

440
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,720
and fire the cannon.

441
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,160
The communication equipment

442
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,720
has been destroyed by the enemy.

443
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,960
The scout team

444
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,560
needs to contact the army.

445
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,240
I order you

446
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,760
to recover communication quickly.

447
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,400
Do you understand?

448
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,240
Yes.

449
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,960
We need to focus more on

450
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,640
the overall requirements of the actual battle.

451
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,920
Although the test

452
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,600
is a verbal question,

453
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,560
everything

454
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,080
needs to be done according to the standard of the actual battle.

455
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,440
You will encounter many difficulties

456
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,560
and need to solve them by yourself.

457
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,200
This task

458
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,720
is led by the general staff.

459
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,640
The five-fourth is in the rear.

460
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,680
Yes.

461
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,600
Start the test.

462
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,160
Yes.

463
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,920
Five-fourth, out of the field.

464
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,640
Yes.

465
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,800
Attention, all teams.

466
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,960
The firepower of the S-shaped Guibi is locked.

467
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,480
Please react quickly.

468
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,040
Yes.

469
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,520
Running bridge between the two camps

470
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:23,640

472
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,720
Attention!

473
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,200
A disk has been filed to the wall

474
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,360
Your weight lost action

475
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,040
is impossible to proceed.

476
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,520
Only when time isเ�r Jeong

Do you release yourapplause.

478
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,640
Could the Winston gang

479
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,520
stop Beijing location

480
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,120
and break into the healing neighbourhood

481
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,960
and plugins?

482
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,480
Did they success in their work?

483
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,680
The time is limited.

484
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,680
Please find another way to land as soon as possible.

485
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,240
Stop!

486
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
Take this car from the wind tunnel and completely sink.

487
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,880
Yes.

488
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,000
Team A1, pay attention.

489
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,160
Your wind tunnel will be completely sunk.

490
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,640
Before the time is up, you all jump into the sea.

491
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,840
Hurry up.

492
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,080
Wang Chen, our wind tunnel is ready.

493
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
I'll go back to the source.

494
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,440
Diao Tao, go back to save the people.

495
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
The professional level of the manned ship is still good.

496
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,040
It's not enough to have only professional level.

497
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,840
The battlefield is changing rapidly.

498
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,200
It's more important to be able to deal with different emergencies.

499
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,480
Immediately implement electromagnetic interference.

500
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,360
Yes.

501
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,240
Implement strong electromagnetic interference.

502
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,880
Wang Shan, Wang Shan.

503
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,880
Wang Shan.

504
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,560
Help.

505
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,520
Wang Shan, Wang Shan.

506
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,320
Wang Shan, Wang Shan.

507
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
Please reply when you receive it.

508
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,920
What happened?

509
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,280
The enemy has started to implement strong electromagnetic interference.

510
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,400
The signal can't be sent out at all.

511
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,960
Then we can't complete the task of

512
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,280
restoring power communication within the time limit.

513
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,200
How about this?

514
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,480
You pass the information to the ship by using the area method.

515
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,240
The distance is too far.

516
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,200
The ship is afraid that it is difficult to see the ship.

517
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,320
We can't send the signal to the ship.

518
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,520
We can't send the signal to the ship.

519
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,720
We can't send the signal to the ship.

520
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
We can't send the signal to the ship.

521
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,000
It's hard to see the signal.

522
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,200
Wang Shan, send me the radio.

523
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:53,960
Yes.

524
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,080
You reply to the signal here.

525
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,640
I'll go to the ship on the shore.

526
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,240
Got it.

527
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,600
Xiaowan.

528
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,840
You only have three minutes left

529
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,160
to set the time.

530
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,840
What are they doing?

531
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,960
Commander,

532
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,120
the situation is still unclear.

533
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,000
Let's see the final result.

534
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,960
Fryfman I'll tell you.

535
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,620
Commander from the Polish brigade

536
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,000
has made contact with the Assault Region,

537
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,080
which defaults to

538
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,680
X-5678-1,

539
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,640
Y-78234.

540
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:46,380
the purchase of the

541
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,760
Why were you crying after I learned how to cook Today?

542
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,080
Thinking in my head,

543
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,120
I would kill to come here after you are dead.

544
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,720
Throwing the def Safe Away

545
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,880
to make me idiotic.

546
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,400
But what a comfortable dump.

547
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,520
I don't need my son that much to go to the police station.

548
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,600
Look, I have been very well.

549
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,560
In my heart, having you alive is a blessing.

550
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,600
Which kid?

551
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,000
Dongqing.

552
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,480
That's great, dad.

553
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,840
I know I'm the best.

554
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,960
Okay, okay, okay.

555
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,840
You're eating junk food again.

556
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,680
I like junk food.

557
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,880
I'll throw them all away for you.

558
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,640
Yeah.

559
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,320
I'll throw them away.

560
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,000
Really?

561
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,920
Don't eat them anymore.

562
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,600
Okay, okay, okay.

563
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,040
I'll throw them away.

564
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,280
Okay, okay, okay.

565
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,040
I have something to do.

566
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,640
Go to mom.

567
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,120
Okay.

568
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,280
Love you.

569
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,480
Love you too.

570
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,200
What's the situation with the last payment?

571
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,000
It may take another two or three days.

572
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,840
Be careful.

573
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,000
Mr. Han.

574
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,480
What's the matter?

575
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,920
Here's the thing.

576
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,960
I've found out the person who accompanied Tang Xin

577
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,080
to rent a boat out of the sea last time.

578
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,080
Who is it?

579
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,720
Could it be a policeman?

580
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,400
Seeing him in uniform and leaving the camp,

581
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,440
he should be called Wu Si.

582
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,320
I don't know the other names.

583
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,800
It's a goldfish.

584
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,680
Wu Si.

585
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,280
Is there anything else?

586
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,800
No.

587
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,320
Go.

588
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:39,840
Yes.

589
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,200
Secretary Zhou.

590
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,720
Do you remember

591
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,320
a man called Wu Tongshu?

592
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
You mean

593
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,600
the undercover policeman?

594
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,440
Wu Si.

595
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,240
Wu Tongshu.

596
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,120
Go and check

597
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,520
what's the relationship between them.

598
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Yes, Mr. Han.

599
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,640
Captain Wu.

600
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,920
You're back.

601
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,600
Are you done with your class?

602
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,360
You like to be on the show?

603
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,640
I'll give it to you.

604
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
No, no, no.

605
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,200
Tang's job of promoting the boat

606
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,760
is to scold you and make you angry, right?

607
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,440
I'm fine.

608
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,560
I'm just running around.

609
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,240
You're fine?

610
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,440
How can I come to you?

611
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,560
Help me pick one.

612
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,040
Cheng Yuan is a lazy man.

613
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,080
He doesn't know anything about fashion.

614
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,040
Drink it.

615
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,120
I know fashion.

616
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,720
You...

617
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,240
Ask him a question about self-harm.

618
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
I'm still young.

619
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,000
Take the baby out.

620
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,520
Help me.

621
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,520
Make it a happy family, okay?

622
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,800
Take a look.

623
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,680
White plain.

624
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,280
Take a look.

625
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,080
Take a look?

626
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,840
Don't stick to me, okay?

627
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,080
It's not like that when you propose.

628
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,880
What's the smell?

629
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,480
Captain, this is more important than proposing.

630
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,520
Just help me.

631
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,360
Okay?

632
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,080
Don't move.

633
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Pick one if you can't pick white.

634
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,120
Pick the one that looks...

635
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,000
The phone for the label.

636
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,080
I'll hang up the rules and regulations.

637
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,680
Li Zheng.

638
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,440
Wear a uniform.

639
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,320
The uniform looks the best.

640
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,520
Yeah.

641
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,040
Why didn't I think of that?

642
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,000
I'll take back what I said.

643
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,840
You're the general in the saddle.

644
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,280
Fang Xin.

645
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,640
Captain Wu.

646
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,640
Why did you call me?

647
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,920
Nothing.

648
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,200
I'm asking if it's convenient for you to go to the interview tomorrow.

649
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:12,960
It's convenient.

650
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,560
Come at any time.

651
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,240
Okay.

652
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,000
If you need any help,

653
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,960
just let me know.

654
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,800
I'll figure it out.

655
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,160
Any help?

656
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,040
Any help.

657
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,880
I hope you can take care of me

658
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,280
when we interview tomorrow.

659
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,920
Don't go around like last time.

660
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,720
I'll stay with you.

661
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,320
Any other questions?

662
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,520
And...

663
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
Nothing.

664
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,360
See you tomorrow.

665
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,840
Okay.

666
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,120
And...

667
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,040
I really want to know

668
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,720
if you're the one

669
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,760
that Da Yan taught me.

670
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I hope it's you.

671
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,480
Dad.

672
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,240
Mom.

673
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,800
You're not eating?

674
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,200
I'm not eating.

675
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:20,640
I'm on a diet.

676
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,360
I'm going back.

677
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,800
You're on a diet.

678
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,720
It's time for dinner.

679
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,000
You should spend time with your parents.

680
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,760
Yeah.

681
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,160
I'm a little tired.

682
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,680
I want to go back to the county office.

683
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,720
I have to go to the military service interview tomorrow morning.

684
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,920
You're going to the military service interview tomorrow.

685
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,640
You have company, right?

686
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,360
I think so.

687
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,920
Why don't you take this opportunity

688
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,120
and have a good talk?

689
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,800
How's the car?

690
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,600
Well...

691
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,560
It's okay.

692
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,400
It's good.

693
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,520
It's not good.

694
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,440
Tell me.

695
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,800
It's...

696
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,160
It's good everywhere.

697
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,800
It's good.

698
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,600
Why don't you hurry up?

699
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,880
You're so anxious.

700
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,480
I can't hurry up.

701
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,800
I can't see it now.

702
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
I can't touch it.

703
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,480
I'm embarrassed.

704
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,880
You're not angry.

705
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,040
Who's embarrassed?

706
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,040
Okay, I'll stop talking to you.

707
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,520
I'm going back to prepare the interview draft.

708
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,200
You guys eat.

709
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,560
I think it's good.

710
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,480
Maybe it can help us get started.

711
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,040
Look at this.

712
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,680
It's electric.

713
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,640
It's good.

714
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,320
Where are they?

715
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,600
I don't know.

716
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,560
I just saw Yi Nan Wang.

717
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,520
He ate so fast.

718
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,960
I don't know what he's going to do later.

719
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
It's a bit abnormal.

720
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,800
You won't be abnormal on weekends.

721
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,760
I have something to do.

722
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,960
Zijian will pick me up later.

723
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,040
I don't care when he picks you up.

724
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,400
Anyway, the price is for you.

725
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,200
Have a good weekend.

726
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,520
Thank you, captain.

727
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,320
Hello, mom.

728
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Son.

729
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,840
Where did you go on a business trip?

730
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,480
It's been so long.

731
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,880
Mom, this time I...

732
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,680
I have to go to several places on a business trip.

733
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,320
I have to go back here.

734
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,120
Something's wrong with you.

735
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,400
What's going on?

736
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,280
Let me tell you the truth.

737
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,280
I'm not going to go back.

738
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Tell me the truth.

739
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,640
I'm busy with my work lately.

740
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
I'm going to transfer to

741
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,080
the Wenzhou Ocean Museum.

742
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,680
You're going to Wenzhou?

743
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,480
It's a big deal.

744
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,080
Why don't you discuss it with mom?

745
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,160
I'm afraid you'll worry about me.

746
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,360
Mom, listen to me.

747
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,920
Wenzhou is a good place.

748
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,240
The opportunity to develop

749
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,960
the Wenzhou Ocean Museum is good.

750
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,360
After I get there,

751
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,480
I can show off my talent.

752
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,680
Just wait for my good news.

753
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,080
When I'm all set,

754
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,280
I'll report to you.

755
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,000
Wenzhou has a chance, right?

756
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,480
I think Wenzhou has Wang Chen.

757
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,160
All right, all right.

758
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,200
I won't say anything.

759
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,360
Hello?

760
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,360
Captain Song.

761
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,880
We're all wearing the same clothes.

762
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,560
Why don't I wear it?

763
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,640
It doesn't smell like you.

764
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,800
Don't do this.

765
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
You can be a soldier for a few more years.

766
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,040
I'm off to Motion spots.

767
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:43,800
All right.

768
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,280
See you later.

769
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,780
Bye.

770
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:55,680
Captain.

771
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,280
Captain.

772
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,480
Yinan Wang,

773
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,080
Wang Chen mentioned that you were in a hurry

774
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,000
in breakfast today.

775
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,240
Is that why team Zong

776
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,120
establishment all ticking you off?

777
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,360
No, captain.

778
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:10,800
Report.

779
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,720
I'm taking Yi Nanwang to the library.

780
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:13,840
Please.

781
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,720
Tell me how you feel.

782
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,920
Honestly,

783
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,240
I'm a little scared.

784
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,840
The Lu's team

785
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,520
is not scared.

786
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,040
You don't know.

787
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,840
Yangyang said his father was strict.

788
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,280
Think about it.

789
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,240
He filed a complaint about the proposal.

790
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,360
He even put the matter of giving up being a doctor

791
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,280
on my head.

792
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,480
I'm not afraid of anyone.

793
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,400
I think

794
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,520
since he invited you,

795
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,840
he has decided everything.

796
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,800
He can relax.

797
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,640
He will be fine.

798
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,640
Wei Li, Yangyang.

799
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,600
I'm going out.

800
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,280
I asked you to meet your father-in-law,

801
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,320
not to the battlefield.

802
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,920
Where is the courage to propose?

803
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,280
You're really sitting and talking.

804
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,680
Do you think every father-in-law

805
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,840
is like Mr. Tang?

806
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,760
Captain Wu.

807
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,760
Mr. Tang.

808
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,800
It's me.

809
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,120
I'm here to pick you up.

810
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,120
Why are you here now?

811
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,200
I want to pick you up.

812
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,880
I was doing psychological construction

813
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,760
at the door just now.

814
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,560
Why do you live here?

815
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,800
Are you Zongqing?

816
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,160
Mom, come here.

817
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,320
Let me introduce to you.

818
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,800
This is Zongqing.

819
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,720
This is my mom.

820
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,360
Sit down.

821
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:12,840
Let's go.

822
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,640
Dad.

823
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,720
Chief Shen.

824
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,720
This is my dad.

00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,200
This is Zong Qing.

826
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,720

827
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,480

828
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,280
Welcome to my home.

829
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,080
Thank you, Chief.

830
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,880
No need.

831
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,160
We're not in the army.

832
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,240
You don't have to be so serious.

833
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,480
You're a dog.

834
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,640
Report to Chief.

835
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,960
Send an agreement.

836
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,680
I guessed it right.

837
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,840
What's your dad?

838
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,440
Wash your hands.

839
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,040
Let's eat.

Yes.

841
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,000
Why didn't you tell me your dad was...
