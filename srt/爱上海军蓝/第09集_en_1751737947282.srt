1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,520
The world may be small

2
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,520
But I've never been desperate for a second

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,800
I've crossed the waves of the world

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,520
And stepped on the deep corners of the dark

5
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,400
To face the more fierce wind

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,760
The wound is covered with the wind

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,560
The night is engulfed by the starlight

8
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,200
This pole is written for an era of tenderness

9
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,200
Let's hug this iceberg

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,560
The end is a good one

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,840
I'm as unchanging as the sin

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:24,640
You don't need to accept a fearless

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,760
Dude, who are they talking to?

14
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,520
Song Qing, no need to be shy.

15
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,920
Aunt, I don't know what you like.

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,640
I mostly cook

17
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,680
what Yang Yang takes.

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,080
Thank you, Auntie.

19
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,800
I like what she expensively cooks.

20
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,160
That's great.

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,040
How's the food in the army?

22
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,160
Very good, aunt.

23
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,360
We're eating second-grade cooking.

24
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,560
What's second-grade cooking?

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,080
According to the needs of the army,

26
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,400
the supply of food, bones, fish, meat, eggs,

27
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,640
vegetables, fruits and oil,

28
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,280
and other small supplies

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,080
must be in a good balance.

30
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,440
It's guaranteed that every soldier

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,440
needs a healthy and balanced nutrition every day.

32
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,160
Second-grade cooking.

33
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,520
Everyone needs to eat 41 yuan a day.

34
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,880
It's guaranteed that every meal is a soup with six dishes.

35
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,520
Are you chatting?

36
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,120
Why are you acting like a report?

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,360
Although the army

38
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,840
has a good nutrition,

39
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,440
it's not as good as the food made by aunt.

40
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,920
She often comes to our house

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,080
when the food is good.

42
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,840
She's a soldier.

43
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,000
How can she come here at once?

44
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,600
Dad,

45
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,160
she's a soldier.

46
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,040
She's your future son-in-law.

47
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,240
Why can't she come here?

48
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,160
Yang Yang,

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,200
that's not what the chief meant.

50
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,000
I won't have many chances

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,320
to go home and eat in the future.

52
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,440
But I promise

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,200
that I'll come back

54
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,080
when I have no mission to rest.

55
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,320
I'll come with you

56
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,560
to see aunt and chief.

57
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,720
Uncle.

58
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,800
Call me uncle at home.

59
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,080
Yes, aunt.

60
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,520
Is there anything fun

61
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,080
in your army?

62
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,640
How do you train?

63
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,400
Is there any great task?

64
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,040
Our army has secret rules.

65
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,960
We can't tell you.

66
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,720
I'm not a spy.

67
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,760
She's right.

68
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,280
Try my soup.

69
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,440
I like it.

70
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,320
She's a helper for you,

71
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,520
so you show me how good soup is.

72
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,200
Sure.

73
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:47,680
lack of

74
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,940
And...

75
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,760
We're in the same boat.

76
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,480
It matches you effectively.

77
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,720
Forget about it.

78
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,560
Sis,

79
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,320
my dad told me

80
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,440
you've spent years

81
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,840
in the home

82
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,400
looking after your dad and kids,

83
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,200
to help your family

84
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,560
and to look after your foster team.

85
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,760
I'm not a sister-in-law.

86
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,080
I'm not just a sister-in-law.

87
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,480
I'm also in the military books.

88
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,760
I have many things to bring.

89
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,520
That's right.

90
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,280
My mom

91
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,000
introduces people to people in the group every day.

92
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,960
Don't look at it.

93
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,280
I think it's pretty good.

94
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,480
You ask.

95
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,400
I'm not suitable to ask.

96
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,040
You ask.

97
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,520
He's your brother.

98
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,640
Of course you should ask.

99
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,200
Okay then.

100
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,960
I'll ask.

101
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,600
You ask.

102
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,280
I'll ask.

103
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,880
You ask.

104
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,520
You ask.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,600
Okay then.

106
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,080
Lan Yangyang.

107
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,760
Zongqing.

108
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,520
Come on.

109
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,480
Dad.

110
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,280
Can you stop

111
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,960
being so surprised at home?

112
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,120
That's right.

113
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,400
I'm talking at home.

114
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,120
Come on.

115
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,800
Sit down.

116
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,200
Come on.

117
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,400
Sit down.

118
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,840
Zuo Yan.

119
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,360
Yes.

120
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,760
Zongqing.

121
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,040
I'm asking you a question

122
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,880
as a father.

123
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,360
Please say it.

124
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,560
Today is our

125
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,280
first official meeting.

126
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,080
If we disagree

127
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,440
with what happened between you and Yangyang,

128
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,320
what do you think?

129
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,000
Dad.

130
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,800
Answer my question.

131
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,320
Chief.

132
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,280
I know you have doubts

133
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
about Yangyang and me.

134
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,520
But I promise you.

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,880
My proposal to Yangyang

136
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,040
was not a sudden impulse.

137
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,360
I saw Yangyang's low spirit.

138
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,560
I liked him.

139
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,880
At that time, I decided

140
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,960
to protect him

141
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,840
and take care of him.

142
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,840
I will try to be a good soldier

143
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,560
and a good husband.

144
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,480
I know what I'm saying

145
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,280
is empty words.

146
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,480
But I will use my actions

147
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,080
to prove it to you and aunt.

148
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,480
Zongqing.

149
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,040
We believe

150
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,280
your feelings for Yangyang.

151
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,280
But sometimes,

152
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,520
the soldier's heart

153
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,000
has to be broken in two.

154
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,600
Most of the time,

155
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,280
a good soldier and a good husband

156
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,440
can only be a good husband

157
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,480
on purpose.

158
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,280
You can't be a good husband

159
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,680
and a good husband.

160
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,800
Dad, mom.

161
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,520
Don't push Zongqing.

162
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,560
He is a soldier.

163
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,480
I support him.

164
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,840
Answer my question.

165
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,960
Chief.

166
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,520
I will do my best

167
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,400
to love Yangyang.

168
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,800
But the military order is like a mountain.

169
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,760
I will do my best

170
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
to fulfill my duty.

171
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,440
Sit down.

172
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,120
Yes.

173
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,400
What do your parents think?

174
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,000
They agree.

175
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,920
Then

176
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,800
ask them to come over.

177
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,720
Okay.

178
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,600
The time is passing by.

179
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
The army has always been considerate

180
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,520
of the life pressure of our family.

181
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,280
It has especially established

182
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,360
the military-armor support group.

183
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,440
And the military-armor group

184
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,360
of Lin Lan's sister-in-law.

185
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,320
Military-armor group.

186
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,640
The military-armor group.

187
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,520
There are old people in the family.

188
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,680
They want to have a second child.

189
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,120
They want to find a job.

190
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,360
We care about each other.

191
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,360
The military-armor group

192
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,400
supports our life-saving competition.

193
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,680
Recover the good things

194
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,720
and return to the society.

195
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,480
The military is a family.

196
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,080
The people are a family.

197
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,520
We are united in the military.

198
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,560
We can solve the problem

199
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,200
of our family's life-saving.

200
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,720
It's a contribution

201
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,200
to the army's construction.

202
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,640
Xin Xin.

203
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,520
Are you satisfied with today's interview?

204
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:07,960
Okay.

205
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,720
I'm so satisfied.

206
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,400
Thanks to Mr. Wang, my sister-in-law.

207
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,120
Thank you.

208
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,440
As long as you are satisfied,

209
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,560
we have completed the task.

210
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,400
Okay.

211
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,880
Brigadier.

212
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,960
The soldiers who went to the sea

213
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,920
have returned.

214
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,040
I'll arrange someone to pick them up.

215
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,560
Okay.

216
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,280
Xin Xin.

217
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,360
The soldiers who just came back from the sea

218
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,320
do you want to interview them?

219
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,280
Of course.

220
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,200
But they are in another camp.

221
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,040
It will be very late if they arrive.

222
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,240
Then...

223
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,840
Brigadier.

224
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,920
How about asking the reporter Tang to stay here first?

225
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,080
I'm going to go there tomorrow.

226
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,160
I'll go there by the way.

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,720
Brigadier.

228
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,560
This way.

229
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,560
Brigadier Wu.

230
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,880
Do you keep the door open here?

231
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,640
There is a station.

232
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,800
It's 24 hours.

233
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,680
Are all the girls living here?

234
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,240
They are family members.

235
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,160
They don't know each other.

236
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,320
Don't be afraid.

237
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,200
It's safe in the army.

238
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,400
Well...

239
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,160
Well...

240
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,840
Can't I get my takeout?

241
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,520
You ordered takeout?

242
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,760
I'll get it for you.

243
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,960
I'm just kidding.

244
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,000
You can say whatever you want.

245
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,080
Your room is in front of you.

246
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,480
I'm leaving.

247
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,320
Have a good rest.

248
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,160
I'll call you tomorrow morning at six o'clock.

249
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,720
Okay.

250
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,480
See you tomorrow.

251
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,280
See you tomorrow.

252
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,720
arch've been gathered here

253
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,480
Chen Bai

254
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,320
Did the food come back?

255
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,000
Do you want it?

256
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,240
What happened?

257
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,360
Squad Zong went to kill the enemy

258
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,280
Kill the enemy?

259
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,000
The enemy got destroyed.

260
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,160
Who else can be in the blue team except us?

261
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,160
Lan Si Lian.

262
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,640
What's wrong?

263
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,560
Is it hard to guess?

264
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,160
You're right.

265
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,360
It's quite reasonable to think so.

266
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,760
Princess Milk Tea is

267
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,920
Lan Si Lian's ex-wife.

268
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,280
Isn't it a thunderous blow?

269
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,640
I've never thought about it.

270
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,200
Brother, you...

271
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,240
You know how to think?

272
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,720
I have the guts.

273
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,760
I can't help you this time.

274
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,680
Come on.

275
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,040
I'll sit with you.

276
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,960
Let's do it together.

277
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,680
I'll sit with you.

278
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,320
Sit.

279
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,840
You're still here?

280
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,520
Where did the captain go?

281
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,320
I'm waiting for his idea.

282
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,520
This problem in my head

283
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,200
may be having the car accident.

284
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,040
I worry that

285
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,520
the car accident happens it.

286
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,440
You can say that again.

287
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,480
How about I help you train the fully capacity passenger car?

288
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,360
Okay.

289
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,760
I don't like it.

290
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,480
Hello, Chengyuan.

291
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,200
Captain.

292
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,520
I'mcong.

293
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,160
What?

294
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,200
Well,

295
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,400
what did Commander Lan say?

296
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,520
How?

297
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,200
Commander said

298
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,400
what if he disagrees?

299
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,760
I was so anxious.

300
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,800
I said it without thinking.

301
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,680
Then he said he wanted to talk to my parents.

302
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,200
Is it...

303
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,000
Is it because he wants to sue my parents?

304
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,320
Are you stupid?

305
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,720
You don't understand what I'm saying?

306
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,680
Call your parents.

307
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,600
I'll pick you up.

308
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,400
Wait for good news.

309
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,760
Go.

310
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,160
Come back.

311
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,440
I'll pick you back.

312
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,960
Where is the captain going?

313
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,040
Ask again.

314
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
Then he doesn't eat breakfast.

315
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,760
What's wrong with you?

316
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
It's such a nice day.

317
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,440
You can have breakfast

318
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,360
with long-ousted workers like us.

319
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,160
That's right.

320
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,600
He had breakfast with his bandmate.

321
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
He didn't miss.

322
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,960
Second thought didn't have breakfast?

323
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,560
What is it?

324
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,240
Is it fun?

325
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,160
Second thought is quite strict.

326
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,960
I want to ask

327
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,440
Wait a minute

328
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,600
Two-star hotel

329
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,720
Then this

330
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,040
No female toilet

331
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,720
Hello, go to the second floor

332
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,920
Yes

333
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,680
Captain

334
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,400
Go to the second floor

335
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,320
Yes

336
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,840
You have been here all the time

337
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,560
I'm just worried

338
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,920
we break up

339
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,120
Can I go

340
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Can

341
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,560
Watch your breath

342
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,640
The committed standard rod

343
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,200
LD Jeff

344
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,240
Could you do something

345
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,920
Could you do something

346
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,800
Hello, sir.

347
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,560
Please introduce yourself.

348
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,480
This is Liu,

349
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,920
the ex-convict of Haicheng.

350
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,480
Mr. Liu.

351
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,960
This is Tang Xin,

352
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,760
a reporter from Minkua Network.

353
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,520
She's here to interview us.

354
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,440
Hello, Mr. Tang.

355
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,360
We're in the middle of

356
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,320
the training of the Stas-4.

357
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,680
Hello, sir.

358
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,680
Let me take a look.

359
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,000
Will it affect your training?

360
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,680
No.

361
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,640
The common gun can't shoot.

362
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,520
It can't...

363
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,160
It can't take pictures.

364
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,760
I see.

365
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,560
Sir,

366
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,360
can I touch this gun

367
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,000
and try it later?

368
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,200
Sorry, Mr. Tang.

369
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,200
We can't touch it.

370
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,960
We have the rule of

371
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,800
shooting with the gun.

372
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:11,880
I see.

373
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,360
Sorry.

374
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,080
Continue the training.

375
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,760
Yes, sir.

376
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,000
That's

377
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,000
what happened.

378
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,640
I thought I was abroad

379
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,880
and you've almost

380
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,160
handled the situation.

381
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,640
But that reporter

382
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,920
is so stubborn.

383
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,400
She's still investigating.

384
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,040
Dad,

385
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,560
why don't you

386
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,520
show her some colors?

387
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,080
No need.

388
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,040
Anyway,

389
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,600
she's an airman.

390
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,720
If something happens to her,

391
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,640
she'll be bad to everyone.

392
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,560
She

393
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,200
wants to make things worse.

394
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,480
Let's just make it

395
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,560
a small thing.

396
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,800
Let them deal with it.

397
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,760
What do you mean?

398
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,600
We've almost

399
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:26,720
handled

400
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,520
the thing called the Stas-4.

401
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,080
Just throw away

402
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,440
the remaining bones.

403
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,440
But what if

404
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,720
we find something in the bones?

405
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,480
That's a pity.

406
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,520
Where can she go?

407
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Do you know why

408
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,800
I came back

409
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,120
after so long?

410
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,720
Did you find something new

411
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,680
in our cooperation team?

412
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,240
After our understanding abroad,

413
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,240
we've basically decided

414
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,720
to go to the sea

415
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,800
of the Song Dynasty.

416
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,640
So,

417
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,360
don't do anything

418
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,480
that will make you lose your mind.

419
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:17,960
Okay.

420
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,360
I understand what to do next.

421
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,200
What are you going to do

422
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,640
about the female reporter?

423
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,040
So far,

424
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,360
the biggest threat we have

425
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,200
is to provide clues to Tang Xin.

426
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,200
We don't know

427
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,760
how much she knows about us.

428
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,000
If we don't get rid of her,

429
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,640
we'll be worried.

430
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,680
Okay.

431
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,080
Since you know,

432
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,640
go do it.

433
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,240
Okay.

434
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,680
I'll do it now.

435
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,920
Her photo book

436
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,120
hasn't been watched yet.

437
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,800
You've no question.

438
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,160
Her bad done show

439
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,160
has been on radio show recently.

440
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:22,020
It received an

441
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,240
unsoteited Iraqi commentning.

442
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,160
I found it on gossips,

443
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,480
and after this...

444
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,720
I'm Wang Chen.

445
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,880
Okay, sit down.

446
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,400
Okay.

447
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,000
Please sit down.

448
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,160
I remember you told me on the phone

449
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,560
that you wanted to talk about

450
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,760
the sinking of the ship in the Yangtze River.

451
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,960
Some time ago,

452
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,640
I actually received a report

453
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,840
that said

454
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,520
there were illegal people

455
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,040
who were in the Yangtze River

456
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,560
and were caught by the ship in the Yangtze River.

457
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,160
I went out of the sea

458
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,040
three times before and after

459
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,360
to find out what happened.

460
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,440
But for various reasons,

461
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,080
I ended up getting nothing.

462
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,400
Based on what I know

463
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,040
and the obstacles

464
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
I encountered in investigating this matter,

465
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,680
I think there is a great possibility

466
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,520
of sinking in the Yangtze River.

467
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,040
So I want to come over and ask you about it.

468
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,720
The Yangtze River

469
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,880
was originally the South China Sea route

470
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,440
along the Silk Road

471
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,360
during the Tang Song Yuan Ming period.

472
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,520
There was a very high probability

473
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,720
of sinking in that place.

474
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,640
I understand.

475
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,760
Actually,

476
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,200
I still have one other purpose

477
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,360
to come over today.

478
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,160
I know that

479
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,840
this situation is very difficult

480
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,600
for me to investigate by myself.

481
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,640
So I wonder

482
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,160
if the Mythical and edits department

483
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,320
can manage to

484
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,120
manage the dalrya fixing

485
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,240
leads to celebrate the failure.

486
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,720
I mean,

487
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,320
is it possible that you make

488
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,600
I'll give it to our leader

489
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,600
and let him

490
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,440
transfer it to the cultural department.

491
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,040
Let's see if we can

492
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,200
make it a

493
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,480
underwater archaeology activity

494
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,440
in Dayanjiao.

495
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,680
Thank you, Mr. Bai.

496
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,880
You're welcome.

497
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,560
Let me show you a picture.

498
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,640
This sea picture

499
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,080
shows the sea area of Dayanjiao.

500
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,560
You're going there, right?

501
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,400
Yes, that's right.

502
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,920
There are many dark rivers here.

503
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,400
So the probability of sinking

504
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,440
is very high.

505
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,000
The probability of sinking is very high.

506
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,160
If you're not sure,

507
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,640
you can run five kilometers.

508
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,560
Captain,

509
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,960
my parents went to Yang'an's house.

510
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,840
Can't they be in trouble again?

511
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,480
Don't talk nonsense.

512
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,040
Let's talk after the training.

513
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,520
Yes.

514
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,160
Mom,

515
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,000
are Zongqing's parents here?

516
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
No.

517
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,040
I bought so many things.

518
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,840
I'm so busy

519
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,200
and I'm so busy.

520
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,360
I didn't go out

521
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,280
or work in the airport.

522
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,840
I almost broke my leg.

523
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,040
Mom,

524
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,880
are you going out?

525
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,480
Your dad is looking for me.

526
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,480
I have to go there.

527
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,720
Your dad is not here.

528
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,080
Zongqing's parents

529
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,800
will be here soon.

530
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,200
He wants to see them.

531
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,080
They're here

532
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,360
to see you.

533
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,840
It's useless to tell them.

534
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,680
It doesn't matter

535
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,440
if we're here or not.

536
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:32,960
Let's go.

537
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,040
No, you can't go.

538
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,200
All right.

539
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,520
I'm telling you.

540
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,880
When they come,

541
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,960
you have to be strong.

542
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,720
Besides,

543
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,120
your parents will be back soon.

544
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,280
Hurry up.

545
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,800
Mom, you...

546
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
Look, everything is dripping.

547
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,840
Look.

548
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,800
Mom, don't go.

549
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,160
Mom.

550
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,360
Mom, I can't cook.

551
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,360
Aunt Lin,

552
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,000
after all, today is the first time

553
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,280
Yangyang has seen

554
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Zongqing's parents.

555
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,520
Otherwise, we would still...

556
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,800
Look at you.

557
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,640
You're soft-hearted.

558
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,160
We've already seen Zongqing.

559
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,120
You should let the old couple

560
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,640
meet Yangyang.

561
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,480
Think about it.

562
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,360
If we're here,

563
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,560
what would happen?

564
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,480
You prepare the food in the kitchen.

565
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,480
I'll chat with the guests in the living room.

566
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,760
Yangyang is playing tricks

567
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,000
and playing tricks.

568
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,600
It's not that cheap.

569
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,760
What if Yangyang

570
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,560
messes up?

571
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,200
That's his own problem.

572
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:24,920
I'm telling you.

573
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,520
You have to agree with me.

574
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,480
Before,

575
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,160
I checked my husband for my daughter.

576
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,000
Today,

577
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,280
I'll check my wife

578
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,480
for my soldier.

579
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,600
Why are you so nervous?

580
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,320

00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,720
If this happens again,

778
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:40,920
Coach.

779
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:41,920
Mr. Bai.

780
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,560
How is Zhong Qing doing in the army?

781
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,240
Not bad.

782
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,280
He's a qualified soldier.

783
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,280
He's our only military fan since he was a child.

784
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,080
He hid from us during the college entrance examination.

785
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,240
He got into the military school.

786
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,800
After graduation,

787
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,040
he still hid from us

788
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,360
and joined the army.

789
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,480
He's used to making decisions for himself.

790
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,320
He even informed us about the engagement

791
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,320
a few days ago.

792
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,600
With your words,

793
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,520
he's not saying that Zhong Qing is uneducated.

794
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,040
I mean,

795
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,120
since childhood,

796
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,720
we've always respected Zhong Qing's decision

797
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,520
and believed in his choice.

798
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,960
You've met Yangyang.

799
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,640
Are you satisfied with him?

800
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,560
Yes.

801
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,800
Of course.

802
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,720
Men shouldn't have high expectations.

803
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,000
To be honest,

804
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
my Yangyang is good at cooking.

805
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,240
He invited his good friend Tang Xin

806
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,640
to cook for you today.

807
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,800
Lan.

808
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
He's a foodie.

809
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,520
We can tell.

810
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,840
Don't laugh.

811
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,120
I spoiled him since he was a child.

812
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,160
Lan always praised him for being a good soldier.

813
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,160
We all like him.

814
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,760
But don't mind

815
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,200
that Yangyang is young and ignorant.

816
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,200
I like Yangyang.

817
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,800
We respect his decision.

818
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,200
His choice is our choice.

819
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,720
Yes.

820
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:11,880
周青,

821
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,680
I'm here.

822
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,400
Hurry.

823
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,360
Wang Xing.

824
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:25,960
Yes?

825
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,600
Take him back.

826
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,360
Yes.

827
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,960
Left, right...

828
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,160
Monkey sc Skype around!

829
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,160
I did all the work.

830
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,040
Do you know how to do it?

831
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,480
Why not?

832
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,880
Last time, Li was like a chicken nest to me.

833
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,920
That's your head.

834
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,120
You didn't sleep well when you were a kid.

835
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,160
Stop!

836
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,800
Huang Tiancheng.

837
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,440
Yes.

838
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,240
Come out.

839
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:08,880
Yes.

840
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,320
Who did this to your hair?

841
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,920
Report!

842
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,520
Come out!

843
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,320
I did it.

844
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,080
That's all?

845
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,120
Report!

846
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,520
I just shaved half of it.

847
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,120
It's just a hair dryer.

848
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,360
It looks good after shaving.

849
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,000
Laugh!

850
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,480
Okay, let's start with the training.

851
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,400
I'll shave it after the training.

852
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,160
Get ready.

853
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:42,960
Yes.

854
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,440
Everyone.

855
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,120
Tonight's training is over.

856
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,240
The night is bright.

857
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,840
Everyone, take him away.

858
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,520
March!

859
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,640
March!

860
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,360
Le Tong.

861
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,840
You're so thick-skinned.

862
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,840
What's wrong with you?

863
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:11,840
Everyone.

864
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,720
What?

865
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,920
I have good news for you.

866
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,160
Uncle agreed to send Yang Yang back.

867
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:16,880
Really?

868
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,680
Really?

869
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,480
Yes.

870
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,520
Yes.

871
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,400
Yes.

872
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,200
Yes.

873
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,160
Yes.

874
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,040
Yes.

875
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,920
Yes.

876
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,880
Yes.

877
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,840
Yes.

878
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,720
Yes.

879
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,600
Yes.

880
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,840
Usually I keep one in vai...

881
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,680
What?

882
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:29,800
1.0

883
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,560
What are you going to do

884
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,160
I have already informed the Ministry of Justice.

885
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,880
You are going to study in the Political Bureau.

886
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,120
You go and get it done.

887
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:42,920
Yes.

888
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,880
Only if you do it together

889
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,320
can I feel at ease.

890
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,560
Understood.

891
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,880
Be careful.

892
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,560
Go straight. Go straight.

893
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,320
Okay, go straight.

894
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,640
Go straight. Go straight.

895
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,120
Tell me to stay still.

896
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,800
There is a shoe cabinet on the right. Be careful.

897
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,120
Okay.

898
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,880
Go straight. Go straight.

899
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,040
Go straight.

900
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,160
Yes.

901
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,240
Go straight.

902
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,520
Stop.

903
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,560
Turn left.

904
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,680
Take the first three steps.

905
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,880
One, two, three.

906
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,560
Turn right.

907
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,000
Okay, you can keep going.

908
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,520
Okay.

909
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,560
Stop. Stop.

910
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,160
Mr. Zhong Qing.

911
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,600
Let me introduce you.

912
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
This is our future house.

913
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,720
Do you like it?

914
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,640
Did you make it all by yourself?

915
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,600
Yes.

916
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,080
Why didn't you ask me to help you?

917
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,360
You are so busy in the army.

918
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,120
And I can do it myself.

919
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,480
Honey, let me ask you something.

920
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,440
How did you rent this house?

921
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,440
This is a friend's rented out-of-town house.

922
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,520
It's just a small place.

923
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,400
It's by the sea.

924
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,440
The rent is less than 2,000 yuan.

925
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:58,960
How about this?

926
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,000
From now on, all my salary

927
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,080
will be paid in installments.

928
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,480
The rent will be deducted from the inside.

929
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,560
Okay.

930
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,520
I didn't force you.

931
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,720
It's a deal.

932
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,600
Captain.

933
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,560
Captain.

934
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,600
Sit down.

935
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,720
What's this?

936
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,760
Captain, you bought snacks again?

937
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,160
Captain Wu.

938
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,520
The payment for the hospitality fee

939
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,520
will be deducted from the installments.

940
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,000
Okay, I get it.

941
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:34,960
You got lots of snacks for me.

942
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:35,640
Yes.

943
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,640
Give me a few.

944
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,680
You have money.

945
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,400
It's okay.

946
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,320
I left some for her.

947
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,320
Thank you for the snacks.

948
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:46,960
Thanks, Captain.

949
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,120
Enjoy the food.

950
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,920
You can trad it later on.

951
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,840
Okay.

952
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,480
Captain.

953
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,480
Sit down.

954
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Take a seat.

955
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,120
Where's Zeng Qing?

956
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,920
He's gone for husbandry

957
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,000
and he won't eat lunch anymore.

958
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,520
Come and eat

959
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,520
This is good

960
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,600
Come

961
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,720
Come

962
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,360
Ok, the sea theme is done

963
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,600
Time priority

964
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,800
Seem Courtesy

965
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,400
Yangyang, you owe me a big favor

966
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,720
Don't say that.

967
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,720
It suits you.

968
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,120
Xinxin.

969
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,000
You're so ugly.

970
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,680
This is a wedding dress shop.

971
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,640
Can't you be affected by such a romantic atmosphere?

972
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,120
I'm not married.

973
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,200
Why would I be affected?

974
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,800
Then show it to me.

975
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,920
I want to make you beautiful.

976
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,600
Please.

977
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,240
Song Qing.

978
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,600
Captain.

979
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,520
How was it?

980
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,880
Captain Hu.

981
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,640
Okay.

982
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,920
Are you satisfied now?

983
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,840
What's wrong?

984
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
Is it weird?

985
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,520
No.

986
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,400
No.

987
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,880
I just think

988
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,760
your dress is different from what you usually wear.

989
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,640
Is it pretty?

990
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,520
Yes.

991
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,840
Then it's not pretty at all.

992
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:17,920
No.

993
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,240
You look good in everything.

994
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,480
Why are you here?

995
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,120

996
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,120

997
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,240
Canceled?

998
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,240
