00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,180
Get ready for��

2
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,020
Roger

3
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,720
Fire

4
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,900
The president is blocked.

5
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,560
Fry...

6
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,560
We have found this out,

7
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,620
the courier is not here.

8
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,060
The figure

9
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,560
is not in the picture.

10
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,920
Here said

11
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,200
Ms. Jian.

12
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,060
Are you 경

13
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:32,560
아

14
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,000
Well.

15
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,020
맡

16
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,760
Yes.

17
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,280
The body was sent here yesterday.

18
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,600
We need to be sure that our advisor proves that

19
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,240
the

20
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,120
Kang요 goons are telling the truth.

21
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,720
Come on, me too.

22
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,640
Chief Song.

23
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,680
After investigation,

24
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,360
we found no trace of the commander.

25
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,320
We just repeated

26
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
the same steps once again.

27
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't worry.

28
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,280
There should be time.

29
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,280
That soldier.

30
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,320
It's time. I need to take medicine.

31
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,000
Shut up.

32
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,240
Squad leader.

33
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,800
You need to take medicine.

34
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,720
It's a life-saving medicine.

35
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,240
Two drops.

36
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,320
Get some water.

37
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,040
It can't be smoked.

38
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,600
Be careful.

39
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,440
Smells fine.

40
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,540
Let's go.

41
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,240
The team leader and the guard are confirming the location of the highest command post of the Blue Army.

42
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,240
Let's meet up at the fastest speed.

43
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,840
How far is it?

44
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,840
It's about one and a half kilometers.

45
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,640
Let's go.

46
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,240
Yes.

47
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
The Blue Army

48
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,040
Thank you, Princess Yangyang, for the birthday gift.

49
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,240
Actually, if there's nothing else,

50
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,440
you can go out for a walk.

51
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,840
You don't have to be at home.

52
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,640
What?

53
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,240
My birthday gift.

54
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,440
No.

55
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,840
How old is it?

56
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
You still want a birthday gift?

57
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,240
I want a big gift when I grow up.

58
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,440
I don't want a small one.

59
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,840
Your dad's birthday gift

60
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,440
is for your grandson.

61
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
You have nothing.

62
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,840
Come here.

63
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
Get up.

64
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,840
I'll answer the phone.

65
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,440
Hello, Han.

66
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,640
Sister,

67
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,440
you're lucky that you didn't come to work today.

68
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,440
What's wrong?

69
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Mr. Han,

70
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
the real gold and silver are all sent to the company.

71
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
You're famous.

72
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,240
What real gold and silver?

73
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,440
Mr. Han

74
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,040
has sponsored a batch of camera equipment

75
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,840
to celebrate your birthday.

76
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,040
Then you'll take it?

77
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
No.

78
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,640
It's all on the reception table.

79
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,840
Okay, that's it.

80
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,640
I got it.

81
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
Who is this?

82
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,440
A friend.

83
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,440
This friend sent you real gold and silver.

84
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
It's interesting to you.

85
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,640
Nonsense.

86
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,440
No.

87
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,440
Xinxin,

88
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,040
when the five-fourth exercise is not here,

89
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,440
you should be careful

90
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,040
about the relationship between people.

91
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,840
Dad, mom,

92
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
I have to swear.

93
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,440
I have no other relationship with this friend.

94
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Just a normal friend.

95
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,440
I won't have it in the future.

96
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,040
No, we can rest assured.

97
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,840
You have to let the five-fourth rest assured.

98
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,440
Yes.

99
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,040
The key is that the five-fourth believes you.

100
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,040
But if others don't know the situation,

101
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,440
what if it spreads out again?

102
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,640
Okay, okay, okay.

103
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,440
Dad, mom,

104
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,440
that's enough.

105
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,240
He is not as careful as you think.

106
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,440
Hurry up.

107
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
Next part.

108
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,840
Okay.

109
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,240
Next part.

110
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,480
Xissan.

111
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,600
The 곧只许在你身边

112
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,240
while Jaguar

113
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,440
Cumulus are at his tonal place,

114
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,240
you are didn't hear about Mi Óch Majesty.

115
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,240
He said,

116
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
installing a trap

117
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,040
is a guarantee for both rosters,

118
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:11,520
otherwise

119
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,480
It's like he said

120
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,640
He will never be in danger again,

121
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,680
even if he 친구�皆不玩

122
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,240
Go.

123
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,760
Come.

124
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,040
Move.

125
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,920
Kobayashi dye

126
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,420
Got it.

127
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,020
I'll go.

128
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,000
Leader�� Sorry.

129
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,040
You were substance of breach.

130
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,160
Fall out.

131
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,160
Thesuji 1992 Mission BALA疆

132
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,320
extraordinary mission.

133
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,480
From now on,

134
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,280
write a request to由

135
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:43,320
to definitely stop

136
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:50,960
Ah

137
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,400
They're good cars for shopping.

138
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,400
Sure, I'd buy one for you.

139
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,920
Don't forget to check.

140
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,960
Thank you.

141
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,020
It won't be much interest to you.

142
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,840
Go back to work.

143
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,080
나오는

144
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,680
It's a new car accident.

145
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,800
I'll tell Mr. Han to come to the meeting

146
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,400
on the phone.

147
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,000
It's easier to say it in person.

148
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,480
Go ahead.

149
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,760
Changchong Group has

150
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,720
completed the reshuffle.

151
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,160
I'll be the chairman of the group

152
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,160
and I'll be in charge of all the business.

153
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,200
That's indeed

154
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,240
an important thing.

155
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,000
There's another thing.

156
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,000
I hope that

157
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,160
no matter what difficulties you encounter

158
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,520
or what you need,

159
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,080
you can always find me

160
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,200
and my father.

161
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,200
Thank you for your kindness.

162
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,440
I have a question.

163
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,560
You're in charge of Changchong now.

164
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,520
What about your father and brother?

165
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,720
They're

166
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,840
on the second line.

167
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,600
What's his name?

168
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,200
Three-Eigle-exc Rails.

169
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,000
He's about to circumcise and

170
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,280
go out of town tomorrow.

171
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,960
A good driver

172
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,000
like you

173
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
has the ability

174
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,520
to protect the senior officially

175
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,440
in the future.

176
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,520
Will you give me the full cover?

177
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,760
You're an expert,

178
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,880
Designed for the Karabakh region,

179
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,560
marks so,

180
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,800
but not exclusive to the brothers,

181
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
at one of them.

182
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,960
There needs to be different Hearts and Heart.

183
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,720
For few rounds,

184
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,000
look closely.

185
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,520
Their hearts are at men's bowing.

186
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,760
This is the spirits of the army.

187
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,720
And our hearts

188
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,840
are demos that the finger is so close.

189
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,160
screws with Greatérie 5th.

190
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
Chief, we have two combat team members

191
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
who are on a mission.

192
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
They were attacked by unknown armed personnel

193
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
on the island.

194
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
They were removed after a short-range contact.

195
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,160
The superior ordered our men to turn into the first-level combat status.

196
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Send the team members to check the situation.

197
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
If necessary, the enemy can fire directly.

198
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,160
The second-level combat status is to send the team members

199
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
to check the situation.

200
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
If necessary, the enemy can fire directly.

201
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
As for the staff,

202
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,160
the military sowie from the Wan bye may be a reasonable understanding for them.

203
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,560
We saw clearly the aims of the members'

204
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,160
useful spare parts.

205
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
But we didn't notice this condition.

206
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,160
It's too awful.

207
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,160
The machine gun...

208
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
was мояed from our view.

209
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
We were gonna shoot it away,

210
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
but it really was a big south star.

211
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,800
So there doesn't look like we need

212
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
overwhelmed people anymore.

213
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,080
Today,

214
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,700
we need to do something to support them.

215
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,160
Tank the Desert Control System.

216
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:27,360
Tell Lieutenant General

217
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,980
about our reaches,

218
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,460
and train our troops.

219
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,320
Captain.

220
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,340
interconnect with the Commander-in-Chief.

221
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,040
Bring the location of the WeChat message.

222
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,520
We'll meet here.

223
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,480
and leave the well warehouse.

224
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,360
I will go to theicking

225
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,280
when Tonight,

226
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,280
the well requires me to pass the screening fund.

227
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,560
Why don't you do it?

228
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,520
Everyone has enough lotuses.

229
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,240
Your friend said I did it.

230
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,760

231
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,480

233
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,000
Hold this.

234
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,800

235
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,040

During this time

350
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,080
You and others need to keep a safe distance

351
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,080
After the results come out

352
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,080

You can go back if you have something

356
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
I want to stay alone for a while

Why are you so late again?

362
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,080
I had a temporary heat stroke today

363
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,080
So I got off work late

364
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
You said you are a child

365
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,080
Life is so irregular

366
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
Mom told you

367
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,080
Zong Qing is not at home

368
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,080
You moved back

369
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
I am with your dad

370
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
This day is over

371
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
That's a big eye, a small eye

372
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
We have nothing to do

373
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,080
I'm not going to eat

374
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,080

How lively you are back

379
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
Talk to mom

380
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,080
Look at your dad's face

381
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Isn't this close to the hospital?

382
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,080
What's going on on the road?

383
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,080
How is your hospital work?

384
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Are you still used to it?

385
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
Yes

386
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,080
You and dad don't worry

387
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
You are at home now

388
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
Eat more, watch more TV

389
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
Then don't fight

390
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,080
Wait for the weekend

391
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
I will try to go to see you earlier

392
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
Mom, I won't say it anymore

393
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,080
I'm here for work, bye

394
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,080
Hello, Director Wan

395
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,080
21 Bed English Foreign Maid

396
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,080
Can you arrive in half an hour?

397
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
No problem, I'll be there soon

398
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
The basic separation is dangerous

399
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
But it still needs observation

400
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Qiaoqiao

401
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,080
I want to hear the truth

402
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,080
The truth is

403
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
We have tried our best

404
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,080
Take five pieces of broken pieces from his head

405
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
Unreasonable fragments

406
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
but

407
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,080
But there are two broken pieces that cannot be removed

408
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
Broken pieces will crush the eye nerves

409
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,080
Cause his vision to continue to decline

410
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
Until the nerves are cut off

411
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,080
The brain can't be recovered

412
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,080
You are doctors

413
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,080
You must have a way, right?

414
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,080
The eye nerves belong to the central nerve

415
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,080
Once cut off, there is no way to re-ignite

416
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,080
His blood vessels above are thinner than hair

417
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,080
Can't be recovered at all

418
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
Not to mention the possibility of excretion reaction

419
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

420
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

421
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

422
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

423
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

424
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

425
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

426
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

427
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

428
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

429
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

430
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

431
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

432
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

433
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

434
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

435
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

436
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

437
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

438
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

439
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

440
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,080
The brain can't be recovered at all

441
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,040
What happened to your brother

442
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,000
He didn't go to play

443
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,060
Hello

444
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,200
夠

445
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,860
Yuan

446
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,400
Bye

447
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,680
Hello

448
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,300
it's me

449
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,540
Jingxing

450
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,080
Why are you picking up the phone so late this evening

451
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,080
I suddenly miss you.

452
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,080
I'm fine.

453
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
When will you come back?

454
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
I miss you so much.

455
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
Soon.

456
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,080
We won the show this time.

457
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,080
Really?

458
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,080
That's great.

459
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,080
Then,

460
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
you're all fine, right?

461
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,080
No one is hurt, right?

462
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
Song Qing.

463
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,080
Well,

464
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
we're going to meet.

465
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
I'll hang up now.

466
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,080
Wait.

467
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
I'm here.

468
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
Be careful.

469
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,080
Come back soon.

470
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
I'll wait for you.

471
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
I'll wait for you.

472
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,080
I see.

473
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,080
Don't worry.

474
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,080
Go to bed early.

475
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,080
Good night.

476
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,080
Song Qing.

477
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
No.

478
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
Dad, mom, why are you

479
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
not sleeping in the room?

480
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
What are you doing here?

481
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
Where did you go?

482
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
Who is going to sleep?

483
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,080
I'm working overtime.

484
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,080
I'm afraid I'll disturb you

485
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,080
when I come back at night.

486
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,080
I slept in the office.

487
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,080
I'll show you the draft of overtime.

488
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,080
Is that okay?

489
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
No.

490
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
It looks like a draft.

491
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
No, I mean,

492
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
Comrade Tang,

493
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,080
you're following me

494
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
just to beat me up.

495
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,080
I'm really busy.

496
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,080
I'll beat you up.

497
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
I'm going to take a walk.

498
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,080
It's early in the morning.

499
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,080
What are you going to do?

500
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,080
It's early in the morning.

501
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
It's a day's work.

502
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
Today is your dad's birthday.

503
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Why didn't you tell him

504
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,080
you wanted to eat?

505
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
Dad.

506
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,080
Well,

507
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,080
happy birthday.

508
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
No.

509
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,080
I'll give you a small gift.

510
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,080
No.

511
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,080
Wu Si proposed to me.

512
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,080
Say it again.

513
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,080
I said it several times.

514
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,080
It's the same.

515
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,080
Wu Si proposed to me.

516
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
Let's propose before we go.

517
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,080
Will you promise me?

518
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,080
Will you promise me?

519
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,080
I won't promise you.

520
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,080
I have to go play.

521
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,080
I have to go play.

522
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
I have to go play.

523
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,080
He really went.

524
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,080
No.

525
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,080
Mom, you won't push him back?

526
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
Why push him?

527
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,080
He's afraid that people will see him

528
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,080
wipe his tears.

529
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
Mom.

530
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,080
Then this time,

531
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
will Xiaotang really

532
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
save your husband?

533
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,080
You.

534
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,080
You have to be better

535
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,080
than mom.

536
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
Slow down.

537
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,080
Okay.

538
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,080
That's enough.

539
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,080
In a few days,

540
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,080
I don't have to hold him.

541
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
He can walk on his own.

542
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,080
That's great.

543
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,080
Okay.

544
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,080
No problem.

545
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,080
If you have any news,

546
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,080
you can call me anytime.

547
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
Okay. Thank you.

548
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,080
Bye.

549
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,080
Mr. Han.

550
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
I've found the chairman and Mr. Yu Tian.

551
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
Where is he?

552
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
He's in Luoman.

553
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
Luoman?

554
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
You didn't inform us

555
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
beforehand

556
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,080
if there was anything urgent.

557
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,080
Sorry.

558
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,080
I didn't inform you beforehand.

559
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Here's the thing.

560
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,080
We've left all the domestic business

561
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,080
to my youngest son.

562
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,080
Now we can focus on

563
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,080
our favorite business.

564
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
I will focus on this business.

565
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,080
So your son leading

566
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,080
the Changzhou Group,

567
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,080
will he still be covering you up?

568
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,080
Your son took over the Changzhou Group.

569
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,080
Will he still be covering you up?

570
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,080
He won't leave this time.

571
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,080
He's settled down.

572
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,080
No need to cover up.

573
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,080
And there's no return.

574
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,080
So we don't need any cover.

575
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,080
Okay.

576
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
Can I ask a question?

577
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,080
Why did you decide to leave the group?

578
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,080
Mr. William.

579
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,080
Mr. William.

580
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,080
From the last time we met,

581
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,080
to now,

582
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,080
we haven't been able to find the place

583
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,080
where the ship was sinking.

584
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,080
The location of the ship

585
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,080
has not been confirmed.

586
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,080
It's not working.

587
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
I think the efficiency

588
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
needed to be improved.

589
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,080
Well, you know,

590
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,080
that area we're searching,

591
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
it has many underwater currents.

592
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
He said there are many seabed

593
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,080
and many seabed

594
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,080
which increase the difficulty

595
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,080
of searching for the sinking ship.

596
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,080
But you leading it in person,

597
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,080
I think it's a good idea.

598
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,080
Now you're in charge of this.

599
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,080
He thinks it's a good thing.

600
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,080
The efficiency will be improved.

601
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,080
In this case,

602
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,080
can we adjust

603
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,080
our share?

604
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,080
I think the profit should be redistributed

605
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,080
according to the contribution.

606
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,080
What do you mean?

607
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,080
You just mentioned it.

608
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
Because our arrival

609
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
has increased the efficiency.

610
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
So I think

611
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,080
the share should be redistributed.

612
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,080
I think we should redistribute the profit

613
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,080
according to the contribution.

614
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,080
But don't forget,

615
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,080
the more stuff you dig out,

616
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,080
the more of my connections

617
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,080
will be used to sell it.

618
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,080
The more cultural relics you dig out,

619
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,080
the more work he does in sales.

620
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,080
I think I put as much effort

621
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,080
as you guys did.

622
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,080
Plus, without my connections,

623
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,080
it doesn't matter

624
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,080
how much stuff you dig out.

625
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,080
It all will be useless.

626
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,080
Without his connections,

627
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,080
no matter how much cultural relics we dig out,

628
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,080
it will be worthless.

629
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,080
William.

630
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Mr. William.

631
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,080
He's young.

632
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,080
He just said it.

633
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,080
Yutian is too young to understand.

634
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,080
Don't be so hard on him.

635
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,080
Please never mind.

636
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,080
We're old friends.

637
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,080
We have our own rules.

638
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,080
We have our own rules.

639
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,080
We can't hurt our relationship

640
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
for a little profit.

641
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,080
Right?

642
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,080
We're friends.

643
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,080
How we cooperated before,

644
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,080
the same in the future.

645
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,080
How can I hurt you for the interest?

646
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,080
Good.

647
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,080
Good.

648
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,080
Okay?

649
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,080
Okay.

650
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,080
Now, we have to go now.

651
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,080
So, see you next time.

652
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
My friend.

653
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,080
Young man.

654
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,080
Please.

655
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,080
I'll be going.

656
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,080
Okay, bye.

657
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,080
Bye.

658
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,080
Captain Song.

659
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,080
Do you know

660
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,080
what is the safe distance?

661
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Yes, I know.

662
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,080
All right.

663
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,080
Don't worry about it.

664
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,960
I'll take you to see him

665
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,320
Yes, Captain Song

666
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
You be careful too

667
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,320
What am I careful about

668
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,840
OK

669
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:54,920
Stop

670
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,760
Small stop

671
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,000
Get out

672
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,040
What is the navy?

673
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,440
What is the Blue Team?

674
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,840
The army of the army

675
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,880
The country's hot blood wolf

676
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,720
That's amazing

677
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,520
Great great

678
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,480
Xinxin is here

679
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,680
I listen to your speech

680
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,280
But plagiarize our navy

681
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,240
The song of the army

682
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,080
I report to you

683
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,400
Xinxin

684
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,960
Listen to your dad, you are engaged

685
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,040
Where did you find this man?

686
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,520
Introduce my second daughter

687
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,280
Want to find one

688
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,520
Like Xinxin's boyfriend

689
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,280
Not easy

690
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,520
Uncle uncle

691
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,920
How did my dad

692
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,840
Show my boyfriend

693
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,800
Just say this guy is very good to you

694
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,800
Be filial to their old couple

695
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,880
Three phone calls a day

696
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,880
Warm and cold

697
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,520
Eat, wear, use

698
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,400
Go home every day

699
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,360
Last time a boy

700
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,640
Can you buy a jacket and a jacket?

701
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,320
Buy a jacket and a jacket

702
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,200
Dad, that jacket and a jacket

703
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,440
I remember it was me

704
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,200
No, I'm not this

705
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,680
This

706
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,080
Isn't it Chen Lian

707
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,400
I met them after I came back

708
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,200
I said to you

709
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:10,920
Uncle and uncle

710
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,120
Introduce me to the five four

711
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,960
I didn't say this

712
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,800
I didn't say

713
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,520
No

714
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,080
Row

715
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,160
Uncle and uncle

716
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,720
Report to you officially

717
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,200
Xiaotang is indeed engaged

718
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,200
It was introduced by my dad

719
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
The object is high and handsome

720
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,280
And reliable

721
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,920
Buy us food, buy bags

722
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,920
Buy a jacket and a jacket

723
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,440
Yes

724
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,080
Uncle and uncle

725
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,280
What's the matter with the children at home?

726
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,080
Find our old Tang

727
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,320
Okay

728
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,080
You don't have to congratulate me on this

729
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,760
Come on

730
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,480
Stop

731
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,360
You talk

732
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,160
Go go

733
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,680
Just look at your senior

734
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,960
This is a word-for-word

735
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,200
Mr. Tang, don't worry

736
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,720
Xiaotang doesn't care where she is

737
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,960
I am also your Xiaotang

738
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
I this basin of water

739
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,960
You and my mom

740
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,080
I don't want to run away

741
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,960
Don't don't don't

742
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,240
Don't be so close to me

743
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,520
You think I can't bear you

744
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,080
I can't wait for you to marry out this year

745
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,160
Really

746
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,360
Really

747
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,600
Really

748
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Are you eating

749
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,960
I just can't wait

750
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,440
Come on

751
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,720
Mr. Tian

752
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,200
sit

753
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,800
So what's your leader

754
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,720
Care about you

755
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,200
Personal issues

756
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,640
Isn't that the matrices

757
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,040
What do you talk to you?

758
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,440
You have a good thing

759
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,280
Let's be happy together

760
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,640
Say something

761
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,480
How are things denganINE's boyfriend developing

762
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,040
how

763
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,480
Say so

764
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,600
Top Christmas

765
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,680
Consider it

766
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,080
Peter, I'm sorry.

767
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,120
No problem.

768
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,860
Is the

769
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,860
Lai Yang Yang in there?

770
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,860
She's in the operation.

771
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,860
Okay, thank you.

772
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
Are you tired?

773
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,760
I'm hungry.

774
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,520
Eat slowly.

775
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,760
I'll get you some food.

776
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760
What happened to your hand?

777
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,800
It's okay.

778
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,680
I got a little injury during the operation.

779
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,680
Let me see.

780
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,920
No need.

781
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,960
You worked hard today.

782
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
I'll help you pack up.

783
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Mr. Tian.

784
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,000
You...

785
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
You wanted to see me?

786
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I'm here to see you.

787
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,480
Yes, I'm waiting for you.

788
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,480
Hurry up.

789
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,480
So many people.

790
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,480
Is this a meeting?

791
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,480
Why don't you go to the meeting room?

792
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
It's not a meeting.

793
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
But for Tang Xin,

794
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,480
I'm absolutely sure.

795
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,480
What's the situation?

796
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,480
I called you guys here

797
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,480
to plan a engagement party

798
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,480
to give Tang Xin a surprise.

799
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,480
Tang Xin is getting engaged?

800
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,480
I'm sorry.

801
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,480
I'm sorry.

802
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,480
I'm sorry.

803
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
I'm sorry.

804
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,480
I'm sorry.

805
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,480
I'm sorry.

806
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
I'm sorry.

807
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,480
I'm sorry.

808
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,480
I'm sorry.

809
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,480
I'm sorry.

810
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,480
I'm sorry.

811
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,480
I'm sorry.

812
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,480
I'm sorry.

813
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,480
I'm sorry.

814
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,480
I'm sorry.

815
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,480
I'm sorry.

816
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,480
I'm sorry.

817
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,480
I'm sorry.

818
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
I'm sorry.

819
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,480
I'm sorry.

820
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,480
I'm sorry.

821
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
I'm sorry.

822
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,480
I'm sorry.

823
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,480
I'm sorry.

824
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
I'm sorry.

825
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,480
I'm sorry.

826
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,480
I'm sorry.

827
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,480
I'm sorry.

828
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,480
I'm sorry.

829
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,480
Let everything be romantic

830
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,480
Let dreams be as simple as they are

831
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,480
Let your heart hide more expectations

832
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,480
I really don't understand

833
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,480
You say love is too vague

834
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,480
But you give me an answer with your eyes

835
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,480
I can be with you with all my heart

836
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,480
I want to exchange

837
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:48,480
Thank you for waking up the courage that used to be weak

838
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,480
Let everything be random

839
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,480
Let all the simple things become together

840
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,480
Open the bright future

841
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,480
People can't separate us

842
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,480
Every moment is warm

843
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,480
Why is it so lonely in my memory

844
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,480
The loneliness of the time you are in love

845
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,480
I will always miss you

846
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,480
I don't want to regret it

847
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,480
Let the heart be as simple as it is

848
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,480
Let my heart be as simple as it is

849
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,480
Thank you for being by my side

850
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,480
Bright blood and darkness

851
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,480
The bigger the world, the more lonely it is

852
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,480
Only standing by your side

853
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:55,480
I feel warm in my heart

854
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,480
Thank you for watching
