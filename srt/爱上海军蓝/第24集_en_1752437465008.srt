00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,820
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,700
Honey.

3
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,980
I'm sorry today.

4
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,340
I'm going out today.

5
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,340
Why are you sorry?

6
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,440
I'm sorry anyway.

7
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,280
I made you feel bad for nothing.

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,400
It's not just the park and the kids.

9
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,320
How can I feel bad?

10
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,760
I've been much better these days.

11
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,720
I'm not as fragile as when I saw the kids.

12
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,880
Don't worry.

13
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,760
I'm feeling better.

14
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,820
I'm feeling better.

15
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,020
You must be tired today.

16
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,460
Get up. I'll massage your legs.

17
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,900
Come on.

18
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,180
Honey.

19
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,060
Why are you so nice to me?

20
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,620
The nicer you are to me,

21
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,200
the more upset I feel.

22
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,440
Yangyang.

23
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,120
Look at me.

24
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,240
You're my wife.

25
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,160
Don't say that again.

26
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,320
I'm nice to you.

27
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,400
The Long Ballad

28
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,160
This is the machine.

29
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
The doctor will be here soon.

30
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,040
Okay, thank you.

31
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,680
Don't be nervous.

32
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,720
Captain Wang.

33
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,120
Mr. Yang.

34
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,760
Mr. Bai.

35
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,760
Today's recovery treatment

36
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,880
is to relax the heart

37
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
and relax the body on this digital recovery table.

38
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,660
Try to maintain

39
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,500
the balance of ten minutes on this machine.

40
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,740
I can do it.

41
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,260
Come on.

42
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,840
Captain Wang.

43
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,640
Get ready.

44
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
We're about to start.

45
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,640
Come on.

46
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,380
documentation

47
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,260
This machine will turn back an omen in half an hour.

48
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,100
We can hold on now.

49
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,900
Doctor,

50
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,280
the wall is toopart sitting on it.

51
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,060
The current maybe it won't around.

52
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,760
No.

53
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,840
Come on!

54
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,040
Ready!

55
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,800
Go!

56
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,640
Come on!

57
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,720
Come on!

58
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Come on!

59
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,920
Come on!

60
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,200
Come on!

61
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,880
Come on!

62
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,840
Come on!

63
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,680
Come on!

64
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,520
Come on!

65
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,560
Come on!

66
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,040
JiangDDao was concerned about Zitou's safety very much.

67
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,620
But JiangDDaoayedo

68
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,600
raised a sound,

69
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,080
and said that

70
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,360
the plan of Molina was about to be prepared.

71
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,040
Yes.

72
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,300
It's Telecom Japanese Charity Group.

73
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,520
Blろう,

74
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,740
meet me separately,

75
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,520
and talk about it again.

76
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,340
Does that mean

77
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,640
by this plan.

78
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,840
What's your next plan?

79
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,620
When will it be ready?

80
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,520
Yes.

81
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,880
Are you going back to the army tomorrow?

82
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,320
Yes.

83
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,680
Time flies.

84
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,640
Honey.

85
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,720
How about I stay with the Brigadier for a few more days?

86
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,560
I'll stay with you for a few more days.

87
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,800
No.

88
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,280
You'd better go back first.

89
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,360
I've been living in the house for ten days.

90
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,880
Honey.

91
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,960
You...

92
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,720
You'd better go back to your parents' house.

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,280
At least someone will take care of you.

94
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,640
If you're so worried,

95
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,400
you can stay at home and press a camera

96
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,520
to watch me eat and sleep every day.

97
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,280
That'll work, right?

98
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,920
Yes.

99
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,000
You're right.

100
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,120
Honey, don't worry.

101
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,160
I'll be just like when you were at home.

102
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
I'll be healthy.

103
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,160
That's them?

104
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,320
Yes.

105
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
General continuaat.

106
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,520
You're awake.

107
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,920
You're awake?

108
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,520
Captain Zong.

109
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,480
What are you doing?

110
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,000
You're holding the lead.

111
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,680
All right.

112
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,880
Don't do this to me.

113
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,400
You really want to stay with me for 10 kilometers?

114
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,680
Captain Zong.

115
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,000
I've run

116
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,040
10 kilometers today.

117
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,760
Yin Dong.

118
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,440
Comrades.

119
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,160
Captain Zong asked us to stay with him for 10 kilometers.

120
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,120
Are you willing to stay with us?

121
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,040
Yes.

122
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,960
I brought it for you.

123
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,000
What?

124
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,160
You borrowed it?

125
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,560
He swore to Lian Qi

126
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,600
that Captain Chen wouldn't eat snacks

127
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,960
if he didn't recover.

128
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,800
I went to the hospital to see Captain Chen.

129
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,320
He's recovered now.

130
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,960
Get in the car.

131
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,520
Hurry.

132
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,120
Did you hear the sound?

133
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,320
Yes.

134
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,240
Did you hear the sound?

135
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,360
Yes.

136
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,200
You heard it?

137
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,760
Why didn't you pass?

138
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Do you think

139
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,040
I won't make your dream come true?

140
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,480
Or

141
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,720
I won't give you

142
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,720
a bullet to your head?

143
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,520
You know this, right?

144
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,440
It's because of something we know.

145
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,280
It almost destroyed our whole team.

146
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,880
Tell me.

147
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,460
Please tell me,

148
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,640
why

149
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,360
you didn't stop

150
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,280
so we can fight against the enemy together

151
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,560
and whom you failed to protect.

152
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,760
Nobody ran 15 kilometers

153
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:50,460
but hung on your

154
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:50,680

155
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,440
Yes.

156
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,520
As you know,

157
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,800
it's boy склад can't rip a unit apart,

158
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,680
so remember to keep oral.

159
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,320
Mom, please help me get my son

160
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,440
そう sam got it

161
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,480
Hello

162
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,560
Yangyang

163
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
Zongqing went back

164
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes, his house has expired

165
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,280
Then you move back

166
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,600
I've prepared everything.

167
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,200
Don't worry.

168
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,920
We'll go back together on the weekend.

169
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,160
Okay.

170
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,600
Tell me how you're feeling.

171
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,400
If you feel unwell,

172
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,680
tell us.

173
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,600
Come on, stop nagging.

174
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,080
Don't think I'm nagging.

175
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,840
You're about to get married.

176
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,040
You don't know

177
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,360
how sick she is.

178
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,000
Our sister-in-law Wang,

179
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,360
her miscarriage...

180
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,840
Don't talk about it.

181
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,320
I'm fine, Dad and Mom.

182
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,000
Life must go on.

183
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,920
Right.

184
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,840
Yangyang, you're right.

185
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,840
Your health is the most important.

186
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,080
Don't participate in the evaluation.

187
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,320
Yes, yes.

188
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,520
Your dad is right.

189
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,800
The evaluation caused some troubles.

190
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,000
We don't care about the money.

191
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,800
It's not good for you to play around.

192
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,720
Why don't you find a job

193
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,800
and get in touch with others?

194
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,120
You'll be fine when you're in a good mood.

195
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,480
You'll have a good life.

196
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,320
I see.

197
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,720
I'll hang up.

198
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,440
Hurry up!

199
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
Hurry up!

200
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Hurry up!

201
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,840
Hurry up!

202
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,320
Five kilometers to go!

203
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,440
Hurry up!

204
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,560
Hurry up!

205
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,800
Come on!

206
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,800
Hurry up!

207
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,080
We can't do this!

208
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,200
Hurry up!

209
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,280
Hurry up!

210
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,400
Hurry up!

211
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,800
Hurry up!

212
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,920
We can't do this!

213
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,280
Hurry up!

214
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,760
Hurry up!

215
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,920
The ones behind!

216
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,040
Go back and don't let them go!

217
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,040
Hurry up!

218
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
Hurry up!

219
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,440
Hurry up!

220
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,680
The ones behind!

221
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
Hurry up!

222
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
Hurry up!

223
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Hurry up!

224
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Hurry up!

225
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
Hurry up!

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hurry up!

227
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,480
Hurry up!

228
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,320
Hello, Aunt Wang.

229
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,280
What's wrong?

230
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,440
Tang Xin.

231
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,280
Are you busy now?

232
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,360
Is Yangyang in trouble?

233
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,320
You know Yangyang's situation.

234
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,400
Zong Qing has been taking care of him recently.

235
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,520
But Zong Qing has already gone back to the army

236
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,440
and I want Yangyang to move back.

237
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,440
But he refused.

238
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,960
I want to go over and take care of him.

239
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,000
But he refused.

240
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,640
I want to go over and take care of him.

241
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,760
But he refused.

242
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,440
I want to go over and take care of him.

243
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
But he refused.

244
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
But he refused.

245
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,680
I'm really worried.

246
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,360
So...

247
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,360
I understand, Aunt Wang.

248
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,560
Don't worry.

249
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,280
I'll go over and stay with Yangyang for a few days.

250
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,160
I wanted to see him a long time ago.

251
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,480
Thank you, kid.

252
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,280
You're welcome.

253
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,280
That's all.

254
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,720
Goodbye, Aunt Wang.

255
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
Hello, Mr. Han.

256
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,880
Tang Xin.

257
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,680
Since Luo Man came back,

258
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,480
we haven't seen each other for a long time.

259
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
Come over for dinner.

260
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,520
Let's chat, okay?

261
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,280
Mr. Han, it's really not a coincidence today.

262
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,480
I have an appointment with my best friend.

263
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,120
I have to go with her tonight.

264
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,400
Just have dinner.

265
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,160
I won't bother you with your best friend.

266
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,400
It's like this.

267
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,920
You may not know.

268
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,720
My best friend

269
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,960
has been in a special situation recently.

270
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,280
Next time.

271
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,320
Next time for sure.

272
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,560
Today is my birthday.

273
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,000
Seeing that we

274
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,040
have experienced life and death,

275
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,600
let's celebrate my birthday with me.

276
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,440
I won't ask anyone.

277
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,680
You're here alone?

278
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,680
Report.

279
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,280
The team is in a bad mood.

280
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,880
They've been fighting here for a long time.

281
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,400
Xiao Jing.

282
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,200
Captain.

283
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,280
Don't help me today.

284
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,000
I'll let you punish me.

285
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,280
Is the training field

286
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,720
a place for you to vent your anger alone?

287
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,200
Who would give you the back?

288
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,640
Can't you be more responsible

289
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,120
for your own actions?

290
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,720
I'm not here to help you.

291
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,840
I'm here to help you.

292
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,880
I'm here to help you.

293
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,080
I'm here to help you.

294
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
I'm here to help you.

295
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,320
I'm here to help you.

296
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,400
I'm here to help you.

297
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,520
I'm here to help you.

298
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,800
Stand up!

299
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,680
Yes.

300
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,960
Come in.

301
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,320
Mr. Han.

302
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,200
I knew you'd come.

303
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,720
I didn't know it was your birthday

304
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,840
and I didn't prepare it in advance.

305
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,080
I bought a whole cake.

306
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,160
Here's your gift.

307
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,360
Thank you.

308
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,560
Sit down.

309
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
There are only a few people

310
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,640
who can get in touch with the core secrets

311
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,240
of the company.

312
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Now you have to

313
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,760
find out all the people

314
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,040
who are involved in this.

315
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,760
No matter what you do,

316
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,080
you have to

317
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,840
get the core secrets out within a week.

318
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,000
Boss,

319
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,960
we have to check their computers

320
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,720
and phones.

321
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,440
If we do that,

322
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,960
we'll be clear.

323
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,520
Can you think about it?

324
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,920
How did you get the email

325
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,640
from the female reporter's computer?

326
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,080
Yes, I understand.

327
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,320
Mr. Han, there's one more thing.

328
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,400
Now, apart from Li Wang and Zhang Xuming,

329
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,960
the other three people are on the sea.

330
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,280
I'm afraid a week is not enough.

331
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,480
You don't have to worry about that.

332
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,120
Ms. Zhong.

333
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,840
Yes.

334
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,200
Call them right away

335
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,160
and ask them to go back to the company to work.

336
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,200
Okay, Mr. Han.

337
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,440
Finding this person

338
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,680
is so important to the company.

339
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,080
I don't have to say it, right?

340
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,240
If you can't find this person,

341
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
get out of here.

342
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,240
There's a saying, although I've said it

343
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,640
countless times before,

344
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,720
but today is my birthday.

345
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,400
I still want to ask you again.

346
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,120
Can you consider accepting me?

347
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,840
Mr. Han, I've said it many times before.

348
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,720
You've helped me a lot

349
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,080
and saved me.

350
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
I'm really grateful to you.

351
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,240
But what you just said is

352
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,920
I'm telling the truth.

353
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,360
It's impossible for us.

354
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,200
Just like what you said,

355
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,040
we've known each other for a long time.

356
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,240
We've also experienced some things in the middle.

357
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,560
It's exactly because of

358
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,440
what we've been through together

359
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,480
that I realized

360
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,160
that we have a tacit understanding.

361
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,520
But I already have a boyfriend.

362
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,200
And even if I don't have a boyfriend,

363
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,000
we're not suitable for each other.

364
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,680
Do you understand?

365
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,480
Yes.

366
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,040
If what you're investigating

367
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,160
is the truth,

368
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,600
then our family

369
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,280
is a big thief's nest.

370
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,840
Which good girl

371
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,640
would want to marry into the thief's nest?

372
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,080
Do you understand?

373
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,200
Mr. Han, I...

374
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
You don't have to explain anything.

375
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,040
Because what you said is right.

376
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,880
But Tang Xin,

377
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,640
I have to tell you.

378
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,760
I was born in a family

379
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,760
and I have no choice.

380
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,120
I grew up in a certain environment

381
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,160
and I have no choice.

382
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,880
But from now on,

383
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,920
I can decide

384
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,000
my future.

385
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,120
So don't reject me now.

386
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,960
Give me some time.

387
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,200
I'll prove it to you.

388
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,000
Happy birthday to you again.

389
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,680
You can hold on.

390
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,840
Look.

391
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,200
It's been an hour and a half.

392
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,880
It's almost done.

393
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,360
The doctor said it would take half an hour.

394
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,880
It's okay. I can do it.

395
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,720
Xiao Chen, listen to the doctor.

396
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,200
It's almost done.

397
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,560
Mom, I'm really fine.

398
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,840
Look, I'm much better now.

399
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,200
I'm much better than

400
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,000
when I first started.

401
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,000
Zi Jian.

402
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Don't make me suffer anymore.

403
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,880
I can do it by myself.

404
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,560
I'm fine.

405
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,360
I'm fine at home, right?

406
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,160
I'm afraid you'll worry about me.

407
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,120
Okay. If you keep practicing,

408
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,480
you'll see Lu Fei tomorrow.

409
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,840
You're right.

410
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,280
The last five minutes.

411
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,200
Let's check the time.

412
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,720
Five, four,

413
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,600
three, two, one.

414
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,440
It's time.

415
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,400
I'll check the body.

416
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,080
I'll call the doctor.

417
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,680
Okay.

418
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,520
Stop.

419
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,040
I knew you'd come.

420
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,040
My mom sent you, right?

421
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,400
Who sent me? Don't worry.

422
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,680
Anyway, my husband left.

423
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,800
My best friend lives with me.

424
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,440
Why?

425
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,320
You're not happy?

426
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,360
Happy?

427
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,640
What about your household chores?

428
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,040
I've put them away.

429
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,040
You've put them away?

430
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,920
You're not the owner anymore?

431
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,680
Actually, I was the owner

432
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,040
at first.

433
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,800
But in the end,

434
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,040
I didn't feel any achievement.

435
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160
You mean

436
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,560
you want to change the battlefield?

437
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,400
I'm a doctor

438
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,480
who can't keep my child.

439
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,480
But I can help other mothers

440
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,120
keep their children.

441
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,280
I can help more little creatures

442
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,800
to come to this world safely.

443
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,080
That's the only thing I can do

444
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,360
and the only thing I want to do.

445
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,040
Otherwise, I'll let Xi Xi down.

446
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,400
Have you made up your mind?

447
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,720
Come on, An Yang.

448
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,680
Come on.

449
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,440
Come on.

450
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,520
Come on.

451
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,280
Mr. Pan, we're done.

452
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,120
Have a rest.

453
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,760
I'll put it down.

454
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,000
I haven't finished yet.

455
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,240
I always thought

456
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,680
my life was almost perfect.

457
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,560
Since I was a kid,

458
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,080
I grew up with a golden spoon.

459
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,160
I was good at writing.

460
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,120
Then I got into Hong Kong University.

461
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,080
After I graduated from this course,

462
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,520
I went to Boston.

463
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,560
I studied finance

464
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,560
and master's degree

465
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,440
at Boston University.

466
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,160
My dad and my brother

467
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,040
were very poor since childhood.

468
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,080
They were very nice to me.

469
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,720
I was respected

470
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,920
at home

471
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,040
or at work

472
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,840
or anywhere else.

473
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,920
I was respected.

474
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:32,960
Right?

475
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,520
Yes.

476
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,640
Mr. Ding, are you

477
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,000
jealous of my background?

478
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,680
But I'm telling you,

479
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,000
I have

480
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,000
a big heart.

481
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,880
I can understand that.

482
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,400
Really?

483
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,520
In my memory,

484
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,280
my dad

485
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,440
is not only

486
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,960
a successful entrepreneur,

487
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,040
but also

488
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,640
a big philanthropist.

489
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,200
He was always willing

490
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,440
to donate money, do charity,

491
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,160
build schools and hospitals.

492
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,520
But in fact,

493
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,400
he and my brother

494
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,960
have another side.

495
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,120
That's their true face.

496
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,960
They are them.

497
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,960
You are you.

498
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,280
You're still very righteous

499
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,240
in my heart.

500
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,400
Is it useful?

501
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,080
Is it useful?

502
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,360
I was born in a family like this.

503
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,240
I can't change the reality.

504
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,280
Do you understand?

505
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,080
Mr. Ding, how about you teach me?

506
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,960
What should I do?

507
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,120
Look.

508
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,680
You have no choice.

509
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,080
The last cup.

510
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,920
After drinking,

511
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
I'll let you go home to sleep.

512
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,320
I think

513
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,880
Mr. Pan,

514
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,840
I'm here to see Wang Chen.

515
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,080
Sit down.

516
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,760
Sit down.

517
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,640
Sit down.

518
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,480
Wang Chen just finished his medical training.

519
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,440
He's asleep.

520
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,120
It's okay.

521
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,520
I can come to see him next time.

522
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,560
How are you?

523
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,720
Are you okay?

524
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,200
I'm fine.

525
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,240
Actually, after we got married,

526
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,000
we haven't been together for so long.

527
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,480
I'm sorry.

528
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,440
I'm sorry.

529
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,320
I'm sorry.

530
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,320
I'm sorry.

531
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,360
Right around here.

532
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,400
And Wang Chen

533
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,240
got▼

534
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,760
beesworn.

535
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,480
You know,

536
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,240
I forgot to tell you

537
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,600
something important.

538
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,440
What is it?

539
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,880
Da Yan Jiaoopedic Consortium's

540
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,920
archaeological work

541
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,160
has basically been done.

542
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,200
The executive team

543
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,640
has finally found the ship.

544
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,160
The mediated dental issues

545
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,960
were all taken away

546
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,360
and displays disappeared.

547
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,920
It's such a pity.

548
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,280
The police told the police

549
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,760
that they value this matter highly.

550
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,280
Didn't you send a photo

551
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,600
from Luo Man?

552
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,160
Yes.

553
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,760
This photo has been identified

554
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,720
by the face recognition technology.

555
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,760
This person is called Wei Lian.

556
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,320
He is the leader of the

557
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,840
criminal organization

558
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,520
that has been investigating

559
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,880
the theft of cultural relics and the fire of the group.

560
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,400
The police has already

561
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,280
confirmed that the Changzhou Group

562
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,160
is suspected of stealing

563
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
the cultural relics of the sea.

564
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,360
That's great.

565
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,480
Tang Xin.

566
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,400
Many of these

567
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,520
are your work.

568
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,000
You have been making efforts

569
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
and persisting.

570
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,040
You have made some money.

571
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,960
Where have you been?

572
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,960
Why are you here so late?

573
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,840
I met Mr. Bai Zi Jian in the hospital.

574
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,120
He told me about

575
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,160
the investigation of Luo Man.

576
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,360
What's the progress

577
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,160
of the police on this case?

578
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,800
Come out to meet me this weekend.

579
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,640
I have an idea for the topic.

580
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,560
I want to do a

581
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,760
program to promote and protect

582
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,000
the cultural relics of the sea.

583
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,120
This is a big topic.

584
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,040
We can do it together.

585
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,320
We can make a series.

586
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,280
From the Silk Road on the Sea

587
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,520
to the origin of the dust

588
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,720
and the illegal people

589
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,760
to steal the dust

590
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,080
and cause damage to the country.

591
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,120
Your idea is good.

592
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,080
But

593
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,520
we don't have

594
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,560
this kind of talent.

595
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,040
Why don't you talk to me?

596
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,520
Did you say you were angry with me last time?

597
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,720
No such words.

598
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,280
The things about the completed Ku pour

599
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,680
has beendroput early in the morning.

600
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
We just do

601
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,120
general advertising

602
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,360
and knowledge coverage.

603
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,240
No one else does that.

604
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,600
I want to ask Mr. Bai

605
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,680
to run a conference with us

606
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,160
to מהboard the idea.

607
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,840
That's good for me.

608
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,760
OK, I'll lead you to get ready.

609
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,320
Go.

610
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,520
Bye.

611
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,960
Don't GreatIN in sooner.

612
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Today's the weekend.

613
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,840
I like to rest.

614
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,400
Mr. Tang called me

615
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,480
for dinner tonight.

616
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,400
Want me to pick you up?

617
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,800
No.

618
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,080
Thank you, auntie.

619
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,500
Wu Si.

620
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,720
You've been back for a long time.

621
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,920
So we could go home

622
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,600
What?

623
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,040
No, Mr. Lao.

624
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,360
I called Tang Xin several times before.

625
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,400
She was busy.

626
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,600
Yes.

627
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,120
Tang Xin is busy.

628
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,720
She's busy during the day.

629
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,520
She has no time at night.

630
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,160
Our Xin Xin

631
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,280
is capable now.

632
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,400
She has done shows abroad.

633
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,480
When will it be broadcast?

634
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,960
Where can I see it?

635
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,600
What's wrong?

636
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,480
You didn't say a word last night.

637
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,160
Did you

638
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,840
have a fight with me?

639
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,000
No.

640
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,520
Maybe I'm too busy and a little tired.

641
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,040
No, I'm a little tired.

642
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,560
You're tired?

643
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,520
Eat more.

644
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,360
Mr. Lu.

645
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,320
Aunt.

646
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,640
Here's a fruit.

647
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:54,880
Yes.

648
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,480
It's my treat.

649
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,800
Time its clouds and waves.

650
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,560
Jinxing

651
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:05,900
has been

652
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,000
mischievous

653
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,040
since young.

654
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,160
She used to be

655
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,760
so strict with him,

656
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,520
but

657
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,320
it's a female this time.

658
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,160
Look,

659
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,980
I believe Mo afar

660
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,600
willぁ

661
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,600
give it a try.

662
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,440
Right.

663
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,160
Miss Zhou.

664
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,600
Miss Zhou.

665
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,360
It's time.

666
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,440
Time to go give a beat.

667
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,480
You and your mom

668
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,680
are late for games every night.

669
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,240
We are going to fall back.

670
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,000
Let's go.

671
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,880
Take a seat.

672
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,360
Let's go.

673
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,000
Come.

674
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,320
I hope you can just let me know the reason.

675
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,640
Then, do what you should.

676
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,480
Hurry up.

677
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,300
Mr. Qian is leaving.

678
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,100
This actor is popular.

679
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,300
Is there no reason for him to leave?

680
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,240
Can I ask you something?

681
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,300
What did you say to my dad before?

682
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,780
I said nothing before.

683
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,140
That's what my dad asked.

684
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,920
Jin.

685
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,220
But as a student,

686
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,040
sometimes it'll leave you hanging.

687
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,320
velocity of Leng Wu away from the university

688
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,480
and confident with his future.

689
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,580
I always thought

690
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,660
that Tang Yizhe sausage the gold prepare for battle.

691
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,980
He with a high quality temperament,

692
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,880
but the temperament

693
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,240
is rather different,

694
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,280
just like that he can only hear the good words

695
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,100
that cannot be heard

696
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,140
in reverse voice.

697
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,920
I was wrong all the time, Tang Tianzhe.

698
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,920
I'll

699
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,120
talk to you in another way in the future.

700
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,880
No need.

701
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,160
I can't see it.

702
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,280
Get up.

703
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
Let me get it for you.

704
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,560
No need. I can do it myself.

705
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,200
I'm sorry.

706
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,640
I brought you some information.

707
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,480
Thank you so much.

708
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,360
Actually, I'm embarrassed.

709
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,520
Sister Wangcheng is still in the hospital.

710
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,480
I have to take care of her.

711
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,280
I brought you here.

712
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:42,960
Actually, I can't help you

713
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,000
there.

714
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,120
OK. I won't be polite to you.

715
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,360
Let's go to the meeting room.

716
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,000
OK.

717
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,560
I'll listen to you when I get here.

718
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,160
OK.

719
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,240
During the time of the Song Dynasty,

720
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
the指南针

721
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,200
was used in the sea technology.

722
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,680
So China's remote-sail ability

723
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,880
was greatly improved.

724
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,200
The Song Dynasty

725
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,800
also values business very much

726
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,480
and encourages sea trade.

727
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,840
So the whole field of sea trade

728
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,240
has expanded to Asia, Africa, Europe and other continents.

729
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,680
No wonder.

730
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,560
The sea of China and the foreign seas

731
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,280
all have Chinese ancient traditions.

732
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,280
That's right.

733
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,720
In fact, the Silk Road on the Sea

734
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,040
has another name.

735
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,560
In 1913,

736
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,800
the Eastern scholars of France,

737
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,160
Sartre, he proposed

738
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,000
the road of spices on the sea

739
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,560
and the road of ceramic on the sea.

740
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,000
According to the theory of the road of ceramic on the sea,

741
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,560
the ceramic of Chinese exports

742
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,040
is very important.

743
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,640
Yes.

744
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,720
The ceramic is different from other products.

745
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,200
It is very resistant to corrosion.

746
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,400
So it can be preserved

747
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,680
under the sea.

748
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,680
Over the years,

749
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,840
the value of Chinese ancient ceramic

750
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,760
is getting higher and higher

751
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,360
in the auction market.

752
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,160
So many cultural relics

753
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,160
and illegal individuals

754
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,840
have started to

755
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,160
sell the cultural relics.

756
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,600
Of course,

757
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,760
there are many gold and jewelry

758
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,640
on the ship.

759
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,040
The value is also very significant.

760
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,680
How is Yang Yang?

761
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,920
He is almost recovered.

762
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,760
But he still has some anxiety.

763
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
This needs to be checked.

764
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,360
Not your fault.

765
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,320
But you are a man.

766
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,720
You have to take responsibility.

767
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,920
Take good care of Yang Yang.

768
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,320
If you need anything, just tell me.

769
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,240
I need it now.

770
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,680
Help me to add a form.

771
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,080
How do you feel today?

772
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,040
The doctor said

773
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,520
that he has entered the recovery training.

774
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,000
The recovery effect is also good.

775
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,920
Not enough.

776
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,920
It's still far from enough.

777
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,320
It's not up to you to decide whether it's enough or not.

778
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,880
It's up to the doctor.

779
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,880
I told you last time.

780
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,240
Soldiers must obey orders.

781
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,200
The patient must obey the doctor.

782
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,880
Do you understand?

783
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,000
Yes.

784
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,040
Do something big.

785
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,160
Yes.

786
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,640
That's right.

787
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,520
You are the one who is responsible for the injury.

788
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,200
But all the wounds of Guangrong

789
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:08,920
are healed quickly.

790
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,080
I tell you,

791
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,760
now the men are just a bunch of

792
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,200
lazy people.

793
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,280
You can't be wrong.

794
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,640
Listen to the doctor.

795
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,440
I'll wait for you to go back to the competition next year.

796
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,920
I promise to complete the task.

797
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,720
OK.

798
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,720
Just lie down and rest.

799
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,360
I'm relieved to see you.

800
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,400
By the way, Xiao Bai.

801
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,680
If he doesn't obey your orders,

802
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,680
you tell me immediately.

803
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,400
I'll see if he will obey the commander's orders.

804
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:32,840
OK.

805
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,560
That's great.

806
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,640
I'm leaving.

807
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,240
Thank you.

808
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,120
OK. Thank you, commander.

809
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,800
Thank you.

810
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,480
I'll see you off.

811
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,200
No need to see me off.

812
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,760
I see.

813
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,560
The commander has to treat you.

814
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,760
Isn't it the same as what I said?

815
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,880
Why don't you listen to me?

816
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,280
And salute.

817
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,960
Why didn't you salute me?

818
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,080
I'm sorry.

819
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,880
I'm sorry.

820
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,680
I'm sorry.

821
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,480
I'm sorry.

822
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,360
I'm sorry.

823
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,240
I'm sorry.

824
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,240
I'm sorry.

825
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,160
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

877
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

901
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,060
τα

902
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,300
styles

903
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:30,760
just

904
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,100
h

905
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:39,680
She

906
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,720
Share

907
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:51,920
We

908
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,160
how am I creepy?

909
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,280
Captain.

910
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,120
You know

911
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,880
I was in Pakistan

912
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,800
when Xiao Ying and I walked together?

913
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,480
On Ji Regular,

914
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,600
I called Yang.

915
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
I had to make sure they had a good meal.

916
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,960
I even specially called

917
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,960
and told Baobao

918
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,960
not to bully Mom.

919
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,960
I told Mom to eat well.

920
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,960
But my voice was very loud at that time.

921
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,960
Baobao

922
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,960
heard my first and last words.

923
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,960
I was very worried.

924
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,960
It was all about my poor parents.

925
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,960
You said I was the worst dad in the world.

926
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,960
In fact, raising a child is not wrong.

927
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,960
It's me who was wrong.

928
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
You take good care of them.

929
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,960
You two just started.

930
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,960
It's still a long way to go.

931
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,960
It will be fine.

932
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,960
It will be a good life.

to handle

991

ask for your company

Thank you for being behind me

995
