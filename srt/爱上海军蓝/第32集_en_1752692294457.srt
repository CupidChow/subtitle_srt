The Long Ballad

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,600
I'll go out and get some fresh air.

4
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,400
No, no, no.

5
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,680
This...

6
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,400
Dad.

7
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,240
Get some fresh air,焦东哥 If I get anyAnnndf

8
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,360
Wu Si.

9
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,240
Yes?

10
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,360
You should know

11
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,760
that Tang Xin's dad and me

12
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,640
love you a lot.

13
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,920
His dad loves you

14
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,600
because you are a good kid.

15
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,960
And we're both

16
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,760
your boys' orientation.

17
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
I'm not.

18
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,880
I like you.

19
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,880
Of course, it's because my daughter likes you.

20
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,680
I like you.

21
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,600
Aunt.

22
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,000
I know.

23
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,800
I understand.

24
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,080
We only have one daughter.

25
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,960
We handed her to you.

26
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,880
I hope you can promise me

27
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,720
that you won't let our Xin Xin

28
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,600
be successes.

29
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,720
After we turn close,

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,520
you shall let the world know

31
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,320
that we won't!]

32
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:21,700
You may ask

33
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,720
when he gotaves.

34
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,720
He'er!

35
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
How did you think of making a hot air balloon?

36
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,720
A romantic student can't go to the hot air balloon.

37
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,720
Beautiful Wenzhou, you can still have a look.

38
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
I have to take a good look at Wenzhou.

39
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,720
I've been a soldier for so many years, but I haven't seen her properly.

40
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,720
Dad, dad, what are you doing?

41
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Your eyes are a display.

42
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Didn't you see what I was doing?

43
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
Enough, enough, enough.

44
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Look at you, you're so energetic.

45
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
Let's go, I'm here to pick you up.

46
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
Go back.

47
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Dad, dad, dad, dad.

48
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,720
Dad, dad, dad, dad.

49
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Dad, dad, dad, dad.

50
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Dad, dad, dad, dad.

51
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Go back.

52
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
That's enough.

53
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,720
She's jumping, her rhythm is messed up.

54
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Director Lao,

55
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
I'm home.

56
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
I know I was wrong.

57
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,720
I promise I won't do it again.

58
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Go home.

59
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Take your things.

60
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
Sit.

61
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
You look like that.

62
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Let me, let me.

63
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Don't add it to her face.

64
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Yes, yes, yes.

65
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Let me have a bite.

66
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
Dad, look, you can't add it.

67
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
Dad, dad, dad.

68
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Dad, dad, dad.

69
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Let all coincidences become a wish

70
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Let all the previous ones become the same

71
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Open the bright future of years

72
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Let the courage to break free

73
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Let my heart be your cover

74
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Thank you for being by my side

75
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,720
The wine, the blood and the darkness

76
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,720
The bigger the world, the more lonely it is

77
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Only standing by your side

78
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,720
The more I'm with you, the more I feel warm

79
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
You came to see me off?

80
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
I'm a little dizzy.

81
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
This is a small eye.

82
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
It doesn't match your current vision.

83
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
Your vision will gradually decrease.

84
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
The bigger the eyes, the more suitable.

85
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
Very thoughtful.

86
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Thank you.

87
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
I'm sorry.

88
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
I'm sorry.

90
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
I'm sorry.

92
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Here you are.

93
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
It's nothing.

94
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
It's painkillers.

95
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
Your eyes may be more painful.

96
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Save some food.

97
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
I'm old.

98
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
Don't worry.

99
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Maybe we won't see each other again.

100
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,720
I wish you a happy new year in advance.

101
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Happy new marriage.

102
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
Happy holiday.

103
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
What holiday?

104
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Which holiday?

105
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
I hope you are happy even if it's not a holiday.

106
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
Happy holiday.

107
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Wait a minute.

108
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
When did you get hurt?

109
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Boss, the wound is a bit bad.

110
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Really?

111
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
That's not bad.

112
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
No matter what the content is, the assessment is the assessment.

113
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Safety first, you know?

114
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Training is temporary.

115
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,720
Your body is eternal.

116
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Keep up with the trend.

117
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Come on.

118
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
Not hurry.

119
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,120
Me too.

120
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,240
There are still more names.

121
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,120
I wonder how many numbers

122
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,880
are there.

123
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,080
I'll ask someone to pass it back now.

124
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,280
According to the data tried by factory organizers,

125
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,640
I've found the Empyreanany,

126
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,780
and gathered them.

127
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,400
Have they come up with any proposals?

128
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,360
Do we need to go there at this time?

129
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,800
I shall take a lead.

130
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,360
Stopbian,

131
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,520
Take the girl first.

132
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,280
That man,

133
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
seemed to carry a heavy heavyavamine backyard.

134
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,840
I've promoted to Wojna,

135
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,680
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,120
I don't need to announce the result.

137
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,160
Cui Liwa escaped.

138
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,080
He took the equipment and shot himself.

139
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,120
He got full marks.

140
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,800
I hope all of you remember his face.

141
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,760
He's Ynan Wang.

142
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,880
Because of him, all of you got zero marks.

143
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,880
Report!

144
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,160
Report!

145
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,280
Report! We're going up now.

146
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,880
Yes.

147
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,920
Yes.

148
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,400
Hello.

149
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,960
Boss, I want to report to you.

150
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,160
The first batch of cultural relics we got

151
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,360
has been sent to the island.

152
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,080
How many?

153
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
About 100.

154
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,760
Are the others normal?

155
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,760
Everything is normal.

156
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,440
Okay, I got it.

157
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,840
Thank you.

158
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,400
Dad, it's time to eat.

159
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,840
Okay.

160
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,520
The ship has been shipped.

161
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,800
Shipped?

162
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,360
It's all shipped to the base.

163
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
Let's go and check it out.

164
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,320
Get ready.

165
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
We'll be there in a few days.

166
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,160
Okay.

167
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,800
Wang,

168
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,560
I'm sorry.

169
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,280
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,760
Wang Chen's order.

171
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,800
Take a look.

172
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,520
I talked to Wang Chen.

173
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,520
I decided to transfer him to the base

174
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,920
as a coach.

175
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,080
He didn't want you to know.

176
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,480
He thought he was a deserter.

177
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,880
But

178
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,200
you know his injuries.

179
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,000
Even though he made such a great effort

180
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,560
to recover like this,

181
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,240
it's hard for him to adapt to

182
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,800
the high-level training of the man.

183
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,640
From the perspective of caring for his comrades,

184
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,360
I prefer to transfer him

185
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,760
to a better position.

186
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,160
Wang Chen's decision

187
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,600
is made.

188
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,200
I'll leave you alone.

189
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
Let's talk about you.

190
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,960
The organization

191
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,840
has considered carefully

192
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,400
and hopes that you can take on more responsibilities.

193
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,800
Brigadier,

194
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,040
I don't think I can take the position.

195
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,520
Don't say anything to Tianqi today.

196
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,040
You can take the position now.

197
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,120
You have to take the position

198
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,240
after the committee discusses it.

199
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,600
I'll treat Wang Chen to hot pot tonight.

200
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,640
You come too.

201
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,400
Say goodbye warmly.

202
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,600
Yes.

203
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,120
The enemy's formation is getting bigger.

204
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,720
The enemy's formation is getting smaller.

205
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,320
The enemy's formation is getting bigger.

206
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,000
The enemy's formation is getting smaller.

207
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,400
The situation is safe.

208
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,040
Pass quickly.

209
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,840
This soldier,

210
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,120
take the horse and go ahead.

211
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,680
Pay attention to the flow of the flow.

212
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,400
Yes.

213
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,040
You say,

214
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,760
be careful on your셔 시 and legs.

215
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,600
Report!

216
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,720
The shallow Gang building training is over.

217
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,400
Back to peonies!

218
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,200
Sha Xi.

219
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,600
Yes.

220
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,520
I've seen it.

221
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,720
Does it hurt?

222
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,360
Yes.

223
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,920
No.

224
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,800
Does it hurt?

225
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,960
No, sir.

226
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,360
It's not the time for you to

227
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,720
be so fast in the underwater training.

228
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,400
I'll repeat it again.

229
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,800
If you're too fast,

230
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,480
you may get a light sin

231
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,840
and a diving sickness.

232
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,160
It may not only

233
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,240
harm your health,

234
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,480
but also

235
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,240
put your life in danger.

236
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,760
What's wrong?

237
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,760
Do you want to be

238
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,120
the diving soldiers?

239
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,400
No.

240
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,840
Zhao Hang.

241
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,520
Yes.

242
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,240
After the medical room,

243
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,200
go back and train Qiao Li 100 times.

244
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,000
Yes.

245
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,200
Are you hungry?

246
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,280
Yes.

247
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,240
Let's eat.

248
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,200
Yes.

249
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,960
Wait.

250
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,760
Next step.

251
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Right turn.

252
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,480
Right turn.

253
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Right turn.

254
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,720
Back leg.

255
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,680
You've already ordered it.

256
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,040
Sorry, captain.

257
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,360
I didn't discuss it with you.

258
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,320
I wanted to

259
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,280
leave while I was

260
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,560
training in the underwater training.

261
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,480
He just sent his members away.

262
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,840
He sent me back.

263
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,120
I was afraid he would be upset.

264
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,680
So you hid it from me

265
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,120
because you were afraid I would be upset.

266
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,200
You wanted to leave

267
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,080
before I returned, right?

268
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,440
I didn't hide it from you.

269
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,200
I just wanted to

270
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,640
bring more new soldiers

271
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,560
and keep

272
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,000
what I have.

273
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,360
Why did you leave?

274
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,960
Because of your family

275
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,800
or

276
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,400
your members?

277
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,200
Both.

278
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,160
Actually, during my recovery,

279
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,160
I told myself

280
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,000
that no matter how difficult it was,

281
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,280
as long as I could stay in the team,

282
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,880
I could overcome it.

283
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,760
I always felt

284
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,880
that I was brave.

285
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,680
Until the day I sent the members away,

286
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,400
I realized

287
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,680
what was really brave.

288
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:40,960
However,

289
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,040
I just couldn't

290
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,040
miss the remote areas.

291
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,760
So,

292
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,520
I almost included

293
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,600
his teamقد publicly at work instead of

294
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,280
making an expectation of the team.

295
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,280
Really?

296
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,200
What are you going to do now?

297
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,960
Maybe,

298
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,360
let everyone

299
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,280
get in the way

300
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,880
and ask everyone their comes on the ship.

301
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,280
But you won't get away

302
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,480
after فيhere.

303
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,200
Beyond that,

304
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,520
no keeping the team

305
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,400
is important.

306
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,720
We won't waste time

307
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,580
in continuing this LIU team

308
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,940
and Yi Nan Wang.

309
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,740
After I leave,

310
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,180
more new blood will come in.

311
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,860
No soldier

312
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,740
wants to be a weakling of his comrades.

313
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,300
To advance to the front line

314
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,540
is the last thing

315
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,540
I can do for the Blue Team.

316
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,540
You are always a part of the Blue Team.

317
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,460
You have worked hard these years.

318
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,660
You are still not finished.

319
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,420
You can always wait for the Blue Team.

320
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,620
I respect your choice.

321
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,780
Cheng Yuan, I'm home.

322
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,020
I didn't tell you on purpose.

323
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,660
Because I can't bear to leave

324
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,260
when I see you.

325
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,900
To be honest,

326
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,260
I really didn't understand

327
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,460
why you didn't want to leave the army.

328
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,460
I just thought

329
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,340
since you can't come back,

330
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,900
I'll go to you.

331
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,140
I was on the phone during the new soldiers' period.

332
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,780
You called me but I couldn't get through.

333
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,420
I answered the monitor's call and called him.

334
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,660
You were busy again.

335
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,580
That was the most tiring,

336
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,460
the most bitter,

337
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,180
and the most confused stage of my life.

338
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,060
But you were never by my side.

339
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,420
We were like a love

340
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,260
that was empty and empty.

341
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,660
On the same land,

342
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,460
we were safe and sound.

343
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,620
I didn't understand you before.

344
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,220
I didn't understand the power of the army.

345
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,980
Until I took off my uniform,

346
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,740
I finally understood the meaning of soldiers.

347
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,060
I understood who was behind the good times

348
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,100
and who was supporting this peace.

349
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,860
I joined the army for you.

350
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,580
Now I'm leaving for myself.

351
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,500
I hope we can be safe.

352
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,980
I also hope your life

353
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,340
will always be bright and bright.

354
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,700
Always move forward.

355
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,540
Today's meal

356
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,260
is to celebrate

357
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,860
Wang Chen's return from the business.

358
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,140
It's also to send him away.

359
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,940
You're a good cook, you know?

360
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,020
Wang Chen.

361
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,540
Captain Chen,

362
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,860
celebrate.

363
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,860
It's time to start a new life.

364
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,420
There are so many soldiers in the south.

365
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,500
You two are the first batch I brought in.

366
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,460
From Wu Si to Yi Nan Wang,

367
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,140
it's been ten years, right?

368
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,700
Ten years.

369
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,020
In these ten years,

370
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,300
you've always been my backbone.

371
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,180
I've given you all the hardest and most difficult tasks.

372
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,180
I didn't praise you much before.

373
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,300
I'll make it up today.

374
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,580
Every task

375
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,380
you've done is very good.

376
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,780
Everyone

377
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,300
is a very good Chinese navy.

378
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,260
Wang Chen didn't leave easily today.

379
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,780
He should leave.

380
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,860
As a family,

381
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,740
you have more than one responsibility.

382
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,940
I've been a soldier for so many years.

383
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,460
Your sister-in-law helped me to support the family.

384
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,300
So,

385
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,020
it's even harder to be a soldier.

386
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,260
After you leave,

387
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,740
don't quarrel with Xiao Bai.

388
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,940
Don't be angry with him.

389
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,100
You two live your own lives.

390
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,700
It's also a contribution to the country.

391
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,540
Are you going to leave soon?

392
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,580
Don't you want to say something to us?

393
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,940
I have many feelings for you.

394
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,900
Yuzheng.

395
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,100
Please don't.

396
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,980
Fine.

397
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,620
I'll not say it if you don't want me to.

398
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,820
I understand you.

399
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,700
Do keep this in mind.

400
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,580
ίο come back often to visit us.

401
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,100
That's right.

402
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,740
Hurry up.

403
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,700
Let's eat.

404
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:31,940
Let's have some food.

405
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,100
If it's not so,

406
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,420
you shouldn't be here.

407
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,320
This is cause for havoc.

408
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,360
Actually, at first,

409
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,620
I know you guys

410
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,660
would leave the company as slaves.

411
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,260
This fellow,

412
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,180
graduated military university and joined the company.

413
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,620
He has already got a poor reputation.

414
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,680
But, he really has got what it takes.

415
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,200
When I talked to their company,

416
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,180
they always told me,

417
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,820
How did you get the bell?

418
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,420
I didn't even call for a gun

419
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,780
I won in one match

420
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,860
Cheng Yuan

421
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,780
Keep the bell

422
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,020
I can't keep Cheng Yuan

423
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,420
Such an excellent sniper

424
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,220
I only have one

425
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,700
No more

426
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,100
Report

427
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,740
Say

428
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,220
Can I

429
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,380
Could it be

430
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,740
All blacked out

431
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,380
Right- insulin

432
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,340
Look out

433
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,380
jacket

434
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:25,900
bury

435
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,460
rope training

436
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,020
Point

437
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,580
facilities are all centers

438
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,740
500 meters from the square.

439
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,620
One hour.

440
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,340
If you don't pass the test,

441
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,500
I'll find you.

442
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,780
Understand?

443
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,860
Yes.

444
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,420
Dismiss.

445
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,100
Well,

446
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,220
I'm not in a good mood.

447
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,620
I don't know if I can be the captain.

448
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,740
If I can't,

449
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,700
I'll continue to work in this position.

450
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,780
I'm not responsible for all the soldiers.

451
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,340
So,

452
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,060
there will be a group of people who are more suitable for me

453
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,260
to be in this position.

454
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,300
You've been holding back for a long time, right?

455
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,260
Since I talked to you as a psychological counselor,

456
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,340
I know you have something to say.

457
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,980
I called you here today

458
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,500
to let you say something.

459
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,900
Have you made up your mind?

460
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:42,900
Where to go?

461
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,340
The machine gun? The back of the gun?

462
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,380
Or

463
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,740
go to the big team like Wang Chen?

464
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:52,980
If you've made up your mind,

465
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,100
remember to report it.

466
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,420
I'll hand it over to you personally.

467
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,660
The captain must have been impulsive

468
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,940
to make up his mind.

469
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,260
You won't report it,

470
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,660
right?

471
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,900
I thought...

472
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,820
I thought

473
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,500
I could...

474
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,260
I could take them out

475
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,500
and bring them back safely.

476
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,700
They're safe.

477
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,260
But now I even...

478
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,100
Wu Si.

479
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,900
You know

480
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,860
why I tried so hard to come back.

481
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,700
It's because

482
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,580
one day I can come back to our team.

483
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,700
I'm back now.

484
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,460
But my health condition

485
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,820
doesn't allow me to come back to my position.

486
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,260
I'm like Cheng Yuan.

487
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,820
We quit not because we want to leave.

488
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,820
As long as there's a choice,

489
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,100
we won't leave.

490
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,580
Don't you know how much I envy you

491
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,660
for fighting on the front line?

492
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,100
Cheng Yuan and I are in a mutual relationship.

493
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,140
You're different.

494
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,620
The captain acknowledged your reason,

495
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,820
but I didn't.

496
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,180
Leave now.

497
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,460
Does Cheng Yuan know?

498
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,460
What will he think if he knows?

499
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,220
We're allergic to each other.

500
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,260
We're not.

501
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,100
We're teammates.

502
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,940
We're on the battlefield.

503
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,900
We face the enemy

504
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,620
and we're our teammates.

505
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,060
It's what we should do.

506
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,620
It's not your fault that we're injured.

507
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,060
And it's not your excuse to escape.

508
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,820
Alright.

509
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,900
Stop persuading me.

510
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,300
Stick the ice on the plate.

511
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,180
I'm telling you,

512
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,260
we're in a mutual relationship.

513
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,980
It's just a memory.

514
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,100
Remember one thing.

515
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,820
No matter what choice you make,

516
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,140
no matter where you go,

517
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,100
no matter how far you go,

518
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,660
there will always be the same flag

519
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,540
in your hands.

520
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,500
I like you.

521
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,300
Director, what are you doing?

522
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,100
Stop the wind!

523
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,260
Come out

524
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,260

525
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,260
Report, the road is closed

526
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,260
Report your name

527
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,260

Go ahead

537
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,560
Do not come

538
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:36,980
No

539
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:37,800

540
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,160
Three

541
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:38,640
Five

542
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,060
Two

00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:39,880

Come out

548
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,140
Are you in your room?

549
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,740
Sir.

550
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,180
today I accept you to work hard.

551
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,580
Con Ary training.

552
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,380
There is no SH ER.

553
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,540
Are you in your class?

554
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,900
Member.

555
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,700
When did you come back?

556
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:42,860
It is not the first time

557
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,140
You asked us for a blood test.

558
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,060
How to be present

559
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,420
it is good

560
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,300
What's wrong

561
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,300
Too difficult

562
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,780
Too difficult

563
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,900
They are all

564
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,580
I've done the best I could.

565
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,500
I can't bear to let them go.

566
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,020
But I can't keep you.

567
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,820
Madam.

568
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,140
Madam.

569
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:31,940
I should check if you can cover the

570
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:31,980
😁

571
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,220
Baby.

572
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,500
Are you working overtime at the hospital?

573
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,380
Yes.

574
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,940
I'm a pillar of the Allah of Science department now.

575
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,180
You did this to her last night

576
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,500
and make a move.

577
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,860
But don't make a move now.

578
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,140
Don'tkeeping up a soon anymore.

579
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,620
You have to stop pestering them.

580
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,940
that sounds like church.

581
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,720
Are you mad at them?

582
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,740
I'm telling you,

583
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,060
I'm mad at you.

584
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,540
I've been Gosh speeded along by such a noise.

585
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,340
No one cares about me.

586
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:03,880
that's it.

587
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,820
Come see the moon in the sky,

588
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,560
Yuan.

589
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,660
and your handsome husband.

590
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,340
I miss you so much.

591
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,100
I miss you too, honey.

592
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,100
Can you keep up with me?

593
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,980
Okay.

594
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,220
Dad, mom, you're back.

595
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,380
Mr. Jin.

596
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,380
Mr. Jin.

597
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,780
You're back.

598
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,540
You're here to eat again?

599
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,380
You think I'm your family?

600
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,500
What are you talking about?

601
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,540
We're in the middle of the street.

602
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,780
Come to our house for dinner.

603
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,300
Hurry up.

604
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,420
I'll cook something for you.

605
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,980
Wait.

606
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,740
What's this?

607
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,780
Let's play together.

608
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:57,980
Look.

609
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,180
Look.

610
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,260
No.

611
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,980
Guys.

612
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,180
What day is it today, guys?

613
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,340
Today is the New Year's Day.

614
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,180
Yes, New Year's Day.

615
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:09,940
New Year's Day?

616
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,620
You...

617
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,620
Wang Leng's daughter is a million times better than you.

618
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,820
Right.

619
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,660
How can I forget about her?

620
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,740
You...

621
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,260
No one bags bombs inside.

622
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,060
Right?

623
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,260
I made them for you too.

624
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,780
Can I have a look?

625
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,220
No, thank you.

626
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,700
Please have a look.

627
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,820
No.

628
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,660
Are you kidding?

629
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,580
and follow there.

630
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,140
Dad.

631
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,140
Dad.

632
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:15,940
Hello.

633
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:16,860
Hello.

634
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,500
Is Lan Yang'er in the surgery room now?

635
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,740
No, she is away.

636
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,500
Thanks.

637
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,260
Not at all.

638
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,060
Please call the anesthetist

639
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,660
for operation no.309.

640
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,860
What're you doing here?

641
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,420
shouldn't be so serious.

642
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,180
Is there another case?

643
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,300
Babie.

644
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,700
Do you know

645
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,020
that Express quality in your life

646
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,580
is almost plummeting?

647
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,860
It should be a guessing game.

648
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,180
No, it's…

649
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,140
I think it's okay.

650
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:51,780
Babie.

651
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,580
Babie.

652
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,900
May you rest,

653
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,900
It's so beautiful

654
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,980
This little girl looks like Lin Lan

655
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,740
Is it not like her

656
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,020
So beautiful

657
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,900
The eyelashes are so long, so beautiful

658
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,140
No, it should be like me

659
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,380
The girl is like my father

660
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,500
Like you two

661
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,540
So beautiful

662
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,540
What did he do with this dance?

663
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,700
Why isn't he coming

664
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,340
Don't mention it

665
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,820
I just called him and didn't answer

666
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,060
Secretly

667
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,820
He must have something important

668
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,740
Do you have to pick something important?

669
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,420
Yes, you should pick it well

670
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,460
Don't rush

671
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,580
Why don't you dance

672
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,140
Sir, choose a ring

673
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,220
Yes, proposal ring

674
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,140
it is good

675
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,540
Wait a minute

676
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,200
theité

677
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:25,120
We are also

678
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,460
I'm not a good guy

679
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:28,940
Sister-in-law

680
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,820
I have the best disease

681
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,420
I gave you my best disease

682
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,580
From today on

683
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,580
Be ready to beat

684
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,940
But please take care of her

685
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,460
You rest assured

686
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,460
Come, thank you, you are good

687
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,260
Come come come

688
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,780
Thank you, thank you

689
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,500
Thank you

690
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:48,820
it is good

691
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,260
Uncle Wang, but I want to say something

692
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,860
What you just said

693
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,060
It seems that the five-four is like a drunk

694
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,700
How are we married

695
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,620
You don't care about him

696
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,300
I want to care about him in the future

697
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,420
Can't control

698
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,900
Although all in a group

699
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,060
Less chance to meet

700
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,260
What do you mean

701
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,300
The five-four told me that he was going to fall off the line

702
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,460
What is this

703
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,460
How come out

704
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,860
Where did you go

705
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,860
I'll go buy something

706
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,540
Propose ring

707
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,780
the change will be on the equator.

708
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,460
We have to go to the lion's den to play,

709
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,500
yes.

710
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,140
Afghan orientation.

711
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:06,820
What's that?

712
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,660
A special battle commander

713
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,980
will be deployed

714
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,180
on the front row

715
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,740
to make reinforcements at the associative base.

716
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,380
You shouldn't leave there

717
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,500
as there is no place

718
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,140
and no400 pad.

719
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,540
Is that so?

720
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,660
I'm willing to respect your choice.

721
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,380
But the premise is

722
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,340
that you really want

723
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,740
this choice.

724
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,420
It's not because the front line soldiers

725
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,820
are too busy and too dangerous

726
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,100
and can't take care of the family.

727
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,500
Or you doubt yourself.

728
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,340
You want me to be at ease.

729
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,140
I want to be responsible for you.

730
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,380
I'm also thinking about

731
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,540
the future of us.

732
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,300
Are you persuading me

733
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,900
or yourself?

734
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,220
I've made up my mind.

735
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,260
Actually, every time

736
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,980
you run away,

737
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,100
I have an answer in my heart.

738
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,700
Including this time.

739
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,540
So I'm sorry.

740
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,260
I can't accept your proposal now.

741
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,300
This is not the marriage I want.

742
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,180
We don't have to

743
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,100
have the same skin color.

744
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,740
Should I give them a little gift?

745
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,660
Leave me alone.

746
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,860
Let me have a look.

747
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,180
Leave you alone.

748
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,940
Leave no one alone.

749
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,420
To be honest,

750
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,540
after I graduated,

751
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,940
the way you helped me

752
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,020
in the brain masters.

753
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,500
You saved me.

754
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,400
For a person like you,

755
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,800
I'll be just a bad guys.

756
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,480
And playing by myself,

757
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,740
why do I need to believe

758
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,820
can make me more important and pounding.

759
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,340
For a person like you,

760
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,340
I'm sorry.

761
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,340
I'm sorry.

762
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,340
I'm sorry.

763
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,340
I'm sorry.

764
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,340
I'm sorry.

765
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,340
I'm sorry.

766
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,340
I'm sorry.

767
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,340
I'm sorry.

768
