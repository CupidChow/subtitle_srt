1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,660
My love has finally stopped.

2
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,520
It's you who no longer understands.

3
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,440
ps react

4
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,800
I called you

5
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,240
but Sorry

6
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,920
I've been Ooo for you

7
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,340
so annoying

8
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,840
years.

9
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,020
Ms. Qiu.

10
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,120
Miss Tang.

11
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,780
Miss Qiu.

12
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:22,760
Missどう YOU

13
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,180
You are not someone expect to be treated?

14
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,300
Totally dessert.

15
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,460
How's your rest?

16
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,420
Are you dizzy?

17
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,060
A little.

18
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,140
It's okay.

19
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,340
How's Wang Chen?

20
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,180
Captain Wang Chen has other doctors to take care of.

21
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,940
I'm your doctor now.

22
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,540
Lv Zhao has already

23
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,140
reported you and your family.

24
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,740
You're fine.

25
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,780
You'll recover in a while.

26
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,180
But Tang Ji,

27
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,140
I'm not a professional

28
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,260
psychological doctor.

29
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,340
You need to adjust

30
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,900
your mental problems.

31
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,260
I'm fine.

32
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,100
The first batch of staff,

33
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,060
breakfast is ready.

34
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,300
It's time for breakfast.

35
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,340
I'll take you to the restaurant.

36
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,020
Business is first.

37
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,940
The dishes here

38
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,220
are not for everyone.

39
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,140
Well,

40
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,860
how many people

41
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,460
are the special forces?

42
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,980
You're Captain Wu, right?

43
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,340
He's a special force

44
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,340
and a cadet.

45
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,060
He's not in charge of his restaurant.

46
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,900
I'll wait for him.

47
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,180
Let the soldiers eat first.

48
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,860
You don't have to wait for him.

49
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,540
Even on the street,

50
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,940
you rarely see him.

51
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,100
He's the busiest one among us.

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,420
Dr. Qiu,

53
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,500
when I was asleep,

54
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,900
he came to see me again.

55
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,420
Tang Ji,

56
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,500
this is the military base.

57
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,300
He's wearing military uniform.

58
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,060
He can't be with you all the time.

59
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,580
When he asks me to tell you

60
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,140
to eat and sleep well,

61
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,940
we'll be home soon.

62
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,060
Yang Yang,

63
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,780
you're sitting on the floor.

64
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,660
You'll catch a cold.

65
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,020
Look at my sister.

66
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,340
The bag is so pretty.

67
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,740
Yang Yang,

68
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,540
thank you for staying with my mom

69
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,860
and sister.

70
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,260
Sister is not a good doctor.

71
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,940
She didn't help us much this time.

72
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,340
But at least

73
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,300
she can stay with you.

74
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,540
Yang Yang,

75
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,300
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,940
Don't say sorry.

77
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,420
It's none of your business.

78
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,340
Zhou Ying,

79
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,860
this is a little secret between us.

80
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,180
Don't tell anyone else, okay?

81
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,540
If your parents ask,

82
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,260
just tell them

83
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,420
Yang Yang

84
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,420
took you back to get changed

85
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,980
and went back.

86
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,500
Nothing happened.

87
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,580
It's okay.

88
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,100
Why?

89
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,260
Because...

90
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,300
Because this is

91
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,980
Yang Yang's problem.

92
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,940
It's between Xixi and me.

93
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,060
Thank you, Mr. Han.

94
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,980
I'm okay.

95
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,140
I'm just a little dizzy.

96
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,460
What about you?

97
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,980
I'm not dizzy,

98
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,900
but I may not sleep well.

99
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,940
Maybe I'm a little scared.

100
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,100
I met Captain Wu a few days ago.

101
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,820
I told him about it.

102
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,460
Have you seen him?

103
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,540
When?

104
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,740
The day before yesterday.

105
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,460
He went to the job transfer on the deck.

106
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,820
You haven't seen Captain Wu yet?

107
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,140
I heard from Captain Wu

108
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,820
that he didn't know

109
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,100
you were going to Luoman.

110
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,300
Even if he knew,

111
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,340
he wouldn't have agreed to let you go to Luoman.

112
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,140
So,

113
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,940
I don't really want to know

114
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,820
why you went to Luoman.

115
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,300
I just want to know

116
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,980
why you went to Luoman.

117
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,260
Why didn't you tell him?

118
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,780
He went to the warehouse

119
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,420
when I was going there.

120
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,900
How could I tell him?

121
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,260
That's true.

122
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,780
All right.

123
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,020
Since you're dizzy,

124
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,420
take a rest.

125
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,780
Remember to eat on time.

126
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,740
If you need anything,

127
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,860
just tell me.

128
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,900
No.

129
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,340
You have to

130
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,540
tell Captain Wu.

131
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,740
You should remember us.

132
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,780
It's okay.

133
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,140
He was exactly the same.

134
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,780
I was wrong.

135
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,500
Xiaohui,

136
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,460
you have a private level.

137
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,580
If we still need to cut off those measurements,

138
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,060
we can see the results.

139
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,940
It's weird to see

140
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,620
the result like that.

141
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,620
Your father always misses you.

142
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,220
Come back soon.

143
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,020
Okay.

144
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,660
I'll make you something delicious.

145
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,100
Your father loved you so much.

146
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,020
You錘ed to me.

147
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,220
You know,

148
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,020
Iredit of my dad,

149
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,820
is she�� chasing medicine,

150
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,460
or kids'IRT,

151
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,660
the ones who have always challenged their passion.

152
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,460
Eat more.

153
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,540
It's the same taste

154
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,700
That can't be said

155
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,940
OK

156
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,300
In our family

157
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,140
Your dad is a chef

158
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,500
It's easy to cook

159
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,780
This one is cooked

160
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,380
Look, fragrant

161
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,180
Then I just dip it today

162
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,940
Dipped you and my grandson's light

163
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,220
I have this mouthful

164
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,540
delicious

165
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,460
That's right

166
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,180
Now I'm cooking for my daughter

167
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,300
In the future

168
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,300
Wait for my grandson

169
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,700
You can order

170
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,540
Order casually

171
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,820
I'm really eating

172
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,220
I'm thinking

173
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,540
My granddaughter in the future

174
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,820
It may also be a grandson

175
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,860
Must be like my daughter

176
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,140
Big eyes

177
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,660
High

178
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,500
Like Zongqing

179
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,380
It must be a grandson

180
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,500
This grandson must be like my daughter

181
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,420
It must be as cute as Yangyang

182
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,700
As smart as Zongqing

183
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,660
Personality and temperament

184
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,260
Should be with Zongqing

185
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,660
Don't be with our baby

186
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,220
How much

187
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,260
You should spoil it

188
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,220
My own daughter

189
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,340
Who do I spoil if I don't spoil

190
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,340
Really

191
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,700
Then you are not like you

192
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,700
What's wrong with me

193
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,860
I just said

194
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,100
I'm waiting to spoil my grandson

195
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,500
But I can't be spoiled

196
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,260
I have to cultivate him well

197
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,540
At that time

198
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,900
I guess I retired

199
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,620
I must cultivate him

200
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,700
Become a real man

201
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,580
Think about it

202
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,660
He must be absorbing

203
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,980
Absorb the advantages of his parents

204
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,420
Each head must have

205
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,860
We have to grow to one meter nine

206
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,500
Study well

207
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,660
Entrance to military school

208
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,100
Military school graduation

209
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,740
I let him be a navy

210
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,620
Think about it

211
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,340
A man-like big brother

212
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,660
Sturder than Zongqing

213
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,660
Put on our navy's military uniform

214
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,140
A battle on the ship

215
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,620
That's a man's flag

216
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,660
You can read it

217
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,100
Are you going to hang it

218
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,100
Is it clear

219
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,740
what happened

220
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,060
Yaoyao

221
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,700
what happened

222
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,820
I

223
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,660
My child is gone

224
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,260
My baby is gone

225
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,460
I died...

226
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,740
I died...

227
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,740
I was killed...

228
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,820
I died...

229
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,200
ah

230
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,380
Nothing

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,060
I'm sorry

232
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,720
I am sorry

233
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,980
I'm sorry

234
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,760
So small

235
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,680
So 예쁜

236
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,720
This is unass length

237
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,380
Aren't these two

238
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,380
Instead of losing weight

239
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,260
in the case of Wang Zhen.

240
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,780
There's no problem with Wang Zhen.

241
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,980
He needs to calm down,

242
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,560
but we can't even work on it.

243
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,280
Here's a gift.

244
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,720
For me?

245
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,420
A bullet round.

246
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,220
What's inside

247
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,220
is the sea water of our traditional river.

248
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,220
You wear it,

249
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,220
it's like walking on the road I've walked.

250
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,220
I'm sorry, Si.

251
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,220
I came to Rome this time

252
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,220
to make you worry.

253
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,220
Come on.

254
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,220
What's wrong?

255
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,220
Attention, team.

256
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,220
We're about to cross the traditional river

257
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,220
and return to the sea of our country.

258
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,220
Attention, team.

259
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,220
We're about to cross the traditional river

260
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,220
and return to the sea of our country.

261
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,220
We're going home.

262
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,220
Mom.

263
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,220
Have you ever regretted

264
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,220
marrying a soldier like my dad?

265
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,220
I haven't thought about it.

266
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,220
But if you ask me to choose again,

267
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,220
I'll choose

268
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,220
to be your dad's wife,

269
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,220
to be your mom,

270
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,220
to be another half of a soldier.

271
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,220
I'll choose to be your dad's wife,

272
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
to be your mom,

273
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,220
to be another half of a soldier.

274
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,220
Mom.

275
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,220
A military wife like you

276
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,220
is really too kind.

277
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,220
The military certificate of a soldier

278
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,220
should be divided into half of you.

279
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,220
But I don't think

280
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,220
I'm a good military wife at all.

281
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,220
Dad said

282
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,220
he was worried

283
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,220
that I couldn't be a military wife.

284
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,220
It seems reasonable.

285
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,220
Do you regret it?

286
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,220
It's not easy to get married.

287
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,220
But I really didn't expect

288
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,220
it would be so difficult.

289
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,220
Actually, my requirements for marriage

290
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,220
are very simple.

291
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,220
My stable company

292
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,220
and caring waiting

293
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,220
are enough.

294
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,220
But now I understand

295
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,220
when the country

296
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,220
and the people

297
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,220
need my husband the most,

298
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,220
he is the most lovely person.

299
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,220
And when I need him,

300
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,220
he is always there for me.

301
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,220
He is always on TV,

302
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,220
on the phone,

303
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,220
and even lost contact everywhere.

304
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,220
Mom,

305
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,220
do you think

306
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,220
I made a hasty decision?

307
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
I haven't grown up yet.

308
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,220
I can't afford

309
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,220
to be a soldier

310
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,220
for my family

311
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,220
and my wife.

312
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,220
Yangyang,

313
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,220
a soldier is a profession,

314
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,220
but not a military wife.

315
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,220
I can understand your feelings

316
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,220
now

317
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,220
even if I believe you.

318
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,220
But the times are different.

319
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,220
There are many choices

320
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,220
and challenges

321
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,220
for a military marriage.

322
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,220
I just want you to know

323
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,220
that soldiers like your father

324
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,220
and your father's family

325
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,220
are not

326
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,220
ordinary people.

327
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,220
They are great people.

328
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,220
They are the people

329
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,220
who sacrificed

330
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,220
and dedicated themselves

331
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,220
behind the good times.

332
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,220
There must be someone

333
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,220
to do these things.

334
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,220
Only with these people

335
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,220
can we have

336
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
the happiness

337
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
and a peaceful life.

338
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,220
The End

339
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,220
The General Manager is coming back.

340
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,340
Large Group

341
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,540
Look down!

342
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,620
There's no barricade here.

343
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,520
Neither barricades nor perfect bars are here.

344
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,220
We'll spend money

345
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,220
on a dynamic playhouse

346
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,560
and rain fish.

347
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,220
Member.

348
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,220
Okay.

349
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,820
Yang Yang, answer it.

350
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,220
Hello?

351
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,220
Hello, Dad.

352
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,620
Why are you answering the phone?

353
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,820
Where is Yang Yang?

354
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,820
She went to take a shower.

355
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,420
You go home first.

356
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,820
Okay.

357
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,820
I'll be home soon.

358
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,820
See you later.

359
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,220
Yang Yang

360
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,220
Reporter Tang.

361
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,220
Did you talk to the captain on the ship?

362
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,820
I wanted to talk to him.

363
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,620
But he was too busy.

364
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,620
He didn't have a chance.

365
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,620
Do you want to know

366
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,620
what he was like when he was not busy?

367
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,620
What?

368
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,620
It's not the first time that the captain has joined the escort.

369
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,020
But this time,

370
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,820
everyone can see

371
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,420
that he is different from when he went out to sea.

372
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,620
He never called the warships

373
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,420
or the soldiers.

374
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,620
This time, we can always see him

375
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,620
when we are in line to make a call.

376
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,620
I saw him.

377
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,820
He wanted to call you.

378
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,020
But he didn't get the call

379
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,820
and left without saying goodbye.

380
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,420
He took his phone and recorded a video for you.

381
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,820
Be careful.

382
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,620
Look at the sea.

383
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,620
Look at the clouds.

384
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,420
When it was early in the morning,

385
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,020
when it was sunset,

386
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,420
when the scenery was beautiful,

387
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,220
you can see it all.

388
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,020
You can see it all.

389
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,620
And you know

390
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,420
the life on the ship is very boring.

391
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,620
But he always wanted to share

392
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,220
all the good moments with you.

393
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,620
Usually,

394
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,620
the captain has a lot of things

395
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,020
to worry about on the ship.

396
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,820
But since this time,

397
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,520
I can feel it

398
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,580
I'm always in the coffin.

399
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,940
I really don't know these things.

400
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,340
Yang Yang.

401
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,740
Yang Yang, don't be like this.

402
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,300
I know you're upset.

403
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,540
Yang Yang.

404
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,220
Listen to me. Come out.

405
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,060
I'll face it with you.

406
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,780
Yang Yang.

407
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,300
Yang Yang, don't be like this.

408
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,420
The phone is ringing.

409
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:39,980
Yang Yang.

410
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,660
Honey, wait for me.

411
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,380
Yang Yang.

412
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,460
I'll be home soon.

413
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,780
Yang Yang.

414
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,140
Yang Yang, come out, okay?

415
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,100
Listen to me.

416
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,060
Don't hide in the house.

417
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,020
Don't knock.

418
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,820
Look.

419
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,540
Mom is coming.

420
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,780
What should we do?

421
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,020
Yang Yang, you...

422
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,900
Go.

423
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,100
The bridge is useless now.

424
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,100
It won't open.

425
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,060
What should we do?

426
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,140
It's about to open.

427
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,180
Look at her.

428
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,740
I'm so worried.

429
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,500
I really...

430
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,500
I feel so bad.

431
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,660
They're all our kids.

432
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,300
I feel bad for them.

433
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,060
But...

434
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,380
We have to face it.

435
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,260
How?

436
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,100
You...

437
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,820
Well.

438
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,340
When Chongqing comes in,

439
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,100
you tell him.

440
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,620
Okay.

441
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,300
I'll...

442
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,660
I'll tell him?

443
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,260
Yes.

444
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,660
How can I tell him?

445
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,420
You...

446
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,660
This kind of thing

447
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,020
is a woman's business.

448
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,860
So you're more suitable than me.

449
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,940
How can I

450
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,140
say it?

451
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,380
It's family business.

452
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,540
If something happens to your family,

453
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,700
you're the female owner.

454
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,340
You should be the one to tell him.

455
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,660
You're the owner of the family.

456
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,140
Tell him.

457
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,940
No.

458
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,140
I'll go.

459
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,460
Coming.

460
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,620
Dad.

461
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,140
Give it to me.

462
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,140
Come in.

463
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,220
Dad, come in.

464
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,740
Look.

465
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,980
It's dark.

466
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,540
But it's strong.

467
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,620
Sit down.

468
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,140
Thank you.

469
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,380
It's my pleasure.

470
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,820
How are you doing?

471
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,900
I'm fine.

472
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,300
Are you busy?

473
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:20,620
No.

474
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,740
I'm not free.

475
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,860
Mom, how about you?

476
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,380
I'm fine.

477
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,860
Look.

478
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,100
When I came back,

479
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,340
I bought a set of clothes for my dad.

480
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,220
I don't know if Yangyang likes it.

481
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,100
Where's Yangyang?

482
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,300
Yangyang...

483
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,500
Yangyang...

484
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,180
Yangyang went to buy fruit.

485
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,180
Look at this.

486
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,860
You have a lot of fruit at home.

487
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,020
Why did he buy fruit?

488
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,100
The fruit at home

489
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,940
is too old.

490
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,300
It's not fresh.

491
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,300
He wants to buy the freshest one for you.

492
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,620
Well...

493
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,740
Lu Qing.

494
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,140
Tell me.

495
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,580
Did anything interesting

496
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,220
happen to you

497
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,100
when you went out to protect the bank?

498
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,620
Yes.

499
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,620
There was an accident

500
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,620
in the bank.

501
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,260
A group of armed pirates

502
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,340
intercepted the cargo ship.

503
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,140
Then the cargo ship

504
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,300
sent us a signal.

505
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:11,900
Look.

506
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,540
Jingran.

507
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,020
Think about it.

508
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,100
Think about it.

509
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,780
Don't you know about this, dad?

510
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,540
I know.

511
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,340
I just want to hear you say it again.

512
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,340
Tell me about it.

513
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,340
Well...

514
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,220
The cargo ship was intercepted

515
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,140
by armed pirates.

516
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,460
Then two hostages

517
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,940
were kidnapped on the ship.

518
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,300
Dad. Mom.

519
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,580
Look at your head.

520
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,340
You're so...

521
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,220
Wipe it off.

522
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,020
Wipe it off.

523
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,540
You're just listening to the story.

524
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,580
You're so...

525
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,460
Well, later...

526
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,100
You...

527
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,860
Well...

528
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,780
Well...

529
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,580
Well...

530
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,340
Why is my phone here?

531
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,860
Mom.

532
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,380
What's wrong?

533
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,820
Tell me the truth.

534
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,540
Did anything happen to Yangyang?

535
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,100
No.

536
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,540
No.

537
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,740
Nothing happened.

538
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,740
No.

539
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,580
Zeng Xing.

540
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,660
Here's the thing.

541
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,060
I'm sorry.

542
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,860
We didn't take good care of Yangyang

543
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,260
when you left.

544
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,580
Your kid...

545
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,660
is gone.

546
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:45,940
Run now!

547
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,980
Mom.

548
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,420
I'll get you a sanatorium.

549
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:52,980
OK.

550
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,380
Thanks.

551
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,980
Dad, you don't need to thank me.

552
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,620
Dad,

553
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,780
where's Yangyang now?

554
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,740
Yangyang is in his room.

555
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,060
We can't get her to come out.

556
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,100
Zeng Xing.

557
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,460
Yang Yang, it's me.

558
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,940
Open the door.

559
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,100
Yang Yang,

560
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,180
no matter what happens,

561
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,260
open the door first.

562
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,620
Let me see you.

563
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,620
Are you

564
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,740
okay?

565
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,300
If you have anything to say,

566
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,500
you can tell me first.

567
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,140
I'm fine.

568
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,380
We haven't met for so long.

569
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,460
Don't you miss me?

570
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,780
Are you scared?

571
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,340
I've been thinking about you

572
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,740
on the boat these days.

573
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,180
I've been thinking about how you're doing.

574
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,740
How are you doing?

575
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,500
I even dreamt of going home.

576
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,020
I'm sorry.

577
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,540
I'm afraid you'll face it alone.

578
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,540
Now I'm back.

579
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,420
I'll be with you.

580
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,780
It's okay if you don't want to open the door.

581
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,220
I'll be at the door with you.

582
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,020
the End

583
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,420
Thank you for bringing me back.

584
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,860
Don't be so polite to me.

585
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,020
I told you today

586
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,180
a lot about the captain.

587
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,020
You shouldn't tell him

588
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,940
it's me who told him.

589
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,340
Okay, I won't say it.

590
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,020
Come back this time to recuperate.

591
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,380
After experiencing this,

592
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,700
Shen Xin must be tired.

593
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,140
She's fine.

594
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,220
But it's quite exciting.

595
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,260
Okay, you can go back.

596
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,900
I'll go in, too.

597
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,620
Okay, bye.

598
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:28,700
Captain.

599
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,420
Don't move.

600
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,420
How is it?

601
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,180
I don't feel anything.

602
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,340
I just feel like

603
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,780
it's not my leg.

604
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,820
Where's Qiu Xiao?

605
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,860
He's helping me with the procedures.

606
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,380
Actually, I don't need to keep him company.

607
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,580
The doctors and nurses are here.

608
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,460
Qiu Xiao was transferred by the Brigadier.

609
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,740
Before he comes,

610
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,860
someone must be watching you.

611
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,460
He won't come.

612
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,540
I didn't tell him.

613
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,300
You didn't tell him about such a big thing?

614
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,020
How dare I tell him?

615
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,580
I was slightly injured before.

616
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,980
He was so anxious that he couldn't sleep at all.

617
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,540
Now,

618
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,700
I can't tell him about it.

619
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,860
My mother-in-law didn't want to

620
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,700
tell him about the case of the concussion.

621
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,980
She said she was forced to agree

622
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,020
because of the pregnancy.

623
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,900
The childless thing

624
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,620
is our family's worry.

625
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,500
Now, I can't let them worry

626
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,340
because of my health.

627
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,460
But Mr. Bai has the right to know.

628
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,660
I know.

629
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,100
Wait a few days.

630
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,940
When he gets better,

631
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,380
I'll tell him immediately.

632
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,140
This kind of injury

633
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,820
can't be cured in a short period of time.

634
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,380
Captain Wu, Captain Chen,

635
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,860
I'm Junyi from the Brigade.

636
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,340
I'm also your comrade-in-arms.

637
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,100
I think I need to

638
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,060
tell you clearly about the real injury.

639
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,380
The root is the strongest part of the human leg.

640
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,580
Basically, all the lower body movements

641
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,060
are done by him.

642
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,940
Ordinary sprains

643
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,540
are hard to recover.

644
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,100
Moreover,

645
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,460
your injury is caused by a single puncture.

646
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,140
Qiu Qiu.

647
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,540
It's okay, Captain.

648
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,380
I'll face it sooner or later.

649
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,820
I want to know the real situation.

650
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,380
When we were on the ship,

651
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,100
we had done the first rescue.

652
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,940
Next, we'll have a joint consultation

653
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,900
with the hospital in the battle zone.

654
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,700
But the medical help is limited.

655
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,020
It's up to you

656
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,460
to recover.

657
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:33,940
I believe

658
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,100
through strict recovery training,

659
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,660
you can recover as soon as possible

660
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,340
and go back to normal life.

661
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,780
I'll go to the hospital in the middle of the battle zone.

662
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,500
But the medical help is limited.

663
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,700
I have to face the reality.

664
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,260
I will.

665
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:52,900
Thank you.

666
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,780
Are you still insisting

667
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,780
not to tell your family?

668
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,700
Then tell Zi Jian first.

669
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,060
Don't tell my mother-in-law

670
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,420
about this.

671
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,060
Before I leave, I have to promise her

672
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,020
that I'll come back safely.

673
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,740
I also made some promises to her.

674
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,860
I don't want to break my promise.

675
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,940
Please

676
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,300
keep it a secret for now.

677
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,460
Mr. Tian.

678
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,820
I'm here to report to you.

679
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:33,940
You're back.

680
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,380
If you can

681
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,780
make a report,

682
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,100
it will be a big hit.

683
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,100
I can't

684
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,340
report this time.

685
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,300
I don't want to affect the investigation.

686
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,500
Don't worry. I know that.

687
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,500
I'll remember your credit.

688
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,100
When the investigation is over,

689
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,380
we'll make a big report.

690
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,180
By the way,

691
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,900
you can't

692
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,660
do the investigation alone.

693
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,420
You have to report it.

694
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,100
I have to be responsible for your safety.

695
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,300
If anything happens,

696
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,940
how can I explain to the superior leader?

697
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,220
How can I face your parents?

698
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,220
Okay. I'll pay attention to it.

699
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,460
If you really can...

700
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,300
Also,

701
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,900
please take some time to

702
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,580
take care of the content.

703
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,220
The video out Romantic Movement is at its peak.

704
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,300
Go home and have a good rest.

705
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,980
You can

706
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,140
refresh your topic

707
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,620
and get back on track.

708
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,060
Then we should use what you don't like.

709
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,980
Then I will love you.

710
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,580
I'm sorry.

711
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,380
Sorry.

712
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,220
I'm sorry.

713
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,420
I'm sorry, son.

714
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,700
Stop it,

715
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,060
what kind of person I will be when I am back

716
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,500
So this demon

717
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,540
He entrusted Hurry

718
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:18,720
You're a motionless or mute

719
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,000
The birth son is not around

720
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,900
Coming to see you

721
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:53,320
Isn't it better to have a 기대�ков

722
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,360
Finish reading theotta

723
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,960
I'm afraid when I think of you.

724
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,360
Dad!

725
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,520
Son!

726
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,280
I'm so sorry.

727
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,080
What's so heavy?

728
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,080
Mom's laundry,

729
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,560
and my sister's pee.

730
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,000
And the vitamins that the doctor gave me.

731
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,800
And...

732
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,200
Enough.

733
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,640
You've been taking care of me

734
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,120
when I was away.

735
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,360
Good job.

736
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,200
You're better than your dad.

737
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,680
And Sister Yang Yang.

738
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,040
When I was a baby,

739
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,720
she was always with me.

740
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,080
Let's go see her

741
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,040
when she's out of the hospital.

742
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,200
Okay.

743
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,040
If she has a son,

744
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,080
let's have a baby.

745
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,200
You're thinking too far.

746
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,600
You won't be a innkeeper.

747
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,520
Come on.

748
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,360
Come on.

749
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,360
Look at me.

750
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,640
Is it fun?

751
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,080
From now on,

752
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,400
you're my brother.

753
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,920
Take care of my sister, okay?

754
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,120
Okay.

755
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:25,960
I...

756
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,200
Okay, get it.

757
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,840
Let's go.

758
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,640
Okay.

759
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,800
My husband.

760
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,120
I'm sorry.

761
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
I'm not blaming you.

762
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,040
Why should I blame you?

763
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,320
It's my fault.

764
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,920
I know you're very careful.

765
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,640
Right?

766
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,760
I don't want to leave you alone at home.

767
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,400
I wanted to go home with my baby.

768
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,320
I'm back now.

769
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,800
What's wrong?

770
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,400
I...

771
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,000
I...

772
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,040
I...

773
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
My little boy.

774
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,120
I'll be with you.

775
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,840
Mr. Han.

776
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,480
Call the chairman

777
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,640
and tell him I'm safe.

778
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,240
He calls me every day these days

779
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,480
asking where I've been.

780
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,400
I said

781
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,360
I should call him

782
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,280
as soon as I see you.

783
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,320
I won't.

784
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,880
Call him.

785
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,320
What should I say?

786
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,000
Tell him I'm safe.

787
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,720
Tell him I'm back safe.

788
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,040
You don't know anything else.

789
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,000
I'll call him.

790
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I'll call him.

791
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I'll call him.

792
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I'll call him.

793
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I'll call him.

794
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I'll call him.

795
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I'll call him.

796
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,080
You don't know anything else.

797
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,520
I see.

798
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,600
He's back.

799
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,400
Look.

800
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:45,840
Shi...

801
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,680
What are you doing?

802
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,720
I'll call him.

803
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,720
I'll call him.

804
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,440
I'll call him.

805
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,440
What?

806
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,840
He took so many things.

807
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,600
Look.

808
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,840
Where's Shi?

809
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,200
I'll go and pick him up.

810
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:55,840
Look.

811
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,520
He's back.

812
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,320
He's back.

813
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,200
No.

814
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,640
What do you mean no?

815
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,440
Sit down.

816
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,080
Sit down.

817
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,760
Sit down.

818
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,600
You...

819
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,080
Xingxing.

820
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,080
You're back.

821
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,960
Mom.

822
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,880
You're back.

823
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,960
Honey, why did you take so many things?

824
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,080
Are they heavy?

825
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,600
So many things.

826
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,560
I miss you so much.

827
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,840
I miss you, too, mom.

828
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,440
Let me see.

829
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,800
Are you tired?

830
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,320
No.

831
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,120
Xingxing.

832
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,360
Hurry up.

833
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,360
I'm jealous.

834
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,000
Dad.

835
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,800
You're back.

836
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,400
You're calling me?

837
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,200
Look.

838
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,360
Hello.

839
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,280
台飞she's son.

840
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,000
Hi, Mom.

841
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,080
Mom.

842
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,040
loves you a lot,

843
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,280
but never says anything to you,

844
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,840
because sometimes

845
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,440
it's no one to band for her.

846
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,520
Right?

847
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,400
You're back.

848
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,960
You're always safe.

849
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,200
Your dad.

850
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,520
Dad.

851
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,560
I rode the car to use the toilet.

852
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,840
You've been away for so many days.

853
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,120
One month and three days.

854
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,240
Thirteen hours.

855
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,240
You've been away from home.

856
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,920
Yes.

857
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,640
It's also the first time

858
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,000
I've been away from home for so long.

859
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,080
I still miss home.

860
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I used to say you didn't want to go home.

861
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,000
I didn't understand you when I was a kid.

862
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,400
But this time,

863
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,480
I understand more.

864
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,440
It's because

865
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,320
you didn't want to go home for so many years

866
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,120
that we can have

867
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,320
a safe, happy

868
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,560
and carefree life.

869
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,120
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

870
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,360
Wait.

871
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,320
The blue sky is blue.

872
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,160
My heart is so cold.

873
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,040
I miss you.

874
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,760
You block the clouds for me.

875
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,360
You always take the burden silently.

876
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:41,840
The long road can slowly make me happy.

877
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,960
People all show romance.

878
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,600
The dream is also simple.

879
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,000
But in your heart,

880
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,400
there are more expectations.

881
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,240
I really don't understand

882
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,040
why you say love is so vague.

883
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:11,200
But you give me an answer with your eyes.

884
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,840
I can meet you with all my heart.

885
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,720
I want to say thank you for waking up

886
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,080
the courage that was once weak.

887
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,400
Let all coincidences become a wish.

888
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,200
Let all the burdens become a burden.

889
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,280
Let's start the bright future.

890
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,320
People can't separate us.

891
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,880
You are the warm star.

892
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:51,600
You are the monologue in my memory.

893
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,320
You are the loneliness in the dark.

894
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,120
I want to be with you.

895
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,560
I don't want to be hurt.

896
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,000
The courage is always a person.

897
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,680
Let my heart be your refuge.

898
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,960
Thank you for being by my side.

899
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,160
The cold snow and the darkness.

900
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,560
The bigger the world, the more lonely it is.

901
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,240
Only standing by your side,

902
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:33,560
I can feel the warmth in my heart.
