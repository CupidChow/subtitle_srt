1
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,750
Oh, right.

2
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,950
It's just four lips touching.

3
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,620
I win.

4
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,580
Wait, no.

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,040
Oh, sorry.

6
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,870
I guess I'm better at practical writing,

7
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,200
like telling people "tit-for-tat"

8
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,160
or "an eye for an eye".

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,370
- You...
- You can leave now.

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,450
No, wait.

11
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,750
Oh, right.

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,080
Wait.

13
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,830
What's this?

14
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,040
You're giving me money?

15
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,540
You're paying me after you kissed me?

16
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,040
Are you thinking of me as...

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,880
That kind of person?

18
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,620
Even so,

19
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,540
is this all I'm worth?

20
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,620
It's for the water.

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,500
What water?

22
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,870
The one you bought me
at Happiness this afternoon.

23
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,910
I'm paying you back now.

24
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,370
So that's why you're giving me the money?

25
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,330
Just for a bottle of water
from Happiness?

26
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,540
Makes sense.

27
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,700
Didn't the owner say

28
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,410
that even brothers
settle their accounts clearly?

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,910
Besides,

30
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,870
we barely know each other.

31
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,090
Never mind.

32
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,080
Up to you.

33
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,450
Close the door, thanks.

34
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,660
Recently, English education has put
more emphasis on speaking.

35
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,410
So, everyone, remember,

36
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,620
speaking, speaking, and speaking.

37
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,290
Important things are worth repeating.

38
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,700
Oral practice is crucial.

39
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,910
Here are two examples.

40
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,580
Who can read them out?

41
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,870
Qi Jiahao.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,160
The first one is "It's up to you".

43
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,750
The second one is "It's down to you".

44
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,370
Excellent. Please sit down.

45
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,250
Thank you, ma'am.

46
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,750
So, guys,

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,080
what is the difference

48
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,040
between "up" and "down"?

Crab, I'm busy here.

63
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,440
It's so hot.

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,060
(Waiting for friend request acceptance.)

65
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,290
Still not accepted.

66
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,160
Since he's not my friend,

67
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,540
he's my enemy.

68
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,370
Do you have totake tonight's flight?

69
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,080
You just got back.

70
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,040
I just wanted to come back

71
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,660
and see how you're doing.

72
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,200
Otherwise, I'd go straight
from Thailand to Shanghai.

73
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,540
Alright, I understand.

74
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,830
Alright.

75
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,450
Thank you.

76
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,330
I'll leave the family to you.

77
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,950
- See you.
- Let me drive you to the airport.

78
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,790
No need.

79
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,870
Come on.

80
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,370
Let's go.

81
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,290
Go.

82
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,620
I made your favorite baked vegetables.

83
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,120
Mom!

84
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,200
- Honey!
- Mom!

85
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,660
- What's wrong, honey?
- Mom.

86
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,700
- Mom!
- Honey!

87
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,040
Mom.

88
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,500
Ms. Zhang, take Wang away.

89
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,450
Mom.

90
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,910
Wang, be good. Honey!

91
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,910
Mom.

92
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,830
Ms. Zhang, I'll take her to the hospital.

93
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,370
Sheng Wang, Mom will be back soon.

94
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,580
Don't be afraid.

95
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,450
Be good. Don't cry.

96
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,000
I made your favorite baked vegetables.

97
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,830
Wang.

98
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,870
Hot. Hot. Hot.

99
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,330
Ouch, it's so hot.

100
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,620
Madam, rinse your hand
with running water.

101
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,120
Look at me, all clumsy.

102
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,160
Be careful.

103
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,790
It's okay. I'll put
some ointment on it later.

104
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,630
What's wrong?

105
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,540
She's got burned.

106
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,750
It's okay.

107
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,120
I accidentally burned myself
making baked vegetables.

108
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,000
Why did you suddenly make that?

109
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,410
Wang likes it.

110
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,790
His mom used to make this for him

111
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,330
when he was little.

112
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,410
I don't know how to do it,

113
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,000
so I asked Ms. Sun to teach me

114
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,160
since she is here today.

115
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,120
Try this.

116
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,870
This ointment is great for burns.

117
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,080
I always carry it with me.

118
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,870
It's hot.

119
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,620
Making baked vegetables won't
turn you into my mom.

120
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,580
And my mom wasn't easily hurt.

121
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,540
Tian.

122
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,410
It's okay.

123
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,540
Hey! Take care of Wang.

124
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,580
No need.

125
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,040
What do you mean?

126
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,450
You don't have to take care of me.

127
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,290
Why do you always accommodate me?

128
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,700
It makes me feel like I'm beneath you.

129
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,750
You don't have to do all this.

130
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,330
You're not obligated.

131
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,670
Oh?

132
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,950
You two are so close,

133
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,080
even going to school together.

134
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,370
You don't look well.

135
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,870
Could you be running a fever?

136
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,040
Let me get something for you.

137
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,710
Okay.

138
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,790
Our handsome Sheng's English is excellent.

139
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,830
You scored way above
the school average on the last test.

140
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,910
You should have finished the 150 English

141
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,000
practice questions, right?

142
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,870
Thank you very much.

143
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,290
Hey,

144
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,450
you look terrible.

145
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,160
What did you do last night?

146
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,330
Have you caught a cold?

147
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,080
Maybe.

148
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,620
Here you are.

149
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,910
It works great for fevers.

150
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,370
Oh, thanks.

151
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,660
I have a fever too. Could you check?

152
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,160
Stop being ridiculous.

153
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,020
(Cooling patch)

154
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Guys,

155
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,250
did you finish the 150 questions?

156
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,120
Yes.

157
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,750
What about the others?

158
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,040
No response?

159
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,580
Only Qi Jiahao,
our English expert, answered.

160
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,450
Are you playing dead?

161
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,200
Alright, open your papers now.

162
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,330
Let's get started.

163
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,540
Jing's style is to publicly shame

164
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,290
whoever gets picked.

165
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,290
Give me your paper.

166
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,160
Never mind.

167
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,750
I'll let you off this time.

168
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,500
I'll use a different student's paper.

169
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,880
Okay.

170
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,330
Jiang Tian.

171
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Bring up the paper of the pale student

172
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,830
in front of you.

173
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,500
He seems too frightened
to walk up to the platform.

174
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,450
Ma'am,

175
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,450
he's sick.

176
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,080
Then why didn't he go
to the health center?

177
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,000
Sheng Wang, look over the paper
with Jiang Tian.

178
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,950
Now, let's look at the first question.

179
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,040
You...

180
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,290
You.

181
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,660
Your breathing is too loud.

182
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,160
I win.

183
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,580
(I win!)

184
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,660
You!

185
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,620
Sheng Wang?

186
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,620
What's wrong? You're distracted.

187
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,060
No, I'm not.

188
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,250
Sheng Wang did pretty well
on this paper,

189
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,000
missing only seven or eight questions.

190
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,540
Qi Jiahao, what about you?

191
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,750
Four questions.

192
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,120
Excellent.

193
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,200
Come to my office after class.

194
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,500
Alright, everyone.

195
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,290
Let's move on to the next question.

196
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,770
(Sheng Wang)

197
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,970
(Score: 100)

198
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,420
Sit down.

199
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,910
Do you know your score
on the test paper?

200
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,120
Yes, I know.

201
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,500
Then don't you find it strange?

202
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,750
You got a perfect score,

203
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,870
but I said you got seven
or eight ones wrong.

204
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,000
Does that frustrate you?

205
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,870
Do you want the truth?

206
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,750
Of course.

207
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,960
Not at all.

208
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,830
Because scores are for others to see,

209
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,910
but the ability is my own.

210
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,500
Well said.

211
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,910
Do you know

212
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,870
why I insisted you got seven
or eight questions wrong?

213
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,160
Yes.

214
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,040
Really?

215
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,160
Then tell me, why is that?

216
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,700
Because I just transferred here

217
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,450
and haven't fully integrated
into this class.

218
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,660
I'm only close to Gao Tianyang and…

219
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,750
And whom?

220
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,620
Nobody.

221
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,700
Only Gao Tianyang.

222
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,290
But that's because he's friendly
and easy-going.

223
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,120
It doesn't mean I've been
accepted by my classmates.

224
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,370
A lot of the students

225
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,200
still see me as an outsider

226
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,540
and watch me like it's a show.

227
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,160
So,

228
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,950
my grades can't be too bad,

229
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,200
or I'll be out of place in this class.

230
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,660
But they can't be good either,

231
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,660
or I will take

232
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,250
some credit away from other students.

233
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,870
So I need to be good,

234
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,040
but not too good.

235
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,290
That's for the best.

236
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,830
I didn't expect you

237
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,160
to be so thoughtful.

238
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,870
Not at all.

239
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,120
I just thought of it randomly.

240
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,330
Well, that's pretty much the idea.

241
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,000
Good for you to know that.

242
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,040
The dynamic in the advanced class

243
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,200
can be either simple

244
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,500
or complex.

245
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,750
Since everyone is almost
at the same level,

246
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,870
there's a lot of mutual admiration

247
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,120
but also a lot of competition.

248
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,790
Most students are
pretty straightforward,

249
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,160
but some of them are more

250
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,330
competitive and defensive.

251
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,080
So, it's best if you
stay low-key for now.

252
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,250
Ma'am.

253
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,540
About those 150 questions,

254
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,620
I'm afraid

255
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,870
I won't be able to stay low-key.

256
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,290
Why?

257
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,870
You know,

258
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,710
well,

259
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,870
in the morning during self-study,

260
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,700
we usually check answers
with each other.

261
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,410
How many students?

262
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,410
Considering Gao Tianyang's influence,

263
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,750
it's one...

264
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,660
20, I guess.

265
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,040
20?

266
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,790
Here comes our English genius, Sheng Wang!

267
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,330
Bravo!

268
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,120
Are you insane?

269
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,370
Am I a tourist attraction for you?

270
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,750
You should be a tour guide.

271
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,750
Come on. You got 150 questions
all correct. That's amazing.

272
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,620
I really made the right choice
by copying your answers.

273
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,950
You have no shame.

274
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,630
Hunk,

275
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,950
let's talk.

276
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,250
Hunk? Do you like me?

277
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,200
No, no.

278
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,700
I checked the forum
of Shanghai International School

279
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,330
and found out

280
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,160
that you were the school hunk.

281
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,870
I usually call people by a single word,

282
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,580
so I call you "Hunk".

283
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,200
I don't mind your habit,

284
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,660
but can you use a different word?

285
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,200
For your information, no "school".

286
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,000
How about

287
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,840
Sheng?

288
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,660
Sheng? Sounds like calling me "shame".

289
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,700
Watch your accent.

290
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,330
How about

291
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,500
calling him Wang?

292
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,200
Ask him. Don't ask me.

293
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,410
- Wang?
- I'm okay with it.

294
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,000
But don't you feel it weird?

295
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,200
Call me "Wang" and see how it sounds.

296
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,910
Wang. Woof?

297
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,290
That suits you so well.

298
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,160
Gao the Dog.

299
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,160
Dog Tianyang.

300
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,620
Should we just call you Sheng?

301
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,700
That's good.

302
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,450
Then we'll call you Sheng from now on.

303
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,830
- Sheng.
- Sheng.

304
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,540
I'm fine with anything.
It's up to you guys.

305
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,660
Sheng.

306
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,750
Can I ask you for a favor?

307
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,450
Can you not let Gao copy

308
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,870
your answers to the test paper?

309
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,450
I was asked to watch out
for students copying homework.

310
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,290
It's my responsibility as the study monitor.

311
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,500
I'm for everyone's good.

312
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,700
Exactly. And the phones.

313
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,910
Don't distract me with that.

314
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,700
Note it down.

315
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,870
You've never used a phone

316
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,330
or copied someone's homework?

317
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,700
Don't think I won't dare.

318
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,660
I've recorded everything.

319
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,410
I'll hand it over
at the end of the semester.

320
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,250
- I'm just kidding.
- What time is it?

321
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,160
A lot.

322
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
You didn't record me, right?

323
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,370
Tian, where did you go just now?

324
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:56,870
The health center.

325
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,500
(DYHS)
The health center?

326
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,040
No way.

327
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,290
Did you go to get
cold medicine for Sheng?

328
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,870
My mom burned her hand.

329
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,120
This is for her.

330
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,310
(DYHS)

331
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,060
(On duty:
Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian)

332
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,020
(On duty: Jiang Tian)

333
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,880
Sheng.

334
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,870
Come here.

335
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,090
What's up?

336
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,950
Are you free tonight?

337
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,040
Qi's friend just opened
a coffee shop by the river.

338
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,160
It is opening today.

339
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,870
They don't just serve coffee.
There's barbecue too.

340
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,540
We can also have some iced drinks.

341
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,410
They're perfect for this hot weather.

342
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,000
What do you think?

343
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,040
We have a little homework today.

344
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,330
Let's go and have some fun.

345
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,250
Qi is already there.

346
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,540
I'm not going...

347
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,040
Not going wouldn't be right, huh?

348
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,910
I'll go.

349
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,870
Great.

350
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,250
Bye, Tian.

351
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,000
Hey.

352
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,540
You seem to get along well
with Jiang Tian.

353
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,040
Why didn't you invite him?

354
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,750
It's more than just getting along.

355
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,250
He is my childhood sweetheart.

356
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,200
We grew up together
in the Little White House.

357
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,500
But Tian never attends
these kinds of events.

358
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,500
He's busy.

359
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,750
Oh.

360
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,040
But I'm surprised you asked about him.

361
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,120
Why?

362
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,540
I mean,

363
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,330
from the first day you were here,
you two didn't get along.

364
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,620
If it weren't for Jing
forcing you two together,

365
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,160
you wouldn't have spoken much at all.

366
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,370
I thought you weren't close,
so you didn't want him there.

367
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,580
True.

368
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,450
I'm not close to him.

369
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,410
Not close at all.

370
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,910
I'll be home late today.

371
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,120
If my mom asks,

372
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,370
just tell her the teacher needs me.

373
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,040
You call that not close?

374
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,500
He's reporting to you.

375
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,750
N-No... He was just...

376
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,540
He's not reporting to me.

377
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,750
He's reporting to his mom.

378
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,080
Oh, come on, it's complicated.

379
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,290
We're just...

380
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,660
We are roommates.

381
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,370
He...

382
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,870
If you want to know, just ask him.

383
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,870
So you are living together at night

384
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,750
but acting like strangers
during the day?

385
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,750
Are you two a secret couple
or something?

386
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,040
What are you talking about?

387
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,290
I have my own room, and he has his.

388
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,540
Are you close to your neighbors?

389
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,380
Yes.

390
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,830
My neighbors are my grandparents.

391
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,840
Are you all set?

392
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,160
Ready to go?

393
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,870
Let's go.

394
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,200
You slacked off again.

395
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,790
Shh.

396
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,520
(On duty: Jiang Tian)

397
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,950
Hey, this place is beautiful.

398
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,080
Look at me. Look at me!

399
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,410
Let's take a photo together.

400
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,870
Come here, everyone.

401
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,120
You go over there.

402
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,700
Why? Stop pushing!

403
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,660
Everyone, get in.

404
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,370
One, two, three.

405
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,040
One more time.

406
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,080
Get the river in the shot.

407
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,540
One, two...

408
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,120
- Why is it only Gao Tianyang's head?
- Handsome.

409
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,330
So handsome.

410
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,160
Ridiculously handsome.

411
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,580
Hey, I heard the coffee shop owner

412
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,580
knocked down all the partitions
on the first floor.

413
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,040
They also have outdoor tables and chairs

414
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,700
where we can overlook
the Tamsui River there.

415
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,830
One day at a time.

416
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,370
It's our last fun year.

417
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,950
Next year, in our third year,

418
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,790
the school will strongly recommend
living on campus

419
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,000
to save time for study.

420
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,870
By then, everyone will be moving in.

421
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,040
Some might even

422
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,290
rent a place at the Little White House

423
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,410
and turn it into a dorm area.

424
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,160
I see.

425
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,200
Come on, Sheng.

426
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,450
You seem a bit tempted.

427
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,500
Are you thinking about
dorm life already?

428
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,080
When does registration start?

429
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,620
I'll let you know
when the school informs us.

430
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,700
Sheng, do you want to live on campus?

431
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:56,120
Well... It's lively with more people.

432
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,910
And if I don't finish the homework,

433
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,080
I can copy from 180 students around.

434
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,330
Good point. Well said.

435
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,040
But usually, they copy yours, right?

436
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,200
That's right. We copy his.

437
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,580
Alright, Qi is waiting
for us over there.

438
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,500
Let's hurry up.

439
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,160
Why would he copy theirs?

440
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah.

441
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,120
Where are your classmates?

442
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,290
I don't know. They should be here soon.

443
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,330
Hey! Come on in!

444
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,580
Qi!

445
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,910
What took you so long?

446
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,830
Tianyang.

447
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,790
Xi! Long time no see!

448
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,370
- Long time no see.
- I'll never forget

449
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,750
when you took me to
Mr. Ding's to steal sausages.

450
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,910
They were so good.

451
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,500
- Eat all the sausages you want later.
- Thanks, Xi.

452
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,870
Are they all your classmates?

453
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,080
They are my friends

454
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,910
and they both call me Xi.

455
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,500
If you don't mind, you can call me Xi too.

456
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,200
Nice to see you, Xi.

457
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,660
Let me introduce you.

458
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,370
This is my partner.

459
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,450
His name is Linzi.

460
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,200
You can call him Linzi.

461
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,660
Hi, Linzi.

462
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,500
Hello, everyone.

463
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,160
I'll let him show you to your seats,

464
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,500
- okay?
- Okay.

465
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,790
The seats are at the back.

466
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,910
Today is the soft opening.
Eat and drink as much as you like.

467
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,410
Come on in. Have a seat.

468
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,450
Wow.

469
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,200
You guys start first.

470
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,500
I'll prepare more food for you.

471
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,540
Okay. Thanks, Linzi.

472
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,000
- Qi.
- Thanks.

473
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,040
How did you know Xi?

474
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,120
Actually, he used to tutor me.

475
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,950
I'm telling you. He's amazing.

476
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,370
You know the honor roll
on the first floor of our school?

477
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,830
He used to dominate the top spot.

478
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,120
He even won the Taiwan Model Student Award
of China.

479
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,330
How's the food?

480
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,790
It's good. Thanks, Xi.

481
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,910
- Thanks, Xi.
- Xi.

482
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,000
Who ordered the beer?

483
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,500
Sorry, Xi. It was me.

484
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,120
I took a break from school. I'm 18 now.

485
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,660
But your classmates are not yet.

486
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,420
How about this?

487
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,410
Today, everything is on the house,

488
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,250
except for alcoholic drinks.

489
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,090
Have as much as you want.

490
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,870
Then I'll have a soft drink.

491
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,250
Hey, Tianyang.

492
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,370
Ask Jiang Tian

493
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,410
if he wants to come.

494
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,090
Jiang Tian?

495
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,500
He's also your classmate?

496
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,370
Yes.

497
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,540
You know Tian?

498
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,700
In fact, we're very close.

499
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,040
Have we met before?

500
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,700
- Me?
- Yes.

501
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,620
Where?

502
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,910
At the convenience store.
Fish ball soup with A-gei.

503
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,080
Sorry. I'm face blind.

504
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,830
You didn't pay for the food,

505
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,330
and Jiang Tian took care of it...

506
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,580
Oh, I remember now.

507
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,000
You dined and dashed?

508
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,870
You didn't pay?

509
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,910
You ate without paying?

510
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,410
No, I paid him back later.

511
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,160
So, you're really close to Tian.

512
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,870
No wonder you came to school
together this morning.

513
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,750
Hello, Jiang Tian.

514
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,040
You are not coming?

515
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,660
Your friends are all here.

516
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,080
The one who didn't pay for the food.

517
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,000
Okay. I'll see you next time.

518
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,450
Jiang Tian's busy and can't come.

519
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,910
Help yourselves, guys.

520
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,410
Just let me know if you need anything.

521
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,330
Xi, do you have any skewers?

522
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,410
Yes.

523
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,330
Linzi.

524
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,160
Grill some skewers.

525
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,250
- Yes!
- Okay.

526
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,370
Thanks, Xi.

527
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,660
Dig in.

528
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,500
Grandpa.

529
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,700
Your leg is acting up again?

530
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,580
No, I told you I'm fine.

531
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,120
You don't have to come here.

532
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,750
I just bumped my knee.

533
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,590
It's fine.

534
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,250
Alright, stop, stop.

535
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,910
Let me check it.

536
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,750
No. No need.

537
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,290
It's not a big deal.

538
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,330
It's nothing, just a bump.

539
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,660
Are you getting used to staying there?

540
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,660
You never answer my questions.

541
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,950
Are you getting used to it?

542
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,790
You know, everything in this world
has cause and effect.

543
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
Actually,

544
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,620
I dried the fish for myself.

545
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,080
If that's the cause,

546
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,750
then the fish being eaten is the effect.

547
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,500
The fish being eaten… Be gentle.

548
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,910
Alright, hang in there.

549
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,330
The fish being eaten is the cause.

550
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:43,410
So I caught the cat and hit it.
It was the effect.

551
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,160
The cat being hit is the cause,

552
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,870
so it sees me as an enemy.

553
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,700
When I got out,
it jumped down to scare me.

554
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,080
That's the effect.

555
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,500
And then, I bumped my knee.

556
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,870
Many things

557
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,450
may seem independent,

558
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,620
but they're all interconnected.

559
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,250
If you

560
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,120
keep trying to avoid your fate,

561
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,040
you are

562
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,540
just running away from yourself.

563
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,040
Everything is part
of a perfect arrangement.

564
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,330
Face it, and you'll find peace.

565
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,290
Remember what I told you?

566
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,040
Always playing a steady game.

567
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,200
With it, I can handle anything.

568
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,580
Alright, sit down.

569
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,450
Why?

570
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,790
I'll handle it.

571
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,300
Oh, cat.

572
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,660
You caused me

573
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,410
to get bumped into.

574
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,160
Alright.

575
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,040
I won't blame you.

576
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,540
Did you eat my green peppers?

577
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,200
You'll eat from where he bit.
Do you like him?

578
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,620
I'll eat from the other side.

579
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,790
- Can you eat that?
- Save the yellow ones for me.

580
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,920
Sure.

581
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,290
Drink more water since you're sick.

582
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,500
Who... Who told you I'm sick?

583
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,540
What do you think?

584
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,790
Jiang Tian?

585
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,790
He didn't even come over.

586
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,950
Why does he care?

587
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,080
- Wow, you want to finish that?
- Slow down.

588
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,790
Wow!

589
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,700
Sheng is really thirsty.

590
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,950
Here, grilled skewers.

591
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,290
Thanks, Linzi.

592
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,500
Move. Move.

593
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,340
I want that.

594
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,480
- Who knocked my chopsticks?
- Why does it taste weird?

595
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,070
- Gao Tianyang.
- Go ahead and enjoy yourself.

596
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,290
Raise your glasses.

597
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,040
Cheers!

598
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,410
Hey, you know what?

599
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,330
Even though Jing

600
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,870
has been single for a long time,

601
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:16,160
there are actually a lot
of male teachers pursuing her.

602
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,830
But she doesn't fancy any of them.

603
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,080
So I was thinking,

604
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,330
maybe I'm the one

605
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,660
she wants to date.

606
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,910
No way.

607
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,950
Do you dare to talk about that?

608
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,790
The one who forbids us
from dating is your dad!

609
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,750
Exactly.

610
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,540
But did you listen to him?

611
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,620
- And you?
- Stop that.

612
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,540
So, do you guys know

613
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,160
the two girls from the class next door
who often come to see Tian?

614
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:42,580
I heard they've recently moved on

615
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,160
and had a crush on the new student
in our class.

616
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,950
We have another new transfer student?

617
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,540
It's you. You're the…

618
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,500
Oh, no.

619
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,910
- Give me my green tea.
- It's not green tea.

620
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,000
This is beer.

621
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,120
He didn't even come over.
Why does he care?

622
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,500
Slow down.

623
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,040
No wonder the taste seemed weird.

624
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,870
I'll go to the bathroom.

625
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:16,910
Careful.

626
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,290
You drank too much.

627
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,540
Don't sneak a drink.

628
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,540
Just give it a try.

629
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,330
- Is he drunk or not?
- Will he throw up?

630
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,250
He looks fine.

631
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,620
I think you're the one who's drunk.

632
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,950
You act crazy all day.

633
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,660
Hey, it just occurred to me.

634
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,410
Isn't the selection

635
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,040
for the Model Student Award
starting again soon?

636
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,830
You're really in the loop.

637
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,450
The class advisor might
announce it tomorrow.

638
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,790
There are probably
three spots per class.

639
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,370
But based on grades and class roles,

640
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:52,870
I probably don't have a chance.

641
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,950
But there's a spot
chosen by the class votes.

642
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,040
- Yeah.
- That's why I'm treating everyone

643
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,160
to dinner.

644
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,000
I'd appreciate it
if you could vote for me.

645
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,330
Can I get the check, please?

646
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,500
That won't be a problem.

647
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,540
Qi, you're so lame.

648
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,500
Ready to pay?

649
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,500
The boy who went to the restroom already paid.

650
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,080
- Sheng?
- Did Sheng pay?

651
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,200
Sheng, are you okay?

652
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,910
I'm fine.

653
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:19,790
Sheng,

654
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,580
you paid the bill?

655
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,910
Yeah.

656
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,700
- Thanks, Sheng.
- Thanks for treating us.

657
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,370
Thanks for inviting me to this gathering.

658
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,700
I'm finally not alone anymore.

659
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,660
So,

660
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,750
please enjoy yourselves.

661
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:35,790
Cheers.

662
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:40,000
- Yay! Cheers!
- Cheers!

663
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:45,790
Let's dig in.

664
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,790
Xi, please take care of Sheng.

665
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,830
We're heading out.

666
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,970
(Alors Cafe)

667
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,750
My head hurts.

668
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,470
(Jiang Tian)

669
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,250
Why are you here?

670
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,370
Aren't you going to Mr. Ding's?

671
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,370
Did you give him alcohol?

672
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,660
I gave him water.

673
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
He insisted on drinking it cold
and drank the wrong thing.

674
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,290
I just drank a full glass of green tea.

675
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,830
When I wanted a second glass,

676
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,370
it got snatched away.

677
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,330
Let's go back. Can you stand up?

678
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,160
I didn't drink alcohol.

679
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,200
Where is Gao Yangtian?

680
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,660
His name is Gao Tianyang.

681
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:08,120
What about Song Sirui,
Little Mouth Xu, Qi Jiahao,

682
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,200
and Pepper Fish or something?

683
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,790
They all left.

684
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,910
You are so drunk.

685
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,500
I was gonna take you home
after I cleaned up.

686
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,160
It's okay. I'll take him home.

687
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,410
Can you walk?

688
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,700
Tian.

689
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,370
Let's head back

690
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,200
to the palace!

691
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,660
I'll cross the mountain.

692
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,700
Hey, be careful.

693
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,660
Speed up, you.

694
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,120
It used to be you waiting for me.

695
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,370
Do I have to wait for you this time?

696
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,370
What's that?

697
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,830
Cockroach poison.

698
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,410
We don't have cockroaches at home.

699
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,910
It's for poisoning you.

700
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,080
I'm faster than you.

701
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,200
I win.

702
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,670
Sit here.

703
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,080
I'll go get some water.

704
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,040
I don't want to.

705
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,080
Sit.

706
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,750
They all say I'm close to you.

707
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,660
My dad even says

708
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,500
we'd make good friends.

709
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,370
Our classmates say

710
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,950
we look close too.

711
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:52,040
Even Zhao Xi, the café owner, says

712
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,000
we seem to have a good relationship.

713
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,410
Everyone thinks we're close.

714
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,750
But we've barely spoken to each other.

715
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,000
Actually, we can…

716
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,160
Actually, I'm feeling very sick today.

717
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,620
But you didn't get me any medicine.

718
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,290
What's this?

719
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,850
(Complete cold medicine)

720
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,120
Have this hangover remedy first.

721
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,000
Take the cold medicine later.

722
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,160
I'll give it to you

723
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,790
when you're sober.

724
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,700
What brand is this?

725
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,750
You know I'm quite delicate.

726
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,410
I don't take just any medicine.

727
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,580
Whatever.

728
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,120
This is disgusting.

729
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,500
Bitter medicine cures
the disease. Drink up.

730
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:23,830
It's empty.

731
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,700
I think I'm sober now.

732
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,200
Really?

733
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,040
Yes.

734
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,950
Now count from one to ten.

735
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,200
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, and ten.

736
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,410
Now count from ten to one.

737
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,540
Ten, nine...

738
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,540
Why should I listen to you?

739
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,040
Let's go home.

740
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,830
I'm not drunk.

741
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,870
You are finally back.

742
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:06,830
Don't touch me.

743
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:09,080
Why are you two so late?

744
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,040
I thought...

745
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,790
Why do you smell so strongly of alcohol?

746
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:14,950
Did you drink alcohol?

747
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,540
Wang, are you okay?

748
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,580
I'm fine. Great.

749
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,700
Hey, be careful.

750
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,290
Mind the step.

751
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,200
Careful.

752
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,450
Here. Sit down.

753
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:27,870
Easy.

754
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,540
Do you feel like throwing up?

755
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,540
Why did you take him to drink alcohol?

756
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,580
Keep an eye on him.

757
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,540
Make sure he doesn't throw up.

758
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,460
Mom.

759
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,950
Is your hand okay?

760
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,330
My hand?

761
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,290
It's fine.

762
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,790
I bought some burn ointment today.

763
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,580
Remember to apply it.

764
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,580
You bought it for me?

765
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,960
Okay.

766
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:01,250
Go watch him.

767
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,250
Don't let him throw up.

768
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,000
Mom, are you okay?

769
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,700
Actually,

770
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:29,410
I can somewhat understand Wang.

771
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,700
Even I'm still not used
to this house yet,

772
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,450
no wonder he's struggling
to accept both of us, right?

773
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,620
I need some lemon and honey.

774
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,910
Tian.

775
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,750
This is for you.

776
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,540
Drink this to prevent a cold. Hurry up.

777
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,840
Wang.

778
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,370
Here.

779
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,080
Have some honey water to sober up.

780
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,620
I'm sleepy.

781
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,700
I'll go to bed.

782
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,080
He's drunk.

783
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,620
Very drunk.

784
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,410
I guess the two of us

785
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,910
remind him of his mom.

786
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,200
Who is it?

787
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:49,140
(Notification: "." accepted your
friend request. You can chat now.)

788
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,540
Period?

789
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,250
Is that Jiang Tian?

790
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,790
He accepted my friend request now.

791
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,160
Did you lock your door?

792
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:12,140
(Want Want Senbei)
No.

793
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,240
Then I'm going in.

794
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:18,040
You want to…

795
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,290
Drink it.

796
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,580
When I was a kid,

797
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,200
every time I had a fever,

798
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,700
my mom would make me honey lemonade.

799
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:07,330
After my mom passed away,

800
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,370
there was a time

801
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,830
I would dream about her every night.

802
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:19,660
Back then, I felt so miserable

803
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:26,410
that I would snuggle
with my dad to fall asleep.

804
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:31,450
It felt like having him beside me

805
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,370
eased the pain.

806
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,830
Later on,

807
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:49,200
maybe because I hit puberty

808
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,500
or my dad got busier,

809
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:56,870
that closeness

810
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,250
became harder to maintain.

811
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,830
We moved into bigger and bigger houses,

812
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,160
but no one snuggled with me anymore.

813
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,120
Over time,

814
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,450
I no longer needed
that kind of closeness.

815
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:42,540
My dad respects me a lot.

816
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:48,370
People think my father is open-minded.

817
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,700
But I know

818
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,370
it's just politeness

819
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,000
and distance.

820
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:12,000
I'll drink it.

821
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,660
You can leave now.

822
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:54,000
I finished.

823
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:58,250
Here you are.

824
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,160
Get some rest.

825
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,540
I remember

826
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,160
I was going to ask you something.

827
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:28,290
But I can't remember what it was.

828
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,500
Oh, I remember.

829
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,410
You know.

830
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:42,290
When we were by the river,

831
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,540
I said

832
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,870
everyone thinks we are close

833
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:53,950
but we've barely spoken to each other.

834
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:57,540
At that time,

835
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:01,830
you said something to me.

836
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,660
You said that...

837
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,450
"Actually..." What was that?

838
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:15,330
"Actually..."

839
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:19,620
- Actually, we can...
- Actually, I'm feeling very sick today.

840
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,910
"Actually..."

841
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:22,830
Actually, we can give it a try.

842
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:29,450
Try what?

843
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,160
Try getting closer.

(I completely forgot
what the English teacher had said)

(about the difference between
"up to you" and "down to you".)

Excuse me.

858
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:44,950
Are you Jiang Tian from Class 2A?

859
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,250
What can I do for you?

860
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:49,040
My mom got burned.

861
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,410
Is there something I can get for her?

862
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:53,620
According to school rules,
that's not allowed,

863
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,700
but...

864
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,540
Alright. I'll get it for you.

865
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:57,750
Thank you.

00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,750
Apply it three times a day.
Don't forget.

867
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:17,910
By the way, your English teacher called.

868
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:19,450
She said a student
in your class has a cold.

869
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:20,870
Can you take the medicine to him?

870
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:26,370
But I have something coming up.

871
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,500
Well, that's okay.
I'll ask someone else to do it.

872
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,770
(Health Center)

873
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:42,250
Not going wouldn't be right, huh?

874
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,100
I'll go.

875
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:43,940
Great.

876
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:45,450
Bye, Tian.

877
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:51,620
You seem to get along well
with Jiang Tian.

878
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,000
Why didn't you invite him?

879
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:55,200
It's more than just getting along.

880
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,580
He is my childhood sweetheart.

881
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,750
(Complete cold medicine)
But Tian never attends these kinds of events.

882
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:01,620
He's busy.

883
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,080
Oh.

884
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:05,620
But I'm surprised you asked about him.

885
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,040
Why?

886
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:10,080
I mean, from the first day
you were here,

887
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,410
you two didn't get along.

888
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,950
If it weren't for Jing
forcing you two together,

889
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,330
you wouldn't have spoken much at all.

890
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:20,540
I thought you weren't close,
so you didn't want him there.

891
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,910
True. I'm not close to him.

892
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:25,870
Not close at all.

893
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,250
I'll be home late today.
