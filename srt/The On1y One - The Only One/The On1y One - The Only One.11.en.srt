1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,910
In Chinese,

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,290
the same imagery

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,580
can be interpreted differently
by different people.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,160
Take "Riverside Town" by Su Shi,

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,250
"Lonely grave a thousand miles off.
Cold thoughts, where can I talk them out?

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,080
Even if we met, you wouldn't know me,

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,660
dust on my face, hair like frost."

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,660
It conveys the sorrow of time passing

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,290
and the grief

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,870
of being separated by life and death
when they meet again.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,830
Understand,

12
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,750
class?

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,950
That's okay.

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,370
Have you heard of

15
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,910
the saying "a broken mirror restored"?

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,250
Yes.

17
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,370
I see.

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,120
You know the story behind it?

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Jiang Tian.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,410
Let's see if you know.

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,450
It's based on Princess Lechang
from the Southern Dynasty.

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,450
She was forced to part
from her husband.

23
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,330
Before they separated,
they broke a mirror

24
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,870
and kept half each.

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,830
Years later,

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,540
they reunited because of that mirror

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,250
and spent the rest
of their lives together.

28
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,160
But behind this beautiful story,

29
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,870
there's a deep meaning.

30
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,700
You're home.

31
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,660
Welcome home.

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,000
For the decades they were apart,

33
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,370
they could only look at
their half of the mirror,

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,040
cherishing the best memories.

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,750
After reuniting,

36
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,870
the mirror

37
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,950
no longer reflected
their vibrant youth and beauty,

38
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,160
but only the pale moonlight

39
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,080
of time passing.

sleep like this the whole night?

54
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,290
No way. I'm not a corpse.

55
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,410
Oh, right.

56
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,580
Mr. Sun...

57
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,620
Whoa!

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,120
Who put the ball here?

59
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,080
What's going on?

60
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,950
Come on.

61
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,160
It wasn't me.

62
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,700
What's going on, guys?

63
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,660
We have so many beds here.

64
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,200
Why are you sleeping together?

65
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
Wait.

66
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,790
You just got back yesterday.

67
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,500
Why are you back today?

68
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,000
The mock exam is coming up.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,660
So Shi and I thought

70
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,080
we should study together
while you two star students

71
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,450
are still in the dorm, right?

72
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,340
Wait.

73
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,910
That is not the point.

74
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,830
The point is...

75
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,820
The point is that a thief broke in
last night. Do you know?

76
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,290
A thief?

77
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,540
Oh, yeah.

78
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,120
I heard the guys in Room 308
talking about it.

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,450
The whole floor was robbed.

80
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,250
And, I even saw a shadow.

81
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,500
A shadow?

82
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,830
Yeah, it was pretty blurry.

83
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,790
Not sure if it was a person or a ghost.

84
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,750
Ghost?

85
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,370
Gao, seriously?

86
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,540
Did they catch anyone?

87
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,040
Was it a thief or a ghost?

88
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,830
How could they catch someone so soon?

89
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,250
We only called the police last night.

90
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,660
The dorm supervisor

91
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,620
told us to be careful these days.

92
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,950
We could switch rooms or bunk together

93
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,330
for safety and support.

94
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,250
Shi.

95
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,160
Let's share a bed.

96
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,660
This is not a joke.

97
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,120
This is serious.
What if there's a ghost?

98
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,250
No, no, no. No way.

99
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,450
But I'm scared.

100
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,200
I'm more scared of you.

101
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,290
Please, I'm begging you.

102
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,450
- Gao Tianyang...
- Just say yes.

103
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,290
Have you heard about it?

104
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,830
A thief broke into
the boys' dorm last night.

105
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,040
For real?

106
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,450
That's not true.

107
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,950
Actually, it was a ghost.

108
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,330
They say a shadow appeared

109
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,370
in the middle of the night.

110
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,800
The dorm supervisor
didn't want to scare us,

111
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,620
so he said it was a thief.

112
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,290
No wonder I always hear crying at night.

113
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's sleep together.

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,200
Yeah, let's sleep together.

115
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,330
I'm scared.

116
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,120
Don't leave me behind.

117
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,250
Get up.

118
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,950
It's morning.

119
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,120
Oh, man.

120
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,040
You kept me up all night.

121
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,870
Come on.

122
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,000
The thief hasn't been caught yet.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,080
Once they catch him,
I'll sleep in my bed.

124
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,950
Right?

125
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,420
Morning.

126
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,290
Morning.

127
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,290
Morning.

128
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,120
Can't believe bed-sharing
has become a trend.

129
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,580
You're one to talk?

130
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,950
Aren't you two doing the same thing?

131
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,450
I'm not.

132
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,830
I'll go back soon.

133
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,000
The doctor said my ankle is healed,

134
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,410
so I can sleep on the top bunk.

135
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,920
It stinks.

136
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,290
I just changed it yesterday.

137
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,700
Alright.

138
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,910
I'm going to the bathroom.

139
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,700
Or are you scared

140
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,950
and want me to sleep with you?

141
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,000
Whatever.

142
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,290
Whatever?

143
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,410
You're okay with that?

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,290
Well, I'm not.

145
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,410
I'm going to my bed.

146
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,450
Going to my bed.

147
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Hello, long time no see.

148
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,160
Sheng Wang.

149
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,170
Huh?

150
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
What's wrong with you?

151
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,950
Tian,

152
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,580
you've gotten cheeky.

153
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,750
Have I?

154
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,500
Haven't you?

155
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,290
Whoa!

156
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,450
That's sudden.

157
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,040
Shi Yu, are you done yet?

158
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,950
Cut your turn short.
Let me have a go.

159
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,290
Whoa.

160
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,790
Everyone.

161
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,910
Let me wrap up with a few things
before class ends.

162
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,080
First, I'm sure you've heard

163
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,540
that this mock exam will follow
a new class transition system.

164
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,540
Previously,

165
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,700
the bottom three had to leave the class.

166
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,330
But this time,

167
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,700
it's even tougher.

168
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,660
Jing, what's the new rule?

169
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
The new rule is

170
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,330
that only 30 students
will stay in your class.

171
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,000
Those in the top 30 on the exam

172
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,500
can stay in Class A.

173
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,750
The rest will move to other classes.

174
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,700
Quiet down.

175
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,080
Don't get too excited.

176
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,750
Yeah.

177
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,370
I'm so excited. I'm gonna die.

178
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,330
Xu Tianshu.

179
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,580
Yes, Jing.

180
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,450
At least stay alive long
to hear me finish.

181
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,660
No problem, Jing.

182
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,790
If you don't want to fail

183
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,330
and want to stay in Class A,

184
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,540
the next few days are crucial.

185
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,330
Front row,

186
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,700
come and get today's English test papers.

187
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,370
Starting today,

188
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,200
there'll be an extra
test paper every day.

189
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,950
Now, I'm gonna die.

190
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,540
I was always the lucky fourth-from-last.

191
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,500
I'll be straight
in the elimination zone this time.

192
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,000
Well, don't die yet.

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,250
I'm almost in the elimination zone too.

194
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,150
You? In the elimination zone?

195
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,330
You're just passing through.

196
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,250
Look,

197
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,540
since you transferred here,

198
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,660
when have your grades
not been insanely high?

199
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,160
I haven't taken a test since my injury.

200
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,540
I'm a bit rusty now.

201
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,750
So I'm not passing through.

202
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,290
Don't worry. If you leave,

203
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,540
I'll join you, buddy.

204
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,500
Okay.

205
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,790
Just kidding.

206
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll find you a buddy.

207
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,330
Next, another announcement.

208
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,700
As you all know,
the students in our class,

209
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,200
Li Yu, Qi Jiahao, Sheng Wang,
and Jiang Tian

210
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,080
represented our school
in the citywide English competition.

211
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,700
The results are now in.

212
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,290
You didn't do it well?

213
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,500
No idea.

214
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,660
You and Tian probably
have the best shot at an award.

215
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,700
- Here are two certificates
- Jing didn't give you any hints?

216
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,660
- for the first and second prizes.
- She did.

217
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,500
We handed in early.

218
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,870
- Guess which student in our class
- She said

219
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,200
got the second prize

220
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,410
she'll deal with us later.

221
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,790
and who got the first?

222
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,950
They did pretty well this time.

223
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,660
It's definitely between you and Tian.

224
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,450
First, congratulations
to our English expert,

225
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,450
Qi Jiahao,

226
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,830
for getting the second prize.

227
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,120
You did pretty well

228
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,620
with a steady performance. Applause.

229
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,500
What's going on?

230
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,580
One of you didn't win?

231
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,540
Next up,

232
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,750
congratulations to

233
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,200
Li Yu, our class monitor.

234
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,290
You really surprised me this time.

235
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,370
Well done.

236
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,540
So,

237
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,500
a steady performance

238
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,800
- Neither of you won an award?
- can earn you a good result.

239
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,580
But four students
attended the competition.

240
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,540
What about Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian?

241
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,620
I've told you guys

242
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,500
so many times,

243
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,370
don't hand in your papers early!

244
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,790
You know what?

245
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,410
Don't get too cocky,

246
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,410
or there'll be consequences.

247
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,410
So why didn't Sheng Wang
and Jiang Tian win this time?

248
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,290
Actually,

249
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,450
they've advanced to the next round.

250
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,160
That's right, they both made it

251
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,950
into the top 20 for the training camp.

252
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,200
After the training camp,

253
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,620
they'll compete in the final.

254
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,950
If they place in the final,

255
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,750
they'll get provincial awards.

256
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,000
Even if they don't,

257
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,660
they'll still receive Excellence Awards.

258
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,330
Jiang Tian ranked 11th,

259
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,500
and Sheng Wang ranked fifth.

260
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,410
They were only

261
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,000
two points apart.

262
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,910
The ones between them were all

263
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,750
from No.1 Senior High School.

264
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,410
No worries though.

265
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,330
They've already secured
early admission to university,

266
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,330
one each.

267
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,290
Both of them

268
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,450
made it.

269
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,040
Fifth in the province!

270
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,940
Number five!

271
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,830
Five and eleven. Eleven and five.

272
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,700
Hey, Jing.

273
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,620
Weren't you going to settle things
with me and Jiang Tian?

274
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,790
Settle what?

275
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,620
Don't play innocent
after taking advantage.

276
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,410
Sheng, you're amazing.

277
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,790
Tell me, which god do you worship?

278
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,250
And what do you like to eat?

279
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,250
I want to try it and be like you.

280
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,660
Alright, everyone.

281
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,580
It's time for self-study.

282
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,540
Everyone!

283
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,080
One, two, three.

284
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,000
Sheng! Tian!

285
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,250
Number five and number eleven.

286
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,540
Nice!

287
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,390
(Class 2A)
Go back to your studies.

288
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,620
Class dismissed.

289
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,870
Students on duty,
please collect the rackets.

290
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,410
- Class is over!
- Collect the rackets.

291
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,450
Go get changed. We need to go.

292
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,410
Okay.

293
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,450
Something wrong?

294
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,660
Oh, nothing.

295
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,950
What are you doing?

296
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,790
Let's go.

297
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,180
- Get changed.
- Okay.

298
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,500
Hey.

299
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,830
Do you remember?

300
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,160
We walked this way
at the start of the school year.

301
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,830
We were heading to the café then too.

302
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,450
How should we pronounce
that café's name?

303
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,450
I still don't know.

304
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,580
"Alors".

305
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,450
It's French.

306
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,330
French?

307
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,910
It means "so".

308
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,620
I guess they wanted to convey

309
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,410
the idea of living in the moment.

310
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,580
Living in the moment...

311
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,540
And then, you brought up
living in the dorm,

312
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,040
and now you've really done it.

313
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,040
You too.

314
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,910
Where's Jiang Tian?

315
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,950
Tian?

316
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,250
- Where's Tian?
- He wasn't here earlier.

317
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,700
I didn't see him before we left school.

318
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,950
- Yeah.
- Me neither.

319
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,870
Don't worry. He's not a kid.

320
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,290
He knows Xi and Linzi well.

321
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,330
He'll make it on his own.

322
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,420
Let's go.

323
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,200
Wait, I need to use the restroom.

324
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,370
Sheng,

325
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,830
you're not ditching us
to avoid paying, right?

326
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,690
What are you talking about?

327
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,040
Sheng is not that kind of person.

328
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,120
Sheng.

329
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,960
Where is he?

330
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,620
How is that possible?

331
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,000
Come on, Sheng, don't hide.

332
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,040
How could he be down there?

333
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,620
Seriously, it's okay. Just come out.

334
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,410
Maybe you can go down and check.

335
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,500
- Just go down.
- But what if I can't come back up?

336
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,660
- The view's beautiful though.
- Yeah.

337
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,330
Did you bring your camera today?

338
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,040
Hold on a sec.

339
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,080
Let's sneak a group photo
while Sheng isn't here.

340
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,290
But it's just like last time.

341
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,080
Alright. One, two, three.

342
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,380
I'm sorry.

343
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,750
Excuse me, have you seen Jiang Tian?

344
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,370
Oh, thanks.

345
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,870
Excuse me, have you seen Jiang Tian?

346
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,540
- No.
- Oh, thanks.

347
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,870
Hey, did you see Jiang Tian?

348
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,040
I think I saw him

349
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,330
still at the gym.

350
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,120
- The gym?
- Yeah.

351
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,910
- Oh, thanks.
- No problem.

352
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,750
Jiang Tian.

353
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,410
What are you looking for?

354
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,750
Just some stuff.

355
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,580
Don't forget we have dinner with Xi.

356
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,700
What are you looking for? I can help.

357
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,000
Why should I tell you?

358
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,660
I...

359
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,000
I thought we were friends.

360
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,080
No need.

361
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,790
It's dirty.

362
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
What are you looking for?

363
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,370
No need.

364
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,080
Come on. Just tell me.

365
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,200
I can help you.

366
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,250
It's okay.

367
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,790
The wallet.

368
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,500
Sheng, you're amazing.

369
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,910
Tell me, which god do you worship?

370
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,330
And what do you like to eat?

371
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,300
I want to try it and be like you.

372
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,870
Class dismissed.

373
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,870
Students on duty,
please collect the rackets.

374
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,830
Something wrong?

375
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,330
Oh, nothing.

376
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,620
So,

377
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,660
you're helping me?

378
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,620
Why?

379
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,700
I thought there must be
something important in it.

380
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,200
Maybe a lucky charm?

381
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,030
But it's kind of silly

382
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,870
to pin your hopes

383
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,830
on something random.

384
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,620
But then it occurred to me,

385
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,410
what if you dropped out of the top 30

386
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,200
without that stuff?

387
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,120
Actually,

388
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,080
it's not a lucky charm.

389
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,950
Found it.

390
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,580
Is this it?

391
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,830
Check if it is still in there.

392
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,370
I forgot.

393
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,370
You're so picky and delicate.

394
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,830
You probably don't want it

395
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,660
now that we've found it here.

396
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,040
Give it to me.

397
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,370
It's dirty.

398
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,130
It's in here.

399
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,500
Thanks.

400
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,790
Hey! We are in here!

401
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,750
The guard probably didn't notice us.

402
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,160
So he locked the door.

403
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,450
What should we do now?

404
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,910
I'll see if there's a tool to open it.

405
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,450
Why not just call them?

406
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,450
No signal?

407
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,000
No wonder you didn't text me back.

408
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,540
Didn't Sheng just go to the bathroom?

409
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,370
- Why's he taking so long?
- Yeah.

410
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,790
Did he really run away?

411
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Hey.

412
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,080
Just kidding. Don't be mad again.

413
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,500
You just said he wouldn't do that.

414
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,830
What are you guys doing?

415
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,250
We're waiting for Sheng.

416
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,250
Sheng Wang won't come.

417
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,250
How do you know?

418
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,040
I saw him heading to the classroom,

419
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,000
probably for the evening self-study.

420
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,970
I'll go. Bye.

421
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,730
- Impossible.
- For the self-study?

422
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,750
Yeah. We said we'd
go to the café together.

423
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,370
So now,

424
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,410
the fact is that Sheng is missing,

425
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,120
and we don't know if Tian will come.

426
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,250
Should we wait for them?

427
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,580
Maybe I'll give Sheng a call.

428
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,750
Yeah.

429
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,280
Your call will be forwarded
to voicemail.

430
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,870
It's going to voicemail.

431
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,580
Maybe you can call Xi and let him know.

432
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,500
Okay.

433
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,160
Jenny won't come today?

434
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,160
She said the students wouldn't
have any fun if she's here.

435
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,080
Students are always
afraid of their teachers.

436
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,750
It's always been like that.

437
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,620
But why are we joining them?

438
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,950
Do we look like teachers?

439
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,700
You don't. That's for sure.

440
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,620
I'm glad that I don't.

441
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,120
If I do, that wouldn't be good.

442
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,910
Like Big Mouth Xu?

443
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,500
No way.

444
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,040
Hello?

445
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,660
What?

446
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,700
They are not here.

447
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,750
Okay. Got it.

448
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,040
I'll let you know as soon
as I get any news.

449
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,120
What's wrong?

450
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,620
Jiang Tian and Sheng Wang are missing.

451
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,950
The students can't find them.

452
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,910
I'll go find them.

453
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,290
I'll come with you.

454
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,910
What should we do?

455
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,370
There's no signal.

456
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,830
Oh, it's gone.

457
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,500
Don't move.

458
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,380
What's wrong?

459
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,870
Jiang... Jiang Tian,

460
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,910
what are you going to do?

461
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,080
There's a big cockroach behind you.

462
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,790
I've got it.

463
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,620
Now, slowly move towards me.

464
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,590
Sheng...

465
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,370
Did... Did you get it?

466
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,210
Got it.

467
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,870
Sheng Wang. Jiang Tian.

468
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,540
What's going on?

469
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,370
We lost something here,

470
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,330
and while searching for it,

471
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,660
the guard accidentally locked the door.

472
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,620
Thankfully, the students called us

473
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,750
to look for you.

474
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,660
Or you'd have been

475
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,250
stuck here all night.

476
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,080
Glad you're okay.

477
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,750
- Linzi.
- Yeah?

478
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,120
Text the guys that we've found them.

479
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,410
Everyone must be starving by now.

480
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,870
I'm starving.

481
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,790
Let's go eat.

482
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,750
Let's go.

483
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,040
Did you order?

484
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,120
Yeah, it's all ready.

485
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Just waiting for you two.

486
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,080
It's all my fault.

487
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,920
Let's go.

488
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,080
Let's toast with tea.

489
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,540
Congrats to Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian
on making the English competition final.

490
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,380
Cheers.

491
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,870
Cheers!

492
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,580
Next time, whoever gets good grades,

493
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,500
I'll treat.

494
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,540
Yay!

495
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,160
Go, Sheng! Go, Tian!

496
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,330
Cheers. Go, go, go!

497
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,330
Go, go, go!

498
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,540
Drink up.

499
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,830
So, drink it all, guys.

500
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,290
Wow, it looks delicious.

501
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,680
Drink up.

502
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,410
Drink up. Cheers. Cheers.

503
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,370
I'll go get more food.

504
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,630
It's just green tea.

505
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,450
Or what else do you want?

506
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,750
Where did Linzi go?

507
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,410
He went to get more food,

508
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,580
'cause you might eat it all.

509
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,790
That's over the top.

510
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,080
We're not bottomless pits.

511
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,410
Besides, there are girls here.

512
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,000
They girls always on a diet,

513
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,580
fasting,

514
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,540
or doing cleanses.

515
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,120
They won't eat much.

516
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,080
Cleanses? I'll clean your clock.

517
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,160
You hit me too hard.

518
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,040
So what?

519
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,700
What? Are you going to hit a girl?

520
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,750
Our class monitor is here.

521
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,790
Alright, alright.

522
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,750
You don't need to fast or do cleanses.

523
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,160
You eat more than all the guys.
Is that okay?

524
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,330
You are a big eater!

525
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,830
- You idiot!
- She will kill him.

526
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,290
You're quite popular, huh?

527
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,250
Me?

528
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,910
What's that mean?

529
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,200
A girl's chasing a guy around

530
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,250
just because he said she eats more
than the boys in front of you.

531
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,080
Why do you think that is?

532
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,500
You troublemaker.

533
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,160
What does it have to do with me?

534
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:07,950
Whoa. Whoa.

535
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,910
Let's call a truce. I'm starving.

536
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,000
- Let's have a bite, shall we?
- Watch your words.

537
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,500
Eat and drink all you want.

538
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,750
Sheng Wang's treating today.

539
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,040
- Right, it's on me. Help yourselves.
- Thanks, Sheng!

540
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,330
Thanks, Sheng!

541
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,460
Hey, Gao,

542
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,410
being chased by Little Pepper
is better than by Big Mouth Xu, right?

543
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,040
- Exactly.
- That's true.

544
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,830
Sorry, Little Mouth.
Didn't mean to insult your dad.

545
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,040
Haha.

546
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,040
Oh, it's fine.

547
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,330
When I was out and about,

548
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,580
I always cut ties with my family first.

549
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,950
And I heard

550
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,660
he caught someone
sneaking online last time.

551
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,870
And Xu took him to his office,

552
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,250
he had a black plastic bag
over his head.

553
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,450
That's not even the scariest one.

554
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,660
When I was helping a teacher
with grading in the office,

555
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,080
I heard that two students from
the next-door class were caught dating.

556
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,160
And his dad called both parents
to arrange a marriage.

557
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
They both got scared
and broke up on the spot.

558
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,410
Arranging a marriage?

559
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,290
Yeah.

560
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,290
That's crazy.

561
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,130
Yeah.

562
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,750
From today on, he's not my dad.

563
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,450
Don't call me Little Mouth Xu anymore.

564
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,790
Call me...

565
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,000
Little Veg Xu.

566
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,200
Little Veg Xu?

567
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:08,770
Little Veg Xu.

568
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,750
Little Pepper.

569
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,910
Do you want to eat this?

570
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,340
Here you are.

571
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,200
Thank you.

572
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,120
Hey, Xi.

573
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,250
Smiling so sneakily,

574
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,830
did you have any scandalous stories
in high school?

575
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,750
Like what?

576
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,410
Like secretly

577
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,330
dating someone?

578
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,720
Did you?

579
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,210
I knew it!

580
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,160
I will

581
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,370
share this objectively and rationally.

582
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,910
- Are you going to lecture now?
- That's boring.

583
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,540
- Yeah.
- Motivational quotes?

584
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,040
So serious.

585
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,080
Such a buzzkill.

586
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,950
- Stop that.
- Okay.

587
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,080
I admit it.

588
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,950
When I was a student,

589
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,790
I secretly fell in love.

590
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,250
See?

591
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,830
But

592
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,410
it was unrequited love.

593
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,370
Oh, hold on.

594
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,620
It was unrequited love, and then?

595
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,950
- Yeah, then what?
- Yeah.

596
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,580
And because of that, my grades dropped,

597
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,620
almost giving the class advisor
a heart attack.

598
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,290
So you were in love while studying?

599
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,750
I didn't know that before.

600
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,590
Is that so?

601
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,450
Yeah, I heard you received

602
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,200
love letters every day in college.

603
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,450
Speaking of which,

604
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,160
my dad once said

605
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,160
that Xi was already
a heartthrob in high school.

606
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,080
- School heartthrob, huh?
- Aren't you cutting ties with your dad?

607
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,330
Yeah. Call me Little Veg Xu now.

608
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,660
Alright, let's see.

609
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,080
Oh, now I saw that

610
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,800
Song Sirui didn't change
his underwear this morning.

611
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,120
Get out!

612
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,410
Let's play truth or dare.

613
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,660
Okay.

614
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,250
Mr. Zhao,

615
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,950
how many girlfriends have you had?

616
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,120
Hoe many? How many?

617
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,790
50? 40?

618
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,910
It's a secret.

619
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,000
Come on.

620
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,410
Just tell us.

621
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,540
Xi!

622
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,950
Xi, let me help you with this.

623
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,770
This is almost done.

624
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,300
- Careful. It's hot.
- I'll flip it over.

625
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,080
A secret, huh?

626
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,620
Sirui, why didn't you
change your underwear?

627
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,160
Please don't be so tacky.

628
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,120
I did change.

629
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,160
(Alors Cafe)
I was just kidding.

630
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,200
I just happened to guess right.

631
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,060
(Cool in winter, warm in summer,
with outdoor seating.)

632
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,500
Look at Xi.

633
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,700
He didn't let me pay the bill.

634
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,700
But speaking of it,

635
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,450
it's great to have
a big brother like him.

636
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,500
So in that case,

637
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,750
you are my big brother, too.

638
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,170
What is it?

639
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,040
Suddenly want to write a lyrical essay?

640
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,410
No.

641
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,370
It's just that every time
I see the moon,

642
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,700
this melody comes to mind.

643
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,790
Maybe it's because

644
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,080
my mom loved the moon

645
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,790
and also loved Teresa Teng.

646
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,750
Life has its ups and downs,

647
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,830
just like the moon waxes and wanes.

648
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,790
It feels like everything
connected to the moon is sad

649
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
and full of regret.

650
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,290
The moon shines on Earth every day,

651
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,950
but only lights up half of it.

652
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,500
Is that half

653
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,000
a kind of eternity?

654
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,200
I don't agree with that.

655
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,250
I think the moon often symbolizes

656
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,160
light and hope.

657
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,660
So even if it's only half,

658
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:26,160
or just a moment, a second,

659
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,750
as long as it's imprinted in your mind,

660
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,370
it's eternal.

661
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,700
And you know what?

662
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,000
My mom really loved the moon.

663
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,000
When I was young, she often took me
to read books about the moon.

664
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,410
I've forgotten the author,

665
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,830
but the book was called
"The Moon and Sixpence".

666
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,250
After reading it, she asked Dad and me,

667
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:54,040
"Would you choose to look up at the moon

668
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,790
or down at the sixpence?"

669
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,500
My dad said

670
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,660
he thought the moon was too distant

671
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,250
and chose to look at the sixpence.

672
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,410
But later, my mom secretly told me

673
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,160
she hoped I'd choose

674
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,200
the moon for her.

675
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,500
At the time, I didn't understand.

676
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,620
If it were up to you,

677
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,250
would you choose the moon

678
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,660
or the sixpence?

679
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,290
At our age, isn't it too...

680
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,620
What's the line in that poem?

681
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,950
"For composing new poems
I was forced to talk of sorrow."

682
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:36,790
Yes.

683
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,620
Why think about that?

684
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,540
But,

685
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,290
I would choose the moon.

686
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,950
Look at this.

687
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,750
Haven't played it for a long time.

688
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,830
Your ankle just healed,
and you're acting up again.

689
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,000
Are you okay?

690
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,750
It might be a recurring issue.

691
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,790
Go sit over there.

692
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:20,870
- Over there.
- Where?

693
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,200
Just sit here quietly.

694
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,160
I'll take the late-night snack
to Old Man Ding.

695
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,000
- I'm fine. I'll rest later...
- Sit here.

696
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,660
Look at your moon.

697
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,910
I'll be back soon.

698
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,120
"From a wine pot amidst the flowers,

699
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,500
I drink alone without partners.

700
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,120
To invite the moon I raise my cup.

701
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,200
We're three, as my shadow shows up."

702
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,870
You majored in Western history.

703
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,200
How come you're reciting a Tang poetry?

704
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,830
I could recite a Shakespearean poem

705
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,750
about the moon for you.

706
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
Forget it.

707
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,830
I'd better not cast pearls before swine

708
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,330
and spoil tonight's beautiful moon.

709
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,250
So to you,

710
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,950
I'm just a swine?

711
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,750
Yeah.

712
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,500
You know your position pretty well.

713
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,580
That's true.

714
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,290
You're more interesting and talented.

715
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,790
No wonder Yang Jing likes you.

716
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,750
Do you like Yang Jing?

717
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,160
Why do you think I like Yang Jing?

718
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,620
Because you talk about her all the time.

719
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,790
That's because...

720
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,830
What?

721
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,620
Because of what?

722
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,200
Because she wants to test you

723
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,620
to see if you're interested in her.

724
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,450
So do you like Yang Jing?

725
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,540
Give me your answer.

726
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,790
But...

727
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,120
But it was nothing.

728
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,750
Nothing?

729
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,710
Yeah.

730
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,870
It was just four lips touching.
That's all.

731
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,690
It's just four lips touching.
