00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,620
You need to release your feelings.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,330
Be open,

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,580
open yourself up,

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,700
and let everything flow out.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,700
Let your feelings, thoughts, and emotions

00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,410
splash out like paint.

00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,450
Lyrical writing

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,950
is about expressing your inner emotions

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,540
and resonating with others.

10
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,500
How could you make it so rigid
like practical writing,

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,450
huh?

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,160

Guide to Lyrical Writing.

14
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,750

Any issues these past few days?

19
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,660
Not really, no issues.

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,870
You know what?

21
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,080
I'll take you to a place.

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,160
That place is...

23
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,700
Just follow me.

24
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,040
Hey, tell me where it is.

25
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,200
I'll just take you there.

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,290
There's a lot of cool stuff.

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,370
Okay.

28
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,660

Hello?

42
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,250
Hey, are you sleeping?

43
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,910
I was, until you woke me up.

44
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,790
So, did you finish that question?

45
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,620
Wow, you're amazing.

46
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,200
You know what? All my seniors
are still working on it.

47
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,130
I didn't.

48
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,660
You didn't?

49
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,620
So, what were you doing?

50
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,040
Watching a family drama.

51
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,660
A family drama?

52
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,330
What's going on?

53
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,040
It's nothing special.

54
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Someone just moved in next door.

55
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,160
Out of courtesy,

56
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,620
I have to call him "big brother".

57
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,330
"Big brother"?

58
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,450
So, you actually called him that?

59
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,370
No.

60
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,830
I've always been quite impolite.

61
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,830
That's right.

62
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,250
Then you can let the dog out to bite him.

63
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,540
Right, you have a dog.

64
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,410
Lend me your dog.

65
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,700
No way.

66
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,450
My puppy's teeth are precious.

67
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,620
They shouldn't bite others.

68
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,460
Well...

69
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,500
Never mind.

70
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,660
As long as he doesn't bother me

71
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,580
or disturb my studies,

72
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,160
I'll be fine with it.

73
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,950
I'll work on the question.

74
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,160
Wait, hold on.

75
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,910
You said

76
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,160
you should call
the next-door guy "big brother",

77
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,000
so he must be older than you.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,250
Why not let him try the question?

79
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,040
If he can solve it, great.

80
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,250
If not, it'll knock him

81
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,080
down a peg and scare him a bit.

82
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,160
Not bad, huh?

83
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,500
I think this is a good idea.

84
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,750
Then that's it.

85
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,580
Problem solved, now stop bothering me.

86
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,830
Alright, I'm going to sleep.

87
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,790
Bye.

88
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,000
Hey, Crab...

89
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,790
Come on.

90
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,080
Give me the answer you promised.

91
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,160
You really want me to lose sleep over this?

92
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,290
I'll definitely figure it out.

93
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,140
(The ratio of the centripetal force Fa
for object A to Fb for object B.)

94
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,200
Is he sure to solve it?

95
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,060

96
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,630
Mom.

97
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,540
It's not that I can't do it.

98
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,200
It's just beyond what I've learned so far.

99
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,870
And

100
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,200
I'm being magnanimous.

101
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,580
Since we are living together,

102
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,500
we can't stay at odds forever.

103
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,910
Your dear Wang

104
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,200
will use this question

105
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,330
to break the ice.

106
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,620
What am I doing?

107
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,620
What am I doing now?

108
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,330
Whatever, just forget it.

109
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,250
Many students won't solve it either.

110
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,330
I won't be the only one.

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,120
No. I'll go ask him.

112
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,540
What are you doing at my door?

113
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,450
I'm waiting.

114
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,160
What am I doing?

115
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,450
What am I doing now?

116
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,830
You're waiting? For what?

117
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,830
What do you want?

118
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,250
I should be asking you that.

119
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,790
You were pacing around my door,

120
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,330
and your footsteps were loud.

121
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,250
It's none of your business.

122
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,830
What do you want?

123
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,450
Well...

124
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,310
Actually...

125
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,290
Return my pen.

126
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,290
You took it today.

127
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,130
Give it back.

128
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,500
Anything else?

129
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,090
No.

130
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,290
Why did I do this?

131
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,330
He didn't see my test paper, did he?

132
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,830
I hope not.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,870
Morning.

134
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,700
Sit. Have some breakfast.

135
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,200
Ms. Sun isn't here today.
I made some plain porridge.

136
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,910
Is plain porridge okay for you?

137
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,120
Okay.

138
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,120
Wang,

139
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,950
your dad's got an early flight today.

140
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,660
He went to Thailand for gift authorization

141
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,080
and asked me to let you know.

142
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,400
Here.

143
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,790
Tian moved in yesterday.

144
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,750
You two should chat more when you have time

145
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,200
and get to know each other better.

146
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,250
Tian.

147
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,290
Where are you going?
Aren't you going with Wang?

148
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,870
I've got stuff to do at school.

149
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,160
It's okay.

150
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm not very good with people.

151
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,410
Because of Dad's job,

152
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,750
I move a lot.

153
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,080
People always see me as an outsider.

154
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's okay.

155
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,790
Ji Huanyu transferred the money to me.

156
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,870
I'll transfer it to you later.

157
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,040
Oh, okay.

158
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,450
Ji Huanyu?

159
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,330
See you.

160
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,750
Ji Huanyu is Tian's father.

161
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,910
Have your breakfast.

162
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,370
I'll go get another dish.

163
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,950
Oh, I just remembered.

164
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,410
I haven't finished
my science test paper.

165
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,330
I have to go.

166
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,540
But you haven't had your breakfast...

167
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,500
What do you want?

168
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,120
You're welcome.

169
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,290
But the key is the last line.

170
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,750
Mind your own business.

171
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,950
What do you mean?

172
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,000
Are you talking about me
stopping you yesterday?

173
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,620
If I hadn't intervened and stopped you,

174
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,200
where would you have gone that late?

175
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,160
Mind my own business?

176
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,620
I don't need your stupid answer.

177
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,000
Hey, Tian.

178
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,290
Tian!

179
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,520
Tian!

180
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,860
Can we see your answer

181
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,450
to the last question?

182
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,870
We've got three different answers,

183
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,120
and we're not sure about any of them.

184
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,290
Can we see yours?

185
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,700
Oh, my.

186
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,580
A fourth answer.

187
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,450
Should we correct ours?

188
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,790
Of course.

189
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,290
Tian's answers are always right.

190
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,000
And...

191
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,290
The seventh question?

192
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,250
- No, the ninth question.
- I got an E too.

193
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,760
Let's see the ninth question.

194
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:18,980
Did you get it right?

195
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,140
Did I...

196
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,130
I got it wrong.

197
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,250
If it's wrong, it's wrong.

198
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,470
Why do you keep

199
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,850
correcting it?

200
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,130
Then go away. Do it yourself.

201
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,410
That's right.

202
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,510
You're amazing.

203
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,520
Alright, done.

204
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,280
I only correct the last one.

205
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,660
Sheng Wang!

206
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,500
Sorry.

207
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,000
By the way,

208
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,370
we'll have Miss Fortune's class next.

209
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,910
You haven't had her class before, right?

210
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,910
Miss Fortune?

211
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,250
Yes, our Mandarin teacher.

212
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,910
She's plump and does this when she talks,

213
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,410
like a fortune cat.

214
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,120
So we call her Miss Fortune.

215
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,000
What's her real name?

216
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,710
I forgot.

217
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,410
But how should I address her?

218
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,410
Just call her Miss Fortune.

219
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,000
Everyone does it. She doesn't mind.

220
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,200
Also, if you have any problems,

221
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,120
come to me. I've got your back.

222
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,960
Great.

223
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,330
Have you all received your test papers?

224
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,080
Yes.

225
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,040
I know, this exam was a bit tough.

226
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,870
The writing was easy to go off-topic,

227
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,290
and the average score

228
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,160
for the second reading
comprehension was low.

229
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,250
As for the poetry appreciation...

230
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,790
Never mind.

231
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,700
I never had much hope

232
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,080
for you to score well in this part,

233
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,120
but it can't be this bad.

234
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,870
Not even ten of you got it right
in the whole class.

235
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,750
But speaking of which,

236
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,080
I must commend

237
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,040
the new transfer student.

238
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,580
Where is he?

239
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,200
Look at Sheng Wang, guys.

240
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,000
He just transferred here

241
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,120
and hasn't even learned this so far,

242
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,040
but he's got a strong grasp of the basics.

243
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,950
He scored full marks in poetry appreciation

244
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,580
and reading comprehension.

245
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,450
His writing was excellent too.

246
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,910
Let's give him a round of applause.

247
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,580
But,

248
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,370
I do have a suggestion for you.

249
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,040
You need to improve your handwriting.

250
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,120
It doesn't have to be pretty,

251
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,410
but each character should stand upright,

252
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,830
not slouching.

253
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,540
It looks bad.

254
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,370
Sheng,

255
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,290
keep it up.

256
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,830
Chicken scratches, huh?

257
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,950
Keep it up.

258
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,330
Hey,

259
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,450
what's so funny?

260
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,000
At least he knows
how to answer the questions.

261
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,540
Unlike some of you,

262
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,410
whose lyrical essays

263
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,080
are as rigid as formulas.

264
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,370
Can you be a bit more expressive?

265
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,870
I won't say who that is.

266
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,080
Jiang Tian.

267
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,040
Now, let's look at the first
reading comprehension question.

268
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,330
I'm telling you.

269
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,750
Miss Fortune picks the one
who got it wrong.

270
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,790
What does that mean?

271
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,080
Jiang Tian.

272
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,540
Stand up.

273
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,660
What's the correct answer
to this question?

274
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,340
A.

275
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,410
Are you sure it's A?

276
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:48,250
Do you want to think it over?

277
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,120
D.

278
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,290
Alright, everyone,

279
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,290
what's the correct answer?

280
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,410
C.

281
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,080
The correct answer is C.

282
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,370
You need to understand the meaning
behind the words.

283
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,950
Be sensitive, okay?

284
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,950
Sit down.

285
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,540
Alright.

286
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,250
Let's look at the last
reading comprehension question.

287
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,330
It's on the second page.

288
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,700
Wang Youjun Pretends to Sleep.

289
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:33,410
Clearly, we know that Wang Youjun
is Wang Xizhi.

290
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,500
But why is he called Youjun?

291
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,910
Youjun isn't Wang Xizhi's given name
or pseudonym.

292
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,370
A friendly reminder.

293
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,160
Miss Fortune dismisses classes on time.

294
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,000
What does that mean?

295
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,330
We can get to the cafeteria on time.

296
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,750
As soon as the bell rings,

297
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,290
you should run.

298
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,410
Life is so tough for us.

299
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,710
- High school freshmen...
- Gao Tianyang.

300
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,250
Yes.

301
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,290
What did you say?

302
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,000
Nothing.

303
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,040
If so, why don't you share it with us?

304
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,080
I just said that

305
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,700
high school freshmen...

306
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,080
Louder. Repeat it three times.

307
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,830
I'll dismiss the class once you're done.

308
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,620
Come on. Say it.

309
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,410
I just said that

310
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,410
high school freshmen run faster than dogs.

311
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,160
High school freshmen run faster than dogs.

312
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,620
They run so fast.

313
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,620
Alright, sit down.

314
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,120
Copy the three classical texts
we covered today three times

315
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,700
and hand them to me
before the end of the day.

316
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,250
Class dismissed.

317
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,500
Thank you, ma'am.

318
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,170
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

319
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,330
Why didn't you two join them?

320
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,090
Huh?

321
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,400
W-We two?

322
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,950
Jiang is such a good student,

323
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,660
still working on his Mandarin test
after class.

324
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,910
Do you have any questions I can help with?

325
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,830
No.

326
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,950
It's okay.

327
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,500
I can help you out.

328
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,790
Ma'am, I'm going to have lunch.

329
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,200
Ma'am, I'm leaving too.

330
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,450
Correcting your English test
during my class?

331
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,450
See me in my office after school!

332
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,720
(Students' Cafeteria)

333
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,750
It's all Sheng Wang's fault.

334
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,910
He blocked my way.

335
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,500
Now I don't have a seat.

336
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,200
You ran slowly. Don't blame others.

337
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,870
Why don't you have a seat either?

338
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,080
Oh, right.

339
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,910
Your legs are short
and you can't run fast.

340
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,660
What's wrong with you?

341
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,540
Can't I tell the truth?

342
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,870
- Careful.
- You're annoying.

343
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,410
Gao Tianyang, you're being so unkind
to your classmates.

344
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,660
Exactly.

345
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,200
So my short legs are a joke now?

346
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,250
And you blamed Sheng Wang
for not knowing the cafeteria rules.

347
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,580
Is this how you look after
the new student?

348
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,040
Are you up to something?

349
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,370
That's nonsense.

350
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,950
Caring about a transfer student is normal.

351
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,910
Alright.

352
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,080
Then why don't you care about Qi Jiahao?

353
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,410
He's also a transfer student.

354
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,660
Qi Jiahao?

355
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,000
You mean the first-year student

356
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,330
who joined us because of good grades?

357
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That doesn't count.

358
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,410
Why not? He's also a transfer.

359
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,330
Fine. That counts.

360
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,790
But they're still different, okay?

361
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,080
Yesterday, only three students got

362
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,750
the second-to-last question
on the practice test right.

363
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,540
Qi Jiahao,

364
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,000
Sheng Wang, and Jiang Tian,

365
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,450
please stand up.

366
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,450
I should've copied Tian's answers
like you did.

367
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,410
I'm wondering

368
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,080
how the three of you ended
up with the exact same answer?

369
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,700
Did you really know it,

370
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,160
or did you just copy each other?

371
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,290
You three, come up one by one, solve it,
and explain it to the class.

372
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,950
Qi Jiahao, you go first.

373
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
Get up here.

374
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,790
Can't you do it?

375
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,620
Did you forget?

376
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,120
You can't even remember your own work?

377
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,290
Sheng Wang.

378
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,660
Jiang Tian.

379
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,410
Isn't Sheng Wang amazing?

380
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,330
He also copied it,

381
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,290
but he understood it soon after.

382
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,410
But Qi Jiahao didn't.

383
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,000
They're clearly not on the same level.

384
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,750
The reality is harsh, huh?

385
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,620
Yeah, the reality is harsh.

386
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,200
Eat more. Maybe you'll grow taller.

387
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,540
What? I can still eat.
You're eating so much.

388
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,040
Why are you eating my girlfriend's food?

389
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,370
I'm not your girlfriend.

390
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,410
You're disgusting.

391
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,370
You have your own food.

392
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,250
Eat your own food.

393
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,750
Your tofu looks tasty.

394
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,330
Wait, no.

395
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,660
He's the one who was caught doing
English during Mandarin class, not me.

396
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,450
Why am I following him?

397
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,540
Come on, the transfer student is
as handsome as Jiang Tian.

398
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,040
He's your type.

399
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,910
- Hey!
- I'm in love. What should I do?

400
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,000
That's not right.

401
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,870
The cafeteria's that way.
Where are you going?

402
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,580
You'll only get leftovers at this time.

403
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,620
Go ahead.

404
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,250
Hey.

405
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,830
Where are you going?

406
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,370
I'm talking to you. Can you hear me?

407
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,350
Jiang Tian. Jiang Tian.

408
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,370
Stop getting in the way.

409
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,540
Uncle Mute and I can handle it here.

410
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,660
I told you to close the shop,
but you won't.

411
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,790
You just had heart surgery.

412
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,620
At least let me help you.

413
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,250
My small setup can't handle
someone as grand as you.

414
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,120
You've been abroad for so long

415
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,790
without a girlfriend.

416
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,700
You turned down Miss Yang, and Western girls.

417
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,700
Who'll be your partner?

418
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,950
Western food?

419
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,370
How will you get married?

420
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,200
Marriage is just a promise on a certificate.

421
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,580
It's just a choice.

422
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,080
You are also single now.

423
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,120
I have Uncle Mute with me.

424
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,080
But what about you?

425
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,290
Who will be with you

426
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,370
and take care of you when you're old?

427
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,160
Stop quarreling.

428
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,540
I found a place nearby

429
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,950
and want to open a coffee shop.

430
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,580
It'll open in a few days.

431
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,410
If you're free, you can come.

432
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,250
I'm just an old man.

433
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,500
I'll embarrass you.

434
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,870
Your place is too fancy for me.

435
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,200
I didn't expect there to be

436
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,410
a convenience store on campus.

437
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,080
But it's too far from the classroom.

438
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,200
Do people come here often?

439
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,220
What kind of question is that?

440
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,290
Of course, people come.

441
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,160
Students who live on campus all come.

442
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,700
Oh.

443
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,750
You're bringing a classmate to eat?

444
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,250
He'll eat.

445
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,410
I won't.

446
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,290
- Is it your first time here?
- Yeah.

447
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,410
What do you want to eat?

448
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,330
What do you have?

449
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,120
Fish ball soup with A-gei?
[*A-gei: a local delicacy]

450
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,250
Okay.

451
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,120
A new classmate?

452
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,250
He's tall.

453
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,750
Yes, yes.

454
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,870
Kids these days

455
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,620
are growing up like giants
with good nutrition.

456
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,410
This new student is quite handsome.

457
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,200
Hey, boy, do you have a girlfriend?

458
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,080
Or are you like Jiang Tian,

459
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,410
always acting aloof
and scaring the girls away?

460
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,700
Are you close with the owner,
or do you come here often?

461
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,040
You eat over here.

462
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,790
Where are you going?

463
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,950
He's not eating here.

464
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,080
He eats off-campus.

465
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,330
Off-campus?

466
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,700
At the Little White House.

467
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,700
Do you know Little White House?

468
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,910
It used to be the school's staff dormitory.

469
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,790
A lot of old employees still live there.

470
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:01,000
Some kids from far away
also rent rooms there.

471
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,870
Oh, I see.

472
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,950
I used to live in Tamsui.

473
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,700
I'm starving.

474
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,880
What's wrong?

475
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,500
Can't you eat alone,

476
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,790
or is the food not good?

477
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,870
No, it's just...

478
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,000
I can't eat it.

479
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,450
You can't eat it?

480
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,660
Why? You have a spoon and chopsticks.

481
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,330
I... I don't eat cilantro.

482
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,120
Then you can just pick it out.

483
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,170
No, I can't stand

484
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,580
this sauce either.

485
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,250
But the sauce goes with the dish.

486
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,250
Try it.

487
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,200
But...

488
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,410
Do you have any hot sauce?

489
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,870
What a picky eater.

490
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,620
If you want hot sauce,
go to a Sichuan restaurant.

491
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,660
Why did you come here?

492
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,040
This is a specialty.

493
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,080
It's sour and sweet. Give it a try.

494
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,120
But it's weird...

495
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,040
What a spoiled young man.

496
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,200
I have to pick out the cilantro for you.

497
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,660
What do you think?

498
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,950
Does my fish ball soup with A-gei
taste as good as the other places?

499
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:18,580
You know what?

500
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,700
My convenience store

501
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,290
is a real old shop.

502
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,540
I've been running it for decades.

503
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,410
Yes. And it's not crowded here.

504
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,950
Right? Glad you like the food.

505
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,040
Okay. Money?

506
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,750
Oh, right.

507
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,670
Sir.

508
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,500
I think I forgot to bring the money.

509
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,790
You want to get a free meal?

510
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,080
No, no.

511
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,700
How much is it? I'll pay you tomorrow.

512
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,660
No.

513
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,750
Then I'll go back to
the classroom and get it.

514
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,870
Trying to run away?

515
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,660
No way.

516
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:02,950
What should I do?

517
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,450
What should you do?

518
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,410
I have to solve this for you, huh?

519
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,620
Mr. Zhao, what's going on?

520
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,700
Well,

521
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,250
bring some money over

522
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,250
and bail out your classmate
who's dining and dashing.

523
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,500
Or I won't let him go.

524
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,370
I'm sorry...

525
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,250
What? He...

526
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,660
Sir, you'd better just kill me.

527
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,080
No.

528
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,660
My small business

529
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,450
can't afford that.

530
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,330
Why do I keep running into trouble
with everyone named Jiang?

531
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,500
Do I have a grudge against them?

532
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,450
What are you mumbling about?

533
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,450
Why not do something useful?

534
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:58,250
Here.

535
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,700
Take down his phone number.

536
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,500
So next time you can't pay for your food,

537
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,250
I won't have to call him

538
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,870
to bail you out.

539
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,370
But...

540
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,870
What's wrong?

541
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,950
Even brothers
settle their accounts clearly.

542
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,870
You owe me for this phone call.

543
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,950
Yes.

544
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,290
Done.

545
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,870
Great.

546
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,830
The person to bail you out is here.

547
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,700
Good for you.

548
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,540
I left in a hurry

549
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,540
and forgot to take the money.

550
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,910
I didn't expect that I'd have

551
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,500
to escort you and pay for your food.

552
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,330
Mr. Zhao, how much is it?

553
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,000
Anything else you need?

554
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,000
Me?

555
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,330
Who else would it be, a ghost?

556
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
I want these. Thank you.

557
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,850
(Notification: You have a new contact ".".)

558
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,250
Who is this? A period?

559
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,250
What does that mean? Speechless?

560
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,370
Or do you know others
have nothing to say to you?

561
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,200
If you do this again, I'll kill you.

562
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,120
Oh.

563
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,290
Sorry.

564
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,500
I'm really sorry.

565
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,580
I won't make you angry again.

566
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,000
And I'll definitely keep my...

567
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,000
Distance.

568
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,500
You.

569
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,750
Yes?

570
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:14,910
I don't believe you.

571
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,900
A female instructor?

572
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:34,990
Is the photo genuine?

573
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,300
What if she's a middle-aged woman?

574
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,870
- What are you doing here...
- Hey, wait.

575
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,250
Close the door!

576
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,370
Sorry. Have some water and cool down.

577
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,750
Well...

578
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,830
I'll keep my distance.

579
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,450
You give it to him.

580
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,450
We need to change
for the P.E. class in the afternoon.

581
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,910
Changing is a hassle for the girls,

582
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,000
so our class has a fixed time at noon

583
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,750
for them to change in the classroom.

584
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,450
What other rules do you have?

585
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,500
No more rules.

586
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,200
If there are any,
I'll let you know afterward.

587
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,790
Keep moving.

588
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,950
Do it precisely.

589
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,000
Don't mess around.

590
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,660
Warm up properly,

591
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,500
or you might get injured.

592
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,040
During the school sports event,

593
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,700
each class must send representatives.

594
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,830
Everyone has a chance to participate.

595
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,040
Faster.

596
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,370
Are you alone?

597
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,700
Okay. I'll pair up with you.

598
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,520
Faster. Faster.

599
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,210
- I'm so tired.
- Move! Faster!

600
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,330
Excuse me, Mr. Wang.

601
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,830
The sports dean said

602
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,080
there's a meeting about
the sports event later.

603
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,950
Please come over.

604
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,250
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thanks.

605
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:21,410
Everyone, I'll go handle something.

606
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,700
You guys can have free time now.

607
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,950
Yay! Free time!

608
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:24,870
Free time!

609
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,120
But don't go too far.

610
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,950
Stay around here.

611
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,910
I'm exhausted. Lucky me, I don't have
to run in the mixed relay.

612
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,160
It's free time now.

613
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,620
What do you want to play?

614
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,040
Shouldn't we practice
for the mixed relay?

615
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,890
Forget about it.

616
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,080
Don't mess around.

617
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,160
What do you think?

618
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,120
Let's play basketball.

619
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,910
Or volleyball?

620
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:47,750
No, let's just disband here.

621
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,080
That's a good idea.

622
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,250
But, no.

623
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,290
What if Mr. Wang comes back?

624
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,580
We should have something prepared.

625
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,580
What should we play then?

626
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,120
Truth or dare.

627
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,700
Truth or dare?

628
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,330
Who said that?

629
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,630
Sounds good.

630
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,120
We haven't played it in a while.

631
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,870
And now we have a new student.

632
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:07,870
Sheng Wang.

633
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,620
Come join us.

634
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,700
Come on.

635
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,200
Let's play together.

636
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,290
What are we playing?

637
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,870
Truth or dare.

638
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,290
Do you want to play?

639
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,700
Or do you have some deep secrets?

640
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,120
I...

641
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,160
I don't have any.

642
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,580
So, you're in, right?

643
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,660
Game on.

644
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,700
Little Pepper. Lend me your hair tie.

645
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,580
Here.

646
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,910
Whoever the hair tie points to

647
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,290
will have to choose truth or dare.

648
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,250
Just like this.

649
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,870
- What's the color of your underwear?
- Red...

650
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,410
Hey, you have to spin it first.

651
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,370
Red! His underwear is red!

652
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Alright, just kidding.

653
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,870
You go first, okay?

654
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,410
Okay.

655
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,000
The game begins.

656
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,870
Truth or dare?

657
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:57,790
Alright.

658
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,540
I'll go with Truth.

659
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,410
Well...

660
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,580
You're new. I'll ask him something cool.

661
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,420
Okay.

662
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,500
Does Big Mouth Xu kiss your mom at home?

663
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,750
Have you seen it?

664
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,200
Why would Big Mouth Xu kiss his mom?

665
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,580
Big Mouth Xu is his dad.

666
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,910
That's why he's called Little Mouth Xu.

667
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,700
Answer the question.

668
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,870
How could I have seen that?

669
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,330
Have you seen your parents kiss?

670
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:25,080
Not seeing it means you haven't seen it.

671
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,540
So, they do kiss!

672
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,540
Impossible.

673
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,120
Big Mouth Xu is so open-minded.

674
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,290
Hey, do you want to be like your dad

675
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,330
and kiss in front of us?

676
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,540
- What are you doing?
- Kiss who?

677
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,790
I've answered a question.

678
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,200
It's my turn.

679
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,080
- Dare, please.
- Truth!

680
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,330
Let me kiss her.

681
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,080
Why? It's not my punishment.

682
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,080
Don't think about weird stuff.

683
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,450
Fine, I'll grant your wish.

684
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,660
- Dare it is.
- No!

685
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,370
Go tell Mr. Wang "I love you".

686
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:54,910
If you can't do it, then you'll be...

687
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,500
No need. It's just three words.

688
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,410
Check it out.

689
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,200
We need to confirm it again.

690
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,500
Mr. Wang.

691
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,950
I love you!

692
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,540
- Poor Mr. Wang.
- Is it okay?

693
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,620
Okay.

694
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,910
Wow, okay.

695
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,200
Alright, my turn.

696
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,250
That isn't spinning.

697
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,540
Truth or dare?

698
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,080
Truth.

699
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,040
Truth?

700
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,330
Little Pepper.

701
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,200
What's the record

702
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,720
of your longest constipation?

703
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,080
Gao Tianyang!

704
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,660
Say it. Say it.

705
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,500
- Gao Tianyang.
- She can skip, okay?

706
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Because she's my girlfriend.

707
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,830
Nonsense. I'm not your girlfriend.

708
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,200
Spin it.

709
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,410
- Song Sirui.
- Truth...

710
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,950
- Step on his head.
- or dare.

711
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,750
- Step on him.
- That's a piece of cake.

712
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,000
What's going on?

713
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,110
What are you doing? Watch out.

714
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,120
Take the chance to hit him.

715
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,450
Go away.

716
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,290
Alright, consider it your punishment.
Just spin it.

717
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:11,620
Truth or dare?

718
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,460
Dare.

719
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,490
Dare. Okay.

720
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,750
Kiss the next person who walks towards us

721
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,330
for ten seconds.

722
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,330
Kiss again?

723
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,580
If you don't,

724
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,830
you have to bark, crawl for three laps,
and pee like a dog.

725
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,670
Do you dare to do it?

726
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,120
Whoa! You're taking it too far.

727
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,160
Dare to kiss the person?

728
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,660
Do you dare?

729
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,340
Okay.

730
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,620
No problem, I can do it.

731
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,870
Good.

732
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,500
You're a real man.

733
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,370
That's okay, huh?

734
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,700
- Cool!
- Who is it? Who's that?

735
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,410
It's Tian!

736
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:49,870
That doesn't count, right?

737
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,950
We didn't specify
if it had to be a guy or a girl.

738
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,040
Yes.

739
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,230
Kiss him. Kiss him.

740
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,120
Scared? Then you have to bark.

741
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,290
If you don't kiss,
you have to crawl like a dog.

742
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,540
I'm not scared.

743
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,390
I can do it.

744
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,040
Oh, no.

745
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,410
For ten seconds?

746
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,410
Yes.

747
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:20,750

Hey, come on.

767
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,790
Jiang Tian, let me explain.

768
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,080
Jiang Tian.

769
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,200
Actually, I just wanted to...

770
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,250
You.

771
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,540
Don't follow me.

772
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,790
Hey, come on.

773
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,620
Actually, I mean. It was just...

774
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,500
It was just a game.

775
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,250
I admit

776
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,200
that kiss today

777
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,700
was a bit too much.

778
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,290
But in that situation,

779
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,750
I had no choice.

780
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,080
No,

781
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,370
I need to explain this to him.

782
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:49,370
Jiang Tian?

783
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,580
Jiang Tian?

784
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,250
If you don't answer me, I'll come in.

785
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,660
Jiang Tian.

786
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:07,910
I apologize

787
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,620
for what happened today.

788
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:12,500
I'm sorry.

789
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:14,660
But...

790
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,120
But it was nothing.

791
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,830
Nothing?

792
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,160
Yeah.

793
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,290
It was just four lips touching. That's all.

794
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,160
Don't be so petty.

795
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,250
You really have a temper.

796
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,620
I'm petty

797
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,830
and have a temper?

798
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,790
(He is like a tree,)

799
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,290
(without happiness and sadness.)

800
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:51,870
It's nothing, right?

801
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,040
(A part of his body will be sleeping
in the earth peacefully;)

802
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,580
(a part will be dancing
with the wind joyfully;)

803
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,200
(a part will be providing
green shade willingly;)

804
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,830
(and a part will be bathing
in the sunshine warmly.)

805
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,540
(So quiet)

806
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,040
(and so proud will he be)

807
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,410
(that he won't have to depend on anyone,)

808
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,500
(or search for anything.)

809
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,270
(Jiang Tian's very moment)

810
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:20,450
Are you alone?

811
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,750
Okay. I'll pair up with you.

812
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,640
Faster. Faster.

813
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:29,250
I'm not very good with people.

814
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,700
Because of Dad's job,

815
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,500
I move a lot.

816
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,250
People always see me as an outsider.

817
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,580
It's okay.

818
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,850
- Hey, come here.
- I don't have to run in the mixed relay.

819
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,160
- I'm exhausted.
- It's free time now.

820
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,590
- What do you want to play?
- Play what?

821
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,330
Shouldn't you practice for the mixed relay?

822
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:52,450
Seriously? You want to practice?

823
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:53,290
What do you think?

824
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,660
Let's play basketball.

825
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,580
Or volleyball?

826
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,040
Let's just disband here.

827
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,200
That's a good idea.

828
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,200
Great.

829
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,450
But, no. What if Mr. Wang comes back?

830
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:02,700
We should have something prepared.

831
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,410
What should we play then?

832
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,830
Truth or dare.

833
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,620
Truth or dare?

834
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,200
Who said that?

835
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,700
Sounds good.

836
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,200
Sounds good. We haven't played it in a while.

837
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,700
And now we have a new student.

838
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,410
I promise I'll uncover big secrets.

839
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:20,410
Sheng Wang.

840
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,290
Come join us.

841
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:23,500
Come on.

842
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,580
Let's play together.

843
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,420
What are we playing?

844
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,080
Truth or dare.

845
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,040
What's the record
of your longest constipation?

846
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,250
Say it.

847
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,200
Gao Tianyang!

848
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,370
She can skip, okay?

849
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:40,500
Because she's my girlfriend.

850
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,580
Nonsense.

851
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,200
(Lyrical essays set the mood)

852
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,700
(without being explicit,)

853
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,830
(like placing an arm
around his shoulder)

854
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,870
(to subtly show)

855
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,620
(I've already got him on my side.)

856
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,870
I want these. Thank you.

857
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,950
Truth or dare?

858
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:07,910
Dare.

859
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,250
- Dare.
- Give him a hard one.

860
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,100
