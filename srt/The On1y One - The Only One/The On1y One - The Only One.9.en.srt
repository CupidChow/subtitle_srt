1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,660
Everyone,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,950
punctuation is very important
in your essays.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,700
Whether you use it correctly

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,950
affects your essay score

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,700
and whether points will be deducted.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,160
So, you must keep this in mind.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,540
And, about the ellipse,

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,790
how many dots are there?

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,920
Five.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes, please.

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,660
Six.

12
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,250
Correct. It's six dots.

13
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,160
Also, don't add a period
after every sentence.

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,250
What does a period mean?

15
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,370
It means the conversation ends here.

16
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,000
It's like saying "That's all"

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,700
or "This is where it ends."

18
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,950
As for an ellipse,

19
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,910
it means the opposite of a period.

20
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,040
An ellipse indicates
something is left unsaid

21
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,290
or that there's more to come.

22
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,620
Lastly,

23
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,660
the dash.

24
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,160
Draw it directly...

25
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,000
Keep your head up!

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Lift your legs!

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,910
Faster, faster!

28
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,600
Li Yu, Song Sirui,

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,660
you are crawling like turtles.

30
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,000
I can't do it, sir.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,080
Can't do it...

32
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,790
We are exhausted.

33
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,040
Careful, careful.

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,120
I don't want to run.

35
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,700
Now you are exhausted?

36
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,700
We're only at the basketball court,
not the track.

37
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,250
The School Anniversary is coming up,

38
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,950
and there will be a relay race.

39
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,540
At the very least,

40
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,040
get me a medal, okay?

41
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,620
Forget it, let the other class win.

42
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,560
- Whoa.
- We just need to focus on studying.

43
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,620
How can you have no ambition?

44
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,080
I trust you.

45
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,160
I believe in you guys from Class A.

46
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,000
You can do it.

47
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,330
We really can't…

48
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,450
- Yeah, we can do it.
- Oh, no.

49
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,160
Well, Tianyang.

50
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,870
Help me organize the participants

51
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,960
for the anniversary events.

52
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:41,830
Yes.

53
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,000
Confirm and give me the list.

54
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,370
Got it.

55
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,830
Okay, class dismissed.

56
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,620
Thank you, sir.

57
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,700
Goodbye, sir.

58
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,580
Well, I'll count myself in.

59
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,790
The relay requires four runners.

60
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,000
Little Pepper,

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,870
you're one.

62
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,290
No!

63
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,580
I've already checked.
I'll have my period that day.

64
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,000
Your period?

65
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,330
Running with it will make you faster.

66
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,450
I won't let you off. Don't kick me.

67
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,500
- You deserve it.
- And…

68
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,790
Sheng.

69
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,660
I'll sign you up for the long jump.

70
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,950
Why?

71
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,950
You're good at bluffing,

72
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,330
so you must be able to jump far.

73
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,040
By that logic, Jiang Tian
should do the high jump,

74
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,620
since his grades are high.

75
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,120
Tian and Qi Jiahao

76
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,450
never participated in these events.

77
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,870
I beg you.

78
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,160
What's going on?

79
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,330
OK. OK.

80
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,370
Tian will participate!
Make some noise, guys!

81
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,120
Great.

82
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,500
Great.

83
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,870
It's settled.

84
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,250
Tian does the high jump,
and Sheng Wang does the long jump.

85
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,340
Okay.

86
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,120
Who volunteers

87
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,500
for the 3,000-meter run?

88
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,250
Here! Gao Tianyang volunteers.

89
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,120
Little Pepper,
are you trying to kill me?

90
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,700
Yes, by the way,

91
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,370
according to my "bad baby record",

92
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,120
you slept in class six times last week,

93
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,500
threw trash ten times,

94
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,080
and

95
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,330
read comics in class 20 times.

96
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,580
If I submit this,

97
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,540
you'll get a demerit.

98
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,040
So, will you do it or not?

99
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,200
I'll do it! I really want to run
3,000 meters!

100
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,500
Run, run, run!

101
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,830
- I'll do the 3,000-meter run.
- Sheng.

102
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,250
You might not know the rules.

103
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,750
Our sports competition

104
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,080
is point-based by class.

105
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
The top three in each event

106
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,790
get 15, 12, and 9 points respectively.

107
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,750
The fourth, fifth, and sixth

108
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,370
get 6, 4, and 2 points.

109
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,410
Last year, all we had was
Gao Tianyang.

110
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,870
Since he was the only participant,

111
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,910
we didn't get many points.

112
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,290
But this year, with Sheng and Tian,

113
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,040
we'll nail it!

114
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,750
Yeah, with Sheng and Tian,

115
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,660
our class might have a chance this year.

116
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,080
So, thanks to Sheng and Tian.

117
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,580
Our Class A has hope!

118
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:00,250
Sheng! Tian!

119
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,330
You're right,

120
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,290
but you can go back now.

Morning, Jenny Yang.

135
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,120
What's that?

136
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,410
Scones.

137
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,580
I think Linzi made them.

138
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,870
He learned to make these

139
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,160
while studying in the UK.

140
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,590
Do you want some?

141
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,830
Yeah, of course.

142
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,330
It's so good!

143
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,830
No!

144
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,950
I've already checked.
I'll have my period that day.

145
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,040
Your period?

146
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,160
Running with it will make you faster.

147
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,450
- I won't let you off. Don't kick me.
- You deserve it.

148
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,370
Sheng.

149
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,950
I'll sign you up for the long jump.

150
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,580
Why?

151
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,540
You're good at bluffing,

152
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,790
so you must be able to jump far.

153
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,450
By that logic, Jiang Tian
should do the high jump,

154
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,750
since his grades are high.

155
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,250
Tian and Qi Jiahao

156
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,620
never participated in these events.

157
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,200
- What's going on?
- OK. OK.

158
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,460
Really?

159
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,450
Tian will participate!
Make some noise, guys!

160
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,500
Great. It's settled.

161
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,790
Jiahao.

162
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,290
Xi.

163
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,750
I just saw you and your classmates…

164
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,700
Not getting along?

165
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,910
It's okay. Really.

166
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,970
This is even better.
No one will bug me while I study.

167
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,040
I was your tutor,
so I know you're not bad at heart.

168
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,620
Having someone beat up Sheng was wrong,

169
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,200
but it's over now.

170
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,710
Don't mention Sheng Wang to me.

171
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,790
It's over? How is it over?

172
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,410
Here comes our English genius,
Sheng Wang!

173
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,870
Are you insane?

174
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,250
Am I a tourist attraction for you?

175
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,580
Come on. You got all 150 questions
correct. That's amazing.

176
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,370
He's just an outsider
who came in halfway.

177
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,560
Other than good grades, he has nothing.

178
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,820
But everyone just accepts him easily.

179
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,870
Why does he get along with everyone

180
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,540
without even trying?

181
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,660
Thanks, Sheng.

182
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,250
Thanks for treating us.

183
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,290
You know how hard I worked to fit in?

184
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,890
When I first transferred to Class A,

185
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,320
I copied their interests,

186
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,370
researched their topics,
and treated everyone to meals.

187
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,500
And after all that,

188
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,950
we finally got closer.

189
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,310
Then Sheng Wang came
and ruined everything.

190
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,450
Isn't Sheng Wang amazing?

191
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,370
He also copied it,

192
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,450
but he understood it soon after.

193
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,870
But Qi Jiahao didn't.

194
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,800
They're clearly not on the same level.

195
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,160
Xi, you know,

196
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,950
my English

197
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,290
used to be the best in class.

198
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,660
Even Jiang Tian was second to me.

199
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,620
My answers were like the standard key.

200
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,790
Do you know how happy I was?

201
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,680
But then Sheng Wang showed up,

202
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,920
and now he's the new standard key.

203
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,290
Besides you two,

204
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,080
no one scored above 90.

205
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,540
Jiahao.

206
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,580
Do you remember what I told you before?

207
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,160
Everyone has their own strengths.

208
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,950
You shouldn't
compare yourself to others.

209
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,790
And then?

210
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,370
Then what?

211
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,450
Then compare myself to others?
What's this?

212
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,070
Isn't this just teaching us
to compare ourselves to others?

213
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,500
Who has more friends
is a comparison too.

214
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,910
You're checking on me now

215
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,290
because I have no friends, right?

216
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,450
I made one mistake,

217
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,950
and now all the cheers,

218
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,580
excitement, and glory are gone.

219
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,240
The friendships in Class A
are so shallow.

220
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,620
Even Jing, who used to be so good to me,

221
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,190
said she was disappointed.

222
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
It's not just me who can't move on.

223
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,870
No one else can.

224
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,120
I really can't accept this. Why me?

225
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,040
It's so good!

226
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,410
Zhao Xi, do you want one?

227
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,660
No, thanks.

228
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,620
Zhao Xi, what's wrong?

229
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,620
You seem off today.

230
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,040
I'm wondering,

231
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,950
do we have to suffer
while we're young to grow up?

232
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,290
Do things that were hard
when we were young

233
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,660
get easier as we get older?

234
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,830
Zhao Xi.

235
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,040
I never thought you'd be so sentimental.

236
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,000
I always thought you were the type

237
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,580
who only thinks about

238
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,660
having fun, fighting,
and causing trouble.

239
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,580
Jenny Yang.

240
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,410
What?

241
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,620
Fine.

242
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,160
I think

243
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,870
youth is like a color,

244
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,700
and time is the light.

245
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,620
The things

246
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,950
that haven't faded
by the time you grow up

247
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,370
are the ones you didn't
want to let go of.

248
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,620
Whether it's painful or not

249
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,080
depends on which colors
you choose to keep.

250
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,080
So,

251
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,040
don't leave too much blank space
in your youth.

252
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,750
When there's food, eat it.

253
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,750
Or you'll end up with nothing
when you grow up.

254
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,700
You got it?

255
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,750
Jenny Yang.

256
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,700
You're cheesy.

257
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,620
No way!

258
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,040
- Aren't you?
- I think...

259
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,830
What's all this
"no blank space in youth" stuff?

260
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,410
Sounds super cheesy coming from you.

261
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,330
I think it's quite mature.

262
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,950
You're the last person

263
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,080
to be mature.

264
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,250
Zhao Xi.

265
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,370
Obviously, you're the immature one.

266
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,910
Yeah, you're the most mature.

267
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,910
You don't get it.

268
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,910
I really don't.

269
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,500
You don't appreciate things.

270
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,950
Do you want some or not?

271
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,330
If not, I'll eat them all.

272
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,330
Go ahead.

273
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,870
I'm just worried you won't have enough.

274
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,950
I'll eat them all, then.

275
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,120
Nothing left for you.

Everyone, do your best and stay safe.

290
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,290
Thank you, sir.

291
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,540
Ms. Chen.

292
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,540
Here come the most handsome
teachers in our school.

293
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,750
Alright, Class B, show your stuff!

294
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,500
One, two, three, go!

295
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,040
Forge ahead in sports!

296
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,160
Ms. Chen, keep it up.

297
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,950
Come on, my excellent Class A!

298
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,620
Shout your slogan to the two teachers.

299
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,080
Three, two, one.

300
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,700
Win or lose, it's just a game.

301
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,000
Hey, it's a competition.

302
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,160
What do you mean
"win or lose, it's just a game."

303
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,330
Who came up with this slogan?

304
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,040
Gao Tianyang.

305
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,250
Gao Tianyang, you really are...

306
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,830
Sir, this is the true spirit
of sportsmanship.

307
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,000
We aim to participate,

308
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,950
not just to win.

309
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,660
You really have a lot of reasons, huh?

310
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,750
But we're totally serious about this.
No doubt about it.

311
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,330
Look, we specially designed
this class uniform.

312
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,540
A.

313
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,040
Super A.

314
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,870
Super A?

315
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,290
"A" would be fine, but "super A"?

316
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,410
Who would dare to wear that?

317
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,950
Sir, none of us want to wear it.

318
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,620
A total waste of money.

319
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,540
No way, it looks good.

320
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,410
Exactly.

321
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,580
"Super A" fits Class A's vibe perfectly.

322
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,660
Super Class 2A.

323
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,620
Wow!

324
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,450
This is our beloved diva, Jing!

325
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,660
Ms. Yang?

326
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,580
Yes?

327
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,290
I think

328
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,330
I'm in love.

329
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,120
Gross.

330
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,080
Everyone, isn't Ms. Yang
looking beautiful today?

331
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,040
Beautiful!

332
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,540
Alright, stop it.

333
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,750
You guys, stop flattering.

334
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,910
Why haven't some of you changed
into your class uniforms yet?

335
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,040
Hurry up and change,

336
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,910
then gather at the ceremonial stand
for a group photo.

337
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,000
- Okay.
- See you.

338
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,500
Did you hear that?

339
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,660
Jing said to change, Little Mouth Xu.

340
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,250
- No way, I can still be in the picture.
- Beg me.

341
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,440
We'll check out the other classes.

342
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,540
You all have no taste.

343
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,410
You don't understand art.
Only Sheng gets me.

344
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,580
Hey, give me another one.

345
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,080
You want to wear two? Okay.

346
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,920
No, no.

347
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,660
It's for him.

348
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,870
No way, Tian...

349
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,790
I'm not wearing it.

350
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,790
Gao designed and worked hard on it.

351
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,750
Just put it on.

352
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,730
No.

353
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,600
Just for one day.

354
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,540
I don't want to.

355
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,380
Brother.

356
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,660
Wow, Brother...

357
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,070
- Brother...
- Tian is Sheng's elder brother.

358
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,140
Elder brother!

359
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,620
Elder brother!

360
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,410
Brother Jiang Tian!

361
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,950
Brother, wear it.

362
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,500
Just for one day, please.

363
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,660
Did you see that?

364
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,410
Even Tian will wear it,
so why won't you?

365
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,750
- Fine, I'll wear it.
- Take it.

366
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,830
There you go.

367
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,750

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,580
Thanks. Thank you, Class B.

371
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,700
Now, let's have Class 2A.

372
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,370
Come on, Class A, quickly!

373
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,250
Okay.

374
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,950
Class 2A, show some energy.

375
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,700
- Here we go.
- Smile.

376
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,620
Ready? Look here.

377
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,790
One, two, three.

378
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,450
Yay!

379
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,950
Let's take one more.

380
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,250
For this photo,

381
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,410
let's turn around
and do our Super A pose!

382
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,830
Unique. Great, let's take
one more for you guys.

383
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,290
Okay. Thank you!

384
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,500
- Thank you.
- Great.

385
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,960
All done?

386
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,200
Now get back and prepare
for the sports events.

387
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,580
Okay.

388
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,910
Mr. He, how did
Class A perform last year?

389
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,120
Oh, our class. What was it?

390
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,850
We came in last place last year.

391
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,730
We were...

392
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,040
- The last place.
- In last place.

393
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,580
Oh, with your enthusiasm this year,

394
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,410
you won't be in last place again.

395
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,540
How about this?

396
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,950
I'll make you a bet.

397
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,330
If you win the relay this year,

398
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,790
I'll treat everyone to drinks.

399
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,580
If you lose, at worst, you'll just
clean the toilets for a week.

400
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,530
What?

401
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,200
Director Xu, this bet is terrible.

402
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,580
If we lose, we clean the toilets for a week,

403
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,910
but if we win, we only get drinks?

404
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,120
Yeah.

405
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,870
That's not fair.

406
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,040
What do you want then?

407
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,660
Streaking.

408
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,450
Since you're betting, make it a big one.

409
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,910
That way, it shows sincerity

410
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,580
and avoids any claims of bullying.

411
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,860
- Right?
- Yeah.

412
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:23,830
- Yes.
- Let's do it.

413
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:24,790
That's right.

414
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,330
- Really?
- Yeah.

415
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,540
Do you dare, Director Xu?

416
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,250
Do it! Do it!

417
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,870
Alright, a bet's a bet!
I'm not afraid.

418
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,200
Alright.

419
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,500
If you win the relay,

420
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,620
I'll streak.

421
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,790
Is that okay?

422
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,290
Yes!

423
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,750
Director Xu will streak!

424
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,160
Streak! Streak! Streak!

425
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,370
Alright, go, go, go! Go to your events!

435
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,950

438
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,200
Run!

439
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,660
Faster!

440
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,290
Run faster!

441
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,410
Little Pepper, go!

442
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,200
Foul!

443
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,660
You're fouling!

444
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:23,430
Little Pepper! Go!

445
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,830
Sheng! Sheng!

446
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,080
Hey, who won?

447
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,040
Go check it.

448
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,120
Tian.

449
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,750
Could it be that I beat you?

450
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,450
Tian.

451
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,370
Who was it?

452
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,500
Us or Class B?

453
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,750
I'll go listen in.

454
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,620
Well,

455
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,160
Class A is 0.2 seconds faster.

456
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,410
What was it?

457
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,450
Just say it. Who's the winner?

458
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,410
You know what?

459
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,040
Director Xu will streak!

460
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,250
Yay!

461
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,120
Streak! Streak! Streak!

462
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,620
Director Xu, you have to streak now!

463
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,000
Hold on.

464
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Wait, wait.

465
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,250
You misunderstood.

466
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,790
I meant your total score.

467
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:06,330
You need to win
the teachers' PK match too.

468
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,660
What?

469
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,790
- You're cheating.
- Keep your word!

470
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,830
Hey, you misunderstood.

471
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,680
He is the director.

472
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,780
Director Xu is cheating.

473
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,620
Don't say that.

474
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,120
No, no, you misunderstood.

475
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,290
Hey!

476
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,330
We won first place!

477
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,290
Did you hear me? We're number one!

478
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,670
Water?

479
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,790
- I think you were awesome just now.
- Tian.

480
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,580
Tian.

481
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,330
Let's go to the tent.

482
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,660
Who's he?

483
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,540
None of your business.

484
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,170
Let's go.

485
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,700
I heard today is the sports day,

486
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,790
so I came to see you.

487
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,290
I've looked for you many times

488
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,870
but couldn't find you.

489
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,290
Today, you ran...

490
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,040
First place! First place!

491
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,750
Announcement. Announcement.

492
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,160
Now, we are announcing the results

493
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,830

494
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,540
The first place goes to Class 2A.

495
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,540
The second place goes to Class 2B.

496
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,750
The third place goes to Class 2C.

497
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,410
The first place!

498
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,290
Have you seen Ms. Yang,
your class advisor?

499
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,700
Class advisor?

500
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,290
No, we haven't seen her since earlier.

501
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,450
Okay. Thank you.

502
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,410
Mr. He.

503
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,540
Have you seen Ms. Yang?

504
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,000
Ms. Yang?

505
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,040
No.

506
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,160
I haven't seen her since the relay race.

507
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,910
We teachers have matches later.
Where is she?

508
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,120
We'll go find her.

509
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,410
Don't forget the PK match.

510
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,000
- We're counting on you.
- Okay.

511
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,910
Jenny Yang?

512
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,200
Is she there?

513
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,950
No.

514
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,870
Let's go check the classrooms.

515
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,450
Jenny!

516
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,330
- Jenny Yang?
- Jenny!

517
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,200
Jenny!

518
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,700
Jenny!

519
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,660
Still no answer.

520
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,830
Let's keep looking.

521
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,960
Over there.

522
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,410
Let go of me.

523
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,080
Let go of me.

524
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,410
You brought me here.
What do you want?

525
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,120
Ma'am, don't be afraid.

526
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,620
We'll take some pictures of you.

527
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,910
The other teachers will be here soon.

528
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,620
Oh, you're wearing so many layers.

529
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,120
It won't look good in the photos.

530
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,910
Ma'am, take off one layer.

531
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,580
If you don't,

532
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,120
I'll use this knife to cut your face.

533
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,250
What exactly do you want?

534
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,790
Aren't you a teacher?

535
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,370
Aren't you supposed to believe in
and encourage your students?

536
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,470
Why are you disappointed in him?

537
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,370
What?

538
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,410
As a teacher,

539
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,910
can you be disappointed
in your students?

540
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,410
This is all your fault.

541
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,950
You're torturing your student,

542
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,950
letting him die slowly in pain!

543
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,620
You're not a teacher.

544
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,080
You're actually a murderer.

545
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,200
I think you misunderstood something.

546
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,040
You're stubborn, huh?

547
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,700
Fine. Go ahead.

548
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,000
What are you doing?

549
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,250
Let go of me.

550
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,040
Zhao Xi! Benny!

551
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,050
It's you guys again.

552
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,090
Watch out.

553
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,700
Where are you going?

554
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,380
Watch out.

555
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,840
Careful.

556
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,370
- Benny!
- Jenny!

557
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,370
Let's go.

558
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,660
Careful.

559
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,910
Sit down for a bit.

560
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,750
My foot...

561
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,790
I think I twisted my ankle.

562
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,620
Does it hurt like this?

563
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,790
I'll go get the first aid kit.

564
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:26,470
(Teacher: Lin Beiting)
(Teacher: Yang Jing)

565
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:21,830
How about now?

566
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,370
How could Zhao Xi
just leave it here and go?

567
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,700
So irresponsible.

568
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,250
I never thought

569
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,910
I'd encounter something like this.

570
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,130
Your hand.

571
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,700
Does it hurt?

572
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,750
A bit.

573
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,950
This should do it.

574
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,910
Anywhere else hurting?

575
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,450
My hand and foot are much better.

576
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,870
It's not really hurt.

577
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,790
I'm just thinking

578
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,080
that those punks said I killed Qi Jiahao

579
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,330
because I was disappointed in him.

580
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,290
But

581
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,080
in my mind, as a teacher,

582
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,120
I'm not just responsible
for only one student,

583
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,080
but for every student

584
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,700
besides him.

585
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,000
And

586
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I didn't give up on Qi Jiahao.

587
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,620
I knew he cared about his grades,

588
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,120
so I made a study plan for him

589
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,660
and even asked my foreign friends

590
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,950
to help him
with his language sense. I...

591
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,580
So, you didn't do anything wrong.

592
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,200
Don't doubt yourself.

593
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,250
Yeah.

594
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:20,600
(The 30th School Anniversary Sports Day)
(2nd-year sports results)

595
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,830
Gao Tianyang!

596
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,830
Yay!

597
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,240
Gao Tianyang!

598
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,870
That's insane, Gao Tianyang.

599
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,000
You even won the 3,000-meter run.

600
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,660
You got 15 points three times.
Great job!

601
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,290
Hey, I checked.

602
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,120
We're currently in first place overall.

603
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,700
We have a shot at the championship!

604
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,120
Now it's just the high jump
and the long jump.

605
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,580
If we win these,
we'll be in first place!

606
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,830
Everyone,

607
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,450
whether we get to see
Big Mouth Xu streak or not

608
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,790
depends on Sheng and Tian.

609
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,040
Who wants to see him streak?

610
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,450
We want to win and be champions.

611
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,310
Exactly.

612
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,370
Come on, Class A.

613
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,040
Let's cheer them on and get pumped up!

614
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,950
Come here. One, two, three.

615
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,370
Go, go, go!

616
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,370
Tian, you are awesome.

617
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,200
Awesome. Awesome.

618
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,580
There is one more left.

619
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,830
The current record is 1.75 meters.

620
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,870
Beat them with your next jump.

621
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,160
- Show them who rocks!
- You've got this!

622
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,870
Ref, I'll challenge 1.8 meters.

623
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,790
1.8 meters?

624
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,790
Okay.

625
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,330
Wow!

626
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:25,910
Tian! Tian! Tian!

627
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,790
Jiang Tian, Class 2A,
cleared 1.8 meters.

628
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,120
Sheng Wang, Class 2A,
second jump attempt.

629
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,430
- Go, go!
- Stay steady. It'll be fine.

630
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,540
Watch your pacing.

631
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,040
Sheng, go for it!

632
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,620
Sheng, go for it!

633
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,410
Stay steady on your feet.

634
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,430
It's far.

635
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,830
5.12 meters.

636
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:32,660
Xie Zhongcheng, Class 2B,
third jump attempt.

637
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,160
Zhongcheng, first place!
Zhongcheng, go for it!

638
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,290
Go!

639
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,440
That seems pretty far too.

640
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,910
5.36 meters.

641
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,950
Sheng, for your final jump, beat them

642
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,350
and take first place. Go for it!

643
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,200
Sheng, go for it!

644
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,620
Just stay focused, one last jump.

645
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,620
Remember what I said.

646
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,910
Sheng, go for it! Sheng, go, go, go!

647
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,450
Hey, shh!

648
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,790
Let's not distract him.
We believe in him.

649
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,630
Believe in him.

650
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,370
The power of belief, you know?

651
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,410
Go away.

652
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:13,950
Sheng Wang, Class 2A,
third jump attempt.

653
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,750
Go, Sheng!

654
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,160
You can beat him. You've got this!

655
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,370
- Focus!
- Go for it!

656
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,950
5.45 meters.

657
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,540
Sheng Wang from Class 2A
made his final jump

658
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,620
at 5.45 meters and took first place.

659
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,330
First place! First place!

660
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,230
Super A!

661
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,160
First! First!

662
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,760
First place! First place!

663
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,370
Sheng.

664
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,790
- What's wrong? Did you get hurt?
- Sheng.

665
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,790
No, no.

666
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,950
Are you okay?

667
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,830
Careful.

668
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,200
Are you really okay?

669
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,910
I'm fine. Don't worry.

670
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:30,790
You sure?

671
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,910
Sheng, you got first place!

672
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,330
We're the champions. Super A!

673
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,620
Hey, remember our bet with Big Mouth Xu?

674
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,950
Should we run away now?

675
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,790
I really don't want to see
a man streak.

676
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,950
It's okay. He's always
been strict with us.

677
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,040
We'll watch him embarrass himself.

678
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,500
We'll get even this time.

679
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,620
Strip him. Sound good?

680
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,290
- Strip him!
- Go.

681
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,410
Strip him!

682
00:35:54,810 --> 00:36:01,810
(Class A)

683
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,250
Hey, Director Xu.

684
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,250
What are you doing?

685
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,660
They earned the points openly and fairly.

686
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,200
That's weird.

687
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,250
Where is Zhao Xi?
Why hasn't he come back yet?

688
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,080
Just forget about him.

689
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,370
Do you want to try walking again?

690
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,880
Yeah.

691
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,080
Where did you go?

692
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,370
Got hungry after the fight,
so I went to grab a bite.

693
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,250
What did you eat that took you so long?

694
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,870
Why didn't you bring something for us?

695
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,250
I ate your scones.

696
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,950
You're so annoying.

697
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,450
When I offered them,
you said you didn't want any.

698
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,040
Now you sneaked off to eat them.

699
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,540
Are you talking about my scones?

700
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:54,700
Yeah.

701
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,330
Oh, stop fighting.

702
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,120
I'll just make more next time.

703
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,120
I heard you make a lot of great food.

704
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,410
Next time, I want to try them all.

705
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,160
- No problem.
- It's a deal.

706
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
It's a deal.

707
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,700
Zhao Xi, your hand.

708
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,750
- Join us.
- Your hand, now.

709
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,170
Here we go.

710
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,750
Anyway, no matter what happens,

711
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,450
we'll face it bravely together.

712
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,330
- Exactly.
- Wait.

713
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,620
You hurt your hand.

714
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,790
You need to apply medicine too.

715
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,910
In the world,

716
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,540
everyone has a few scars.

717
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,750
Right, right.

718
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,790
Thanks for saving me, hero.

719
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,830
Too bad I can't marry you in return.

720
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,870
But I finally see your old flair.

721
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,120
Alright, let's go.

722
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,000
Let's go.

723
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Don't you move,

724
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,250
Little Mouth Xu!

725
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:46,950
Get on your knees.

726
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,580
Director Xu, go!

727
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,450
You're insane. Are you high?

728
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,450
You're hurt.

729
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,580
No, no. I'm fine. Just go ahead.

730
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,160
Let me take a look. Don't move.

731
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,450
Ref,

732
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,330
we need to withdraw.

733
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,910
Hey, I'm fine.

734
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,120
Sheng Wang hurt his ankle.
I'll take him to the health center.

735
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,000
- Okay.
- Jiang Tian...

736
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,750
- What about the competition?
- Get on.

737
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,250
- Or they will streak.
- Get on.

738
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,000
Get on.

739
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,580
Song Sirui,

740
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,540
you'll take my place.

741
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,250
Me?

742
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:49,910
Song Sirui.

743
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,540
But they...

744
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,830
Never mind.

745
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,650
Ready!

746
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,120
Miss Fortune, go for it!

747
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:12,720
Left, right. Left, right...

748
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,910
Quickly!

749
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,960
Oh, no.

750
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:35,830
We have to streak now.

751
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,500
It's you guys, not us.

752
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,080
- Not me.
- Yes, you are.

753
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,370
No way.

754
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,700
That's okay. I really don't want
to see my dad streak.

755
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,000
Why didn't you let me carry you earlier?

756
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,290
Because it's embarrassing.

757
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,040
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

758
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,500
Besides,

759
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,000
it's not my first time carrying you.

760
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,130
Hey,

761
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,620
your neck is in my arms now.

762
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,700
Watch what you say.

763
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,500
You're in my arms too.

764
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,790
What? Go on.

765
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,870
Nothing.

766
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,120
Are you tired?

767
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,040
If you stay still, I won't get tired.

768
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,330
Are you tired?

769
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:48,910
Me?

770
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,200
Why would I be tired?

771
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,910
Your neck's stiff, isn't it?

772
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,120
Please take care of your injury.

773
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,450
Don't move around for the next few days.

774
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:12,700
Yes.

775
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,080
You, keep an eye on him.

776
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:23,690
Let's go.

777
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,370
Don't move.

778
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,950
What's wrong?

779
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,910
It's not a cast.

780
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,040
Leave a mark.

781
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,370
Hey,

782
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,080
the man of few words.

783
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,290
That's a period.

784
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,660

Sheng.

796
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,290
How's the competition?

797
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,620
Sorry, it's my fault.

798
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,500
No, it's all because of me.

799
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,120
If I'd been more careful,
my foot wouldn't be hurt.

800
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,660
Sheng, how is your ankle?

801
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,040
The doctor said I need to rest a bit,

802
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,620
but it's not serious. Don't worry.

803
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,330
Just get some rest.

804
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,750
Hey, Tian.

805
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,370
Can I use your pen?

806
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,290

everyone signs it.

809
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:05,700
I'll change it tonight.

810
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,790
Be gentle.

811
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,450
Relax. I won't hurt your beloved Sheng.

812
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,500
- What a poor handwriting.
- Love you.

813
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,830

Let's hope Sheng can get well soon.

822
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,160
Get well soon.

823
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,290
Wait. I think we forgot something.

824
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:58,590
Something important.

825
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,490
What is it?

826
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,750
Yeah.

827
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:01,870
You're right.

828
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,080
A bet is a bet.

829
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:11,870
Let's go.

830
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,250
Let me help you.

831
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,080
Here, let me take a look.

832
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,830
Put the shoe on your uninjured foot.

833
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:18,870
I'll carry the other one for you.

834
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:19,950
Okay. Thanks.

835
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,080
Let's go, then.

836
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:25,370
Go.

837
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,620
Hurry up and clean up.

838
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,120
Yeah, pack everything up
over there quickly.

839
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:36,450
OK. Good.

840
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,250
Yeah, pack it all up.

841
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,910
Gao Tianyang did it alone.

842
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:43,040
How's your ankle?

843
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,580
Just as you can see.

844
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,330
- Go rest over there.
- Let's go over there.

845
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,750
What now?

846
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:51,830
Director Xu,

847
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,700
we admit defeat in the bet.

848
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,290
Well, it's not a big deal.

849
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,790
Don't mess around. Just go back.

850
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:58,790
No.

851
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,450
We have to keep our word.

852
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,540
We're going streaking.

853
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,120
Well...

854
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,830
Don't joke around. This is not...

855
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:06,620
Didn't you hear me? Go back now.

856
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,950
A bet is a bet!

857
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:12,120
A bet is a bet!

858
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,000
Alright.

859
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,370
- Stop it, everyone.
- Will they be streaking?

860
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:15,330
Just go back.

861
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:16,500
You stick to your word.

862
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:17,790
Nice.

863
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,370
They're serious?

864
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:21,580
Come on. Don't mess around.

865
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,910
This is just a joke.

866
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:24,290
- Go back, all of you...
- Get ready.

867
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,160
Take your clothes off.

868
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,700
Hey, hey!

869
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,620
Don't take them off!

870
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,910
No! I forbid it.

871
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,080
You'd better stop now. Stop!

872
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,120
Turn around.

873
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,080
What...

874
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,870
Hey, stop! Stop it!

875
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,620
Hey, don't look!

876
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,870
Run!

877
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,330
One, two, three, four.

878
