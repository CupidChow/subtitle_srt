Miss Fortune is really strict.

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,290
She gave us so many classical texts.

00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,450
50 pieces!

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,120
I can't even finish reading them,
let alone copy them all.

at least doubles the retention.

But for someone

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,700
who writes slowly
and has poor handwriting,

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,080
he will only drag the stats down.

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,750
Fine. That's me. My handwriting is poor.

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,290
I write slowly.

14
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,950
But at least I can write,

15
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,620

Well, Wang.

66
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,120
Did Dad do something wrong?

67
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,660
Why do you insist on living at school?

68
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,040
I told you.

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,660
I just want to stay in the dorm
for a change of pace.

It saves time

71
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,120

What's bothering you? Just tell me.

00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,370
Nothing's bothering me.

77
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,450
Then why do you insist
on living in school?

78
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,290
Right?

79
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,870
Just tell Dad the reason, okay?

80
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,160
It's okay. Dad can handle it.

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,580
Tell me. Come on.

82
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,830
I've already told you.

You're never home all year,
always traveling.

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,000
What's the difference
between home and school?

85
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,500
So this is what bothers you, right?

86
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,450
Dad's never home,

87
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,410
and doesn't care about you, huh?

88
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,200
No, it's not that.

89
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,870
What do I have to say
for you to believe me?

90
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,870
Then why do you have to...

91
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,660
Alright. That's okay.

Son,

94
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,000
what's the real reason?

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,840
Dad loves you.

96
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,950
Just tell me. I'll make it right.

97
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,410
What's wrong, Wang?

98
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,250
Wang?

See you.

101
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,620
I'm going too.

102
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,790
Dear, what's wrong?

103
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,540
It must be my fault,

104
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,580
making both of them unhappy at home.

105
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,830
Don't overthink it. That's not true.

106
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,500
Don't be sad.

107
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,160
No, it's not your fault.

108
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,620
Don't be sad.
I'll ask Sheng Wang sometime.

109
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,370
Don't cry.

Wang, I heard you two
are going to live at school.

113
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,830
What's going on?

114
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,700
Am I not doing a good job?

115
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,080
No, Ms. Sun.

116
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,160
Please don't overthink it.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,450
We should go.

118
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,290
Even Ms. Sun knows about it.

119
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,660
My dad definitely told her.

120
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,410
My dad is really annoying.

121
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,620
Why are you two suddenly
moving to the dorm?

122
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,370
Hello?

123
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,410

I heard you're moving to the school dorm.

125
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,160
Why so sudden? Is there something wrong?

126
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,830
Now the whole world knows
you're moving to the dorm.

127
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,370
My dad told you, didn't he?

128
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,700
- Well, Wang...
- Please don't ask me why for him.

129
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,790
Thanks.

Come on, Tian.

Let's go.

you won't get these delicacies.

Let's have a talk, too.

148
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,370
Just say whatever you want.

149
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,250
Kids your age

150
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,870
always think we're outdated

151
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,620
and old-fashioned.

152
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,500
But that's not entirely true.

153
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,250
Tell me.

154
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,660
Is it because of me or Ms. Jiang?

155
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,330
I've told you.

156
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,870
It's not anyone's fault and I'm not mad.

157
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,120
Can you just listen to me for once?

158
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,160
I'm listening.

159
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,330
You have to say it for me to understand.

160
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,410
I just

161
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,750
don't want you to be unhappy.

Dad.

163
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,870
You've always said

164
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,580
I'm narrow-minded,

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,660
short-tempered, and quick to anger.

166
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,040
But whenever you ask me what happened,

167
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,580
I've always told you.

168
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,750
The question is,

169
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,750
have you ever really listened?

170
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,580
When I was little,

171
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,660
I said I could handle things myself

172
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,790
and didn't need your help.

173
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,830
You had to work and travel.

174
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,910
That was fine with me.

175
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,120
You just needed to let me know
when you'd be back.

176
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,250
I could handle everything.

177
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,660
But what happened?

178
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,620
You started dating Ms. Jiang.

179
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,410
I...

180
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,870
Finally, I came to terms with it.

181
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,580
After all, my mom is gone.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Someday,

183
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,000
I would fall in love, get married,

184
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,370
and leave this house.

185
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,830
You couldn't stay single forever.

186
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,040
You'd find someone else,
and I accepted that.

187
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,950
But I remember telling you

188
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,330
I didn't want anyone to replace my mom.

189
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,290
But what did you do?

190
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,450
You and Ms. Jiang

191
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,580
moved into the house I grew up in,

192
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,750
slept in my mom's old room,

193
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,870
used her kitchen,

194
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,410
and even made the dishes
she used to cook.

195
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,830
- Wang...
- Dad.

196
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,750
You did it on purpose.

197
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,200
You purposely found someone
who looks like my mom.

198
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
You knew I wouldn't get mad at her.

199
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,450
You knew I'd accept her.

200
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,750
That's okay.

201
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,750
I thought I'd already accepted it.

202
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,750
When I accidentally drank alcohol,

203
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,700
she made me honey water.

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,870
She knows I like to sleep in and be late,

205
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,040
so she has her son wait for me every day.

206
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,910
I mentioned my favorite dish once

207
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,790
and she tried so hard to cook it for me.

208
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,910
Even if it didn't taste great,
she tried her best.

209
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,910
But I still can't accept

210
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,540
anyone replacing my mom.

211
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,700
- I didn't mean to let her...
- Dad.

212
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,450
But I can accept

213
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,910
two more family members.

214
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,620
I don't dislike Ms. Jiang

215
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,910
and I accept you two being together.

216
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,040
I can treat them as family.

217
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,620
And I get along well with Jiang Tian,

218
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,580
better than you think
and better than I expected.

219
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,410
So I'm not mad at anyone.

220
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,370
I just simply want to live at school.

221
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,750
So this time,

222
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,410
could you please take my words seriously?

223
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,120
He transferred the money to me.

224
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,250
Mom.

225
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,120
Don't overthink it.

226
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,540
I never thought you owed me

227
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,120
or wanted to leave me behind.

228
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,370
I used to feel sad

229
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,540
and even a bit resentful,

230
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,410
wondering why you treated me that way.

231
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,330
But now, I understand you.

232
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,620
It's all gone

233
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,120
and doesn't matter anymore.

234
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,620
Honestly, does

235
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,120
living here

236
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,950
make you unhappy

237
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,200
and uncomfortable?

238
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,700
Living at school has nothing
to do with this.

239
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,120
It's just more convenient for studying.

240
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,500
Don't worry about it.

241
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Actually, this morning,

242
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,830
Wang told Mr. Sheng

243
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,540
that

244
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,870
Mr. Sheng isn't home very often

245
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,410
and that they barely see each other.

246
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,370
It doesn't really matter
whether he lives at home or not.

247
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,660
Actually, I felt sad

248
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,580
when I heard this.

249
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,290
Because I thought

250
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,790
he's a bit like how you were
when you were little.

251
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,450
All these years,

252
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,250
I've been thinking,

253
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,000
if your dad and I...

254
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,080
If I hadn't been so strong-willed,

255
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,450
if we had both compromised,

256
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,750
or,

257
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,200
if I hadn't been so occupied with work

258
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,120
and had spent more time with you...

259
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,120
- If...
- Mom.

260
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,950
If I hadn't sent you
to live with Grandma,

261
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,910
would things

262
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,700
be different now?

263
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,500
But I know

264
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,040
I missed out on so much.

265
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,830
And I know there are

266
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,500
many things I can't make up for.

267
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,830
So I really don't want

268
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,200
to see you alone,

269
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,910
dragging your suitcase

270
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,620
and moving around anymore.

271
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,700
It makes me really sad.

272
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,540
Mom.

273
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,880
Mom.

274
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,540
This time, I'm not alone.

275
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,410
Someone's coming with me.

276
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,290
And someone is with you, right?

277
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,330
Thank you, Tian.

278
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,250
After Wang and I move into the dorm,

279
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,450
you and Mr. Sheng can focus on your work

280
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,830
and take care of each other.

281
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,410
It's a good thing,

282
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,040
isn't it?

283
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,080
Thank you.

284
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,750
Thank you.

285
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,040
Have some tea.

286
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,000
Thank you.

287
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,840
Here you go.

288
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,700
I saw you two talking for quite a while.

289
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,750
Is everything okay?

290
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,330
It's great.

291
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,160
Did you cry?

292
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm fine.

293
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,830
Once they start living at school,

294
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,870
they'll only come back occasionally.

295
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,540
Try not to feel too down about it.

296
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,120
You know what?

297
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,410
We'll keep both of our schedules clear

298
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,120
on those days

299
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,040
and spend the time with them.

300
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,910
How does that sound?

301
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,040
Maybe this way, we'll even
see them more often.

302
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,450
Exactly.

303
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,910
My son is quite something.

304
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,870
He's super picky about food.

305
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,160
But he's still brave enough
to live at school.

306
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,750
How's he going to handle it?

307
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,250
Maybe this will help him

308
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,620
get over his picky eating habits.

309
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,580
Impossible.

310
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,700
I bet he'll come back skinny as a stick.

311
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,200
Never mind.

312
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,410
As long as they're happy.

313
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,120
Tian isn't picky, though.

314
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,660
But you know, the dorm food

315
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,700
can't be that good.

316
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,660
Yeah.

317
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,910
In the end, it's still
going to be tough for us.

318
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,120
Tian told me.

319
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,750
"Mom, don't worry."

320
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,250
But how can we parents not worry?

321
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,830
Maybe that's just

322
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,790
how young people are.

323
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,700
Yeah, we were young once too.

324
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,410
You know what?

325
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,870
I used to sneak into your house
to take your sausages.

326
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,870
So you were the one stealing them?

327
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,250
That makes me really miss

328
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,410
my mom's sausages.

329
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,840
Dad.

330
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,330
So,

331
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,500
can we move into the dorm now?

332
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,830
We talked about it last night.

333
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,160
Since you both want it so much,

334
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,540
just go ahead.

335
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,750
Dad.

336
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,620
Thank you.

337
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,370
Son.

338
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,160
Okay.

339
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,870
Wang. Come here.

340
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,200
- Why?
- Just come here.

341
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,000
Tian, you too, come here.

342
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,580
Come on. Come here.

343
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,750
You go over there.

344
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,330
Tian, you're the older brother.

345
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,200
When you're in the dorm,
look after Wang, okay?

346
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Wang, listen. Once you're...

347
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,120
Alright, Old Sheng,

348
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,620
don't nag so much.

349
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,910
From now on, we're all family.

350
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,370
We should look out for each other, okay?

351
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,700
Ms. Jiang.

352
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,750
Let's hug.

353
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,330
Come on, let's hug.

354
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,370
- We're family.
- We're family!

355
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,580
Morning, Ms. Yang.

356
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,790
Morning.

357
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,000
Why are you so early today?

358
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,580
Oh, my goldfish memory.

359
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,160
I just remembered,

360
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,160
Ms. Lai from senior year
will be on tocolysis leave

361
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,700
and then maternity leave.

362
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,910
So, you'll cover her classes
for both sophomore and senior years.

363
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,200
Why didn't you remind me earlier?

364
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,410
But you remembered just now.

365
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,500
Alright.

366
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,120
Mr. Lin.

367
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,080
Is that

368
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,750
a rainbow pattern?

369
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,250
So, you also support...

370
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,670
Yeah.

371
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,160
Me, too!

372
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,330
But our private school is conservative.

373
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,580
Mr Lin,

374
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,660
You dare to use such a beautiful
rainbow-patterned cup.

375
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,750
You are brave.

376
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,200
Do you like this cup?

377
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,450
I love it. It's so pretty.

378
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,700
If you don't mind,

379
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,910
you can have it.

380
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,000
Really?

381
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,080
Yes.

382
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,160
For both of us supporting
the rainbow community.

383
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,250
Thank you.

384
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,160
Cheers.

385
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,540
Cheers.

386
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,540
Morning.

387
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,640
Morning.

388
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,950
Morning, Zhao Xi.

389
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,290
Do you want some breakfast?

390
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,160
What do you have?

391
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,450
Sandwiches.

392
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,620
Zhao Xi, you're being really nice today.

393
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,910
I'll take one.

394
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,080
I'll give you all.

395
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,370
I love you.

396
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,700
Zhao Xi,

397
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,120
what do I have today?

398
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,160
Buns.

399
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,330
Did you line up to buy them early?

400
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,170
Of course.

401
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,750
But why are these buns cold?

402
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,000
Then don't eat them.

403
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,500
I never said that.

404
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,120
Give them back. I want them.

405
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,040
Jenny Yang. My dad hasn't
seen you for a while.

406
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,370
Come over for dinner when you're free.

407
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,870
If I accept,

408
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,200
won't it make me seem too available?

409
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,120
Don't worry, my dad will cook up
a feast with all your favorite dishes.

410
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,960
How about that?

411
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,580
You said it.

412
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,910
You'd better keep your word.

413
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,950
I'll be there.

414
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,870
My dad invited you, not me.

415
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,290
Even cold, it's still good.

416
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,910
Wow, this move.

417
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,790
So white.

418
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,660
Wow, this pose.

419
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,410
So big.

420
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,750
But sweetie, how did you hurt your leg?

421
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,500
Oh, this makes my heart ache.

422
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,340
Hey.

423
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,290
What's so white and big?
That's not how you describe it.

424
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,410
Or do you think their legs
are white and big?

425
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,880
Don't judge me, buzzkill.

426
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,990
The dorm rooms have been assigned.

427
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,540
There you go.

428
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,690
(Sticky Note)
Really? How did you know?

429
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,830
What's so happy? Winning the lottery?

430
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,620
Go see the legs.

431
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,620
Mind your own business.

432
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,660
You have no sense of beauty.

433
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,040
It's fine. Sheng Wang doesn't look.

434
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,450
I'll take a good look.

435
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,540
I just ran into Old He.
He gave me the keys.

436
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'll definitely swap out those two boys.

437
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,790
(Sticky Note: Which room?)
What?

438
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,370
Are you hurt?

439
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,370
Any injuries?

440
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,750
(Boys' Dorm)
Seems fine.

441
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,500
Keep it up. Keep it up.

442
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,460
At this moment,

443
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,450
I finally feel like I'm going to
live in the dorm.

444
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,440
Tell me it's true.

445
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,000
Be safe.

446
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,200
- It's true.
- Be safe.

447
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,800
Did you see the dorm?

448
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,700
- How is it?
- Great. Great.

449
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,830
You could skip the next class
to check it out.

450
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,460
Are you going to get me killed?

451
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,410
Big Mouth... I mean.

452
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,370
Director Xu.

453
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,540
One's for sneak shots,
and the other's for peeking.

454
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,790
Quite the setup, huh?

455
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,790
Go back to your classroom.

456
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,540
Hold on.

457
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,410
Are you in a relationship?

458
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,620
You're at that puberty stage,

459
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,910
curious about everything

460
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,660
and pushing boundaries.

461
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,080
You're good-looking,

462
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,410
so it's natural for people
to be interested.

463
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:34,660
Some girls, who are
a bit bold and rebellious,

464
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,290
might be attracted to you.

465
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm not in a relationship.

466
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,870
I've been there myself, you know.

467
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,080
I get it.

468
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,000
But, sir, who told you that?

469
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,700
Then who were you texting just now?

470
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,620
Jiang Tian.

471
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,830
No way.

472
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,950
I'm always right about spotting students

473
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,200
who are in a relationship.

474
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,700
You must be in one.

475
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,620
Sir, I'm not.

476
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,330
I was really texting Jiang Tian.

477
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,370
I don't believe it.

478
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,120
Unlock your phone. Now.

479
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,870
Oh, it's Jiang Tian.

480
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,950
Yeah.

481
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,700
That's my bad.

482
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,200
But you know,

483
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,700
you should remember what I said

484
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,290
and focus on your studies.

485
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,950
You're a talented student.

486
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,790
I hope you can focus on your studies,

487
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,790
enjoy high school,
and finish your coursework.

488
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,870
Everything else can wait.

489
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,200
Don't let anything distract you.

490
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,330
This is contraband.

491
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,580
I'll take it.

492
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,250
Go back to your classroom.

493
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,500
Sheng Wang.

494
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,830
Hold on for a while.

495
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,540
No phone,

496
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,090
but I have this.

497
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,590
What do you think?

498
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,290
Don't you want it?

499
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,580
Hey.

500
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,090
I want it.

501
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,080
It's my promise to you.

502
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,580
A fresh start.

503
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,000
Let's live together then.

504
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,540
Okay.

505
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,330
Once we get home,

506
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,160
grab your stuff,
and we'll head to the dorm.

507
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,830
Okay.

508
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,450
And if you need anything,
we'll buy it later.

509
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,460
Okay.

510
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,540
What about your phone?

511
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,000
Whatever.

512
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,040
I asked Gao Tianyang.

513
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,830
He asked Little Mouth Xu,

514
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,580
but he didn't dare to ask his dad.

515
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,200
But, he's got guts

516
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,540
and asked Old He.

517
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,910
He said there are two options.

518
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,500
Option one, write an apology letter

519
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,080
until Big Mouth Xu is happy.

520
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,950
Option two,

521
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,790
have my dad come over.

522
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,040
So...

523
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,870
Option one, my poor handwriting

524
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,250
would give Big Mouth Xu a stroke.

525
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,790
I can't write that.

526
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,790
Option two, have my dad come over.

527
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,950
He's too busy to come.

528
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,200
And if I tell him, he'll probably

529
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,290
just give me money for a new phone.

530
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,580
My dad might not be great

531
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,830
at everything,

532
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,160
but he's always generous with money.

533
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,750
I believe that.

534
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,080
You bought a fridge for Old Man Ding.

535
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,660
Remember?

536
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,290
Oh, yeah.

537
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,830
Don't worry.

538
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,370
He'll be good to you too.

539
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,410
Oh, after we go to the dorm,

540
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,750
come with me to the phone store.

541
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,710
Okay.

542
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,540
Hello, Mom?

543
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,370
What?

544
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,950
Excuse me, may I ask

545
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,120
if Jiang Tian and Sheng Wang live here?

546
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,410
One moment please.

547
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,370
Oh, thanks.

548
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,500
Yes, they are.

549
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,870
And who are you two?

550
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,160
Oh, I'm Jiang Tian's mother.

551
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,620
I'm Sheng Wang's father.

552
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,540
So,

553
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,330
what's their relationship?

554
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,250
They're brothers.

555
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,540
Mom.

556
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,460
Hey.

557
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,160
- Old Sheng?
- Hey, son.

558
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,750
What are you doing here?

559
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,830
Aren't you flying to Shenzhen this noon?

560
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,580
Wang, your dad was worried about you,

561
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,290
so he put work off to tomorrow afternoon.

562
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,000
He also changed his flight
to tomorrow morning.

563
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,040
I just wanted to get you settled
before leaving.

564
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,410
It's more reassuring that way.

565
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,120
What? You don't want to see us?

566
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,450
- Let me take it.
- I'll take it.

567
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,410
Let me show you the way.

568
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,040
Okay. Let's go.

569
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,080
Let's go.

570
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,910
Hey, Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian
are brothers.

571
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,790
Did you know that?

572
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,040
I can't believe it.

573
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,290
Hey, let's go online and post it.

574
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,580
This way.

575
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,830
We live in Room 501.

576
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,290
Wow, your dorm is huge.

577
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,790
501? Let me have a look.

578
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,830
Some students have already moved in.

579
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,660
Hello, you guys.

580
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,250
- Let me take this.
- Hi, ma'am.

581
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,450
- Come on in.
- Hello.

582
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,700
Hello, sir.

583
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,910
Their room is big.

584
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:13,830
Not bad.

585
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,950
Gao Tianyang?

586
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,330
What are you doing here?

587
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,370
Sheng?

588
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,660
Tian?

589
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,200
I should be asking why you're here.

590
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,290
Didn't you say you weren't moving in?

591
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,160
Did you change your mind?

592
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,120
Don't worry about us.

593
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,540
What about you? Why did you move in?

594
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,160
Ever heard of "a cunning rabbit
has three burrows"?

595
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,000
Oh, right.

596
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,370
He's Shi Yu, from Class B.

597
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,700
Hi, I'm Shi Yu.

598
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,750
I know you.

599
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,410
You know me?

600
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,580
I keep a low profile in Class B.

601
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,950
I don't know how low profile
you are in your class,

602
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,830
but you sure stand out on the court.

603
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,870
You stepped on me six times.

604
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,500
- I'm sorry.
- No worries.

605
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,080
Shi Yu and I picked this bunk,

606
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,120
so the one inside is for you.

607
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,870
Wang, son, come here.

608
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,540
Alright, listen.

609
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,870
Since Tian is the elder brother,

610
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,410
he'll take the bottom bunk.

611
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,370
I'm only a few months younger.

612
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,790
Why do I have to take the top?

613
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,750
Well,

614
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,000
you can wait for the next life.

615
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,660
Maybe you'll have a chance then.

616
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,950
You two are good brothers, right?

617
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,120
You should take care of each other.

618
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,330
Hey, hey, hey.

619
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,120
You must be thirsty.

620
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,790
We'll go get water. Go.

621
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,450
- Okay, let's go.
- Stop nagging.

622
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,870
- Alright.
- Let's go.

623
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,200
When did you two become brothers?

624
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,410
I was just wondering

625
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,540
why only one set of parents showed up.

626
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,290
Real brothers?

627
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,290
Yeah.

628
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,620
Come on, Tian.

629
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,790
I've known you since we were little.

630
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,250
How could I not know you
had a long-lost brother?

631
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,580
We just met each other.

632
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,620
What's going on?

633
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,540
Long story short,

634
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,620
we're both single-parent kids.

635
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,910
This is my dad. This is his mom.

636
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,950
And, there are the two of us.

637
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,250
Now they're a couple,

638
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,620
so we're...

639
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,120
That's it.

640
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,540
So you really are brothers.

641
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,660
But you two as a duo

642
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,290
is just crazy.

643
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,540
Yeah.

644
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,370
Two handsome and smart guys

645
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,750
are family.

646
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,500
Handsome?

647
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,410
Only the elder brother is handsome.

648
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,370
What do you mean?

649
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,830
Are you saying you're
the only handsome one,

650
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,000
brother?

651
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,450
Be good.

652
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,300
You...

653
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,140
Hey,

654
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,000
Tian is older than you.

655
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,370
You should call him elder brother.

656
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,830
Gao Tianyang...

657
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,500
Alright, just kidding.

658
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,790
But,

659
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,620
little brother, listen to
your big brother, okay?

660
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,700
Come on. Let's tidy up.

661
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:04,330
They even bicker over
sharing a bunk bed.

662
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,910
Do you think they'll
get used to living here?

663
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,290
You're worrying too much.

664
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,120
Since they decided to move into the dorm,

665
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,200
do you think they won't
look out for each other?

666
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,370
You're right.

667
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,750
They've grown up.

668
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,080
I should let them go.

669
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,580
Exactly, Dad Sheng.

670
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,540
Let's go.

671
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,250
Breaking news! Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian
from Class 2A are brothers!

672
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,410
For real? But they have
different last names!

673
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,410
I heard they're living together.

674
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,950
Wow, choosing between the older
and younger brother is tough.

675
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,160
Do you know Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian

676
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,540
are actually brothers?

677
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,790
It's gone viral on the school forum now.

678
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,790
It's 5000% trending.

679
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,790
Isn't that great?

680
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,160
Now it's easier for you, fangirl.

681
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,120
Are you jealous of their good-looking family?

682
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,750
Do I look like a fangirl?

683
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,750
Yes.

684
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,040
Women liking pretty boys
is an eternal rule.

685
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,450
If you're into it, I can be one of them.

686
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,160
You? Forget it.

687
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
You're more like a middle-aged,

688
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,410
greasy guy.

689
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,950
Since when did you become
a hardcore player,

690
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,790
Jenny Yang?

691
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,290
Then why do you always
act so silly, Zhao Xi?

692
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,580
Seriously? I'm a 30-year-old man.

693
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,870
If you like pretty boys,

694
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,950
I can play along.

695
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,370
Are you really not going to consider it?

696
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,500
Zhao Xi, you're so annoying.

697
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,580
Go away.

698
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,290
Fine, I'm leaving.

699
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,120
Then no bubble tea for you.

700
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,700
What? You brought bubble tea.

701
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,000
Smart move. Give it to me.

702
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,840
I want it.

703
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,040
Give it to me!

704
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,750
Oh, man.

705
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,870
It's so sweet.

706
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,450
This one's not sweet enough today.

707
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,200
It is sweet.

708
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,950
You think it's not sweet?

709
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,250
It's fine. It's healthy to have
less sweet drinks sometimes.

710
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,540
- Oh, no need to walk us out.
- Here we are.

711
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,830
You don't need to walk us out.

712
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,160
Oh, don't talk to him like that.

713
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,000
Is he insisting on
walking us for a reason?

714
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,870
He means well.

715
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,540
Dad,

716
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,540
my teacher confiscated my phone

717
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,660
and said you have to get it back.

718
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,290
See? I told you.

719
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,200
I was going to buy a new one myself,

720
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,120
but

721
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,500
you're here now.

722
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,910
When you need me, you call me Dad.

723
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,500
When you don't, you just
call me Old Sheng.

724
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,870
Alright, I'll go get it for you.

725
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,160
Really?

726
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,500
Then I'll take you to him.

727
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,080
- Let's go.
- Go.

728
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,960
Jiang Tian!

729
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,790
Jiang Tian,

730
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,500
let's live in the dorm together.

731
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,410
You and I,

732
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,090
together.

733
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,080
Thank you.

734
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,910
Actually, we can give it a try.

735
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,620
Try what?

736
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:55,700
Try to get closer.

737
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,540
I used to value the past
because I've never lived in the moment.

738
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,750
But now that I do,

739
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,750
the past doesn't matter as much.

740
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,330
From now on,

741
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,080
I'll always be by your side.

742
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:21,290
