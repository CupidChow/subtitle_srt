1
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,620
Now, let's move on to

2
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,040
a cultural museum that I really like,

3
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,000
called the Alhambra Palace.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,700
It's located in Granada, southern Spain.

5
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,700
In 1984, it was included
in the World Cultural Heritage List.

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,160
Generally, Spanish architecture

7
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,830
is mostly Catholic.

8
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,620
But the Alhambra Palace
is in Eastern Islamic style.

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,620
This is because, in 711 AD,

10
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,870
the Moors led the Arabs

11
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,330
to invade the Iberian Peninsula,

12
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,700
which is now Spain and Portugal.

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,040
Then, Muhammad I

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,620
built the Alhambra Palace,

15
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,870
mainly as a defensive fortress.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,370
It wasn't until 1492,

17
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,330
after Spain completed the Reconquista,

18
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,120
that the Moors were driven out.

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,080
Since then,

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,750
the Alhambra Palace has been a deserted

21
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,330
and abandoned site for centuries.

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,830
Does anyone have any questions so far?

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,830
No.

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,370
What's wrong?

25
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,450
Do you dislike Spain

26
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,290
or the Reconquista?

27
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,660
I just don't like history.

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,620
History is merely
a grim record of invasions

29
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,500
about the conquers,

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,160
new borders,

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,950
new nations,

32
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,160
and new territories.

33
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,750
What?

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,250
Did I say something wrong?

35
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,700
Not really,

36
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,870
but...

37
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,790
It's precisely these movements
and advancements

38
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,450
that broke down walls

39
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,750
and allowed love

40
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,290
to spread throughout the world.

41
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,540
And

42
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,500
because of these so-called boundaries,

43
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,660
we get the chance
to enter each other's worlds

44
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,290
and understand one another.

45
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,790
So, do you think
I'm invading your world now,

46
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,450
or are you invading mine?

47
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,250
I just don't like history.

48
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,830
And then, they left it abandoned
for centuries,

49
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,950
until 1828,

50
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,840
when King Ferdinand VII of Spain

51
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
began restoration...

Let's catch up on the progress today.

68
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,660
(Physics)
We're covering

69
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,950
Chapters 9 and 10.

70
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,870
Sheng Wang.

71
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,790
What are you doing here?

72
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,540
Didn't the doctor tell you
to go home and rest for 15 days?

73
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,410
Look at your ankle.

74
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,120
Sir, I can stay in the dorm.

75
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,250
I don't need to go home.

76
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,120
Let me ask you.

77
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,330
Which floor is your dorm on?

78
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,540
Fifth floor.

79
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,830
And your classroom?

80
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,790
Second floor.

81
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,750
If you don't go home,

82
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,660
how will you handle those stairs?

83
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,950
Will someone carry you?

84
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,040
Who will help you with the bathroom,

85
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,620
bathing, dressing, and undressing?

86
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,540
Even though the dorm
has anti-slip flooring,

87
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,120
you might still fall.

88
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
What if you bump into the door

89
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,160
or the floor, and get hurt again?

90
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,460
Sir.

91
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,410
My fault. I'll go home now.

92
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,830
I'll go with you.

93
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,170
Gao Tianyang, sit down.

94
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,750
Jiang Tian, you take
Sheng Wang downstairs.

95
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,700
Sir, I'll go then.

96
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,750
Okay. Focus here. Let's continue.

97
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,870
Trying to skip class, huh?

98
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,910
I've sent you the recordings
of the classes.

99
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,450
Don't forget to listen to
and review them.

100
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,750
Okay.

101
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,410
You don't need to take this week's test,

102
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,330
but there will be
another one when you return,

103
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,620
so you still need to study.

104
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,830
Got it, Sheng Wang?

105
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,910
Got it. Thank you, sir.

106
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,410
You should thank Jiang Tian.

107
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,950
He reminded us to record the classes.

108
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,250
Oh...

109
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,700
Even though you're family,

110
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,540
you should still thank your brother.

111
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,410
Understand?

112
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,200
Yeah, I got it.

113
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
Bye, sir.

114
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,080
May I come in?

115
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,200
Oh, sure.

116
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,160
Wang,

117
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,250
are you taking a break or studying?

118
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,580
Oh, I'm taking a break.

119
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,120
Here,

120
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,580
- have some fruit while you rest.
- Oh, okay.

121
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,790
Wait, don't move.

122
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,250
Be careful with your ankle.

123
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,540
Do you like apples or pears?

124
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,410
Or, maybe this seasonal fruit
is better. Here.

125
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,500
It's okay, Ms. Jiang. I'll do it myself.

126
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,410
Wang.

127
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,250
If you need anything

128
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,370
or want to do something,

129
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,290
just call me.

130
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,700
I'll bring it to you.

131
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,240
Feel free to ask for anything.

132
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,790
Do you need to change your medication?

133
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,540
I'll go downstairs and get it for you.

134
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,870
Oh, no need.

135
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,700
Or, what do you want to eat?

136
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,120
I'll go get it for you right now.

137
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,290
Really, it's okay, Ms. Jiang.

138
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,540
It's just my ankle that hurts.

139
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,910
Everything else is fine.

140
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,830
Alright then.

141
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,580
Have a good rest.

142
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,830
Eat more fruit.

143
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,670
Yeah.

144
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,790
If you need anything,

145
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,120
just call me.

146
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,450
I'll be here to help.

147
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,660
Oh, sure.

148
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,750
Hey, Ms. Jiang.

149
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,340
Ms. Jiang...

150
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,120
Your phone.

151
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,450
Ms. Jiang,

152
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,040
you don't have to do this.

153
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,450
I know you're doing this

154
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,160
because you miss Jiang Tian.

155
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,870
But I want to let you know,

156
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,330
Tian is doing really well in the dorm.

157
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,950
I don't know what happened
between you two before,

158
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,330
but he's pretty happy now

159
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,540
and doesn't blame you.

160
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,750
He thinks that as long as you're okay,

161
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,040
he'll be okay.

162
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,410
And if you and my dad are okay,

163
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,790
I'll be happy.

164
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,120
Thank you.

165
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,830
I told my dad about this before.

166
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,410
I'm not sure if he told you.

167
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,700
We're family.

168
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,160
Thank you, Wang.

169
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,700
Wang, we're heading out now.

170
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,160

(Sticky Note: I didn't know our house
was so quiet during the day.)

194
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,370
Is he in a PE class?

195
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,500
Or did he leave his phone
in the classroom?

196
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:15,140
(Sticky Note)
I really didn't want to go home.

197
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,960
Now I'm bored.

198
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,240

The power's out!

209
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,290
Seriously?

210
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,290
- The power's out...
- Tonight...

211
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,290
There won't be any self-study classes!

212
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,620
Yes!

213
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,250
Why do you look so happy?

214
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,370
Where are you going?

215
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,200
It's a secret.

216
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,120
A secret?

217
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,080
What about you?

218
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Do you wanna go to Room 208
for some charcoal hot pot?

219
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,040
I don't have time.

220
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,200
No time?

221
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,370
Hot pot?

222
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,050
Isn't the power out?

223
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,500
Oh, you're using a small stove?

224
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,950
You know we aren't allowed
to use that stuff in the dorm.

225
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,250
Shh!

226
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,000
Shi,

227
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,370
it's a secret.

228
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,000
Alright, a secret.

229
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,870
Tian, do you wanna go to Room 208...

230
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,750
No.

231
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,950
But since you're going,

232
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,750
can I borrow your rechargeable lamp?

233
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,160
Sure, but for what?

234
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,290
To organize something.

235
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,420
Organize what?

236
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,660
Interesting exam questions.

237
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,700
Wow.

238
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,330
Everyone's thinking about having fun,

239
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,950
and you're thinking about studying?

240
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,250
Tian.

241
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,450
You don't need to do this.

242
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,290
You're already top of the grade.

243
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,500
Wait.

244
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,250
I guess you're doing this

245
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,540
for Sheng, right?

246
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,370
That guy just transferred here

247
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,750
and now he's missing 15 days of class.

248
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,950
It's quite tough for him.

249
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,950
But our school is really over the top.

250
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,250
Weekly tests are bad enough.

251
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,540
Now there's this weird

252
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,540
"bottoming out system".

253
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,290
But it's fine.

254
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,910
Our Sheng is a real whiz.

255
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,290
He won't get kicked out of our class.

256
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,000
He's ranked 79.

257
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,160
That's risky though.

258
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,870
And

259
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,910
he's been bugging me all day,

260
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,120
saying he's bored.

261
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,610
Better give him something to do.

262
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,080
Hey, let me take this call.

263
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,040
Hello?

264
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,540
Yeah.

265
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,040
Okay. I'll go find you now.

266
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,790
OK. OK.

267
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,540
I'm off then.

268
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,410
Where to?

269
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,660
- It's a secret.
- Another secret?

270
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,120
- Bye.
- Another secret, huh?

271
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,120
Alright.

272
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,290
Press it again.

273
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,330
Press it twice. Then it works.

274
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,170
See you.

275
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,940
(Sticky Note)
Jiang Tian. Jiang Tian. Jiang Tian.

276
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,060
Yes.

277
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,810
(Sticky Note)
You said the dorm's out of power?

278
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Has it come back yet?

279
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,840
Not yet.

280
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,840
(Sticky Note)
And you said you had a plan tonight?

281
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:45,910
Yeah.

282
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,860
(Sticky Note)
What is it?

283
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,370
Do you need to leave school?

284
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,900
Yes. I'll go to the Little White House.

285
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,030
(Sticky Note)
Then go ahead. I'll go eat.

286
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,870
What are you going to do?

287
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:23,870
(Unread)

288
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,540
You're right on time.

289
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,250
Let me update you
on this month's accounts.

290
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,910
We're short 6,000 NT$ this month.

291
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,750
That's not a small amount.

292
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,080
What's going on?

293
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,540
What are you rushing for?

294
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,620
I'm wondering if we didn't

295
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,780
get the money from the last delivery.

296
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,520
What do you think?

297
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,290
Got you.

298
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,790
This time, you can't get away with it.

299
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,330
- Isn't this Jenny's kidnapping footage?
- Let me go.

300
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,340
Yeah.

301
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,750
It was really hard to find this footage.

302
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,500
Then the school had a power cut,

303
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,910
so I have to use your computer.

304
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,790
Is it that urgent

305
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,410
to check some footage?

306
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,540
I don't like to put things off.

307
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,160
You're just like Jenny,

308
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,330
getting impulsive when you're worked up.

309
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,120
That makes sense.

310
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,330
If I weren't impulsive,

311
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,040
you might not be alive today, right?

312
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,660
This says "Please touch."

313
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
"Please touch"?

314
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,910
See? Come and look.

315
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,580
Yeah, "Please touch."

316
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,330
Here we go. D-o-g.

317
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,290
Dog.

318
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,620
Hey! What are you doing?

319
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:20,910
None of your business.

320
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,370
This is a historic site.

321
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,120
A historic site? So?

322
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,450
It says "Do not touch",

323
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,290
but you keep touching it.

324
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,910
How is that important?

325
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,330
Don't touch it.

326
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,080
These things have witnessed
200 years of Tamsui's history.

327
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,700
Tamsui? What sway?

328
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,120
And you're littering
with cigarette butts.

329
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,580
What are you going to do about it?

330
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,950
Please leave now.

331
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,800
Say that again.

332
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,790
- Say that again.
- Please leave now.

333
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,000
Say it one more time.

334
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,950
Got a big group, so what?

335
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,500
Not really.

336
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,700
Just one more person than you.

337
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,910
What do you want?

338
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,870
What do you want?

339
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,950
Come back!

340
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,700
- Don't run!
- Stay there!

341
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,210
Don't run!

342
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,430
You heard me?

343
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,620
Don't run!

344
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,040
Let's go.

345
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,160
Come. Quickly.

346
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,500
Good thing I ran into you.

347
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,700
I'm terrible at fighting.

348
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,160
I'd have gotten beaten up badly.

349
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,870
Thanks.

350
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,750
No worries.

351
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,540
Do you also study at NTU?

352
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:16,830
Yeah.

353
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,040
You too?

354
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,910
Senior, Physics.

355
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,200
History, sophomore.

356
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,830
Do you like history?

357
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,700
Yeah.

358
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
I'm working on a paper
about the history of this area.

359
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,790
So I'm here for field research.

360
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,290
What about you, senior?

361
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,000
Do you like physics?

362
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,410
I chose it because it lets me

363
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,120
see a different world.

364
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,950
Also,

365
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,500
my dad doesn't get physics.

366
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,700
so knowing it is cool for me.

367
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,750
Actually, I've always had a dream.

368
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,910
I want to open a coffee shop here

369
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,120
and make my own history.

370
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,040
That sounds awesome.

371
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,870
Senior,

372
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,700
if you do open it,

373
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,080
please count me in.

374
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,960
Deal.

375
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,290
Remember now?

376
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,700
You owe me a life, don't you?

377
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,660
So I came back with you.

378
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,620
We opened this shop together.

379
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,450
And I even work as your waiter.

380
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,370
Did I force you to do that?

381
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,910
Do you know

382
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,790
why I agreed to come back with you?

383
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,330
Let me take this call.

384
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,000
Hello, Jenny Yang?

385
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,620
Did you need something?

386
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,800
Okay.

387
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,450
Going shopping with me, huh?

388
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,330
I'd rather not, honestly.

389
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,040
Really? I'll go back then.

390
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,120
I tried so hard to ask you out,
but you ignored me.

391
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,910
Eventually, I had to give up.

392
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Thanks for giving up on me.

393
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,540
Now I like someone else.

394
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,750
You were discarded.

395
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,790
Just do your job

396
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,000
and help me pick a gift for him.

397
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,910
Understand?

398
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Yes.

399
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,580
Hey, look.

400
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,790
What about this one?

401
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,790
It has a flower pattern.

402
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,750
You want me to be honest?

403
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,600
Yeah.

404
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,540
It sucks.

405
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,540
Have you ever seen a guy
with something like this on his desk?

406
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,040
If you're giving a gift,
make it practical.

407
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,450
Something he can use every day.

408
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,540
Alright. You do have a good point.

409
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,200
What about this? It's a cup.

410
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,040
What do you think?

411
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,000
Do you mean no, or just don't know?

412
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,500
I don't know.

413
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,330
Are you a guy or not?

414
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,750
You can't even handle this?

415
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,640
I'm a guy.

416
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,750
But I don't know what your guy likes.

417
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,870
Think it over, okay?

418
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,080
Oh.

419
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,950
This is it.

420
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,790
He'll love this cup.

421
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:22,020
(What are you going to do?)
(Unread)

422
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,490
(Sticky Note)
I'm finished eating.

423
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,960
How much longer will it take
to get your stuff done?

424
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:47,970
I'm done.

425
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,020
(Sticky Note)
So soon?

426
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,360
What's wrong?

427
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,560
(Sticky Note)
Nothing.

428
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,180
Did you go back to school?

429
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,090
Not yet.

430
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,820
On my way.

431
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:24,100

(Sticky Note)
Where are you now?

434
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,850
I'll be at the west gate
after I cross the road.

435
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,430
(Sticky Note)
Are you really here?

436
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,520
How come I don't see you?

437
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,620
The power's back on!

438
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,950
Hey, where are you going?

439
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:10,830
Picking someone up.

440
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,160
Running so fast?

441
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,910
I'm gonna shower today.

442
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,160
Yay!

443
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,830
Excuse me.

444
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,020
Where are you?

445
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,620
Did you sneak over there...

446
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,370
Or...

447
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,580
You came from the dorm, didn't you?

448
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,580
You tricked me.

449
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,330
Never mind.

450
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,910
At least you showed up in time.

451
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,500
I forgive you.

452
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,000
So you can walk by yourself now?

453
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,040
Yeah.

454
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,950
It's okay. I can do it...

455
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,290
By myself.

456
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,370
Who took you here?

457
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,500
Ms. Sun.

458
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,790
I had to beg her a lot
before she finally agreed.

459
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,540
Oh, you know what?

460
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,830
She's been making

461
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,910
pig's feet for me lately.

462
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,410
Most people get bone broth for injuries.

463
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,370
But why does she
keep making pig's feet?

464
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,200
You are what you eat.

465
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,040
What's that supposed to mean?

466
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,410
Are you calling me a pig?

467
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,700
What? Have I...

468
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,120
Have I changed in any way?

469
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,410
Yes.

470
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,250
What is it?

471
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,080

Wow, you really do stink.

510
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,750
I just had charcoal hot pot.

529
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,830

Oh.

The power's back on.

534
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,200
I'll take a shower.

535
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,700
Wait, wait.

536
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,290
What did you just say?

537
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,580
"The same reason"?

538
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,040
What were you doing
at the dating hotspot?

539
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,620
Did you...

540
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,040
I'm off to shower.

541
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,700
Hey! I should be the first...

542
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,870
Hey.

543
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,330
Should we remind him?

544
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,500
Of what?

545
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,120
Being in a relationship
will mess with his studies.

546
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,410
Teachers can say that to him.

547
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,660
But if you tell him that,

548
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,200
you might get punched.

549
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,290
That's right.

550
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,790
But as Shi's best buddy,

551
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,450
I think I should tell him that.

552
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:35,080
To be, or not to be,

553
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,080
what should I do?

554
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,620
- Go away, you bumpkin. You stink.
- What should I do?

555
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,660
Go away.

00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,080

00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,410
You're sleeping in my bed.

560
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,250
I made it to the fifth floor.

561
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,540
Do you think I can't handle these steps?

562
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,580
Do you think I'm asking
for your opinion?

563
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,700
And you can take off your bandages now.

564
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,330
What should I change into?

565
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,000
This one.

566
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,500
It's more breathable.

567
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,200
Your foot.

568
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,830
Does it hurt?

569
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,450
You came from the dorm, didn't you?

570
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,870
Fine. Stop calling me fat.

571
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,750
Fame portends trouble for men

572
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,120
just as

573
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,700
fattening does for pigs.

574
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,620
I made it to the fifth floor.

575
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,870
Do you think I can't handle these steps?

576
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,040
Do you think I'm asking
for your opinion?

577
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,500
Does it hurt?

578
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,770
(DYHS)

579
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,830
You're awake.

580
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:34,890
I got you breakfast.

581
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,910
And

582
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:47,580
Little Pepper asked me
to give you

583
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,950
these homemade cookies

584
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,040
and wish you a speedy recovery.

585
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,090
Oh.

586
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,830
Leave some cookies for me.

587
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,250
I'll take the card.

588
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,450
You can keep the cookies.

589
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,450
Really?

590
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,870
I love you so much!

591
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,000
Alright. Let's go.

592
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,200
We're gonna be late for class.

593
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,540
See you.

594
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,750
Don't miss me too much.

595
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,410
Just stay in the dorm

596
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,160
and don't run around, okay?

597
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,120
Your ankle isn't healed yet.

598
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,540
Got it.

599
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,870
I'll just take a leave of absence.

600
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,000
Then I'll jump back to the classroom.

601
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,370
Alright, I'll go

602
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,500
and record the lectures for you.

603
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,040
These kids, none of them can behave.

604
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,410
Who's causing trouble now?

605
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,870
Who else? The one
with the sprained ankle

606
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,040
insisted on coming to school.

607
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,950
Sheng Wang?

608
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,200
He came to school?

609
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,040
The problem is his ankle isn't healed.

610
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,910
How can he attend classes
with all the stairs?

611
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,040
He should just rest at home.

612
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,580
Exactly.

613
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,000
So why did he come back?

614
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,290
And we'll have

615
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,160
a holiday break starting tomorrow.

616
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
Yeah.

617
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,370
Never mind. Don't talk about him.

618
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,230
I'm off to work.

619
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,080
Okay.

620
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,040
See you.

621
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,790
Alas, none of these students

622
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,790
give us any peace of mind.

623
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,120
So, this cup

624
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,370
is for Linzi, huh?

625
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,040
Well, I mean...

626
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,540
He saved me at the School Anniversary.

627
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,500
I saved you too.

628
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,370
Why don't you give me something?
Playing favorites?

629
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,950
Or do you have feelings

630
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,870
for Linzi?

631
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,350
So what if I do?

632
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,870
Hey.

633
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,870
Aren't you good friends with him?

634
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,590
Can you find out how he feels about me?

635
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,830
This doesn't look like cafeteria food.

636
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,670
Yeah.

637
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,080
Old Man Ding made it?

638
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,330
He's on a vacation.

639
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,250
Then who made it?

640
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,830
Xi and Linzi.

641
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,540
What about the lunch?

642
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,500
They made that too.

643
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,040
Why didn't you...

644
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,580
Even if I could get food
from those hungry ghosts,

645
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,580
would you even eat it,

646
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,120
picky eater?

647
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,950
So I asked Xi and Linzi for a favor.

648
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,200
Guys,

649
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,120
I'll see you around.

650
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,500
You're going?

651
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,410
Yeah.

652
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,000
I won't walk you out then.

653
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,370
- See you.
- Happy holiday.

654
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,250
Happy holiday break. Bye.

655
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,120
Bye.

656
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,250
How could I be so dumb?

657
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,250
Why did I rush over yesterday?

658
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,580
You were going home

659
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,040
tomorrow anyway.

660
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,450
What was I doing here?

661
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,910
I'm so dumb.

662
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,450
It's not that bad.

663
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,950
At least you can catch up
on the classes you missed

664
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,870
and review for the weekly test.

665
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,120
Eat up.

666
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,700
Then do the exercises.

667
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,160
You can't go to sleep
until you're finished.

668
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,000
How could you do this to me?

669
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,620
Eat.

670
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,620
No.

671
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,700
Eat first, then do the exercises.

672
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:07,790
Fine, I'll do it now.

673
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,790
I just read an article titled

674
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,870
"Why do we need sleep?"

675
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,370
"Everyone knows that sleep is important,

676
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:18,950
but have you ever wondered why?

677
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,000
What exactly happens while we sleep?"

678
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,580
Okay.

679
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,540
Aren't you good friends with him?

680
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,330
Can you find out how he feels about me?

681
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,200
What?

682
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,200
May I take your order now?

683
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,660
Why are you up?

684
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,750
Jiang Tian?

685
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,000
What's wrong?

686
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,160
Did you get out of bed?

687
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,750
No, why?

688
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,580
What did you see?

689
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,290
Oh, nothing.

690
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,910
Maybe I got it wrong.

691
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,200
Go back to sleep.

692
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:29,250
Mmm.

693
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,090
What's wrong?

694
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,700
No way.

695
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,580
Students, gather in the hallway.

696
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,200
Everyone, come together.

697
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,640
Please come together.

698
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,620
Here's the thing, everyone.

699
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,620
There's been an issue in the dorm.

700
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,580
I've called the police.

701
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,950
It looks like a thief broke in,

702
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,620
thinking no one was here
during the holiday break.

703
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,250
He was probably trying to
steal laptops or electronics to sell.

704
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,620
The police said there have been
several similar cases lately.

705
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,950
Stay alert until they catch the thief.

706
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,120
If you're scared,

707
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,000
you can switch rooms or bunk together.

708
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,540
You could also go home
for a few days. Safety first.

709
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,910
Let me know if you're going home.

710
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,540
Alright. Let's go back to sleep.

711
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,080
- Thank you, sir.
- In the next few days,

712
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,250
make sure to lock
your doors and windows,

713
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,290
- okay?
- Okay.

714
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:48,160
Go back to sleep.
Nothing to worry about.

715
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,700
My PSP's been stolen.

716
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,330
Okay. We called the police.

717
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,420
The door's locked.

718
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,040
Go back to sleep.

719
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,950
Oh.

720
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:22,450
Are you scared?

721
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,580
No, it's just...

722
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:31,120
The dorm supervisor said
we could bunk together,

723
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,450
but we can't since we have bunk beds.

724
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,370
So how about

725
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,370
we share my bed?

726
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,290
I can't do it anymore.

727
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:43,990
Hey, go sleep in your room.

728
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,000
Who practices this hard?

729
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,120
I'm exhausted.

730
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,080
Sheng Wang. Get up.

731
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,540
I'm too sleepy.

732
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,450
Sheng Wang.

733
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:56,950

Changing my seat.

You sit in front.

777

I do.

And,

783
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,660
because of these
so-called boundaries,

784
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,910
we get the chance
to enter each other's worlds

785
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,410
and understand one another.

786
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,950
Holding someone like this

787
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,370
means we're friends.

788
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:35,390
But I think we're more than friends.

789
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,870

I'm invading your world now,
