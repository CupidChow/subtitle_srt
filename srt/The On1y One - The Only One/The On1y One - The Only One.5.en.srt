1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,000
New teachers.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,770
So handsome.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,660
Hey.

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,000
You guys are so dramatic.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,200
Be quiet.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,290
I know you're all excited
and looking forward to this.

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,950
I will go

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,830
to attend a teaching seminar soon.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,870
So I won't be able to teach you as often.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,910
That's why I've invited Mr. Zhao Xi,

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,790
to co-teach your science classes with me.

12
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,950
And by the way,

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,870
this is Mr. Lin Beiting, your new history

14
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,160
and geography teacher.

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,660
Let me tell you.

16
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,330
Both of them are outstanding talents
who studied abroad.

17
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,290
And believe me, their alma mater
will blow your mind.

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,290
So make sure you learn well from them.

19
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,790
Now, I'll let the two teachers
introduce themselves.

20
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,200
Hello, everyone.

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,370
My name is Zhao Xi.

22
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,500
I'm a graduate of this school,

23
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,290
and I'm also from Tamsui.

24
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,750
I am not a graduate of this school,

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,540
but I love Tamsui people.

26
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,660
My name is Lin Beiting.

27
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,290
Ask me if you have questions
about geography or history.

28
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,450
Okay.

29
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,660
Welcome them.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,290
Now, I'll hand over

31
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,290
this physics class to Mr. Zhao Xi.

32
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,580
Be nice to him, okay?

33
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,660
- Okay.
- See you.

34
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,660
- Bye.
- Goodbye, sir.

35
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,580
Okay.

36
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,540
Today I'll teach you a new law.

37
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,220
(Constant)

38
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,910
What law is this?

39
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,830
This is the law

40
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,830
of conservation of energy,

41
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,040
which is also known
as Bernoulli's Law.

42
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,120
- Please sit down.
- Thank you, sir.

43
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,200
We see many examples of Bernoulli's Law

44
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,660
in our daily lives.

45
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,910
Do you know

46
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,410
which is the most common one?

47
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,870
Airplanes.

48
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,000
Changes in the airflow
create varying air pressures,

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,080
which affect the movement
of air currents.

50
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,200
Here are two balls.

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,950
We try to blow them apart.

52
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,120
They come together instead.

53
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,910
Once the wind stops,

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,250
they separate and go back

55
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,750
to their original positions.

56
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,250
This demonstrates...

57
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,500
Bernoulli's Law.

58
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,250
Okay.

59
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,080
Now, everyone, try it out.

60
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,200
I just don't like it.

61
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,160
Make it clear. What don't you like?

62
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,080
I don't like Bernoulli's Law.

63
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,290
And I don't like Qi Jiahao either.

64
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,910
He works too hard.

65
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,480
(Just like now.)

66
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,870
(Who)

67
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,500
(can come to save me?)

68
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,870
(Terrible.)

69
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,200
(This is terrible.)

70
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,200
(Using this trick to keep me
from taking the exam)

71
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
(is awful.)

72
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,910
(I'll never let you guys succeed.)

73
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,040
Quite the fighter, huh?

74
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,830
You're good, man.

75
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,000
Put it down.

76
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,670

Excuse me.

90
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,910
You're late for the test.

91
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,950
Where have you been?

92
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,370
Ma'am, I went to see the doctor.

93
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,910
What's wrong?

94
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,910
Something wrong in my head,

95
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,950
which is why I got tricked.

96
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,410
Ma'am, may I come in?

97
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,790
Sure, go ahead.

98
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,580
You're 12 minutes late.

99
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,120
The listening test is over.

100
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,450
There's no time to lose.

101
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,620
(No time for listening,)

102
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,000
(but there are questions to refer to.)

103
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,540
(The first part is
all individual questions.)

104
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,660
(I can't do it now.)

105
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,710
(For the second part,)

106
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,580
(the conversations align.)

107
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,370
(By identifying
the most frequent words,)

108
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,950
(I can pinpoint the key points)

109
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,370
(and grasp the meaning.)

110
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,660
(By guessing the answers this way,)

111
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,200
(the accuracy will be much higher.)

112
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:07,770
(Then,)

113
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,000
(Part one: multiple-choice questions)

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,790
(go back to the first part.)

115
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,580
(At least I can get a few right.)

116
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,330
Time's up. Stop writing.

117
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,950
Pass your papers to the student ahead.

118
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,950
Since you're guessing,
you might as well pick all Cs.

119
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,450
Otherwise, you might score nothing.

120
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,830
Ma'am, are you an English teacher?

121
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,200
No, I teach geography.

122
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,250
Have you seen the answers for this test?

123
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:54,790
No.

124
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,660
Alright. Your test papers, quickly.

125
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,600
(Students' Cafeteria) (DYHS)

126
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,580
Sheng, Tian. Come here.

127
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,750
We have seats here.

128
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,000
Why are you here?
I called Sheng and Tian.

129
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,250
Sheng.

130
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,870
What happened to
your English test this morning?

131
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,410
Yeah, I heard about it too.

132
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,750
Did you miss the listening test?

133
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,540
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Keep it down.

134
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,170
I don't want to hold
a press conference here.

135
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,010
What?

136
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,210
Someone set you up!

137
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,410
Keep it down.

138
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,700
Anyway,

139
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,200
someone tricked me, saying Jing was
waiting for me at Happiness.

140
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,870
But when I got there, it was closed

141
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,790
and the owner wasn't there.

142
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,830
Then

143
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,330
two punks blocked my way

144
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,040
and we fought.

145
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,950
Did you beat them up?

146
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,080
Did you win?

147
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,290
How's that possible?

148
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,160
Then how did you
make it back to the test?

149
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,700
I took the chance and ran.

150
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,870
I ran as fast as I could,

151
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,910
but I still missed the listening test.

152
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,410
Who's out to get you?

153
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,830
I can ask my dad

154
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,250
if you can retake the listening test.

155
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,330
Would your dad agree to that?

156
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,120
I don't know.

157
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,120
Anyway, I think we should let

158
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,620
Big Mouth Xu know.
He'll handle it.

159
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,790
Whoever did this is really over the line.

160
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,250
Don't you think so?

161
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,250
Yes. Let's go see Director Xu.

162
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,080
Okay, let's go together.

163
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,120
There's strength in numbers.

164
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,080
Go.

165
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,500
Sit down.

166
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,330
I really appreciate it

167
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,870
if you spare my life.

168
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,910
What does that mean?

169
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,500
Last time, after the test,

170
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,080
I got into a fight
and was scolded by him.

171
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,410
This time, if I tell him why I'm late,

172
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,290
he'll find out I fought again

173
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,910
and I'll be in even more trouble.

174
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,500
True, we don't have any evidence.

175
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,250
We can't prove that the two punks

176
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,620
sneaked onto campus
and attacked you.

177
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,700
Alright, I won't go to my dad then.

178
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,830
This is really strange.
I've been wondering

179
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,290
how two outsiders

180
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,540
managed to sneak into our school.

181
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,830
Who do you have a grudge against?

182
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,620
There's only one truth.
I know who it is.

183
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,080
It must be Zhai Tao!

184
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,950
Oh, Zhai Tao.

185
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,290
Who is Zhai Tao?

186
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,540
Zhai Tao,

187
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,160
the jerk who kicked Uncle Mute.

188
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,340
Oh.

189
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,750
What do the two punks look like?

190
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,540
I don't remember much.

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,120
But

192
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,950
they aren't tall, around 1.7 meters

193
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,040
with black hair.

194
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,040
I forgot what they were wearing.

195
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,450
And I don't remember

196
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,830
much else.

197
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,160
I'm not trying to be mean,

198
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,580
but you're really bad

199
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,250
with faces and names.

200
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,160
How am I supposed to figure this out?

201
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,870
Come on, they came to beat me up.

202
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,160
Did they have to introduce themselves?

203
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,790
I don't know their names.

204
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,580
Fair point. You are stupid.

205
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,370
Who usually has your back?

206
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,660
You're getting bold, huh?

207
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,500
Who's got my back?

208
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,910
Who's got my back?

209
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,700
- My dad, of course.
- Stop picking. Just eat.

210
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,700
I'll go to Happiness.

211
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,540
Why?

212
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,500
To buy water.

213
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,410
Buy water?

214
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,410
Doesn't Tian always use a water bottle?

215
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,370
I don't know.

216
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,000
He didn't take any food.

217
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,750
Aren't you done yet?

218
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,910
Are you going to eat it or not?

219
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,580
The knife used for the ribs
must've also cut garlic.

220
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,660
It tastes like shallots and garlic.

221
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,790
I can't eat this.

222
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,750
It's a miracle you've survived so long.

223
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,120
How did you even grow up?

224
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,220
(Happiness)

225
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,380
Mr. Zhao.

226
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,040
Don't you have a test today?

227
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,500
What are you doing here now?

228
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,250
To buy water.

229
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,410
Oh.

230
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,800
(Band-Aid. High-elastic,
waterproof and breathable.)

231
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,040
Are there still any thieves?

232
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,330
Yeah, of course.

233
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,910
At night, it's dark and deserted here.

234
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,040
Impossible to guard against.

235
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,450
Uncle Mute and I have
caught thieves several times.

236
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,410
Why do you need a Band-Aid?

237
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,120
How much?

238
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,880
Here.

239
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,410
Take it.

240
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm off then.

241
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,450
Okay, go back to your test.

242
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,680
(Band-Aid. High-elastic,
waterproof and breathable.)

243
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,660
I bought it while getting water.

244
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,370
Should we pickle the cucumbers

245
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,870
or stir-fry them?

246
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,160
Wang, is that you?

247
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Yes.

248
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,700
Take a rest. We'll have dinner later.

249
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,620
Okay.

250
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,410
Yeah, this one.

251
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,700
This one is okay.

252
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,750
Let me help you.

253
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,660
No need, you can't even hold a bowl.

254
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,870
What are you doing here? Supervising me?

255
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,950
Afraid I'll cook something terrible?

256
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,000
Hello?

257
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,920
Hello.

258
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,540
Are you kidding me?

259
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,540
You only scored two points
on your Chinese writing?

260
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,000
You're as bad as the guy next door.

261
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,450
Are you laughing at me?

262
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,080
I helped you get the answers last time.

263
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,160
- Wang.
- Hey, wait.

264
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,620
Stay back.

265
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,910
The one in the kitchen
is your lifelong partner.

266
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,830
I'll leave you when I turn 18,

267
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,410
or people will think I'm a parasite.

268
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,500
Don't make me look bad.

269
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,500
You little brat.

270
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,120
You know what?

271
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,700
The teacher said my essay

272
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,950
was nonsensical and misused idioms.

273
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,000
Come on, he has no taste.

274
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,200
So, want me to borrow

275
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,870
the Guide to Lyrical Writing
from next door for you?

276
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,000
No need.

277
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,620
Come on. I'm a literary genius.

278
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,750
I don't need that stuff.

279
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,600
(Unfussy Gao Tianyang)
Did you hear the punks got caught?

280
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,160
Hey, Crab, I'll call you back.

281
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,000
What do you...

282
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,040
Hello, Sheng?

283
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,370
How did they get caught?

284
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,410
It was Xi.

285
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,910
They were causing trouble near the café.

286
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,500
Xi beat them up
and sent them to the police.

287
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,450
Also,

288
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,370
Happiness had new monitors.

289
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,290
The incident where you got hit
was caught on tape.

290
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,700
What? What a coincidence.

291
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,160
Just their bad luck.

292
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,580
Xi doesn't know them.

293
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,040
When I told him
they hit you this morning,

294
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,700
he was shocked.

295
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,000
Hey, I'll send you a picture.

296
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,000
See?

297
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,080
This is divine justice.
Karma never fails.

298
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,790
Justice has long arms.

299
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,410
Take care of Wang.

300
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,250
No need.

301
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,580
Is that Tian?

302
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,700
I'll talk to you later.

303
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,620
Tian is here.

304
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,590
What's up?

305
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,790
The two punks who hit me got caught.

306
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,040
Do you know that?

307
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Yes.

308
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,410
Gao Tianyang showed me the live footage.

309
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,620
Was it you?

310
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,080
Was it what?

311
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,750
Everything was captured.

312
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,910
Your shoes.

313
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,910
Impossible.

314
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,000
What's impossible?

315
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,330
I was so far away.

316
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,700
Yes.

317
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,660
It was me.

318
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,160
Tian is back?

319
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah.

320
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,330
Go wash up, tidy yourself,

321
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,910
and get ready for dinner.

322
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,870
Okay.

323
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,660
This noon, I went to Happiness
to buy water

324
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,290
and noticed two monitors there.

325
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,950
The owner probably installed them

326
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,080
to prevent theft.

327
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,290
I got the footage
and sent it to Zhao Xi,

328
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,080
thinking there might be a chance
to catch them

329
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,950
with so many customers at his shop.

330
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,620
But I didn't mention you getting hit.

331
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,870
Just my luck,

332
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,330
the punks caused trouble today.

333
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,830
If I hadn't found out,

334
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,830
would you have told me?

335
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,660
You really love playing the hero,
don't you?

336
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,830
You'd keep it to yourself.

337
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,250
I was just thinking,

338
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,660
you must have been really scared
at the time,

339
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,080
hoping someone would come help you.

340
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,200
But there was no one,

341
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,410
no one at all.

342
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,120
Just you,

343
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,200
two punks from nowhere

344
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,000
and the fear of
whether you could beat them.

345
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,620
If I were you,

346
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,750
I'd probably panic too.

347
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,700
I didn't know back then
and couldn't help you.

348
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,450
But I want to do something.

349
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,120
It's better late than never.

350
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,040
Not a big deal. Don't worry.

351
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,590
What now?

352
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,120
I...

353
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,450
When I fought them this morning,

354
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,790
I twisted my legs.

355
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,790
Can you carry me upstairs?

356
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,330
Hurry up,

357
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,410
before my dad and your mom see us.

358
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,910
Dinner's ready.
Why are you going upstairs?

359
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,910
Here we are.

360
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,910
Thanks.

361
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,870
Aren't you getting off?

362
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,250
Well.

363
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,540
Go big or go home, you know.

364
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,040
Take me to my room.

365
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,330
Open the door.

366
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,950
Thanks, again.

367
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,250
Don't have dinner.

368
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,370
Why?

369
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,500
You need to lose weight.

370
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,120
I take back my thanks.

371
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,910
Wait a minute.

372
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,200
Give me your hand.

373
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,950
Don't get too moved.

374
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,870
You gave me the Band-Aid this morning.

375
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,910
There's still one left.

376
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,120
Does it hurt?

377
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,250
I'm not that meticulous.

378
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,750
If it hurts, just let me know.

379
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,000
Done.

380
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,500
Thanks.

381
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,700
Oh, by the way,

382
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,620
did you hit them hard for me today?

383
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,120
No.

384
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,040
They tried to run past me,

385
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,910
so I just blocked them.

386
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,160
But they hit me six times today.

387
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,500
Did you block them six times?

388
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,330
Definitely more than six times.

389
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:00,410
You two! Come down for dinner!

390
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,700
I'm not eating.

391
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,330
I'm on a diet.

392
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,370
That guy

393
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,620
must have gone back to bed.

394
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,000
I'll send you the samples
as soon as they're ready tomorrow.

395
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,420
Sure.

396
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:15,870
Okay.

397
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,620
Everything's done as we discussed.

398
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,790
Don't worry.

399
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,120
- Alright, bye.
- Breakfast is ready.

400
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,000
Okay.

401
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,290
- Let me get this.
- Thanks.

402
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,870
Wang, good morning.

403
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,790
- Morning.
- Come on.

404
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,290
Sit here.

405
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,120
You finally decided to
come down for a meal.

406
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,870
Wang.

407
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,580
You said you wanted to eat shumai.

408
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,000
I learned how to make it online.

409
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,870
Try it.

410
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:43,250
If you like it,
I'll make it for you again.

411
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,500
Okay.

412
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,660
Where's Jiang Tian?

413
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,500
He went to the Little White House.

414
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,880
Oh.

415
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:59,250
Aren't you two participating
in the English competition today?

416
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,410
Yes,

417
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,330
in the afternoon.

418
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,180
I'll go later.

419
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,250
Good luck.

420
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,830
Dig in.

421
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,040
Yeah, I don't know why.

422
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,790
It just stopped cooling.

423
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,450
Nothing seems wrong.

424
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,000
Nothing is wrong?

425
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,080
Then why isn't it cooling?

426
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,830
Did you accidentally
adjust the temperature?

427
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,330
I didn't do that.

428
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,870
But sometimes it makes a sound,

429
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,160
then stops,

430
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,080
and then makes that weird sound again.

431
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,580
Alright, I've adjusted it back.

432
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,080
That will do?

433
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,000
It will gradually get colder.

434
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,540
Let me know if there's another issue.

435
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,660
Okay.

436
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,910
I'll go then.

437
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,370
Hey, wait.

438
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,290
Where are you rushing off to?
You haven't eaten yet.

439
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,500
I have a competition this afternoon.

440
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,950
I'll go there by subway with someone.

441
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,200
- With someone, huh?
- Yeah.

442
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,250
Who is it?

443
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,120
The one who came
for a free lunch last time.

444
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,080
- Wang?
- Yeah.

445
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,000
How can you talk about him like that?

446
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,580
That boy is well-behaved and polite,

447
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,250
unlike you, always so cold.

448
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,000
He hasn't been here
for lunch in a while.

449
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,830
Does he not like my cooking?

450
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:21,000
No, he said food at school
is worse than yours.

451
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,500
So, does that mean

452
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,620
he likes my cooking?

453
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,160
Then why didn't he come here today?

454
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,500
Did you invite him?

455
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,540
I...

456
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,160
But you could've invited him.

457
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,040
Is that how you treat your friend?

458
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,160
Give me your phone.

459
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,120
What do you want?

460
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,950
Give me that and shut up.

461
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,870
Wang. Wang.

462
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,000
To Wang.

463
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,450
Wang.

464
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,040
Jiang Tian wants you
to come over for lunch.

465
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,200
Come here quickly.

466
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,290
Okay.

467
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,870
I'll go cook.

468
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,790
Oh, my toilet's leaking a bit.

469
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,830
Can you help me with that?

470
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,080
What happened to your hand?

471
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,950
Just a little scratch.

472
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,250
I'll help you with that.

473
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,140
(Lane 6, Sec.1,
Danying Road, Tamsui District)

474
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,910
Wang. Here we go.

475
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,250
Enjoy your lunch.

476
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,410
Dig in.

477
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,200
Where's Jiang Tian?

478
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,000
My house is old.

479
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,910
The toilet pipes are leaking.

480
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,700
He is helping me with that.

481
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,700
Oh.

482
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,660
Dig in.

483
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,540
So he asked me to come over

484
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,750
just for lunch?

485
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,040
Or can I eat here anytime?

486
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,700
Actually, this is my idea.

487
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,660
Oh.

488
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,750
Well...

489
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,870
This dish is...

490
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,410
Please go ahead.

491
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,450
I just want to ask

492
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,620
if Tian had a fight with someone.

493
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I saw he had a Band-Aid

494
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,660
on his hand.

495
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,080
He said it was just a scratch.

496
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,290
But even if I ask,

497
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,410
he won't tell me the truth.

498
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,870
So you invited me over

499
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,160
just to ask about this?

500
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,790
Honestly,

501
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,700
I've never seen Tian

502
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,580
be close to anyone,

503
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,540
not even to me.

504
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:35,790
He doesn't like getting close to people.

505
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,580
So,

506
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,410
he's always been careful

507
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,450
and avoids hurting others.

508
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,790
Maybe because he's been hurt himself,

509
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,370
he understands what it's like

510
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:50,870
and what others need.

511
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,580
You know,

512
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,000
he's like martial arts masters
in swordsmen films.

513
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,040
When people get close,

514
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,750
they'll be pushed away
by his protective aura.

515
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,120
He's been on his own
since he was little.

516
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,330
His grandma and parents neglected his care,

517
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,580
so he shut himself off.

518
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,700
No one knows

519
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,370
what's really going on in his mind,

520
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,660
and he doesn't let anyone in.

521
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,000
So,

522
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,200
no one can get into his inner world.

523
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,040
You're the first person

524
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,000
he has brought over.

525
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,580
So, Wang,

526
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,450
promise me.

527
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,160
Don't let him push you away.

528
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,410
I hope you can get closer to him. Okay?

529
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,390
(Transit map)

530
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,930
(Qi Jiahao)

531
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,580
How should we buy tickets?

532
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,120
So many stops. From where to where?

533
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,000
Use this.

534
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,830
I guess you don't have an EasyCard.

535
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,160
Here you are.

536
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,920
Oh.

537
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,660
How much is it?

538
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,410
Forget about it.

539
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,660
Just do well in the English competition.

540
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,250
If you can't get first,

541
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,410
at least aim for the top five.

542
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,000
Alright, I'll bring it
to the competition

543
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,660
and keep it

544
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,620
as a good luck charm. Is that okay?

545
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,450
You can be more dramatic.

546
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,790
(EasyCard) (Student)

547
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,750
Let's go.

548
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,290
Okay.

549
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,620
Everyone, remember.

550
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,910
Play it safe and maximize your score.

551
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,450
Tackle the easy questions first

552
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,160
to secure your base score.

553
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,290
As for the difficult ones...

554
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,410
You two are so late.

555
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,450
Let me repeat it.

556
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,080
You two, listen up.

557
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,700
Tackle the easy questions first
to secure your base score.

558
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,290
Leave the harder ones for last.

559
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,200
If you have time left,
try to tackle the harder ones too.

560
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,540
Review your answers multiple times.

561
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,910
Don't submit your paper early.

562
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,160
I've said this over and over again.

563
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,910
Wait until the end.

564
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,910
The competition is about to start.

565
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,080
Get ready to go in.

566
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,450
I'll help you two sign in.

567
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,870
- Thanks, ma'am.
- Thanks, ma'am.

568
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,620
Thanks, ma'am.

569
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,410
I called you.

570
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,500
Why didn't you answer?

571
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,410
Oh, I'm sorry.

572
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,880
What's up?

573
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,950
Nothing special.
Jing wanted me to tell you

574
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,660
it's okay if you didn't do well
on the weekly test.

575
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,790
Just focus on the competition.

576
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,790
She'll talk to you tomorrow.

577
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:13,250
Hey. Didn't Jing say to tell him
after the competition?

578
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,870
You're distracting him now.

579
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,450
It's fine.

580
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,200
I heard it.

581
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,450
We should go in now. Let's go.

582
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,890
(Answer sheet for computer scoring)

583
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,830
Hey, wait.

584
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,910
This time, I'm not sitting behind you.

585
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,790
If your pen runs out of ink,

586
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,870
I can't help you.

587
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,040
I have extra refills.

588
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,450
Take it.

589
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,920
Okay.

590
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,410
What Qi Jiahao did just now

591
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,250
was to discourage you
because you're excellent.

592
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,370
So do your best.

593
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,620
Be confident.

594
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,330
Do you believe in yourself?

595
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,330
What about you?

596
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,540
Do you believe in me?

597
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,370
Don't let him push you away.

598
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:52,660
I hope you can get closer to him. Okay?

599
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,250
Here are two balls.

600
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,160
We try to blow them apart.

601
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,500
But because changes in the airflow

602
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,040
create varying air pressures, which
affect the movement of air currents,

603
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,250
they come together instead.

604
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:59,720
(2012 High School English
Competition Test Paper)

605
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,370
Run?

606
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:18,290
Aren't you good at running?

607
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,370
Keep running.

608
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,250
Showing off, huh?

609
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,000
Didn't I tell you not
to submit your paper early

610
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,830
and to check it multiple times?

611
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,290
Did you forget all of that?

612
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,580
We tried our best.

613
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,040
We're sorry, ma'am.

614
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,950
Wang, you should be.

615
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,200
Do you know what you scored
on the weekly test?

616
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,870
91.

617
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:43,250
That's nine points lower than the last time.

618
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,790
You lost seven points
on listening, your strong suit.

619
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,660
And look at your handwriting.

620
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,370
It's so sloppy that the examiner
couldn't even read it.

621
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,750
That's another two points lost.

622
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,410
Yes, ma'am.

623
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,540
Remember,

624
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,870
you promised

625
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:01,700
to improve by 50 places.

626
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,000
Otherwise, Big Mouth Xu...

627
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,080
Director Xu will tear you apart,

628
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,830
and you might lose your spot
as the model student.

629
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,870
Understand?

630
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,950
Ma'am, how did the other students do?

631
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,910
Besides you two,

632
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,660
no one scored above 90.

633
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,120
What should I do?

634
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
What?

635
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,870
Are you feeling proud now?

636
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,660
Let's wait

637
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,660
until the competition results come out,

638
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,160
then we'll talk.

639
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,000
- Excuse me.
- Get out...

640
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,640
Come in.

641
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,500
Okay.

642
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,120
Qi Jiahao.

643
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,660
Good thing I ignored the invigilator
and didn't pick all Cs.

644
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,410
Otherwise, I'd have lost
even more points.

645
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,120
So you want me to praise you
for guessing right?

646
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,750
You're really annoying...

647
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,750
Hey!

648
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,750
Our English expert Qi Jiahao
messed up this time.

649
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,910
He didn't even get 90 points.

650
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,410
Jing called him to her office.

651
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,290
So,

652
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,660
even if your English score
isn't great this time,

653
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,200
you should be the one

654
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,700
who improved the most.

655
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,450
Actually, my English scores...

656
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,370
Gao Tianyang.

657
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,870
Lend me your math textbook.

658
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,830
- You didn't bring it?
- Nope.

659
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,200
Sure, you can borrow it.

660
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,080
But I'll charge you a fee.

661
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,040
Since we know each other well,
I can give you a discount.

662
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,790
So, take me on a date after school.

663
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,950
Forget it. Sheng.

664
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,160
Alright, I...

665
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,080
I'm kidding. You can borrow it.

666
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,920
Come on in.

667
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,910
Gao Tianyang, did you get a dorm form?

668
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:57,750
Yes, I did.

669
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:00,330
Sheng.

670
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,160
You asked me about the dorm earlier.

671
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,950
Fill out the form and give it to me.

672
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,080
Okay.

673
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,200
Did you get one?

674
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,620
You want to live in the dorm?

675
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,500
No.

676
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,080
I just casually asked
the class monitor for one.

677
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,620
Tian.

678
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,000
This is yours.

679
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,200
After you fill out the forms,

680
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,120
hand them to me by this Friday.

681
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,160
Don't forget it.

682
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,770
Did you guys not get one?

683
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,380
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

684
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,340
No problem.

685
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,580
Why are you laughing?

686
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,540
Enough.

687
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,540
Why do you want to live in the dorm?

688
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,910
I just...

689
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,790
I casually asked
the class monitor about that.

690
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,500
And at that time,

691
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,040
we were not close.

692
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,290
What about now?

693
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,540
Do you still want to?

694
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,920
No.

695
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,160
Now, we are quite close,

696
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,000
right?

697
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,000
What about you?

698
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,080
Do you still want to?

699
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,870
I think I will.

700
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:46,850
(Student Dormitory Application Form)

701
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,580
Everyone, it's time for class.

702
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,080
Wake up.

703
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,540
Before we begin, I'd like to announce

704
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,540
the result of the model student vote.

705
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,370
The selected student is Qi Jiahao.

706
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:19,330
Congratulations.

707
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,410
For this test, we used
a ranking-based seating arrangement.

708
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,040
Your seat will indicate your rank.

709
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,160
I'll hand out the report cards now.

710
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,000
Here you go.

711
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:41,710
Sheng.

712
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,660
You scored 50 points higher overall.

713
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,870
ranked in the top three for science,

714
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,660
and your overall rank
improved by 47 places.

715
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,000
47...

716
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,950
However,

717
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,410
if you'd taken
the English listening test,

718
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,500
your rank could've gone up
by 7 or 8 places.

719
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:00,830
What a shame.

720
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,620

Hawthorn aids digestion

762
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:17,200
I remember I told you

763
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,660
when I was a kid,
I was scared of the dark.

764
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:22,870
So I always slept
side-by-side with my mom.

765
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:27,000
Then, my mom got sick,

766
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,160
I slept with my dad.

767
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,790
Back then, our house was small,

768
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,910
but I always had someone beside me.

769
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:40,250
Then, our house got bigger and bigger,

770
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,330
we had more family members,

771
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:51,000
but no one was by my side anymore.

772
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,540
Do you know why I hate
the Bernoulli's Law?

773
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:04,160
Because I hate futile efforts,

774
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,660
working hard,

775
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,700
but seeing no results.

776
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,410
It's like competing for the model student

777

Do you know why I hate Qi Jiahao?

779
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:37,910
Because the harder I try,

780
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,040
the more pathetic I seem.

781
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,870
All because

782
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:13,750
the wind blows.

783
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,580
