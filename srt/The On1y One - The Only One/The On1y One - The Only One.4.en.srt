00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,040
It's up to you.

00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,580
(Shake Shake)
Welcome to the upside-down world!

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,790
Here's this month's horoscope for you.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,120
Venus and Mars are
in a 180-degree opposition,

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,580
creating a powerful
and intense attraction.

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,040
The impossible can be possible.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,000
A twist, and it's the glamorous end
of the century.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,450
Now, let's go upside-down.

11
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,620
Why did I drink so much?

12
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,000
Good morning.

13
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,750
Let's go.

14
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,690
Why are you standing there?

15
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,540
I'll cross the mountain.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,200
I win.

00:01:53,220 --> 00:02:00,220

18

I have a stomachache.

19
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,700
(If possible,)

20
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,540

21
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,700

Here, Tian, your poached egg.

35
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,620
Mom.

36
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,950
Can you cook a bit longer?

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,700
Actually, we can give it a try.

38
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,080
Try what?

39
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,200
Try getting closer.

40
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,540
Alright, alright.

41
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,540
I'll get another one for you.

42
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,750
Wang.

43
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,410
Come and have breakfast.

44
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,410
Thank you.

45
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,870
You're welcome.

46
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,370
Have some porridge.

47
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,080
I'll make some poached eggs for you.

48
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,870
But there is one right here.

49
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,870
Hey, it's...

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,870
There we go,

51
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,040
poached eggs for both of you.

52
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,660
I need to get to school early today.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,870
You...

54
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,370
Come on, Tian.

55
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,790
You don't eat...
Aren't you going with Wang?

56
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,000
No need.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,870
Didn't you say you wanted it overcooked?

58
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,660
Okay. I'm full.

59
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,450
See you.

60
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,750
That's weird.

61
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,120
He ate the raw one? Isn't...

62
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,660
Doesn't he like the cooked one?

63
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,250
Still want to walk in a straight line?

64
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,790
Did you forget what happened last night?

65
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,750
Last night?

66
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,830
Walk in a straight line?

67
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,290
Let's go home.

68
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,910
Our home is in the opposite direction.

69
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,000
I know that.

70
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,040
I was just testing you.

71
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,410
I mean it.

72
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,660
Why don't you record it with your phone?

73
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,410
I can walk in a straight line.

74
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,750
What exactly do you want?

75
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,950
Record it. Come on.

76
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,370
Here we go.

77
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,870
Is it recording?

78
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,870
What do you think?

79
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,160
Is it a straight line?

80
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,620
Can you do that?

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,160
I don't want to.

82
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,040
Walk over here.

83
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,910
Let's see if you can do it.

84
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,950
No.

85
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,330
Come on.

86
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,160
You did it too.

87
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,750
Thanks.

88
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,950
Hey, how am I supposed to record it now?

89
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,540
I have an idea.

90
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,450
Hey, you...

91
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,590
Give it to me.

92
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,830
Since you can walk in a straight line,
then walk home.

93
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,330
Let's go. I'll record.

94
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,080
Go!

95
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,330
Let's go. Go!

96
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,410
Don't move.

97
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,830
Let's go!

98
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,620
Walk straight. Walk straight.

99
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,870
Stop moving, will you?

100
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,040
Now,

101
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,160
do you remember?

102
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,330
Walk in a straight line.

103
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,420
No.

104
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,750
I wish

105
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,120
I had a real stomachache.

106
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,370
Then I could take a day off.

107
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,870
No poison.

108
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,750
Hawthorn aids digestion
and won't cause diarrhea.

109
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,620
Even if you don't have a stomachache,

110
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,750
you still need it after eating

111
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,830
my mom's dark cuisine.

112
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,450
Did Ms. Jiang want us to have it?

113
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,120
She cooked me breakfast

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,620
and then gave this to you.

115
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,620
She is a kind lady.

116
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,950
Why did you

117
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,790
suddenly say you wanted

118
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,500
to get closer with me?

119
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,620
So,

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,620
you don't want to get closer to me?

121
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,950
That's not what I meant.

122
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,250
So, do you want it to or not?

123
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,830
I do.

124
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,870
Then walk in a straight line.

125
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,580
Hey, can you stop talking about that?

126
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,680
(Class 2A)

127
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,250
Oh, walk straight.

128
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,410
You're really annoying.

129
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,000
The path to beating you
is a straight line,

130
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,550
starting from rest
with an acceleration of 50.

131
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,410
According to Newton's law that F=ma...

132
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,410
Stop that.

133
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,330
Why are you so late?

134
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,620
Go back to your seats.

135
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,290
Why is Jing here so early?

136
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,420
Go back to our seats.

137
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,910
You two, take out your test papers.

138
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,950
Oh, no. I didn't finish mine.

139
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,870
- Me neither.
- So that's what I said.

140
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,300
Two kinds of students
can excel in English.

141
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,470
Qing is so early today.

142
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,580
- The first class hasn't started yet.
- Those who know grammar well

143
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,660
- Why are they all standing?
- and those with a strong language sense.

144
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,470
- Because someone reported to Qing
- Why did I ask you to do

145
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,620
- that some of us copied from others.
- test papers? Because I want you

146
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,700
- If I find out who did it, I will...
- to develop your language sense.

147
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,080
Along with the grammar
you learn in class,

148
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,620
- Love and peace.
- this will improve

149
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,070
your speed and accuracy.

150
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,410
Stand up.

151
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,580
Even without checking,

152
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,870
I know some students
definitely didn't do it.

153
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,450
Gao Tianyang,

154
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,790
I'm talking about you.

155
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,870
Be proactive.

156
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,950
Stand up.

157
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,330
Where's your test paper?

158
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,080
Some students

159
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,290
are different.

160
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,910
I know they definitely did it.

161
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,330
Sheng Wang, come on.

162
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,370
Be a good example for everyone.

163
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,580
Sheng Wang,

164
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,200
what a slap in my face.

165
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Did you feel it?

166
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,950
Stand up.

167
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,200
Which of you haven't finished

168
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,700
your test papers like them?

169
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,040
Take your paper and pen

170
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,700
and go write outside.

171
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,790
Don't come back until you finish it.

172
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,830
Everyone, did you hear me?

173
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,790
- Jiang Tian, your test paper?
- We shouldn't have had BBQ yesterday.

174
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,080
Yes, it was too late.

175
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,870
It was midnight
when I got home and showered.

176
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,540
Good.

177
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,910
Good.

178
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,910
The rest of you did well.

179
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,120
Don't peek at mine. Do it yourself.

180
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,950
Or Jing will notice.

181
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,500
Tian stood up.

182
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,040
Jiang Tian?

183
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,450
Oh, Tian came out too.

184
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,370
- Now I feel so much better.
- Be quiet, everyone.

185
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,790
- Don't compare yourself with Tian.
- Everyone, look at your test papers.

186
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,580
Did Jing say when we can go in?

187
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,080
After you finish your paper.

188
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,550
I see.

189
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,910
After finishing these 150 questions,

190
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,040
I think these two English classes

191
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,880
might be over.

192
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,660
Wait.

193
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,040
Are you already on question 58,

194
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,500
almost 59?

195
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,000
How long will it take
to finish all 150 questions?

196
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,790
Less than an hour.

197
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,630
Oh, my.

198
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,450
Amazing.

199
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,200
Why haven't you finished it?

200
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,330
What do you think?

201
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,450
You could come to school earlier...

202
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,580
I need to get to school early today.

203
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,080
Aren't you going with Wang?

204
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
The answer is A.

205
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The present continuous tense.

206
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,420
How does it feel?

207
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,160
Do you think advanced students
are amazing?

208
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,700
I heard our classroom
has become a tourist spot.

209
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,950
Many people came to watch the so-called
advanced students being punished.

210
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,500
Please,

211
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,830
behave yourselves

212
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,750
and put more effort into your studies.

213
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,500
Is that okay?

214
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,910
Okay.

215
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,910
Okay, I need to tell you about

216
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,450
this year's Model Student Award.

217
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,080
As you know,

218
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,830
a model student of the city gets extra points

219
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,450
for university admission.

220
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,410
It's like a ticket to your top choice.

221
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,040
Four of you will be selected this year.

222
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
As usual,

223
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,830
one for top grades,

224
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,410
one for a class leader,

225
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,330
one voted by the class,

226
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,830
and one for

227
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,540
the most improved student this month.

228
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,500
Okay, take out your textbooks

229
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,830
and open to page 91.

230
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,540
Class monitor,

231
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,660
write the last class's formulas
on the blackboard.

232
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,040
Others, take out yesterday's test papers.

233
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,310
(Want Want Senbei: Still angry?)

234
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,600
(Want Want Senbei: Still angry?)
(Unread)

235
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,850
(Sorry, it's my fault.)

236
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,970
(Want Want Senbei: Still angry?
Sorry, it's my fault.)

237
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:11,270
(Want Want Senbei: Still angry?
Sorry, it's my fault.)

238
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,980
Down on my knees.

239
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,680
(Want Want Senbei)

240
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:28,020
(Focus on the class. Stop texting me.)

241
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,950
Well,

242
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,040
my pen is out of ink.

243
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,080
Lend me a refill.

244
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,830
Thanks.

245
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,880
Hey.

246
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,290
Let's go

247
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,040
to the west gate later.

248
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
Focus on the class.

249
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,080
Oh.

250
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,120
Don't slouch in your chair during class.

251
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,750
Oh.

252
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,040
And,

253
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,250
stop borrowing my refills.

254
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,040
Okay.

255
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,700
Then can you stop being angry?

256
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,950
I have plans tonight.

257
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,160
If my mom asks,

258
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,040
just tell her the teacher needs me.

259
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,280
Okay.

260
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,580
Then can you stop being angry?

261
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,080
Can I have selective amnesia now?

262
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,790
Sure.

263
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,660
I'll let Ms. Jiang know tonight.

264
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,950
This has nothing to do with drinking.

265
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,540
You know, during the day,

266
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,540
I have to attend classes at school.

267
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,250
And at night, I need to catch up
on last semester's work.

268
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't get to sleep before 3 a.m.

269
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,660
And you know what?

270
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,830
I find your school really crazy.

271
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,290
Seat arrangement in the next exam
is based on ranking.

272
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,250
The student in 31st place

273
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,660
will sit in the first seat of Class B,

274
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,950
and the 65th-place student
will sit in the fifth seat of Class C.

275
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,870
I did really badly on the last exam.

276
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,330
Where will I sit?

277
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,830
Mr. Zhao.

278
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
See you.

279
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,290
Mr. Zhao.

280
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,910
I heard

281
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,660
you went to my son's shop yesterday.

282
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,660
Yes. Yesterday was the soft opening.

283
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,830
Oh, you didn't go?

284
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,950
I don't like the food.

285
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,450
Besides the A-gei and fish ball soup,
what else is good?

286
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,700
Go check inside.

287
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,160
Okay, I'm in a good mood today.

288
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll have a feast.

289
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:02,850
Okay.

290
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,870
Okay, Chemistry is done.

291
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,290
1:45 now.

292
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,790
Great. I can go to bed early.

293
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,080
What's he doing?

294
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,790
So noisy.

295
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,400
Why are you walking around so late?

296
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,390
(Want Want Senbei: Why are you
walking around so late?)

297
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,270
Paying so much attention to me?

298
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,260
No.

299
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,270
When are you going to sleep?

300
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,100
How much do you have left to study?

301
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,880
One more workbook.

302
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,150
Which subject?

303
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,050
Physics.

304
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,840
Is your door locked?

305
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,160
My door?

306
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,250
What does that mean?

307
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,750
You are really busy,

308
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,450
even in the middle of the night.

309
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,500
So noisy.

310
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,830
Where are you stuck?

311
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,540
Nothing's stuck.

312
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,540
Nothing?

313
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,540
Then why are you staying up so late?

314
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,950
I have to attend classes,

315
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,370
learn new content,

316
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,450
and catch up.

317
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,250
I'm doing it as fast as I can, okay?

318
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,870
So you texted me,

319
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,830
asking when I'll go to bed.

320
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,450
Which question do you want to ask me?

321
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,380
No one.

322
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,580
So you want me to highlight
the key points and questions?

323
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,950
Be my guest.

324
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,200
Can I write on your workbook?

325
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,250
Sure.

326
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,540
I'll just tear it up anyway.

327
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,580
Tear it up?

328
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,000
Yes.

329
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,700
If I have done

330
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,410
the questions twice without issues,

331
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,620
I'll cross them out.

332
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,830
If an entire page is crossed out,

333
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,160
I'll just tear it out.

334
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,120
In this way, I won't

335
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,750
waste time seeing them next time.

336
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,750
Okay, don't mind if I do.

337
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,580
This is the key point.

338
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,790
Key point.

339
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,290
No need to look at this one.

340
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,040
No need.

341
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,080
Look at this one briefly.

342
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,370
Skim the rest if you have time.

343
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,330
If not, you can skip it.

344
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,620
Got it.

345
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,580
I got that when you first started.

346
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,120
The first six major questions

347
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
are the most comprehensive.

348
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,450
If I can master them,

349
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,330
I won't be afraid of any
major exam questions.

350
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,870
Most of the other questions

351
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,700
repeat parts of these six,

352
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,120
so I don't need to waste time on them,

353
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,000
right?

354
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,630
Yes.

355
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,700
I have a question.

356
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,540
What?

357
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,910
Have you ever been beaten

358
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,000
for sharing key points like this?

359
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,700
No, no, no.

360
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,790
Don't take this away.

361
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,660
Whether I can go to bed early tonight

362
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,750
totally depends on it.

363
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,660
Go ahead.

364
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,040
Give me the pen.

365
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,080
I'll check the math problems
you just did.

366
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,410
Feel free to challenge my key points
if you disagree.

367
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,930
(Class 2H)

368
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,670
Is everything okay?

369
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,330
What's Tian doing? He's taking so long.

370
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,830
Hurry up, mute.

371
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,700
Hurry up. Don't you understand?

372
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,870
Hurry!

373
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,330
Speak human language.

374
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,250
Are you insane?

375
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,040
My shoes are dirty.

376
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,790
Bloody beggar.

377
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,870
Get out of my way.

378
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,710
Can't you hear?

379
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,500
Uncle Mute!

380
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,480
Get up here. Let's go.

381
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,120
You want to fight me? Great.

382
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,290
Okay.

383
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,370
Hit him.

384
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,500
Alright. I'm sorry.

385
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,750
I apologize. Is that enough?

386
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,700
Go to hell.

387
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,080
You go to hell,

388
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,070
not others.

389
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,620
Fine, I will go to hell. Okay?

390
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,540
Let's go to the health center.

391
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,580
What do you mean?

392
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,660
He said not to go to the health center.

393
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,260
He has disinfectant at home.

394
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,160
What brand is it?

395
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,450
Is it expired? Is it effective?

396
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,410
Don't worry about it. Let's go.

397
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,700
Let's get out of here.

398
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,000
Go. Let's go.

399
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,910
He is delicate.

400
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,200
Go. Go.

401
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,080
Hey, careful.

402
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,880
Slow down.

403
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,580
- My bag, please.
- I got it.

404
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,410
Be careful.

405
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,660
Sheng, you know what?

406
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,410
My grandparents and Tian's grandma

407
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,540
were all teachers at Danying
and lived here.

408
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,910
Be careful.

409
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,620
This district's elementary school
is quite famous,

410
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,410
so we moved here
when I was about five or six

411
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,250
and stayed until I graduated
from elementary school.

412
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,540
Tian came here earlier,

413
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,120
around three or four years old,

414
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,830
but he moved away before graduating.

415
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,790
Yes, I moved.

416
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,620
Let Uncle Mute sit there.

417
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,790
He lives just behind.

418
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,160
Sit there.

419
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,370
Come here.

420
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,080
This is Old Man Ding's place.

421
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,580
Mr. Zhao from Happiness
also lives nearby.

422
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,120
By the way,

423
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,200
the Old Man Ding who lives here

424
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,120
is notoriously grumpy
in the Little White House.

425
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,620
He's extremely difficult

426
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,910
to get along with...

427
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,500
But Tian has a good
relationship with him,

428
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,330
he has lunch here every day.

429
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,330
But I can't do that.

430
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,950
When I was young, I climbed a tree

431
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,500
and accidentally damaged his roof.

432
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,950
He still holds a grudge against me.

433
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,250
Is it really that serious?

434
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,290
He's so stingy.

435
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,200
So,

436
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,080
do you have lunch here every day?

437
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,840
Yes.

438
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,200
What's wrong with the mute?

439
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,200
- Hey, you.
- Hi, handsome.

440
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,910
- You still owe me for the roof.
- Nice new haircut.

441
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:26,750
How dare you come here?

442
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,040
I'll beat you...

443
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,910
I love you. I love you too!

444
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,540
That's nonsense.

445
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,830
Every time I see you, I'll hit you.

446
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,700
Mute, what happened to your knee?

447
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,750
He fell at school and hurt his knee.

448
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,410
Who are you?

449
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,620
Oh, I'm his classmate.

450
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,660
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ding.

451
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,370
Who told you I'm Ding?

452
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,080
The one who just ran away.

453
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,790
I should have broken his legs just now!

454
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,910
Did you and Tian bring the mute here?

455
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,290
Yes.

456
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,830
Have you eaten?

457
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,830
Why are you staring at him?

458
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,910
Don't you know if you've eaten or not?

459
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,910
No, I haven't.

460
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,370
Alright, take a break.

461
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,910
I'll go heat up the food.

462
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,330
You go pick up the broom later.

463
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,790
I have a question.

464
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,830
Why can't we understand
what Uncle Mute says,

465
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,000
but you can?

466
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,790
I just guessed.

467
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,120
The only one who can really chat with him

468
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,120
is Mr. Zhao from Happiness.

469
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,160
I see.

470
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,700
No wonder Uncle Mute
often goes to Happiness,

471
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,580
sitting at the register,

472
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,660
counting inventory,

473
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,410
or handling recycling.

474
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,540
He's always busy with everything.

475
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,700
If only one person in the world

476
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,000
can understand you,

477
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,290
he's more important than anyone else.

478
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,790
Back there,

479
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,200
Zhai Tao said some terrible things...

480
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,950
Thank you.

481
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
Let's go inside.

482
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,910
I'll go get the broom.

483
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,580
Be careful.

484
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,200
Here you go.

485
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,950
Dig in.

486
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,120
We have more people today.
I'll whip up another dish.

487
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,620
Go ahead.

488
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,420
What's wrong?

489
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,910
How about you go eat at Happiness?

490
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,120
Never mind. Forget about it.

491
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,200
Old folks' cooking isn't very refined.

492
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,200
I don't know if you'll like it.

493
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,540
So you're beating around the bush,

494
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,540
worried I might not like the food?

495
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,660
I'm afraid the food

496
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,700
might go to waste.

497
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,540
You...

498
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,330
You are really annoying.

499
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,250
Then go to Happiness.

500
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,080
I won't.

501
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,410
I'm not a picky eater.

502
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,660
Right, Uncle Mute?

503
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:53,430
(Zhao Su from Happiness)
The boy you brought here really got me.

504
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,650
He's too picky about food.

505
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,010
He doesn't eat coriander,
carrots, or spinach.

506
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,000
Chopped shallots and garlic
are fine for adding flavor,

507
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,830
- but he didn't eat them when he found out.
- He slandered me.

508
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,460
(If he were my son, I'd let him
go hungry for three days.)

509
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,540
Who slandered you?

510
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,870
Here we go. Enjoy your meal.

511
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,040
His name is...

512
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,250
What's his name?

513
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,290
He is...

514
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,210
Wang.

515
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,790
Sheng, Wang, either is fine.

516
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,330
You can call me whichever you like.

517
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,620
Wang.

518
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,250
Is the rice enough for you?

519
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,880
Yes.

520
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,410
But you are a tall guy.

521
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,370
I'll get you another bowl of rice.

522
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,250
Thank you.

523
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,120
Why does Gao Tianyang
call him Old Man Ding?

524
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,040
Exactly the same.

525
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,160
Why are you laughing?

526
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,750
Why are you laughing so much?

527
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,660
What's so funny?

528
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
That's all we have. No more rice.

529
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,040
Don't just eat the meat slices.

530
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,660
The green peppers
are nutritious and tasty.

531
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,250
He only eats...

532
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,410
I eat green pepper.

533
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,370
Great.

534
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,040
Do you eat green peppers?

535
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,330
I love it the most.

536
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,000
Great. Help yourselves.

537
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,620
It's delicious.

538
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,140
(Student Affairs)

539
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,540
Are we going to get praised?

540
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:04,710
Excuse me.

541
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,080
We're here to pick up
the practice books.

542
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,540
On the desk.

543
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,750
Just grab them and go.

544
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,450
Sheng Wang.

545
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,580
You did well on this test.

546
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,160
Don't you deserve some praise?

547
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,120
How about I praise you for fighting?

548
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,000
You should focus on studying for exams

549
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,330
instead of wasting time
fighting all day.

550
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,380
Sir,

551
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,910
I was also there that day.

552
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:35,830
You forgot me.

553
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,580
Did you fight?

554
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,590
Yes, I did.

555
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,670
No, you didn't.

556
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,410
We have so many cameras.

557
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:45,870
Are they fake?

558
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,330
Don't come here causing trouble.

559
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,620
I'll punish you too.

560
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,420
No one can stop me. I did it...

561
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,540
Sir, Gao Tianyang's brain is damaged.

562
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,380
He's talking nonsense.

563
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,080
I'll take him back to
the classroom to rest.

564
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,540
What are you doing?

565
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,790
Stop talking back.

566
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,120
The more you do,
the angrier my dad gets.

567
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,410
It's not good for Tian and Sheng.

568
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,910
Sir, they ganged up on me.

569
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:20,830
What the hell...

570
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,620
Why am I standing here?

571
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,870
Don't you still know why you're here?

572
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,790
Didn't I just say?

573
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,370
The monitors outside.

574
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,450
Also,

575
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:36,040
other students heard and saw it.

576
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,290
You think I called you in here
to make excuses?

577
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,750
And let me ask you.

578
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,410
Who cursed someone "bloody beggar"?

579
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,910
And

580
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,790
who kicked someone down the stairs?

581
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,700
- I...
- Yes, it's you.

582
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,330
And you two.

583
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,250
I know

584
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,330
your initial intention

585
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:56,160
may not be bad.

586
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,040
But there are countless ways

587
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,620
to handle things.

588
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,330
Why did you have to resort to violence?

589
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,250
Jiang Tian.

590
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,040
Do you think

591
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,660
you look particularly cool

592
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,700
fighting in front of your classmates?

593
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,630
Sheng Wang.

594
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,620
You threw your backpack far away.

595
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,620
Is that impressive?

596
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
Alright, alright.

597
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,700
You three

598
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,000
like to show off in front
of others, right?

599
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,210
Okay.

600
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,290
There are a lot of fallen leaves

601
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,000
on that small path on the west side
of the campus.

602
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
This stage is quite impressive, isn't it?

603
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,250
Sweep the path clean

604
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,750
every day after school.

605
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,870
If I don't embarrass you a few times,

606
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:34,200
you won't understand
how long life's path is.

607
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,840
Thank you, sir.

608
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,250
How can we sweep all these leaves?

609
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,790
They keep falling.

610
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,950
Don't move.

611
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,030
♪Cold clouds wake up
the scorching thunderstorm♪

612
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,570
♪Little by little, I float into droplets♪

613
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:54,210
♪I watch a movie alone, and walk back
with no one to share my umbrella♪

614
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:00,540
♪Bitterness turns sighs into night♪

615
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,950
♪Far away♪

616
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,450
Sometimes, just focus on the moment.

617
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,910
That day, you asked me

618
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,540
what I wanted to say.

619
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,950
I wanted to say

620
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,250
we should live our own lives.

621
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,620
We had no connection before,

622
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,540
so why get tangled up now?

623
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,290
But later,

624
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,700
on the way back,
you insisted on going straight

625
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,950
and forced me to follow.

626
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,370
As I walked

627
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,790
and looked back

628
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,040
at the path we had taken,

629
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I suddenly felt

630
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,750
that the past didn't seem
so important anymore.

631
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,790
I used to value the past
because I never lived the moment.

632
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,870
But now that I do,

633
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,830
the past doesn't matter as much.

634
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,540
So, I just want to live in the now.

635
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,370
If only we could stay
in the present moment.

636
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,620
But why stop here?

637
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,160
A better future is waiting for us.

638
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,700
Sheng Wang, Jiang Tian.

639
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,330
Alright, stop.

640
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,410
Director Xu,

641
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,120
maybe you should tell them yourself.

642
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,700
From now on,

643
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,750
your punishment will be

644
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,950
to see Ms. Yang Jing every break.

645
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,660
This is my idea.

646
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,040
The English competition is next week.

647
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,830
But the two potential award winners

648
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,410
are punished by sweeping leaves

649
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,620
instead of focusing on their studies.

650
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,620
So, Director Xu,

651
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,950
is that right?

652
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,750
Yes.

653
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,080
This competition

654
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,080
affects our school's honor,

655
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,660
academic performance,

656
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,500
and annual admissions,

657
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,580
so the principal
is paying extra attention to it.

658
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,830
I've decided to let you two

659
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,120
redeem yourselves.

660
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,290
Alright. Give me that.

661
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,950
I have two requirements.

662
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,500
Firstly, you must win an award

663
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,620
in the English competition.

664
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,910
Secondly, you need to improve

665
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,580
by at least 50 places
in this week's test.

666
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,950
Not you, I mean Sheng Wang.

667
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,830
You're already the best.
How can you improve further?

668
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:44,700
Director Xu.

669
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,910
You know, the higher the rank,

670
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,450
the harder it is to improve,

671
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,790
especially in such a short time.

672
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,950
Of course, I know.

673
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,500
That's why it's a punishment.

674
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,410
Meet these two requirements,

675
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:56,870
or,

676
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:57,750
here,

677
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,330
keep sweeping.

678
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,870
- No, thanks, sir.
- Also,

679
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,660
you won't be selected

680
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,200
as the model student of your class.

681
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,700
Improve by 50 places...

682
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,250
50 places in the entire grade?

683
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,910
Why should I bear the responsibility

684
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,120
for two people's mistakes?

685
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,870
No way.

686
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,040
I need him to mark out the key points
and questions for me.

687
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,120
I'm not taking advantage of him.

688
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,840
What's up?

689
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,910
My AC is broken.

690
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,830
I want to cool off in your room.

691
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:55,330
I'm not kidding.

692
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,450
You can go check it out.

693
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,450
It's really broken.

694
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,200
(Don't go. Don't go.)

695
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,450
(But if you go,)

696
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,790
(I might just jump out the window.)

697
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
It's comfortable
in the air-conditioned room.

698
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,450
Just do your own stuff. Forget about me.

699
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,120
Do you mind if I sit on your bed?

700
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,040
I do.

701
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,880
Okay.

702
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:35,710
Sit down.

703
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,040
It's okay. I can stand.

704
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,450
Sit down, or go back to your room.

705
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,620
Do your homework.

706
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,660
Okay.

707
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,450
Well,

708
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,000
do you mind staying up a little later,

709
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,080
say,

710
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,080
until 2 a.m.?

711
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,350
(Physics Workbook)

712
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,950
Is your AC really broken?

713
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:22,170
Yes.

714
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,080
And I told Ms. Sun.

715
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,790
She'll have someone fix it
in a couple of days.

716
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,450
Yes, start from here.

717
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:41,910
These questions.

718
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,660
Memorize them.

719
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,870
They're about alternating current.

720
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,580
It will definitely be on the test.

721
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,250
You got this one wrong.

722
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,350
(Morning self-study, please be quiet.)

723
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,120
This one,

724
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:06,790
add this one.

725
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:08,790
To make a whole.

726
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:12,660
Am I right?

727
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,540
Yes.

728
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,410
Go back to sleep in your own room.

729
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:32,450
Your goal of improving by 50 places
is not my concern.

730
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:33,660
You've got this one,

731
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,580
and this to do.

732
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,250
I'll do it when I finish this one.

733
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,450
And this one here.

734
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,040
How long will you stay in my room?

735
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,170
"Lush, lush, the garden's willow trees."

736
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,880
"Fair, fair, the embowered lass."

737
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,720
(Mandarin)

738
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:09,250
"Know the what."

739
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:15,440
"And also know the why."

740
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,500
Wrong.

741
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:22,790
Repeat it again.

742
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:25,890
"But know the what..."

743
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,620
That hurts.

744
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,540
Do it here.

745
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,330
Thanks.

746
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:18,120
It's not even 1 a.m. yet.
I finished them all.

747
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,250
Is there a problem?

748
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,620
No.

749
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,120
Staying here boosts my luck
and helps me work faster.

750
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,120
Give you a thumbs up.

751
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:46,370
What's wrong?

752
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,930
Here it is.

753
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,910
Why...

754
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,120
Why are you packed?

755
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,120
When are you leaving?

756
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,410
I'm not packed.

757
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:33,450
I just left it like this.

758
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,910
(Chemistry)

759
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:37,080
This one is better.
It has more question types.

760
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:45,330
It's just my personal habit.

761
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,750
Wang, I'm back.

762
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,120
Shh.

763
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,090
Shh.

764
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:02,620
My dad's back.

765
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,660
I'm back.

766
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,330
Wang? Are you guys asleep?

767
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,200
Do you really need to be so panicked?

768
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:13,330
I...

769
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:17,250
You even locked me in the closet.

770
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,080
What do you mean?

771
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:22,370
It's just...

772
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,120
My dad is very naggy.

773
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,290
If he finds out we're still awake,

774
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:28,540
he'll definitely ask,

775
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,080
"Why are you still awake?

776
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,330
Haven't you finished your homework,
or are you just procrastinating?"

777
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,120
If I say we haven't finished it,

778
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,000
he'll ask,

779
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,120
"Is it because there's too much
or is it too difficult?

780
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,080
Is it just you
or is the whole class struggling?"

781
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,370
If I say I'm studying
for the monthly test,

782
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,230
he'll ask,

783
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,910
"How is that going?"

784
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,080
Or he might try to boost my confidence,

785
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:50,250
like "Sheng Wang is the best.
Dad believes in you."

786
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,500
It's not Sheng Wang.

787
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,660
Your dad calls you Wang.

788
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,500
- Shut up.
- The lights are off.

789
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,950
They should be asleep.

790
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,290
Let them sleep, then.

791
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:05,660
Okay.

792
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,450
So,

793
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,250
Wang.

794
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:11,750
Can we come out now?

795
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,830
Sure. Sure.

796
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,680
(Class 2C)

797
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,720
(8:00-9:30 English)

798
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,410
May I ask if Sheng Wang is here?

799
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,750
Oh, that's me.

800
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,750
Ms. Yang wants to see you.

801
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,700
- Jing wants to see me?
- Yes.

802
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,910
Now?

803
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:03,870
Yeah, she said it's about
the English competition.

804
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:05,330
She will get you new test papers.

805
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,580
Okay.

806
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,040
She's not in her office.

807
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,580
She said the copier is broken,

808
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,910
so she'll print the papers
at the Happiness Convenience Store.

809
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,040
Oh.

810
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:15,750
You should go. I'll go back then.

811
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,910
Okay. Thanks.

812
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:19,290
Why now?

813
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:29,880
Is that him?

814
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,000
Hey, boy.

815
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:37,720
(Sheng Wang)

816
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,200
Sheng Wang.

817
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:41,250
Don't scare him.

818
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

819
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:45,700
Do you know who I am?

820
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:47,540
No?

821
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,660
Then do you know why I'm here today?

822
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,330
Answer him.

823
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,660
Don't be nervous.

824
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:57,660
Do you know why I want to see you?

825
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:01,750
Yes.

826
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:04,830
You are here

827
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:08,020
- to get beaten up.
- Oh, my.

828
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,200
(What's wrong with me?)

829
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,200
(Every time I have a test,
I get into a fight.)

830
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,500
(This month's horoscope)

831
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,540
(is really accurate.)

832
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,870
You dork.

833
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:25,750
Quite the fighter, huh?

834
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:28,810
Seriously?

835
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,450
Venus and Mars are
in a 180-degree opposition,

836
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:37,200
creating a powerful
and intense attraction.

837
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,700
The impossible can be possible.

838
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,620
A twist, and it's the glamorous end
of the century.

(Jiang Tian's very moment)

840
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,080
Okay, Chemistry is done.

841
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:44,500
1:45 now.

00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:55,660

during the day,

844
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,750
I have to attend classes at school.

845
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,500
And at night, I need to catch up
on last semester's work.

846
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,290
I don't get to sleep before 3 a.m.

One more workbook.

854
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,760
Which subject?

855
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:55,040
Physics.
