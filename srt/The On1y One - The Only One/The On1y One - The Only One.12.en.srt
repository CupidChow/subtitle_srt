This is important.

23
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,750
I'll say it again.

24
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,080
This mock exam will be held

25
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,160
with other schools

26
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,290
to give you a real exam experience.

27
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,500
Based on the draw,

28
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,620
you won't take the exam at our school.

29
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,950
You will go to

30
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,700
the assigned location for the exam.

31
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,580
What? Relax.

32
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,830
Our school will provide buses
for transportation that day,

33
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,660
so make sure to gather on time.

34
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,540
Did you hear that?

35
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,290
Yes.

36
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,620
And remember, don't be late.

37
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,080
Didn't realize the problem

38
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,580
was with all high schools,
not just ours.

39
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,450
See? That's a parabola.

40
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,500
Gao Tianyang,

41
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,370
tell me the formula
for the trajectory of a parabola.

42
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,870
The formula for the trajectory?

43
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,000
Y squared equals...

44
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,330
4...

45
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,370
4c, something.

46
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,250
cx.

47
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,660
Y squared equals 4cx.

48
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,740
Yes, Y squared equals 4cx.

49
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,620
Thanks, Sheng Wang.

50
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,950
Gao Tianyang, sit down please.

51
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,410
Take out your test papers.

52
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,750
Let's review.

53
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,960
Look at the first question.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,160
A 5-kilogram block
on a horizontal surface

55
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,620
moves with an initial speed of 4 meters

56
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,660
per second
against a 10-newton friction force.

57
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,770
You have a good eye for things. Come on.

58
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,370
I'll go shower, then.

59
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,200
- This is awesome.
- This is the artsy version.

60
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,040
This is awesome.

61
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,910
Whoa.

62
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,040
I can't take it.

63
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,580
I'm out of shampoo.

64
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,620
Anyone can lend me some?

65
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,540
I have some.

66
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,790
Here you are.

67
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,120
We've got some good stuff.

68
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,160
Wanna check it out?

69
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,210
No.

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,950
Not interested?

71
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,170
Sheng.

72
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,790
Wanna see something

73
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,540
for grown-ups?

74
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,290
A dirty book?

75
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,290
I'll stick to my math book.

76
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,250
Alright then, you have no taste.

77
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,200
Shi, let's continue.

78
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,330
Gao Tianyang,

79
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,620
here you go.

80
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,830
- Not at all.
- Thanks.

81
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,330
How did you spill it?

82
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,750
Idiot. Look, it's everywhere.

83
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,700
Clean it up.

84
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,040
How did you spill so much?

85
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,410
You want some of this?

86
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,580
- You want some of this?
- Why did you put it here?

87
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,370
I didn't put it here. It's always here.

88
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,950
Now, it's everywhere. Everywhere.

89
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,450
Hurry up and clean it.

90
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,680
You'd better clean it.

91
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,870
It's precious.

92
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,750
What the heck?

93
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,500
Hey, you got it on my pants!

94
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,080

Sheng, morning!

103
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,870
Whoa.

104
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,250
Your smoky eye makeup is too much.

105
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,750
Is it that obvious?

106
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,200
Anyone with eyes can see it.

107
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
What happened?

108
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,040
I couldn't sleep last night.

109
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,830
I don't mean to bother you,

110
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,330
but even if you didn't sleep well,

111
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,910
you should eat something
to make up for it.

112
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,200
Two eggs for breakfast isn't enough.

113
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,250
Are you done,

114
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,330
Gareth?

115
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,200
Gareth?

116
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,120
Speak it faster.

117
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,200
Gareth... Get lost.

118
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,410
But, come on,

119
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,080
why couldn't you sleep?

120
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,830
Did something happen in our dorm?

121
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,090
No.

122
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,880
Wang.

123
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,000
Is that what you want to ask me?

124
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,000
No, that's not what I meant.

125
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,080
I want to ask you this question.

126
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,540
If there are fish in a pond
and you plan to sell some,

127
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,250
when's the best time to catch them?

128
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,040
When you want to eat them.

129
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,790
How many should you catch?

130
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,290
How many?

131
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,160
As many as you want to eat.

132
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,500
Definitely not.

133
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,950
Wanna bet? I'll ask Sheng.

134
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,700
Go ahead. Ask him.

135
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,330
Sheng, let me ask you.

136
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,700
In the last chemistry class,

137
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,950
we learned about fluoride,

138
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,950
the stuff in toothpaste.

139
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,290
What was the key point of that section?

140
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,870
What was the key point?

141
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
To prevent cavities.

142
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,700
What's so funny, you guys?

143
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,160
To prevent cavities.

144
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,540
What is it?

145
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,580
Sheng,

146
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,290
why do you have such bad dark circles?

147
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,200
Oh, I didn't sleep well.

148
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,580
There are eggs right here.

149
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,290
The internet says
you can roll hard-boiled eggs

150
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,910
over your dark circles
to help with them.

151
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,660
- You can give it a try.
- Yeah.

152
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,160
I know someone gave me
these eggs for a reason.

153
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,880
Like this?

154
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,750
- No.
- You should take them out.

155
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,960
Like this?

156
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,090
Roll them around.

157
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
It's hot.

158
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,410
Time for class.

159
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,620
Did you finish your homework?

160
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,620
Get back to your seats.

161
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,000
I can eat them if you are not going to.

162
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,830
Why couldn't you sleep?

163
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,160
Because

164
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,830
I had a nightmare last night.

165
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,080
Linzi.

166
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,200
Director Xu wants to see me.

167
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,500
I'll be right back.

168
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,620
You freaked me out.

169
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,000
What? Are you watching a horror movie?

170
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,080
Yeah. Where's Tian?

171
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,830
He went running.

172
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,750
Actually,

173
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,620
I was just trying to build my courage.

174
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,950
I used to think I wasn't scared

175
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,290
and even laughed at Gao.

176
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,830
But the other day,

177
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,950
I walked someone back to the dorm.

178
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,910
The hallway was pitch black.

179
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,950
Suddenly, someone tapped me
on the shoulder.

180
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,080
It scared me to death.

181
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,790
So how's it going?

182
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,620
Not great, or you wouldn't
have scared me.

183
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,120
How about I watch it with you

184
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,620
to make it up to you?

185
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,080
Sure, let's do it.

186
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,450
But

187
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,580
aren't you scared?

188
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,250
Weren't you sharing a bed
with Tian back then?

189
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,410
Oh, forget it.

190
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,080
Come on. Two negatives make a positive.

191
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,540
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

192
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,380
Okay.

193
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,620
Oh, man. I was scared by you.

194
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,410
That is terrifying.

195
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,950
I got a text.

196
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,790
Oh.

197
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,250
Who sent it?

198
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,620
Why are you grinning like that?

199
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,750
Who else could it be?

200
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,130
It's He Shi.

201
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,580
She told me to build my courage.

202
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,500
What a love-struck fool.

203
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,250
Are you in a relationship?

204
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,620
(I finally feel like I'm going to live
in the dorm. Tell me it's true.)

205
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,290
I'm always right about spotting students

206
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,500
(It's true.)
who are in a relationship.

207
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,040
You must be in one.

208
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,000
Sir, I'm not.

209
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,580
I was really texting Jiang Tian.

210
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,450
I don't believe it.

211
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,750
Here.

212
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,330
Unlock it and show me. Now.

213
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, it is Jiang Tian.

214
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,790
I've noticed that

215
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,950
no matter how fierce a girl is,

216
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,750
once she's in love,

217
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,160
she becomes really cute.

218
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,750
Why?

219
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,410
I never knew a girl with dimples

220
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,750
could be so charming.

221
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,250
Do you know

222
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,200
how cute when she smiles?

223
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,040
She has a little dimple right here.

224
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,370
And you know what? When her hair

225
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,660
catches the sunlight,

226
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,370
it lightens up.

227
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,620
She has fair skin

228
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,830
and long legs.

229
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,410
She is adorable.

230
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,580
Her smile makes me feel warm.

231
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,410
How can you be sure

232
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,410
that she's the one you like?

233
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:24,410
There are many girls with dimples,
long legs, and fair skin.

234
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,410
How can you be sure she's the one?

235
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,330
This isn't even a question.

236
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,410
Whether you like someone or not,

237
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,910
you just know it yourself.

238
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,620
When you like someone,

239
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,790
you can't see anyone else.

240
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,040
Like when I won first place
in the sprint

241
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,910
at the School Anniversary,

242
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,620
all my classmates
came to celebrate with me,

243
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,330
but I could only saw He Shi.

244
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,000
She gave me a bottle of water.

245
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,040
And then,

246
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,870
I accidentally brushed against her.

247
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
She...

248
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,120
I got so nervous.

249
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,410
I even...

250
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,120
I even... I even wanted to kiss her.

251
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,790
I'll go get some water.

252
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,660
Hey, Shi Yu.

253
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,580
Oh, Tian, you're back.

254
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
What's wrong with him?

255
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,040
What do you mean?

256
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,160
What were you guys doing?

257
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,540
We were watching a horror movie.

258
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,870
I wanted to build some courage.

259
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,200
Sheng Wang just got back,

260
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,040
so I asked him to join me.

261
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,790
Him?

262
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,920
Yeah.

263
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,870
So, you both were trembling together?

264
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,410
No, no.

265
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,160
Sheng's got nerves of steel.

266
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,450
I was terrified,

267
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,910
but he stayed completely calm.

268
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,410
He's got nerves of steel?

269
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,590
Yeah.

270
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:17,950
Are you scared?

271
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,830
How about we share my bed?

272
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,450
Hey.

273
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,790
Why are you standing at the door?

274
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,580
Aren't you scare...

275
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,910
What's wrong?

276
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,500

Everyone, line up.

312
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,660
The teacher will call the roll.

313
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,540
Okay.

314
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,000
- Did you bring all your things?
- Line up.

315
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,580
You can't even button your shirt.

316
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,040
Hey, no peeking. Don't look at him.

317
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,080
Why are you wearing a jacket?

318
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,700
Got a cold?

319
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,160
No. The wind is strong in autumn.
I'm just cold.

320
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,450
Or are you feeling unwell?

321
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,450
No, I'm fine.

322
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,750
Come on, Tian.

323
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,660
You did it wrong too.

324
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,450
You guys are so clumsy.

325
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,950
Your left and right brain
aren't balanced.

326
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,580
Maybe you should
get your cerebellum checked.

327
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,410
Yeah, maybe I should.

328
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,200
I twisted my ankle during long jump

329
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,500
and I fall a lot.

330
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,330
I've seen you fall a few times.

331
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah.

332
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,660
I fall a lot.

333
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,870
My brain doesn't work. I'm clumsy.

334
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,790
Why are you mad?

335
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,200
I'm not mad.

336
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:29,870
Little Pepper, help me.

337
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,080
I have an underdeveloped cerebellum.

338
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,960
I can't button my shirt.

339
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:32,910
It's done, you idiot.

340
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,160
You didn't zip up your pants.

341
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,830
Just do me a favor.

342
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,450
Your fly is open.

343
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,120
You didn't zip your fly.

344
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,290
You pervert.

345
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,500
Looks good.
You should keep it like this.

346
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,000
Hello, everyone.

347
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,500
Hello, Director Xu.

348
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,580
Today, many of your teachers

349
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,790
are busy with classes,

350
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,160
so I will be

351
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,750
supervising with two substitute teachers

352
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,950
to take you to the exam.

353
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,160
Do your best and show what you've got.

354
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,040
Alright, let's go.

355
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,200
Everyone, get on the bus.

356
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,290
I'll take the front seat.

357
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,700
Come on. Get on.

358
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,120
Jiang Tian, I didn't know
you wear glasses.

359
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,540
Just in case I need them

360
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,410
for the exam.

361
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,700
That's a good attitude.

362
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,410
Use that energy to tackle the challenge.

363
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,830
Great. Get on the bus.

364
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,620
Sheng Wang, you're not nearsighted?

365
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,200
I had pseudomyopia from gaming,

366
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,410
but it's corrected now.

367
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,700
I don't have any vision problems.

368
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,120
Good.

369
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,620
Come on. Get on the bus.

370
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,750
Hey, Sheng.

371
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,290
Sit over here.

00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,180
(Sheng Wang)

375
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,950
The exam begins.

376
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:52,790
(Yes,)

377
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,950
(that's it.)

378
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,040
(It's like my pseudomyopia.)

379
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,950
(I just need to correct it.)

380
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,370
Hey, Sheng.

381
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,370
How did you do on the exam?

382
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:02,750
Not well.

383
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,120
Not well? You always say that,

384
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,290
but then you nail it.

385
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,370
This time, I really didn't do well.

386
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,670
Hey.

387
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,120
I heard Sheng didn't do well this time.

388
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,040
How do you know?

389
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,410
He just said it on the bus.

390
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,450
For real?

391
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,790
Yeah, seriously.

392
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,540
And he usually says

393
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,370
"Not bad" after an exam,

394
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,410
but this time he just said

395
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,290
he didn't do well.

396
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,540
Maybe he really didn't do well.

397
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,790
Even if he didn't,

398
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,080
he must have done better than us.

399
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,540
This mock exam, our class

400
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,870
did fine.

401
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,450
Sir, don't scare us.

402
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,040
We're all really nervous.

403
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,500
Your physics average was the best
out of the four schools,

404
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,700
and your math was also first.

405
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,910
But English was fourth.

406
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,200
Ms. Yang Jing is not in a good mood,

407
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,790
so be ready to get scolded.

408
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,700
But you do have some highlights.

409
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,950
Jiang Tian was still ranked number one.

410
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,290
He was first among all four schools,

411
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,870
beating the second place by 21 points.

412
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,410
Tian! You are amazing!

413
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,450
You are not even human!
You are not human!

414
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,750
Yeah, he's a freak.

415
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,950
Well, I mean you are

416
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:24,790
freaking good.

417
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,410
Here's another highlight.

418
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,080
More students ranked higher this time.

419
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,370
Normally, around 10 students

420
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:35,040
of our class fall outside the top 30.

421
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,120
This time,

422
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,250
it was only six students.

423
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,250
But these six students

424
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,450
will have to leave Class A.

425
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,250
I'll hand out your report cards now.

426
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,330
If you don't get yours,

427
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,910
come see me after class.

428
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,660
I'm the lucky 30th.

429
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,700
I don't have to leave Class A!

430
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,620
Gao Tianyang, simmer down.

431
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,460
Sit down.

432
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,000
What's wrong, Tian?

433
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,040
Not happy with being No.1
among the four schools?

434
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,950
I didn't have a report card.

435
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,950
Life's not fair.

436
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,410
The heavens favor the best-looking.

437
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,500
And that's me, the most handsome.

438
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,750
You are not.

439
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,200
Sheng is way better looking than you.

440
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,700
That doesn't even make sense.
It's totally weird.

441
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,790
What'd I expect from you?

442
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,290
Did you cheat?

443
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,040
- You're hopeless.
- You think I cheated?

444
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,830
Alright, enough.

445
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,080
Sheng.

446
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,370
I can't accept it.

447
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,620
I still can't believe it.

448
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,790
I don't believe it either.

449
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,750
Even Gao Tianyang made it,

450
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,870
how could you not, Sheng?

451
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,290
Yeah, even I made it.

452
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,000
I've told you,

453
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,830
I really didn't do well this time.

454
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,200
I thought you were just being modest.

455
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,040
Yeah, everyone says that

456
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,580
after every exam.

457
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,910
I thought that was just a polite remark.

458
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,290
I never make polite remarks.

459
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,950
That's true.

460
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,450
Sheng is always straightforward.

461
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,790
Thank you.

462
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,870
But if you...

463
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,750
Alright. I'm just moving
from downstairs to upstairs,

464
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,000
It's not even a big deal.

465
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,450
No need to get sentimental.

466
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,580
It's fine.

467
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,450
Next time we switch classes
will be after the finals.

468
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,370
Sheng, be sure to come back by then.

469
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,500
Sheng.

470
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,910
Good luck.

471
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,000
Again?

472
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,920
We'll be waiting for you.

473
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,170
Oh, right.

474
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,290
You've got to study hard
for the next while.

475
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,330
I have to study hard?

476
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,660
You have to study hard.

477
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,330
No, you have to study hard.

478
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,080
If I make it back next time

479
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,620
and you're still in 30th,

480
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,830
you'll have to leave, right?

481
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,410
- Sounds good.
- Great.

482
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,500
Whoa, that's true.

483
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,160
That would be awesome.

484
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,000
Swapping you for Sheng?

485
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,870
Perfect!

486
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,710
Sounds good.

487
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,000
Ah, I just remembered

488
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,080
Old He wants to see me.

489
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,000
- I'll see you around.
- Old He?

490
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,840
Bring it to class for me.

491
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,120
Seriously, I need to study hard.

492
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,500
If I leave, Little Pepper will miss me.

493
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,450
Didn't you say you count on
your good looks?

494
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,060
Ms. Wu. Ms. Yang.

495
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,950
Morning.

496
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,580
They still got
the basic questions wrong.

497
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,120
I don't know what they were thinking.

498
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,540
We went over these in class.

499
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,090
Excuse me.

500
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,870
Quick arrival.

501
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,330
Perfect timing.

502
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,290
Come on in.

503
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,410
How did you do the two
reading comprehension questions?

504
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,910
We've gone over this many times.

505
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:08,160
For reading comprehension
and poetry appreciation questions,

506
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,450
answer according to the points.

507
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,910
For an 8-point question,
cover four points.

508
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,660
For a 6-point question, cover three.

509
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,250
You know this well,

510
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,660
how did you mess it up?

511
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,830
Sheng Wang,

512
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,370
what was going on this time?

513
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,660
Why did you make such basic mistakes?

514
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,160
Ms. Yang, let's not
dwell on his English.

515
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,120
He got the highest English score
in the school.

516
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,290
Do you really think
you're impressive for that?

517
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,250
I've seen plenty of top students

518
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,450
besides him in my life.

519
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,370
Don't try to show off here.

520
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,540
You'd better think about

521
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,410
why you made those mistakes.

522
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,160
I've reviewed his test papers.

523
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,160
We can't say that

524
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,080
he answered randomly.

525
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,910
Some answers were

526
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,410
actually quite good.

527
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,700
But he made some small mistakes.

528
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,450
They're not just in one subject.

529
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,330
You made small mistakes in all subjects

530
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,700
and it really added up.

531
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,040
Be more careful about that.

532
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,950
Understand?

533
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,370
But how did you even mess up

534
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,200
the English grammar questions?

535
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,120
That cost you about five points.

536
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,450
What does that mean?

537
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,160
Those five points

538
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,410
could have kept you in Class A.

539
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:18,330
Do you know that?

540
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,000
Alright. He gets it.

541
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,870
Sheng Wang,

542
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,830
we really don't want to see you leave.

543
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,660
But you'll have other chances.

544
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,040
Work hard next time, okay?

545
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,040
Go back to class.

546
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,540
Thank you, everyone. I'll take my leave.

547
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,370
I just can't believe that.

548
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,500
How could he...

549
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,790
Everyone, time for class.

550
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,080
Please pass on the test papers.

551
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,200
Take a look at where you went wrong.

552
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,370
We'll review it later.

553
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,250
Where is he?

554
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,410
I don't know.

555
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,540
Wasn't he here earlier?

556
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,700
Brother.

557
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,540
Are you mad at me?

558
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,000
No.

559
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,210
Oh.

560
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,910
You two are just in time!

561
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,830
You're not dragging
your feet today, huh?

562
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,830
The food's just ready.

563
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:09,080
Here's today's special dish,
steamed fish head with chopped chili.

564
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,410
Wow, awesome.

565
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,580
I'm starving.

566
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,290
Grab your chopsticks and dig in.

567
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,160
- Yummy.
- Really?

568
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,500
Mmm, tasty.

569
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,370
Tian, is it tasty?

570
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,750
Mmm.

571
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,040
Look at you.

572
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,620
I thought I might have
poisoned the food.

573
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,290
Why the long face?

574
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,250
If I smiled while eating,

575
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,540
you'd think it was weird, right?

576
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,660
Yeah, yeah. Alright.

577
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,370
You totally set me up for that.

578
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,370
Oh, right.

579
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,910
Mute, come and give me a hand.

580
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,620
The shrimp's defrosted.

581
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,200
Let's peel them. Hurry up.

582
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,790
Come on, stop eating.

583
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,250
Do you have a stomachache?

584
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,660
No, I just ate too much.

585
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:11,450
Where's your bracelet?

586
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,250
It broke.

587
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,540
Does that bother you?

588
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,450
If so,

589
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,330
then tell me,

590
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,830
did you lie to Old He and Yang Jing
like this in the office?

591
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,210
(Yes,)

592
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,370
(that's it.)

593
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,580
(It's like my pseudomyopia.)

594
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,500
(I just need to correct it.)

595
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,700
I said,

596
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,370
did you lie to them like this
in the office?

597
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,290
About what?

598
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,580
About screwing up your exam.

599
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,370
That was an important exam.

600
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,540
Why would I mess it up on purpose?

601
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,410
It wouldn't have done me any good.

602
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,040
Where are you going?

603
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,660
When are you moving?

604
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,120
When are you going to Class B?

605
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,090
At noon.

606
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,620
I'll go before the lunch break ends.

607
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,120
I'll go back later.

608
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,910
I really messed up.

609
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,200
I made mistakes in every subject.

610
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:55,170

617
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,540
It's already too crooked.

618
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,580
You've got to snap off the bent part.

619
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,580
Only then can new buds sprout

620
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,870
and fresh, beautiful leaves grow back.

621
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,750
They'll go another class later.

622
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,330
Yeah, the school's being
really strict this time.

623
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,080
Can't we ask the teacher to reconsider?

624
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,660
It's okay.

625
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,250

628
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,910
They will.

629
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,540
They definitely will!

00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:08,950
Let's go back to our seats.

638

Keep it down.

00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,910
- I'm just being honest.
- Sheng, you too,

640
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:13,830
study hard.

641
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:16,500

Tian's just helping someone else.

654
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,790
He's really got some pull.

655
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:16,330
Which seat?

656
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,620
Hey, sit here.

I'll go back then.

Brother.

664
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,500
Why are you avoiding me?

665
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,250
Because you like Yang Jing?

666
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,160
Or is it just for fun?

667
00:47:58,830 --> 00:47:59,670
Impulsive?

668
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,410
Or regret?

669
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,080
None of those.

670
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,290
Then for what?

671
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,080
Because I like you.

672
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,330
New student,

673
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,120
you can sit here for now.

674
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,200
Wait.
