Jiang Tian!

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,830
(There are about seven billion
people on Earth,)

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,870
(if each person's average lifespan
is 80 years,)

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,200
(you may encounter 1,000 people per day,)

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,330
(and you will meet
about 292 million people all your life.)

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,870
I'm going to school.

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,950
(The probability of two people meeting
is 0.00417.)

8
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,080
(If you like him,)

9
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,080
(and he also likes you,)

10
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,080
(you're "the on1y one" for each other.)

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,290
(That probability is only 0.0000173...)

12
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,770
(Guandu Bridge)

13
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,620
(In everyone's life,)

14
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,450
(there will be the very moment,)

15
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,700
(a special one)

16
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,620
(on which your mind lingers.)

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,950
(That's the most important memory
of your life.)

18
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,040
(Our old house is in Tamsui,)

19
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,120
(but I moved away when I was seven.)

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,660
(And I never came back)

21
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,040
(after my mom passed away...)

22
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,370
(I haven't been back in a while,)

23
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,500
(and I don't remember anything)

24
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,200
(except that it was hot)

25
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,000
(and my mom always made
mint honey lemon water.)

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,540
(I wonder if Tamsui is still as hot in summer.)

Wang, do you really not need me
to help you with the registration?

00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,500
No, I can do it by myself.

41
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,560
Thank you, Uncle Chen.

00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,540

43
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,720
(Class A Grade 2)

44
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,120
News!

45
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,330
Excuse me, sorry.

46
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,450
Big news!

47
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,700
- What's up?
- We're getting a new student.

48
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,080
A new student?

49
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,580
Who is it?

50
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,750
I just heard it at the Student Affairs.

51
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,830
Impossible.

52
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,500
The second year in high school is critical.

53
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,250
- Who would transfer in at this time?
- Right.

54
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,100
Really? Is it a boy or a girl?

55
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,400
Directly entering our Advanced Class for math,
physics, and chemistry,

56
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,580
this person must be something.

57
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,290
Maybe a straight-A student.

58
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,450
Hey, is it true?

59
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,930
It's true, I just saw it.

60
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,620
(Short, Fat)
A boy,

61
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,700
looks...

62
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,580
fair-skinned and quite handsome.

63
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,040
Is he tall?

64
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,790
He looks about 185 cm.

65
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,540
- 185.
- That's 30 cm taller than you.

66
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,410
- Hey, Tian.
- Good morning, Tian.

67
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,040
- Tian.
- Sorry.

68
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,450
Hey, where is he from?

69
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,450
(Ugly)

70
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,750
I heard it's an international school
in Shanghai.

71
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,870
An international school?

72
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,950
An international school?

73
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,790
High tuition, bilingual education.

74
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,540
His English must be really good.

75
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,950
Be careful.

76
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,370
Hey, Tian.

77
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,290
We got a new student from Shanghai,

78
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,660
and his grades are good.

79
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,040
Gao Tianyang is really bad.

80
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,250
Watch out for your position.

81
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,500
None of my business.

82
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,790
So grumpy.

83
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,410
Handsome.

84
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,790
185 cm, he should be as tall as I.

85
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,950
- No.
- For real, do you know how tall you are?

86
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,200
He's about...

87
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,790
Twice as tall as Chili.

88
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,000
Impossible.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,620
- Twice as tall as Li Yu.
- Almost.

90
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,160
Maybe he is as tall as Qi Jiahao.

91
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,830
Wang, are you out of your mind?

92
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,950
(Instructors' Office)
Why didn't you let Uncle Chen go with you?

93
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,120
(Student Affairs)
No.

94
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,540
(Mobile phones are not allowed at school.)
I'm not out of my mind, I'm fine.

95
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,450
I...

96
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,160
It's your first day at the new school.

97
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,120
It's better to have someone with you.

98
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,660
- I...
- Alright, let's not talk about this.

99
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,580
- How's the new school?
- It's...

100
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,870
By the way, did you meet Mr. Xu?

101
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,950
I'm asking if you met Mr. Xu.

102
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,000
Wang, hello?

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,290
What do you want me to say?

104
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,660
You don't give me any chance.

105
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,040
No, I just want to tell you…

106
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,080
Who is Mr. Xu?

107
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,830
Mr. Xu is the head of Student Affairs.

108
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,580
He's a bit fat,

109
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,750
and looks quite proper, but a bit serious.

110
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,870
Mr. Xu said he would pick you up.

111
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,160
You didn't see him?

112
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,120
No.

113
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,750
The teacher who brought me up

114
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,160
was quite kind and friendly.

115
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,540
He's always smiling.

116
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,750
But he is talkative,

117
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,830
like Paul Frank.

118
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,950
That's him.

119
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,330
Do you call that a serious

120
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,330
and proper look?

121
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,000
Well, it's good for you

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,200
to tell your family that you've arrived.

123
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,660
Sorry. I'm done talking.

124
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,600
And...

125
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,900
(Mobile phones are not allowed at school.)
Mobile phones are not allowed

126
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,830
at school.

127
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,290
Look,

128
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,790
like I told you just now,

129
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,450
the new student has a charming face,

130
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,160
but you can tell that he is a good student.

131
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,950
Here you go. These are the textbooks

132
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,910
(Physics)
you will need for this semester, theoretically.

133
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,370
You can take a look.

134
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,040
Theoretically?

135
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,830
Are there any other textbooks?

136
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,290
I've reviewed your records.

137
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,000
Do you often transfer between schools?

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,080
Yes, because of my dad's job.

139
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,700
I mostly followed him around.

140
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,620
So, you once lived in Shanghai?

141
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,660
I attended an international school in Shanghai.

142
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,080
No wonder you have a special accent.

143
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,870
Your English must be pretty good.

144
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,500
At our school,

145
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,540
there might be slight differences

146
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,790
in the curriculum and schedule.

147
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,500
Our school has a long history for many years.

148
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,200
The enrollment rate

149
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,450
is particularly high.

150
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,790
The Class A Grade 2 you're about to join

151
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,120
is an Advanced Class for math,
physics, chemistry.

152
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,500
Advanced class, you know?

153
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,290
Advanced class.

154
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,330
- Yes, I know.
- It's the best.

155
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,410
That is the best class for math,
physics, chemistry in the Senior Two.

156
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,620
(Honor Roll)
Look at this Honor Roll.

157
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,250
These are all your classmates
in the Senior Two.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,040
Oh no.

159
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,250
(Jiang Tian)
Who's doodling hearts on the Honor Roll?

160
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,090
Right.

161
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,830
And their surnames are all Jiang...

162
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,950
Another Jiang?

163
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,200
I've been running into a lot of Jiangs lately.

164
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,500
What?

165
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,580
I mean...

166
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,790
People with the surname Jiang
are all very talented,

167
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,160
and very outstanding.

168
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,160
Look, this Jiang Tian

169
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,330
(Class A Grade 2, Jiang Tian)
takes up a row on the Honor Roll.

170
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,450
He's the top student in all subjects.

171
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,040
- Yes.
- Really outstanding.

172
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,290
Alright, let's move on.

173
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,500
There are eight classes

174
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,310
in the first grade, all in the same building.

175
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,270
(Honor Roll)

176
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,410
3, 2, 1, yeah!

177
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,450
The empty seat over there is for you.

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,950
Director!

179
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,790
Dad.

180
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,620
Good morning, Director.

181
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,750
Come on, this seat is for you.

182
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,580
I know.

183
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,870
It might be challenging to catch up now.

184
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,620
The only solution

185
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,040
is to ask for your peers' help

186
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,750
whenever you have questions.

187
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,400
Do you know

188
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,750
why this special seat is kept for you?

189
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,600
Of all the students in this grade,

190
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,520
he is the most suitable and outstanding.

191
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,880
Many students come to him for help
with their homework after class.

192
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,850
It's just...

193
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,600
Really? He's...

194
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,560
Director,

195
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,310
we have a meeting soon.

196
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,430
Okay, coming.

197
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,970
I'll be there right away.

198
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,810
Thank you.

199
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,390
He is sleeping so...

200
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,720
Oh, right.

201
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,350
It's your first day, so I'll make an exception.

202
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,390
Starting tomorrow, no earphones,

203
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,850
phones,

204
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,350
or such gadgets in the classroom.

205
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,520
I'll be watching.

206
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,360
Darn it!

207
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,470
Gao Tianyang,

208
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,220
you think you hid it well?
It's the second time.

209
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,600
See, this is a prime example.

210
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
I'll keep it.

211
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,890
- Where is the Discipline Officer?
- Here.

212
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,770
Gao Tianyang loses three points
for using phones

213
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,060
and one more point

214
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,060
for swearing.

215
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,180
Got it.

216
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,640
Good luck.

217
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,100
Caught again?

218
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,390
Sorry about that.

219
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,100
It seems like I'm responsible for that.

220
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,470
But...

221
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,220
cheer up.

222
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,020
Well,

223
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,810
it's not your fault.

224
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,220
It's not the first time.

225
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,310
They check phones every now and then.

226
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,060
We all have been through this.

227
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,220
I haven't.

228
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,850
Bro,

229
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,850
why would a young guy

230
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,140
like you

231
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,020
transfer in the second year of high school?

232
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,640
And to our class?

233
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,310
Because of my dad.

234
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,520
Class begins. Hey, have a seat.

235
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,310
Return to your seat.

236
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,750
Go.

237
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,030
Class begins.

238
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,430
Your breathing bothers me.

239
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,220
My breathing bothers you?

240
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,470
Tian, this is the new student.

241
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,930
Big Mouth wants you
to help him with his studies.

242
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:41,970
What are you doing?

243
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,180
Changing my seat. You sit in front.

244
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,410
Why should I sit in front?

245
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,100
What do you think?

246
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,390
Come on, new guy.

247
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,390
Our pal, Jiang Tian, here

248
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,060
just woke up and might be grumpy.

249
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,100
Don't mind him.

250
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,940
Okay.

251
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,930
So, he is Jiang Tian?

252
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:31,850
Uh-huh.

253
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,270
I've been running into a lot of Jiangs lately.

254
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,020
Yeah, yeah.

255
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,560
Wow.

256
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,470
I don't know why.

257
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,720
I feel like I have been

258
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,020
running into a lot of Jiangs lately.

259
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,060
Why?

260
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,100
I don't know. I just...

261
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,640
Hey, Wang.

262
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,600
Come on.

263
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Come on.

264
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,310
Let me introduce you.

265
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,520
Come on.

266
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,930
Come on.

267
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,890
Wang, this is Mrs. Jiang.

268
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,970
I wanted to introduce her to you before,

269
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,680
but you didn't come for dinner.

270
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,810
You finally met today.

271
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,060
Wang,

272
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,890
Mrs. Jiang and I
were primary school classmates.

273
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,180
We lost contact for a long time.

274
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,770
Until a few years ago, we reconnected online.

275
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,810
Have a seat.

276
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,430
Thank you.

277
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,100
I want to try it first.

278
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,310
Don't sneak a bite.

279
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,640
I'm just hungry.

280
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,650
Okay.

281
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,600
Is it delicious?

282
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,680
It's so delicious.

283
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,680
I wonder if Sheng Wang

284
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,930
will like the dishes I made.

285
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,100
Of course, he will like them.
I've tried them all.

286
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,970
- That's great.
- He's not like you.

287
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,810
I don't know, I...

288
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,770
I just feel very anxious.

289
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,220
I don't know how he will react when he sees me.

290
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,520
Dear,

291
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,470
everything will be fine.

292
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,310
Don't be nervous.

293
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,970
I'll call him to ask where he is.

294
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,600
It's okay.

295
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,140
This is Mrs. Jiang's son, Jiang Tian.

296
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,190
Him?

297
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,270
Jiang Tian is a few months older than you.

298
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,390
So, he's your brother.

299
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,390
Brother?

300
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,600
Good boy.

301
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,450
You...

302
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,640
Well,

303
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,180
you have probably met at school today.

304
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,970
I slept all day and didn't notice.

305
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,810
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

306
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,810
I know,

307
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,220
it's the first day you met.
You're not familiar with each other.

308
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,560
You'll get along as time goes by.

309
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,630
I'll leave first if that's all.

310
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,650
Wait.

311
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,930
I have a stomachache.

312
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:38,890
I'll go first.

313
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,220
Hey, Wang.

314
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,180
Tian, what are you doing? Where are you going?

315
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,310
I'm going to Mr. Ding's place.

316
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,060
Hey, you...

317
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,770
Wang, are you okay?

318
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,220
This helps with your cold.

319
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,640
Here you are.

320
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,180
Why do you keep hanging up on me?

321
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,850
Okay, I see,

322
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,930
you forget your old friends

323
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,310
after you transferred to a new school.

324
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,970
I tell you, I'm the kind of person who...

325
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,810
Hello.

326
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,680
Excuse me, why do you keep hanging up on…

327
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,520
Okay.

328
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,970
I won't ask anymore, okay?

329
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,520
I apologize to you, is that okay?

330
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,970
Okay.

331
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,390
Then go and get me
the final exam papers for math,

332
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,140
physics and chemistry in Senior Two.

333
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,720
The final exam papers?

334
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,890
Why do you need them?

335
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,890
(Basic Physics (I))

336
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,320
(Chemistry 1)
Really? Why are you so serious?

337
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,680
(Chinese Literature 1)
You're previewing

338
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,930
(Chinese Literature 1)
at the beginning of the semester?

339
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,970
But that's not right.

340
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,770
For previewing,
why do you need the final exam papers?

341
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,640
Hey, can you please say something to me?

342
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,600
Sheng Wang.

343
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,600
Sheng Wang!

344
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,310
Here we go again.

345
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,350
Fine, so you're not talking to me,

346
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,560
until I get the papers for you, right?

347
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,930
Okay, that's great.

348
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,520
You're something, whatever you say.

349
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,680
Math, physics and chemistry, right?

350
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,970
Okay, I'll get them for you.

351
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,060
Wait a minute.

352
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,680
Why not Chinese and English?

353
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,100
Do you have subject discrimination?

354
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,270
You're the one with subject discrimination.

355
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,140
I can't study so much in one night, can I?

356
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,470
I have to make choices, understand?

357
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,640
No.

358
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,850
Well, it's because the school I'm going to now

359
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,560
is having an exam

360
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,970
on my second day at school.

361
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,090
And it tests all the content
for the first semester of Senior Two.

362
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,310
It's been so long since class started.

363
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,600
Why has no teacher come?

364
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,680
It's Saturday,

365
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,640
and this is a supplementary program
for summer vacation.

366
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,890
So we self-study all day.

367
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,850
Didn't you bring any exam papers
or assessments?

368
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,930
I just came here today.

369
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,720
I forgot.

370
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,640
How do you review the knowledge?

371
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,020
Using textbooks?

372
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,060
Review?

373
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,890
Why should I review anything?

374
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,270
Because there's a weekly exam next week.

375
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,100
What did you say?

376
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,680
Exam.

377
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,310
What to test? Content for Senior One?

378
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,810
That's the exam before the last one.

379
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,770
Why test it again?

380
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,680
These are what the exam is for.

381
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,020
The director said these are
what we're supposed to learn this semester.

382
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,770
Theoretically, yes,

383
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,930
but we've studied them.

384
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,310
We studied them a couple of days ago,
today we review them,

385
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,420
and we'll take the exam tomorrow.

386
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,060
After that,
we start the courses for the second semester.

387
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,970
How many subjects have you learned?

388
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,640
Both.

389
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,180
Do you mean all?

390
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,140
Never mind. You mean

391
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,720
I have to take exams on five subjects
I haven't learned.

392
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,640
I guess so.

393
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,890
Can I ask for leave?

394
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,180
Probably not.

395
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,270
I can only say, bro,

396
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,220
you've got a long way to go. Good luck.

397
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,220
You can find someone

398
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,310
to beat up Mr. Xu after graduation.

399
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,720
Any other questions?

400
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,730
Yes.

401
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:18,810
Shoot.

402
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,270
I want to drop out.

403
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,890
If I don't cram now,

404
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,970
I'll score five zeros tomorrow.

405
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,890
There's no time for Chinese and English.

406
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,930
It's in God's hands now.

407
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,270
I can only do something for math,
physics and chemistry.

408
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,680
Wait,

409
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,890
what's the use of the exam papers?

410
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,850
It's not like the questions
will repeat themselves.

411
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,430
Who said I was going to do these papers?

412
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,890
I want to see

413
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,970
the score distribution on the exam paper.

414
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,110
Huh?

415
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,470
In short,

416
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,640
although each school's exam questions
are different,

417
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,930
the key points are similar.

418
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,220
I want to see the score distribution
on the exam papers

419
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,390
to find out the key points.

420
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,810
I'll focus on these key points tonight,

421
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,970
and cram a bit.

422
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,520
This way, the cost-performance ratio is high.

423
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,140
Wow, does it work?

424
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,720
What else can I do?

425
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,060
I just make every possible effort.

426
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,350
By the way,

427
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,140
do you still remember the best guesses tips?

428
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,060
I forgot.

429
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,810
What?

430
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,220
I can't believe you would need those tips!

431
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,100
No choice,

432
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,970
I used to

433
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,020
take up rows on the Honor Roll.

434
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,570
(Class A Grade 2, Jiang Tian, The Top Student)

435
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,270
What do you think?

436
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,890
I can't let them laugh at me

437
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,810
in the first exam I took at the school.

438
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,270
Besides,

439
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,970
I can't disgrace our school.

440
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,640
Exactly, well said.

441
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,640
Let me think. I remember it very well.

442
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,140
You remember it very well
but still need to think?

443
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,810
Don't interrupt.

444
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,850
Ah, I got it.

445
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,520
Choose the shortest over three very long ones.

446
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,270
Choose the longest over three very short ones.

447
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,680
Choose A when all four are long,
and B when all four are short.

448
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,470
If there's no clear pattern, choose C.

449
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
For two long and two short choices,
you choose D.

450
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,470
This is not funny.

451
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,060
I'm helping you, seriously.

452
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,350
Forget it, that's all.

453
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,190
I will hang up.

454
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,310
I will distribute the math papers first.

455
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,890
(Math)
Wait until the bell rings to start writing.

456
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,430
Everyone should have a sense of honor.

457
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,520
Exams are for your own benefit.

458
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,140
Cheating, peeking, copying others' answers

459
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,520
are all wrong behaviors.

460
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,970
You should be prepared at all times.

461
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,890
Good luck.

462
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,310
At least, there's a new student behind you.

463
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,180
What are you planning to do?

464
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,560
What else can I do? Just go with the flow.

465
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,470
At worst,
I'll just choose C for multiple choices.

466
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,800
Why are you laughing?

467
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,090
You gotta be kidding.

468
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,300
(Danying Senior High School,)
There are no multiple-choice questions

469
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,970
(101 Academic Year, First Semester)
in the math paper?

470
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,900
What?

471
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,390
You should try to

472
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,470
write C
for all the fill-in-the-blank questions.

473
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,160
I'll fill in whatever I want,
none of your business.

474
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,720
There's no need for you to tell me especially.

475
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,720
Are you crazy?

476
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,520
What are you doing?

477
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,930
How long do you plan

478
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,430
to hold onto my exam paper?

479
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,600
Start answering.

480
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,180
Time's up.

481
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,100
Stop writing.

482
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,560
Pass the exam papers forward.

483
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,890
Hey, where are you going?

484
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,720
Oh, I ran out of water.

485
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,270
I'm gonna get some for the next exam.

486
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,770
Don't you know there's another exam paper?

487
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,520
Okay.

488
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,270
I forgot to tell you, we have two math papers.

489
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,430
One main paper,

490
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,850
and one additional questions paper.

491
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,350
What other rules do you have?

492
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,560
Hello,

493
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,600
there are no other rules

494
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,270
other than math.

495
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,220
Give me the exam paper.

496
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,890
Everyone got the second exam paper?

497
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,470
You can start answering.

498
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,720
- I heard that the handsome guy from Class A
- Remember the two things I once told you?

499
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,930
is going to score zero in today's exams.

500
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,560
It will definitely be a bit difficult
to use later.

501
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,390
You need to remember them.

502
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,680
I heard he hasn't studied anything
in the textbook.

503
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,600
That's so cool.

504
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,560
Okay, it's decided.

505
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,930
I'll leave the school network upgrade to you.

506
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,560
- Alright.
- Your dad...

507
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,140
My dad's matters have nothing to do with me.

508
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,720
If there's nothing else, I'll be leaving.

509
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,640
Okay.

510
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,180
Sorry.

511
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,770
I'm not eavesdropping.

512
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,180
It just happened that Old He... No.

513
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,560
Our class teacher asked me
to come to the office.

514
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,970
Our class teacher is just
in his early thirties.

515
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,930
It's not proper to call him Old He, is it?

516
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,930
Isn't the class teacher looking for you?

517
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,680
Get in.

518
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,520
Okay.

519
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,930
Old... well, Mr. He, you want to see me?

520
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,630
- Yes, Sheng Wang, hi.
- Hi.

521
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,020
Actually, it's nothing serious.

522
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,220
I have not introduced you to the class

523
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,310
because I wasn't at school.

524
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,350
I went to a physics seminar.

525
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,560
I feel sorry about that.

526
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,930
Besides, about your schedule,

527
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,470
I heard from Director Xu

528
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,680
that you're a whole semester behind.

529
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,310
If I was here,

530
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,770
I would have told the school

531
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,810
to exempt you from the weekly exam.

532
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,580
What? But I already finished it.

533
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,600
So, you must feel torturous

534
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,850
during the exam.

535
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,350
Doesn't matter,
we all understand your situation.

536
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,890
This score is null.

537
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,220
It's normal to score 5 or 10 points.

538
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,060
Don't be stressful.

539
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,390
Okay.

540
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,430
But...

541
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,020
the huge lag in your schedule is a problem.

542
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,290
Everything in Class A goes very quickly.

543
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,920
Even if it's only the first semester
in Senior Two,

544
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,890
we will finish all the courses of Senior Three.

545
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,600
We can't stop and wait for you.

546
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,220
So, you must find a way yourself

547
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,430
to keep up with our pace

548
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,770
and fill in the gap.

549
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,230
I see.

550
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,100
Also, although the score is null,

551
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,850
there will be another exam next week.

552
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,890
You can't keep going like this.

553
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,220
I discussed it with the other teachers,

554
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,350
and we set a small goal.

555
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,310
Let's work on it week by week,

556
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,930
and try to catch up with the progress, okay?

557
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,100
Okay.

558
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,940
Great.

559
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,180
For physics and chemistry,

560
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,060
we hope you can score 50 points next week.

561
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,350
For math,
excluding the additional questions paper,

562
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,560
we hope you can score at least 60 points.

563
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,270
For Chinese and English, we can adjust it

564
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,430
depending on the situation.

565
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,650
What's wrong? Is it too difficult?

566
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,520
Um...

567
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,220
No, I'll try.

568
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,560
Okay, that's all. Keep it up.

569
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,400
Hmm.

570
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,470
Are you kidding me?

571
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,100
Two to three papers for each subject

572
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,890
at the beginning of the school year?

573
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,480
For Chinese, there are cloze tests and writing.

574
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,420
While for English,
there's a whole set of grammar questions.

575
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,720
It's not your first day at Danying.

576
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,850
You'll get used to it.

577
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,810
I want to drop out.

578
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,680
It's too late for that.

579
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:33,770
I was wondering
why you decided to transfer to Danying,

580
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,100
and even join Class A.

581
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,680
The scores of yesterday's weekly exam are out.

582
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,430
I think everyone

583
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,270
is eager to know your results.

584
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,890
I'm sorry to inform you all

585
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,930
that the average score this time

586
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,310
is lower than last time.

587
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:00,810
Why are you upset?

588
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,770
Some of you

589
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,270
have really made a great effort

590
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,220
to lower the class average.

591
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,090
Hey.

592
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,890
Why are you staring at him?

593
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,810
I was just about to talk about this.

594
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,060
Sheng Wang,

595
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,560
please stand up.

596
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,470
Sheng Wang joined us the day before yesterday.

597
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,890
He hasn't studied any of the exam subjects.

598
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,230
It's true

599
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,970
he didn't pass

600
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,060
in math, physics, and chemistry,

601
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,020
but his scores are higher
than our class average.

602
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,600
And he scored significantly higher
than the average in Chinese and English.

603
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,680
He scored ten to twenty points

604
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,350
higher than you, the gifted students,

605
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,930
who have completed the entire textbook.

606
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,720
To do this, he only spent

607
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,640
one day.

608
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,720
Sheng Wang,
thank you very much for motivating everyone.

609
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,560
Please sit down.

610
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:02,890
Okay.

611
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,930
Next, we will distribute the exam papers.

612
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,770
Correct the mistakes.

613
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,970
Submit them after correction.

614
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,710
Then start working on today's exam paper.

615
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,520
Don't waste time.

616
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,850
Although it's the summer vacation,

617
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,060
time is limited.

618
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,520
If you have questions, ask your peers.

619
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,430
If they don't know either, ask the teachers.

620
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,100
Correct your mistakes.

621
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:36,810
Thank you.

622
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,520
I'll keep it,

623
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,310
then you won't be tempted
to mess with it later.

624
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,150
Come on.

625
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,390
(Jiang Tian)

626
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:55,390
Do you want your exam paper?

627
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,680
My pen for your paper.

628
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,680
No way.

629
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,220
Didn't you hear the teacher?

630
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,430
You need to submit it immediately
after correcting it.

631
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,020
No need.

632
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,180
Do you have a lot of time?

633
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,640
Let me do a simple calculation for you.

634
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,930
Assuming it takes you 30 minutes
to complete one practice paper,

635
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,350
there are two to three papers per subject.

636
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,680
Then it will take you five hours

637
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,810
to do ten papers for five subjects.

638
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,970
Subtract one hour for eating and bathing.

639
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,140
It will

640
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,970
take you at least six hours.

641
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,680
What time do you think
you can go to bed tonight?

642
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,020
Moreover, you might not be able to
finish one paper in 30 minutes.

643
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,980
And

644
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,270
there are also
some particularly difficult questions.

645
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,350
Each might take you 30 minutes.

646
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:09,100
Or maybe longer.

647
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,430
- Hello.
- Yes?

648
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,600
Can I borrow a red pen?

649
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,440
I need it.

650
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,770
I'll let you copy it later.

651
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,390
Here, try this. See if it's marinated well.

652
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,230
Okay.

653
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,020
well, it's quite tasty.

654
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,810
Wang, you're back.

655
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,470
Wang, wait a minute.

656
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,720
I'm talking to you, Wang.

657
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,350
I called Mr. Xu,

658
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,770
the head of Student Affairs.

659
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,810
He said you did well on yesterday's exam.

660
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,310
That means you're not strict with me.

661
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,420
I failed three subjects.

662
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,680
It's hard to communicate with him.

663
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,100
I told you I shouldn't move in.

664
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,220
It's okay.

665
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,060
He needs time to adjust.

666
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,140
When dinner is ready, bring it up for him.

667
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,140
No need, if he's hungry,
he'll come down to eat.

668
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,640
But...

669
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:38,810
He is

670
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,270
stubborn but soft-hearted.

671
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,680
He can tell right from wrong.

672
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
He doesn't have a problem with you. He just...

673
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,060
He just needs time.

674
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,640
Right.

675
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,970
Don't worry.

676
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,520
It's a small thing if he doesn't cry.

677
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,140
Wang is back.

678
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,220
Where's Tian?

679
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,270
Right.

680
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,560
I told Tian to move in today.

681
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,140
But...

682
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,350
Let's eat.

683
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,560
- Hello.
- Hello, Crab.

684
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,020
Did you ask about that question I told you to?

685
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,850
Yes, I did.

686
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,770
I asked the top students in the Senior Two.

687
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,270
They can't solve it.

688
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,430
So, they asked the senior students.

689
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,390
Your school is sick

690
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,560
to come up with such questions.

691
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,930
They're for international competitions.

692
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,850
But seriously,

693
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,430
you are really outstanding.

694
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,890
That's the only question
in the whole paper you can't do.

695
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,180
Didn't you just transfer here?

696
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,270
How do you know the answers to?

697
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,350
It's simple.

698
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,520
Just analyze the questions on the exam paper,

699
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,770
identify the areas they test,

700
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:59,160
and read that part in the textbook carefully.

701
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,100
After that, practice the same type of questions

702
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,720
in the exercise book.

703
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,100
Finally, go back to the exam paper,

704
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,970
and check for miss-outs. That's how.

705
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,310
Wow, you are so amazing.

706
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,180
Stop talking nonsense.

707
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,850
How did the answers turn out?

708
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,390
The senior students

709
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:15,310
are planning to stay up all night.

710
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,520
What do you think?

711
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,180
What kind of perverted question?

712
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,770
They are cursing me while solving it,

713
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,350
saying I caused their insomnia.

714
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,850
They said it's my fault
if they can't sleep tonight.

715
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,220
Do all you good students have a problem?

716
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,470
When you see difficult questions,

717
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,140
you can't sleep until you solve them.

718
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,350
I don't know about others,

719
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,560
but I won't be able to sleep

720
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,850
if I lose to that Jiang boy.

721
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,930
You are really strange.

722
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,470
Why do you have to beat him?

723
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,060
Just because his surname is Jiang?

724
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,720
Do you have a problem with him?

725
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,600
I have to go. I'm hungry.

726
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,560
I'll get something to eat.

727
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,270
Heat it up in the microwave
before eating. By Mrs. Jiang.

728
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,810
You are really strange.

729
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,390
Why do you have to beat him?

730
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,930
Just because his surname is Jiang?

731
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,720
Do you have a problem with him?

732
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:33,100
(Heat it up in the microwave
before eating. By Mrs. Jiang)

733
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,390
I don't want to beat him.

734
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,680
I just...

735
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,560
don't want to lose.

736
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,100
I don't want to give up my place.

737
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,310
(Wanna leave?)

738
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,220
Jiang Tian.

739
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,020
(Why should I hide?)

740
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:32,430
(The probability of two people meeting
is 0.00417.)

741
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,220
(If you like him,)

742
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,220
(and he also likes you,)

743
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,100
(you're "the on1y one" for each other.)

744
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,680
(That probability is only 0.0000173.)

745
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:51,180
(In everyone's life,
there will be the very moment,)

746
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,720
(a special one)

747
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,720
(on which your mind lingers.)

748
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:03,520
(That's the most important memory
of your life.)

749
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,220
(Every time you think of it,)

750
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,770
(you will have a special feeling
in your heart.)

751
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:27,850
Tian,

752
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,180
are you getting used to the place?

753
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,810
I haven't moved in yet.

754
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,060
You know me.

755
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,270
I'm so difficult to get along with.

756
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,140
So, let's live our own lives,

757
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,390
and not interfere with each other.

758
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,600
Is it Tian?

759
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,680
Tian.

760
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,470
- Tian.
- Tian.

761
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,560
- Why are you so late?
- Come on.

762
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,830
- It's okay. Come on.
- You're so late.

763
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:04,850
- It's good that you're here.
- Yes.

764
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:05,820
- Why didn't you come in?
- Come in.

765
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,560
- Let me take this.
- Go.

766
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,890
Come on, come in.

767
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:09,720
Go.

768
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,720
Come in.

769
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,410
Come on.

770
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,430
Go, watch your head.

771
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,560
Go.

772
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,640
Have you eaten?

773
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,430
Are you hungry?

774
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:30,680
Why are you standing outside? Come in.

775
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,180
(Come on,)

776
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,390
(what is going on right now?)

777
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:48,270
Come on, Tian.

778
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,390
Come on, get up here.

779
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,020
Alright, let me introduce you.

780
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,600
I tell you,

781
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,680
Mr. Sheng has really
put a lot of effort into this.

782
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,560
He has taken care of everything.

783
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,310
Come on, Tian, take a look.

784
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,810
Come on, Tian, look.

785
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,520
This is the bathroom.

786
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,220
You can use this one here.

787
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,810
You don't have to go downstairs.

788
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,060
And that's Wang's room.

789
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:22,690
Come on.

790
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,810
Come on, take a look at your room.

791
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,680
- Come on.
- Yes.

792
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,560
(Do not disturb.)
Come on, take a look at your room.

793
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:32,470
- Come in.
- Get in.

794
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:35,470
Look, your mom has already set it up for you.

795
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,390
This room has excellent lighting.

796
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,200
You don't even need to
turn on the lights during the day.

797
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,770
And there's a big balcony outside.

798
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,020
If you feel stuffy while reading,

799
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,310
you can go outside to get some fresh air.

800
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,640
Yes, you can go outside
to get fresh air and take a break.

801
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,470
You can put your books here.

802
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,060
I'll put your luggage here first.

803
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:52,310
Alright.

804
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:57,860
Tian,

805
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,140
spend the night here.

806
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,310
If you have any questions,

807
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,640
we'll talk tomorrow.

808
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,220
Have a good rest.

809
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,680
Is he okay?

810
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,810
Maybe.

811
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,270
Wang, are you asleep?

812
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,720
It's already 11 o'clock, he should be asleep.

813
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,890
Don't disturb him.

814
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,470
Okay, let's not disturb him.

815
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,850
- Let's go.
- Go.

816
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,560
Wait.

817
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,140
Doesn't this make us roommates?

818
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:15,890
(The cicadas in that summer)

819
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,470
(were more noisy than in any other year.)

820
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,520
(The lush branches
outside the classroom windows)

821
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,060
(couldn't block the sunshine.)

822
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:25,850
(The breeze blew through the treetops,)

823
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:28,060
(and the sun shined brightly.)

824
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:31,810
(They were so young.)

825
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:47,430
