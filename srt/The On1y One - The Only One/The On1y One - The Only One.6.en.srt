What are you doing?

26
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,370
Making a schedule.

27
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,870
A schedule?

28
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,580
You never made schedules.

29
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,500
No.

30
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,330
I just realized

31
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,830
that some things

32
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,120

our Mandarin teacher told us?

It was about a boy who made a schedule

00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,950
every summer vacation,

38
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,870

39
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,540
from childhood to adulthood.

40
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,370
But why did he end up crying?

41
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,120
Yeah, why?

42
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,040
Why did he cry?

to come down for breakfast.

83
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,290
I'll go get it. You go down first.

85
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,700
I hope you can spend more time with them

00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,080

what happened to Tian before.

90

You don't want it to happen again, right?

92
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,460

93
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,160
Hey, Wang.

94
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,450

109
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,040

110
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,080
I'm full too.

111
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,830

112
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,330

113
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,250

114
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,450

00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,660
Really?

116
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,830

117
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,160

145
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,130
Which room should it go to?

146
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,700

147
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,580
Please sign here.

148
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,580
Okay. Thanks.

149
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,910
Why did you buy me a new fridge?

150
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,330
Your old one couldn't keep things cold.

151
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,290
You can put your things that were
about to go bad into this one.

152
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,080
But, you bought a new fridge...

153
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,000
Alright, consider it my food bill

154
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,580
and payment to you, the chef.

155
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,870
But you have to let me

156
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,250
have lunch here every day.

157
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,160
No, no.

158
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,160
You should've told me
before replacing my fridge.

159
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,790
Why did you do this

160
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,080
on your own?

161
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,290
If you disagree,

162
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,250
I won't come here for lunch anymore.

163
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,410
Fine, don't come since you've got pride.

164
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,700
Come on.

165
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,950
Grandpa Ding, please.

166
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,620
Can you bear to see me

167
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,830
fighting for food in the cafeteria?

168
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,160
And I can't compete with others.

169
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,580
Besides, moving the new fridge out

170
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,620
will cost money.

171
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,200
Also, I already had the old fridge

172
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,790
hauled off, so it's gone for good.

173
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,130
But really,

174
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,080
couldn't you have talked to me first?

175
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,790
I can't stand you.

176
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,870
So, am I thoughtful or what?

177
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,370
Come on. I knew you needed it,

178
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,790
so I bought... Wait, no.

179
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,540
I placed a fridge here.

180
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,950
Is he your friend?

181
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,450
Aren't you going to do anything?

182
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,500
Even my dad can't do anything about me.

183
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,040
Good for you.

184
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,830
Alright.

185
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,000
I told my dad about this

186
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,950
and he approved it.

187
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,500
Or, where would I get the money?

188
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,410
Alright, I need to use the bathroom now.

189
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,700
I think your friend is better than you.

190
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,330
I treat him well,
but he treats me better.

191
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,040
He is polite, you know.

192
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,910
But who do you need to be polite to?

193
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,620
Only to strangers, right?

194
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,080
If he sees me as one of his own,

195
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,790
he wouldn't be so polite.

196
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,250
So, be direct. He fears

197
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,330
owing others and becoming distant.

198
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,250
It's best not to get
too involved with others.

199
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,660
No connections, no ties.

200
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,250
But,

201
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,540
I think it's pretty wise.

202
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,910
People should keep
their distance, right?

203
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,080
Otherwise, if something bad happens,

204
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,330
it wouldn't be good
to get dragged into it.

205
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,870
You know, a hedge between
keeps friendship green.

206
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,580
I even persuaded you

207
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,700
to get closer to him.

208
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,870
But I didn't expect you
to be the same type.

209
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,410
- Come on. Eat.
- Yes, sir.

210
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,790
Did you wash your hands?

211
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,120
Just finished.

212
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,450
- Alright, eat up.
- Oh, what's this?

213
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,160
You still have classes after lunch, right?

214
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,410
I'll leave you to it.

215
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,910
Wow, that's spicy.

216
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,330
Why are you giving me this?

217
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,580
Weren't you just burning up?

218
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,290
Thanks.

219
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,750
I should buy you one too.

220
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,910
Which one should I get?

221
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
Do you like this one?

222
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,790
It's a sparkling, alkaline drink

223
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,120
with some juice in it.

224
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,040
So, be direct. He fears

225
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,120
owing others and becoming distant.

226
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,580
It's best not to get
too involved with others.

227
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,870
No connections, no ties.

228
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't want it.

229
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,000
Mr. Zhao, money for the water.

230
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,330
Mr. Zhao, I bought one too.

231
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,580
Take it.

232
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,950
Hey, take it!

233
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,790
You just hate owing people,

234
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,700
don't you?

235
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,950
Because I need to pay it back.

236
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,740
Have anyone asked you to pay it back?

237
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,160
No.

238
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,040
But,

239
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,660
if I owe something,
it stays on my mind.

240
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,290
It piles up and weighs on me.

241
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,500
Then I'll be unhappy.

242
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,290
So you put it down,

243
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,040
right?

244
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,950
What do you mean?

245
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,160
Just take it.

246
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,410
I don't want it.

247
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,290
Hey, you always do this.

248
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,790
Don't walk so fast.
You're being childish.

249
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,580
Don't you want to keep your distance from me?

250
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,120
Then don't follow me.

251
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,660
Great to see everyone

252
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,910
so energetic for
the first afternoon class.

253
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,500
Then no one should be dozing off.

254
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,160
Wake up.

255
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,450
Next time I catch someone nodding off,

256
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,950
I'll make them run three laps
on the playground.

257
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,040
Gao Tianyang.

258
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,330
Gao Tianyang.

259
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,500
Gao Tianyang!

260
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,830
So, do you want to run three laps?

261
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,410
What three laps?

262
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,160
Alright, everyone,
take out your textbooks.

263
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,750
Oh, right, one more thing.

264
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,330
Next week, we'll have
a parent-teacher meeting.

265
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,870
Let your parents know.

266
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,080
All the teachers and I

267
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,910
will discuss each of your situations

268
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,450
with your parents.

269
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,830
If you have any special circumstances,

270
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,040
tell me after this class.

271
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,540
Now, let's go over
last time's exercises.

272
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,640
(Class 2A)

273
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,200
Alright, make sure to memorize

274
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,540
today's key points and formulas.

275
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,500
Class dismissed.

276
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,660
Thank you, sir.

277
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,160
Hello, Old Sheng,

278
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,200
when will you come back?

279
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,000
Next Thursday or Friday.

280
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,340
No,

281
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,080
probably the week after the next.

282
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,910
Then just say you don't know.

283
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,200
I don't know.

284
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,160
Fine, I'm going to class. Talk to you later.

285

286
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,950
Sir.

287
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,410
I want to ask you a question.

288
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,450
I have a question too.

289
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,830
Oh. Hello?

290
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,750

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,500
Can you be my dad again?

292
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,040
We'll have another parent-teacher meeting.

293
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,000
You called the wrong person.

I've been looking for you!

304
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,870
Bathroom?

305
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,250
I'm not going.

306
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,750
I'll go to the office.

307
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,700
Why?

308
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500

A special circumstance?

312
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,620
You know, a special circumstance.

313
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,080
What? Did I get it on me?

314
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,040
- I got it on me, right?
- Got what on you?

315
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,910
Keep it down.

316
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,160
What is it? Keep it down.

317
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
You! Go to the bathroom! Go, go, go!

318
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,660
- Gao Tianyang...
- I'll cover for you. Go!

319
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,830
Alright, what are you doing?

320
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,670
Just go to the bathroom.

321
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,080
Wait. Lower your voice.

322
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Gao Tianyang...

323
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,660
After you're done, wait for me
by the bathroom door.

324
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,080
I'll go to the classroom
and grab a jacket.

325
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,500
A jacket? For what?

326
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,950
Come on. That's ketchup.

(Parent-Teacher Meeting

329
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,660
- Sir.
- Yes. What's wrong?

330
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,200
My dad can't make it to the meeting.

331
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,370
The school scheduled it on the weekend

332
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,250
to avoid weekdays.

333
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,120
This meeting is quite important.

334
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,790
Could you ask your father
to spare some time,

335
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,160
just for 30 minutes?

336
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,080
He can't make it.

337
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,700
How about 20 minutes?

338
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,950
Just enough for a quick chat.

339
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,950
He can leave right after.

340
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,370
Not even 20 minutes?

341
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,290
How about this?

342
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,330
Ask him when he'll be free

343
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,620
to come over.

344
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,700
I'll wait for him.

345
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,910
He's been traveling a lot lately.

346
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,500
Sir, I'll catch him
and bring him to you

347
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,700
as soon as he's available.

348
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,000
Is that okay?

349
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,450
How about your mom?

350
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,040
My mom passed away.

351
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,790
She passed away when I was little.

352
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,950
Then, who attended

353
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,950
your meetings before?

354
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,660
- I...
- Excuse me.

355
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,200
Come in.

356
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,810
What's the matter?

357
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,870
Sir, my mom can't make it

358
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,290
to the meeting.

359
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,790
- Your mom too?
- Didn't your mom...

360
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,830
She's busy.

361
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,330
My parents are divorced.

362
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,580
I live with my mom now.

363
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,480
You two planned this, didn't you?

364
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,950
Never mind.

365
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,040
The parents of the top student

366
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,410
and the most improved one can't come.

367
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,000
What can I say?

368
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,330
How about this?

369
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,370
Why don't you two pair up?

370
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,410
Ask your parents when they'll be free.

371
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,540
I can work around

372
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,540
their schedules.

373
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,140
Then the three of us
will have a small meeting.

374
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,000
Okay. That's a deal.

375
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,540
Don't forget to ask your parents.

376
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,790
Since you're both here,

377
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,410
go see Director Xu. Go.

378
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,450
Go on.

379
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,330
Didn't your mom agree
not to travel with my dad?

380
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,910
Hey, what's your problem?

381
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,330
Want to fight again?

382
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,790
Zhai Tao,

383
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,580
why don't you count how many times

384
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,870
you've been called to
my office this month?

385
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,370
Who's that in the middle?

386
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,080
He's Ding Xiu,

387
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,660
the one who tricked you
into fetching the test papers.

388
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,910
Are you the victim or not?

389
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,330
Sorry, sir. I'm face-blind.

390
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,000
I'll make it brief.

391
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,700
Two punks caused trouble at our shop.

392
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,940
Linzi and I caught them.

393
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,370
One confessed

394
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,330
his sworn brother
had been embarrassed at school

395
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,750
so he wanted revenge.

396
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,000
Then, he sneaked onto campus

397
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,080
and looked for someone to do it for him.

398
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,290
This one is the brother
who had been embarrassed.

399
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,500
And Sheng Wang is
the target of the revenge.

400
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,160
Come on.

401
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,290
I just wanted to scare him, not beat him up.

402
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,000
But he told me

403
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,290
this test was crucial for Sheng Wang.

404
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,080
If he failed, it would be
a huge blow to him.

405
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,040
It was all his idea.

406
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,830
Ask my sworn brother
if you don't believe me.

407
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,540
It was really you, Qi?

408
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,700
It wasn't me.

409
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,450
I barely spoke to them.

410
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,830
They two did wrong

411
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,700
and blamed me!

412
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,120
What are you talking about?

413
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,870
You pretend not to know me
after joining Class A?

414
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,000
Are you kidding me?

415
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,790
Why would I accuse you for no reason?

416
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,870
How should I know why you did it?

417
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,160
What's it got to do with me
joining Class A?

418
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,500
You're not a good person,
so I don't want to hang out with you.

419
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,330
You better explain yourself!

420
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,500
You told me

421
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,700
this exam was crucial for him

422
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,290
and you wanted me
to stop him from taking it.

423
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,200
I never said that.

424
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,000
Don't make things up. Show some proof!

425
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,840
You didn't...

426
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,950
Enough!

427
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,120
I didn't call you here
to make a dramatic scene.

428
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,250
Qi Jiahao.

429
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,450
I know you're competitive
and care about grades.

430
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,250
But now,

431
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,250
I'm very disappointed in you.

432
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,330
Jing...

433
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,450
I...

434
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,500
You all know exactly

435
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,870
what happened.

436
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,250
Regardless of your intentions,

437
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,870
you made Sheng Wang
miss the listening test.

438
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:44,040
You may think one test
isn't a big deal for him.

439
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,580
There's always another chance
if he fails this time.

440
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,660
But what if you hadn't
been caught this time?

441
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,410
What if this student

442
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,080
loses the model student title

443
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,040
and it changes his life?

444
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,700
Have you considered that?

445
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,870
The university entrance exam
isn't the end of the road,

446
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,200
but it can impact someone's future.

447
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,120
You worked hard to be a model student,

448
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,410
but you've trampled
on someone else's efforts.

449
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Do you think you deserve the title?

450
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,250
I'll have your class advisor reassess.

451
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,620
Your title is revoked.

452
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,790
And

453
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,290
the three of you

454
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,500
will each receive a major demerit.

455
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,870
As for the model student title,

456
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,700
since you showed the most improvement

457
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,160
over two tests,

458
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,370
I'll keep it for you.

459
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,580
I don't want it.

460
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,750
What?

461
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,660
I said I don't want it.

462
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,620
I didn't advance 50 places,

463
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,200
so I don't want the title.

464
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,330
Fine.

465
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,120
Whatever makes you happy.

466
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,500
Jiang Tian.

467
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,790
Now you're the only one

468
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,540
of the four model students
left in your class.

469
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,500
No.

470
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,620
Now, we have none.

471
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,700
What do you mean?

472
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,830
Make it clear.

473
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,080
We both fought,

474
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,200
so we should be punished equally.

475
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,040
It's unfair if I keep the title

476
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,880
and he doesn't.

477
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,750
Well...

478
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,410
Did I take it from him?

479
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,370
Director Xu.

480
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,000
Honestly,

481
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,910
it really is because of
the conditions you set.

482
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,870
Alright. Alright.

483
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,370
Neither of you want it.

484
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,580
Let's see how you feel about this later.

485
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:31,350
(Student Affairs)

486
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,160
Why did you give up
the model student title?

487
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,950
Like I said,

488
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,290
if you don't have it,
I don't want it either.

489
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,830
Don't think this will make me
feel touched or want to talk to you.

490
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:46,910
What?

491
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,330
You just admitted it.

492
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,830
Admitted what?

493
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,120
You've been ignoring me lately.

494
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,410
What do you mean?

495
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,660
I haven't...

496
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,910
Xi texted me that we eat
before tutoring.

497
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,250
Mr. Lin will be there too.

498
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,660
Not going?

499
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,410
I'll text him back and say

500
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,500
you're still ignoring me.

501
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,620
No. That's not what I meant.

502
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,290
I see. That's what was going on.

503
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,330
Cheers to both of you

504
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:27,120
for giving up your model student titles.

505
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,000
Cool!

506
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:31,200
Teaching kids the wrong things.
Shame on us teachers.

507
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,160
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

508
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,040
It's boiling. Dig in.

509
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,950
Okay.

510
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,750
I have a question.

511
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,370
How did you two meet?

512
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,580
Through a fight.

513
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,290
When we were in college,

514
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,330
he was being bullied and I saved him.

515
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,200
After that, we became
unexpectedly close.

516
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,910
We met again abroad

517
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,700
and returned not long ago.

518
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,540
Then we found this place for rent,

519
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,950
we decided to lease it

520
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,660
and open a café

521
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,580
to reminisce about our youth.

522
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,330
What does the café's name mean?

523
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,850
(Alors Cafe)

524
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,120
Look it up yourself.

525
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,040
Aren't you two top students?

526
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,750
Oh? I can't find it.

527
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,790
Isn't it English?

528
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,660
But seriously,

529
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,540
you really surprised me

530
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,450
with your impulsiveness.

531
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,660
Do you

532
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,830
think it was foolish?

533
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,830
No.

534
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,950
Everyone was young once.

535
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,410
Do you ever notice

536
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,750
how people often tell you,

537
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,910
"You'll regret this later"?

538
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,870
So, do you regret it?

539
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,910
Do we look like we do?

540
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,620
I just know there's a time
for everything.

541
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,580
If you don't go a little wild
when you're young,

542
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,200
you'll regret it when you're older.

543
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,200
Why?

544
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,620
Do you want to live your life

545
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,620
always following a set plan?

546
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,700
I think that can wait.

547
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,080
While you're young, burn bright

548
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,580
and live with no regrets.

549
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,160
Hey.

550
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,790
Do you remember the story
our Mandarin teacher told us?

551
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,950
It was about a boy who made a schedule

552
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,290
every summer vacation,

553
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,870
year after year,

554
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,830
from childhood to adulthood.

555
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,000
But why did he end up crying?

556
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,750
Yeah, why?

557
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,910
Because he wrote his whole life

558
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,790
into his schedules,

559
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,750
into those plans.

560
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,080
But real life

561
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,830
isn't just words on paper.

562
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,290
What are you mumbling about?

563
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,370
I just made a decision.

564
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,750
I'm going to tear up

565
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,830
all my schedules.

566
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:32,040
Because life isn't...

567
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,200
What is it?

568
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,950
Oh, burn bright.

569
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,790
Live with no regrets!

570
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,620
Great!

571
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,750
- Here, meat.
- Thanks.

572
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,810
(Alors Cafe) (Western &amp; Chinese Cuisine/
Light Meals/ Afternoon Tea)

573
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,790
Didn't expect that hotpot to be so good.

574
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,160
Today's tutoring...

575
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,040
Hurry,

576
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,540
we'll be late for evening study.

577
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,340
Hey.

578
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,000
You two asked me for the dorm forms.

579
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,200
Are you going to give them to me or not?

580
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,410
Oh, I'm not...

581
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,290
Yes.

582
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,170
Here you are.

583
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,370
But I won't live in the dorms.

584
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,660
Then you should've told me earlier.

585
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,660
(Parent's Signature)
The dorm supervisor keeps asking me.

586
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,700
From now on,

587
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,950
you'll have lunch with me

588
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,370
and I'll live with you.

589
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,120
You better not regret it.

590
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,410
I know I never will.

591
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,130
Okay.

592
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,000
Everyone.

593
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,660
Time for class. Come on in.

594
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,330
Those outside, come in quickly.

595
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,750

Did you get the stuff
Ms. Jiang asked for?

612
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,700
You know what?

613
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,870
When I was little,
I used to wake my parents early.

614
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:10,950
And

615
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,750
I'd bring them to this street
to check on people.

616
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,620
Why this street?

617
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,080
Because it's lively.

618
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,120
You know,

619
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,250
there used to be lots of vendors here.

620
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,790
So many people, coming and going.

621
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,370
So, back then,

622
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,160
I thought people

623
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,450
were only interesting
when they were noisy.

624
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,120
Except for you,

625
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,330
the man of few words.

626
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,040
Actually,

627
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,370
if I'd met you earlier,

628
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,950
I'd have liked you.

629
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,830
For a while, I really wanted a sibling.

630
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,250
Older or younger, didn't matter.

631
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,040
Preferably younger,

632
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,910
so I could boss him around.

633
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,540
Why don't you want one now?

634
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,580
I never said I don't.

635
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,250
It's just...

636
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,500
Do you know what that is?

637
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,580
It's Mount Guanyin.

638
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,500
It looks like a reclining Guanyin.

639
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,700
That's her head.

640
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,540
Can you picture it?

641
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,290
People come and go.

642
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,580
Boats sail by.

643
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,790
But it just lies there, unmoving.

644
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,750
Maybe eternity is just

645
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,580
an obsession with holding on.

646
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,700
Hold on, then.

647
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,080
It's nice to keep some things.

648
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,620
Check this out.

649
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,120
You have a fan group.

650
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,580
All of these are from your fangirls.

651
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,790
But more importantly,
guess what the post title is?

652
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,250
"DYHS Confession Wall".

653
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,620
Whoa. Hey, tell me.

654
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,830
How popular are you at school?

655
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:16,080
Why would they all
confess their love for you?

656
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,250
Can't help it.

657
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,950
I'm too handsome.

658
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,330
Be even cockier. It's fine.

659
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,910
I really don't get it.

660
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,950
Why can't they see
my stunning good looks?

661
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,500
We went to the same school

662
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,910
and I'm your buddy.

663
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,750
I'm not that bad, am I?

664
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,950
But they only cared
about someone's back.

665
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,330
They were all asking whose back it was.

666
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,330
They were like,

667
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,790
"Oh my. That back is so handsome."

668
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,910
Seriously?

669
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,080
What can you tell from a back?

670
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,660
Crab.

671
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,120
It's late. You should sleep.

672
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,340
Huh?

673
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:32,560
(Grand Opening)

674
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,410
A gift for your opening.

675
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,380
What is it?

676
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,600
(Handwriting Practice Book)

677
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,580
Are you going to get a hit?

678
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,910
Don't want it?

679
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:54,750
Give it back to me.

680
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,250
I want it.

681
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,250
Thank you for saving me

682
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,750
from Jing and Miss Fortune
mocking my bad handwriting.

683
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,700
Is that okay?

684
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,700
Practise well.

685
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,660
Hey.

686
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:11,330
Did you practise
your handwriting with this?

687
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,040
Sort of.

688
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,950
It's either yes or no.

689
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,120
What's "sort of"?

690
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,000
I copied it twice.

691
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,080
Copied twice?
Is that your idea of practice?

692
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:24,000
You might as well say
you're naturally gifted.

693
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,700
I'm naturally gifted.

694
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,290
You...

695
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,580
I get it. You are going to get a hit.

696
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,080
Actually, it's quick to get on.

697
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,160
Save it.

698
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,290
Let me be honest with you.

699
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,790
You might not believe this,

700
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,450
but I did practise
my handwriting before.

701
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,290
Seriously practised

702
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,290
for two years.

703
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,120
Stop that.

704
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,200
Want a quick fix?

705
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,200
Of course...

706
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,200
No way.

707
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,750
You can even fix this quickly?

708
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,660
I can't help you master it,

709
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,120
but at least it'll look decent.

710
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,580
The characters will
stand up straight, not slouching.

711
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,450
You...

712
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,750
Do I have your word?

713
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,660
I don't need perfection.

714
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,830
I'm not a calligrapher.

715
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,700
Let's go.

716
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,870
To my room?

717
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,160
Yeah.

718
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,250
Hey, you...

719
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:40,560
(Sheng)

720
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,390
(Ban)

721
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,640
(Guo)

722
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,120
Practise these.

723
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,200
Dui.

724
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,080
Feng.

725
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,500
Guo.

726
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,580
Sheng.

727
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,080
Why these characters?

728
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,290
What's special about them?

729
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,790
They basically include

730
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:08,700
fully enclosed, semi-enclosed, top-bottom,

731
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,580
and left-right structures.

732
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,410
Oh.

733
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,540
Get started.

734
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:16,700
Okay.

735
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,500
How is it? Check it out.

736
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,000
I think I did better this time.

737
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,180
(Feng)

738
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Write them again.

739
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,200
Oh.

740
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,000
Extend the right-fallings.

741
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,080
Make the left-fallings distinct.

742
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,910
The dots should be clear.

743
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,450
Don't connect the strokes.

744
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:29,950
This one is good.

745
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,080
But this one is messed up.

746
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,540
Don't blur the strokes together.

747
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,500
This one is not bad.

748
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,750
This one is good.

749
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:40,870
But this one's not.

750
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,500
I told you. The dots should be clear.

751
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:46,250
Write them again.

752
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,040
Write them again.

753
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,120
Again.

754
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,620
Again.

755
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:09,870
Again.

756
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,250
I can't do it anymore.

757
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,660
Hey, go sleep in your room.

758
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,450
Who practises this hard?

759
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,330
I'm exhausted.

760
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:20,830
Your room is just next door.

761
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:26,500
Sheng Wang. Get up.

762
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,950
I'm too sleepy.

763
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:29,830
Sheng Wang.

764
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,410
If there's only one person in the world

765
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,700
who can understand you,

766
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:43,870
he is the most important.

767
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,830
I just know there's a time
for everything.

768
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,120
I should go a little wild
while I'm young.

769
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,790
After all, I'll have decades ahead

770
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,290
to play it safe.

771
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,620
What's the rush?

772
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,280
(Class 2A)
Alright,

773
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,870
(Class 2A)
make sure to memorize today's key points

774
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,200
(Jiang Tian's very moment)
and formulas.

775
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,200
Class dismissed.

776
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,410
Thank you, sir.

777
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,700
Sir.

778
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,290
I want to ask you a question.

779
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,950
I have a question too.

780
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,160
Oh. Hello?

781
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,330
Mr. Chen? This is Wang.

782
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:44,620
Can you be my dad again?

783
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,290
We'll have another
parent-teacher meeting.

784
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,250
You called the wrong person.

785
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,580
Jiang Tian?

786
00:46:58,370 --> 00:46:59,210
