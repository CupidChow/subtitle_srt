1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,250
(I am...)

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,870
(In Jiang Tian's room?)

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,290
(Where's Jiang Tian?)

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,870
(Did he sleep next to me last night?)

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Good morning.

6
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,120
Morning.

7
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,330
So,

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,500
is my bed comfortable?

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,410
Don't be so petty.
It was just one night.

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,790
You're being really nit-picky.

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,000
I'll go back to my room then.

12
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,500
(Am I sneaking away after sleeping?)

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,290
(Sneaking away?)

14
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,330
(What nonsense am I thinking?)

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,840
Hey, Jiang Tian...

16
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,250
(Hm?)

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,620
(Where is he?)

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,250
(Did my morning wood scare him off?)

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,590
(I don't believe)

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,790
(as a healthy teenage boy,)

21
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,540
(he doesn't get morning wood?)

22
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,790
(I must have been dreaming.)

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,450
(Anyway, now that he's not here,)

24
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,830
(I'll make my escape.)

25
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,580
Why did I sleep here last night?

26
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,160
You can black out without even drinking?

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,370
You stuck to my bed

28
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,290
like a sticky note last night.

29
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,290
When people are extremely tired,

30
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,620
it feels a bit like being tipsy.

31
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,910
You call that tipsy?

32
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,950
That was dead drunk.

33
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,450
Can't you just forget about it?
You're so petty.

34
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,620
Again?

35
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,660
So where did you sleep last night?

36
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,660
What do you think?

37
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,200
There's only one bed here.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,120
Where else could I sleep?

39
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,250
Good point.

40
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,160
Go change and have breakfast.

41
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,380
I...

42
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,410
Wait a sec. I'm not ready yet.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,540
I left my phone in the bathroom.

44
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,850

58
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,080
(Danying Senior High School)

59
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,920
Sheng,

60
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,790
You've been changing
your nickname a lot lately.

61
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,660
What's your motive for caring about me?

62
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,830
It was not me.

63
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,330
Little Pepper...

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,830
- What about her?
- Gao Tianyang, what's up?

65
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,480
Yes, I have ulterior motives,

66
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,870
staring at Sheng's nickname
for no reason.

67
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,870
Is that good enough for you?

68
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,910
- Sheng is handsome and smart.
- Shut up.

69
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,040
Where else can you find such a catch?

70
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,700
That makes a lot of sense.

71
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,080
Sheng, why don't you just be gay

72
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,750
and let me experience a teenage romance?

73
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,410
Get lost.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Morning, everyone.

75
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,500
Sorry for taking up your self-study time,

76
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,040
but we need to take care of something.

77
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,160
We need to re-elect the model student
of our class.

78
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,500
We'll do it by anonymous voting.

79
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,500
Please pass these out.

80
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,830
Write down your choice,

81
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,620
but skip those who won last time.

82
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,410
There's one more thing.

83
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,580
As you know,
the criteria for model students

84
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,700
include being a class officer,

85
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,200
academic performance, and improvement.

86
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,660
Everyone knows

87
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,120
Jiang Tian has been
at the top one for a long time,

88
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,580
and Sheng Wang's
rapid rise is noticeable.

89
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,830
These two spots would
naturally go to them.

90
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,250
However,

91
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,700
both of them

92
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,410
are very confident

93
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,580
and want to give others a chance.

94
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,870
They voluntarily gave up their spots.

95
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,120
So, we'll move on to the next in line.

96
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,660
Li Jia.

97
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,910
Your total scores in the two tests
ranked second in the grade,

98
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,450
and you got a lot of votes last time.

99
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,450
So, one spot goes to Li Jia.

100
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,540
No objections?

101
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,870
Thanks. Thanks, sir.

102
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,080
Little Pepper, you rock.

103
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,500
You sit down.

104
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,880
Sit down.

105
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,120
And Gao Tianyang.

106
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,410
You improved by 64 points
over two tests,

107
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,200
jumping 78 spots.

108
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,700
You're the second
most improved in our class,

109
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,830
so the other spot goes to you.
Is that okay?

110
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,790
Whoa, it's me.

111
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes, it's you.

112
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,450
Sheng, thanks anyway.

113
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll give you a gift.

114
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
What gift?

115
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,370
Hand.

116
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,720
(Congratulations)

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,870
Congrats.

118
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,910
Alright, once you're done,
pass the list back.

119
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,410
(Isn't there a saying)

120
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,790
(that when you can drop the pretense)

121
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,360
(and comfortably share
both troubles and joys,)

122
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,210
Finished?

123
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,580
(you'll become friends?)

124
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,450
Why are you smiling?

125
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,080
I'll announce the voting results now.

126
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,410
The model student
among the class officers is Li Yu.

127
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,200
And your votes elected Xu Tianshu.

128
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,370
Congratulations to both of them.

129
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,290
I'm in too.

130
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,160
Alright, I'll give you back
your self-study time.

131
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,620
Work on your practice sheets.

132
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,040
Hey, do you wanna go to
the Little White House after class?

133
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,200
The teacher wants to see me.

134
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,750
You go by yourself.

135
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,910
I really need to see Jiang Tian.

136
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,700
Go, go, go. Get out.

137
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,200
Don't come here again.

138
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,580
I don't want to see you again.

139
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,290
How many times are you going to ask?

140
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,580
You never stop.

141
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,700
Stubborn old man.

142
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,620
Grandpa Ding.

143
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,160
You're here.

144
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,450
Why do you seem so down today?

145
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,410
Not happy to see me?

146
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,370
Not at all. The food's ready.

147
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,080
Where is Tian?

148
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,160
He has something at school
and can't make it.

149
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,410
Good.

150
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,080
It's better he didn't come.

151
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,500
Oh, right.

152
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,120
Who was

153
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,580
that man who just left?

154
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,910
Did you see him?

155
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,500
Yeah.

156
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,830
He brushed past me.

157
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,000
That was Ji Huanyu.

158
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,200
Ji Huanyu?

159
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,410
He is Tian's father.

160
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,290
Oh, right. My dad mentioned it.

161
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,700
He used to live here too.

162
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,410
Can I take a look?

163
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,420
Here.

164
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,250
These photos

165
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,160
are quite old.

166
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,040
You young folks don't
develop photos anymore, huh?

167
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,830
Who is this?

168
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,700
That's two people.

169
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,200
Oh, right.

170
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,660
No wonder one is colored,
and the other black and white.

171
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,040
They seem to be from different times.

172
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,160
This cat

173
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,870
looks like Jiang Tian's avatar.

174
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,370
I think so.

175
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,410
So this is Jiang Tian?

176
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,880
Mhm.

177
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,580
And who's this man?

178
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,660
Ji Huanyu.

179
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,120
Ji Huanyu is truly a bad man.

180
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,120
Tian had a tough time with him
when he was a child.

181
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,750
Was Tian unhappy

182
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,040
as a child?

183
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,540
Yes. He had a tough childhood,

184
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,370
like a stray cat.

185
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,200
When Tian was little,

186
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,950
Ji Huanyu

187
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,910
and Tian's mom

188
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,160
were often away and busy.

189
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,410
So they left him with his grandma.

190
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,120
His grandma had dementia.

191
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,040
She often locked him out
and did not let him in.

192
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,120
Grandma.

193
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
Grandma.

194
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,290
Grandma.

195
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,540
Tian would sit outside all day.

196
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,870
He had nothing to eat.

197
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,040
He was shy

198
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,750
and didn't want to admit he was locked out

199
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,700
or bother anyone.

200
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,750
Back then, I had a cat named Commander.

201
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,160
Sometimes when Tian couldn't go home,

202
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,540
he would play with Commander

203
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,910
- at the door.
- What's your name?

204
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,540
I took the chance

205
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,790
to bring Tian to my house.

206
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,290
- Can we be good friends?
- I let him in

207
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,580
to get something to eat.

208
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,790
I've been looking for my cat.

209
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,620
So it's here with you.

210
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,790
Grandpa, what's this cat's name?

211
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,700
Its name is Commander. Does it sound nice?

212
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,000
Yes.

213
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,620
Why don't you go home?

214
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,870
Isn't your grandma there?

215
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,580
Do you wanna come over to my place?

216
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,410
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go.

217
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,540
Hold it tight. I'll carry your bag.

218
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,750
Are you hungry?

219
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,950
Commander used to be a stray cat.

220
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,910
He probably felt close to Commander

221
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,250
because they were alike.

222
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,450
Where is Commander now?

223
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,540
It died.

224
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,410
Commander lived outside.

225
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,000
Tian

226
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,080
often stayed outside,

227
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,250
waiting for it.

228
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,500
He told me

229
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,410
as long as he waited there,
Commander would come back.

230
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,120
But it never came back.

231
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,370
It must have been hard for Ms. Jiang,

232
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,410
to see Jiang Tian so lonely.

233
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,540
Do you know his mother?

234
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,870
Oh, right, it's just...

235
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,450
Ms. Jiang and my dad are now a couple.

236
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,000
They might get married soon.

237
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,870
Yes, yes.

238
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,330
I heard about that but I forgot.

239
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,580
So you and Tian are technically brothers now?

240
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,790
I guess so.

241
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,540
It's good that Jiang is seeing someone else.

242
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,370
I watched her grow up.

243
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,370
She was hardworking and filial.

244
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,290
She worked multiple jobs

245
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,700
to pay her mom's medical bills
and raise Tian.

246
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,620
She took on many side jobs in Taipei

247
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,290
but had no time for Tian.

248
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,500
She felt very guilty.

249
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,450
Sometimes when she came back to see Tian,

250
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,540
her eyes were swollen like walnuts.

251
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,580
He really had a tough childhood.

252
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,200
What about Tian's dad?

253
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,200
Well,

254
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,330
he is an orphan.

255
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,250
He was often bullied when he was a child.

256
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,910
When he grew up,

257
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,910
he wanted to achieve
something big and be successful.

258
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,660
But he failed at everything.

259
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,500
He didn't want to stay home
and take care of Tian.

260
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,620
One day, he suddenly changed his mind

261
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,540
and came back to stay with Tian

262
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,120
for a whole year.

263
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,160
Wasn't that a good thing?

264
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,200
Good? No.

265
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,370
He's not the type of men
who take care of a child.

266
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
One day,

267
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,910
Tian came to my house.

268
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,040
I noticed a burn on the back of his neck.

269
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,410
A few days later,

270
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,950
he got a fever and vomited at my place.

271
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,700
Later, his mother took him home.

272
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,660
Not long after,

273
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,330
she divorced Ji Huanyu.

274
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,500
Could the scar on his neck be from Ji...

275
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,790
I asked him that too.

276
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,290
But he said no.

277
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,290
I think he just

278
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,200
didn't want to tell me the truth.

279
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,910
That's how he is.

280
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,080
He keeps everything

281
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,410
to himself.

282
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,700
After that,

283
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,080
I don't know what happened,

284
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,830
but Tian started wandering around,

285
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,540
staying wherever he could.

286
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,580
I often saw him with his suitcase,

287
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,870
staying here and there.

288
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,040
He couldn't get close to anyone.

289
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,000
No one could keep him.

290
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,750
Jiang Tian!

291
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,290
You...

292
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,120
Why are you packed?

293
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,040
I'm not packed.

294
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,910
I just left it like this.

295
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,750
No wonder

296
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,870
his suitcase is always so neatly packed,

297
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,950
like he's ready to leave at any moment.

298
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,680
(Student Dormitory Application Form)
(Jiang Tian)

299
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,000
(Jiang Ou)
Turns out, staying is hard

300
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,910
(Parent's Signature)
for him.

301
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,790
From now on,

302
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,620
you'll have lunch with me,

303
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,870
and I'll live with you.

304
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,830
You'd better not regret it.

305
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,950
I know I never will.

306
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,980
(Unfussy Gao Tianyang)
Where are you? It's about time for roll call.

307
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,250
Grandpa Ding, I'm leaving. I'm late.

308
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,700
Okay.

309
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,370
I'm about to start the roll call.

310
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,870
Discipline monitor,

311
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,660
check for phones, please.

312
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,500
Okay.

313
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,910
Everyone, put your phones away.

314
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,370
I'm taking names now.

315
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,540
Gao Tianyang.

316
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,400
Here.

317
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,450
Feng Xinhua.

318
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,540
Here.

319
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,280
Zhou Yueqiao.

320
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,310
(Sticky note: Cover for me.)
Here.

321
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,070
(I'll be right back.)
Here.

322
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,160
Chen Dongxiang.

323
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,480
Here.

324
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,990
(I'll say you went to the health center.)
Gu Youjia.

325
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,670
(Be quick.)
Gu Youjia.

326
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,210
Here.

327
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,580
Qi Jiahao.

328
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,250
He's not here.

329
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,040
Does anyone know where he is?

330
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,030
Qi Jiahao has been missing a lot lately.

331
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,160
- Why?
- I think I saw him with Zhai Tao

332
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,290
heading towards Road No. 3.

333
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,200
Okay. I'll write him down.

334
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,040
Song Sirui.

335
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,880
Here.

336
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,290
Xu Tianshu.

337
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,660
Really? What are they doing there?

338
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,790
How could I know? Put your phone away.

339
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,290
And I'll write you down.

340
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,580
Jiang Tian.

341
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,120
- Jiang Tian?
- He was just here.

342
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,290
Does anyone know where he is?

343
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:05,660
I think I saw him with Zhai Tao
heading towards Road No. 3.

344
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,640
(Students' Building)

345
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,620
Mr. Zhao.

346
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,790
(Happiness)
Did you see Sheng Wang?

347
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,950
Wang? No.

348
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,830
But I did see those students
who gave him trouble before.

349
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,290
Hey,

350
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,250
you should be careful too.

351
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,040
They might come after you

352
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,410
since you reported them last time.

353
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,540
What's wrong?

354
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,000
Are you sure you didn't see Wang?

355
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,580
Where is he?

356
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,420
I should go.

357
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,000
Hey, wait.

358
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,620
What's going on?

359
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,160
What are you doing here?

360
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,290
Sheng Wang.

361
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,700
Linzi, Xi, it's you guys.

362
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,870
Have you seen Jiang Tian?

363
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,410
Jiang Tian?

364
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,370
He's probably napping in the classroom.

365
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,960
What's wrong?

366
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,200
Do you know about Jiang Tian's father?

367
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,620
Oh, I know. He's Ji Huanyu.

368
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,750
I saw him today at Old Man Ding's place.

369
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,620
We can't let him find Jiang Tian.

370
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,700
I'm worried he'll take Jiang Tian away.

371
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,540
Ta-Take him away?

372
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,500
To where?

373
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,660
We saw him near
the Little White House yesterday.

374
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,620
We think he's here looking for Jiang Tian.

375
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,410
But no one knows exactly what he wants.

376
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,620
Anyway, let's be on guard

377
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,950
and protect Jiang Tian.

378
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,450
Yeah. Got it.

379
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,870
I'll keep an eye on him.

380
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,500
Okay, you should go back and rest now.

381
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,330
Bye.

382
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,330
- Bye.
- Bye.

383
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,910
(Unfussy Gao Tianyang)
Tian heard that Zhai Tao and Qi Jiahao

384
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,810
were on Road No. 3,

385
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,910
so he went to find you.

386
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,750
Did you see him?

387
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,290
(When I feel abandoned by the world)

388
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,660
(and think nothing I do
will make a difference,)

389
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,830
(I forget)

390
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,040
(that someone with no place to call home)

391
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,910
(is still trying so hard for me)

392
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,290
(and giving his all)

393
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,450
(to protect me.)

394
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,120
What are you doing here?

395
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,660
Where have you been?

396
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,660
Do you know the roll call is over?

397
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,910
From now on,

398
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,330
I'll always be by your side.

399
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,370
I mean it.

400
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,190
Okay. Let's go...

401
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,630
Let's go somewhere.

402
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,620
Come on.

403
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,620
Hey, where are you going?

404
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,580
We can't get out now.

405
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,170
Hey.

406
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,000
What do you want?

407
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,290
Climb over it.

408
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,830
Why?

409
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,290
Because...

410
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,120
I've never skipped classes before.

411
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,410
You haven't either, right?

412
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,660
I've seen it happen.

413
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,950
That doesn't count.

414
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,410
Does watching a murder make you a killer?

415
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,700
Oh, I find you really talented.

416
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,700
You can connect totally unrelated things.

417
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,160
And it's hard to argue with me,

418
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
isn't it?

419
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,540
- What are you doing?
- Run.

420
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,500
What are you doing?

421
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,660
Stop there!

422
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,040
Which class are you from?

423
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,950
Come back!

424
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,040
Gao Tianyang.

425
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,540
Yes, Jing.

426
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,790
Where are Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian?

427
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,120
Sheng Wang is in the health center.

428
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,370
What about Jiang Tian?

429
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,370
Oh. Jiang Tian.

430
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,250
Well, Jiang Tian...

431
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,790
Don't tell me he's in the health center too.

432
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,750
It's a possibility.

433
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,700
Jing, as I get older,

434
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,160
I've realized

435
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,410
that anything is possible.

436
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,120
Impossible!

437
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,870
I just called the health center.

438
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,370
Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian are not there.

439
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,370
(Sheng!)

440
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,540
(Tian!)

441
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,040
That's a good thing.

442
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,160
It means they're healthy and have no issues.

443
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,330
Clap, clap.

444
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,330
That's good.

445
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,330
Gao Tianyang.

446
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:34,710
You,

447
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,500
go to the back of the classroom

448
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,660
and squat.

449
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,250
Stay there and do the horse stance

450
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,500
until Sheng Wang and Jiang Tian come back.

451
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,580
Understood?

452
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,000
Yes.

453
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,290
Then do it now!

454
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,660
Jing, I can't do it now.

455
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,790
It might be considered indecent exposure.

456
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,540
You wouldn't make me a criminal,
would you, Jing?

457
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,750
So what?

458
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,370
No one can see you at the back.

459
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,580
Do it.

460
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,080
Now.

461
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,210
What a fool.

462
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,700
Alright, everyone.

463
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,370
Stop laughing.

464
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,620
Stop looking at him.

465
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,120
Now, open your English textbooks.

466
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,450
Gao Tianyang,

467
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,500
keep it there.

468
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,910
Turn to page 180.

469
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,330
Are you okay?

470
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,500
As the saying goes,

471
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,950
"Where you fall is
where you should lie down."

472
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,250
Let's rest here for a while.

473
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,330
What do you want?

474
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,750
I ran so hard to escape security.

475
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,160
We can't go back to school now.

476
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,080
We might as well lie down here.

477
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,290
Join me for a bit.

478
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,620
Jiang Tian.

479
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,700
Today, I suddenly feel like

480
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,910
we're about the same age.

481
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,200
Aren't you supposed to be resting?

482
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,370
Why so much chatter?

483
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,790
Where do you want to go later?

484
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,450
I'll have to think about it.

485
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,500

Hey, Jiang Tian.

514
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,580
Look over there.

515
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,080
Earlier, I said I wanted you
to stay home with the boys.

516
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,410
I was too harsh,

517
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,620
so I wanted to ask you out.

518
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,500
What are they doing there?

519
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,910
- I hope you didn't take it personally.
- No idea.

520
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,410
I'm fine. Everything is good.

521
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,000
Yeah. Weren't you worried earlier

522
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,620
about Tian not adjusting well?

523
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,540
Look how happy they are now.

524
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,660
Then we...

525
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,160
Don't you want to know what my mom...

526
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,470
- No, your dad...
- Then we can relax a bit, right?

527
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,450
No. Don't you want to know

528
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,080
what they do on a date?

529
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,290
I don't.

530
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,040
Oh.

531
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,410
- But I do.
- Yeah, yeah.

532
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,700
But you know.

533
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,000
I still feel like he hasn't

534
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,080
shared his true feelings with me.

535
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,250
Hey, Ou.

536
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,370
That takes time.

537
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,200
Some things can't be rushed.

538
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,750
But there is one thing
that needs to be dealt with first.

539
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,790
Like...

540
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,910
What is it?

541
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,660
Like...

542
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,200
Our family matters and future plans.

543
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,120
Like our... Our mar...

544
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,330
Oh, I get it. You are talking about money.

545
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,200
With more people in the family,

546
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,160
we need to save up, right?

547
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,660
My dad is stupid.

548
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,660
I'll set up a romantic atmosphere for him.

549
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,580
Hey.

550
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,950
Don't mess around.

551
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,620
Ou.

552
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,080
Marry me.

553
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,330
He proposed.

554
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,460
Dad...

555
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,120
What are you doing?

556
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:22,270
(Men's Room)

557
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,370
Gao Tianyang.

558
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,370
Are you done yet?

559
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,540
Wait a second.

560
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,910
Hurry up.

561
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,830
Go in there.

562
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,210
Thanks.

563
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,620
I'm just showing some sympathy for you.

564
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,580
No need to thank me.

565
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,120
So, if I manage to get your sympathy,

566
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,370
can I ask for your help?

567
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,410
Sure.

568
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,410
But you'll have to be even dumber than today.

569
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,540
Oh, too bad.

570
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,870
You might not be able to help me anymore.

571
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,950
Do you even know yourself?

572
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,620
Clearly, you have chances

573
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,330
every day at any time.

574
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,910
Every day at any time...

575
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,460
Alright.

576
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,540
I'll tell Sheng you're really kind

577
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,540
and virtuous.

578
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,450
Why... why would you tell him that?

579
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,700
Maybe I'll tell Tian instead.

580
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,040
But Sheng will never know

581
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,950
how virtuous and adorable

582
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,200
our Little Pepper is.

583
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,330
You...

584
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:34,750
What?

585
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,540
Get in there.

586
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,160
If you want to, just go tell him.

587
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,700
Magic bracelets! Come and see!

588
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,750
Feel free to check them out!

589
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,790
Come and see, boys.

590
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,620
- Hey, sir.
- Yes?

591
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,250
Does this bracelet have any special meaning?

592
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,750
Once you wear this bracelet,

593
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,910
it ensures that the bond between family,
friends,

594
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:18,250
or lovers will last forever.

595
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,330
Feel it.

596
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,370
Let me see.

597
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,450
Sure, go ahead.

598
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:26,750
Sir,

599
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,250
I'll take these two.

600
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,080
Good choice.

601
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,410
I hope your bond lasts forever.

602
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,790
What are you looking at?

603
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,660
Watching them clean.

604
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,950
What's so interesting about that?

605
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:48,500
It's youth.

606
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,200
Once you grow up,

607
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,540
you can't go back.

608
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,120
Zhao Xi.

609
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,080
Jenny Yang.

610
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,790
So, how does it feel to be back teaching?

611
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,830
What do you think?

612
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,290
Not bad, right?

613
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,000
Thanks for your help.

614
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,120
Not at all.

615
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:14,370
Is this the friend you mentioned
meeting abroad?

616
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,500
Aren't you going to introduce us?

617
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,500
This is Lin from the History Department.

618
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Hi, I'm Yang Jing.

619
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I teach English.

620
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,290
You can call me Jenny.

621
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,250
Jenny.

622
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,410
Hi, I'm Benny.

623
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,160
How are you holding up at school?
All good?

624
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,450
Not bad.

625
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,290
That's good to hear.

626
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,910
I'll get going now.

627
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,080
If you need anything,

628
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,410
just reach out to me.

629
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,870
- See you.
- Okay, thanks.

630
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,710
Bye.

631
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,080
You seem to know Jenny pretty well.

632
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,910
She's my high school classmate.

633
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,410
After I came back from abroad,
she's the only one I've kept in touch with.

634
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,580
I came back to be a substitute teacher
because of her.

635
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,500
Does that count as knowing her well?

636
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,910
Yeah.

637
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,290
Pickled mangoes.

638
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,410
They're sweet and sour, my childhood favorite.

639
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,950
I rarely ate them after moving to Shanghai.

640
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,790
Good food is best shared with good friends.

641
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,040
Have one.

642
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,540
Come on, have one.

643
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,540
I don't eat snacks.

644
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,830
You're a picky eater,

645
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,250
but you like this?

646
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,250
It's delicious.

647
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:00,790
Oh, right.

648
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,040
Why did you drag me away just now?

649
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,910
I missed my dad's grand proposal.

650
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,410
I was afraid you'd ruin their big moment.

651
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,370
Nonsense.

652
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,200
I was going to help them out

653
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,330
by making some bubbles around

654
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,950
and singing a little song.

655
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,790
My dad was so clumsy when he proposed.

656
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,750
It was driving me crazy.

657
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,330
But...

658
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,700
If my dad's proposal works out,

659
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,080
we'll be brothers.

660
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,620
Would that bother you?

661
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,200
Help me with this.

662
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
I want this one.

663
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,250
I'll help you tie that one later.

664
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,080
You know what?

665
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,580
I've always felt

666
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,790
that Mount Guanyin by the Tamsui River
is very spiritual.

667
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,000
If you make a sincere wish there,

668
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,370
it will come true.

669
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,580
Here.

670
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,160
So,

671
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,120
let's live in the dorm together.

672
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,410
You and I,

673
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,880
together.

674
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:57,750
Why?

675
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,410
Because it will be a place that's truly yours,

676
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,630
won't it?

677
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,250
A true home.

678
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,540
Instead of moving

679
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,000
between Dad's,

680
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,540
Mom's, and Ola Man Ding's,

681
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,950
never knowing when to unpack

682
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,080
or repack,

683
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,700
living in the dorm

684
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,120
is the most reassuring choice.

685
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,250
Though we can't live in the dorm forever,

686
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,080
it'll give you a clear timeline

687
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,000
and a place that feels like yours,

688
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,750
with a real sense of security and belonging.

689
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,200
You'll like it, right?

690
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,950
So, I'll be

691
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,160
with you.

692
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,130
Okay.

693
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
You know,

694
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,540
I secretly read in your Guide
to Lyrical Writing

695
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,370
that holding someone like this

696
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,790
means we're friends.

697
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,870
But I think we're more than friends.

698
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,250
We're family.

699
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,290
Has Big Mouth Xu always been
called that since he was young?

700
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,830
His mouth was big when he was young.

701
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,450
But we used to call him Little Mouth Xu.

702
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,250
Do you guys call him Big Mouth Xu?

703
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,950
Not really.

704
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,370
At least not in public.

705
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,040
But we did call his son Little Mouth Xu.

706
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,330
- Eat more.
- Have some veggies.

707
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,290
- Delicious.
- Don't be picky.

708
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,370
Wang, here.

709
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,000
Give me some, too.

710
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,250
Sure. I won't leave you out.

711
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,290
Thanks.

712
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,790
Eat more.

713
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,000
You should, too.

714
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,410
You need energy for your exams.

715
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:15,670
Dad.

716
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,500
Why did you call me Dad?

717
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,040
Don't you usually call me Old Sheng?

718
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,370
What's wrong?

719
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,830
We have something to tell you.

720
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,000
- Mom.
- Dad.

721
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,990
- We'll live together in the dorm.
- We'll live together in the dorm.

722
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,750
- In the dorm?
- In the dorm?

723
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,910
What a joke.

724
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,660
Why live at school when you have a home?

725
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:45,630
I forbid it.

726
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,750
(The gods take away people's fears.)

727
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,450
(Young men's love is intense and passionate.)

728
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,500
(At that moment, the sunset bathed)

729
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,950
(the winding Tamsui River.)

730
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,040
(Stained-glass windows
were outlined in a golden hue,)

731
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:04,370
(and the feather on the clasp
had a glowing edge.)

732
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,950
(Time, like this blessing,)

733
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,080
(feels gentle and everlasting.)

734
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,080
Go change and have breakfast.

735
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,250
(Jiang Tian's very moment)

736
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,090
I...

737
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,120
Wait a sec. I'm not ready yet.

738
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,370
I left my phone in the bathroom.

739
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:04,040
No wonder he was using a book to cover it

740
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,580
and was bending down.
