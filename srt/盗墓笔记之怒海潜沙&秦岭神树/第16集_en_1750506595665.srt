1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:28,420
Black

2
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,700
I took out the piece and wrote many words.

3
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,740
But I didn't know the word.

4
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,180
After I grew up,

5
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,220
I was promoted to a soldier.

6
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,260
I fought for many years.

7
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,100
I got better and became a filial son-in-law.

8
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,940
By that time,

9
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,180
he heard that

10
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,540
the battle near his home

11
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,820
was a big horse

12
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,140
to send troops to kill a little prince

13
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,420
and protect the little prince's army.

14
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,420
It's not a normal army.

15
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,820
It's called the army of the salt-salt season.

16
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,180
Salt-salt season?

17
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,620
Why is the name so weird?

18
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,940
Salt-salt?

19
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,980
It means that

20
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,220
this army is all mute

21
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,620
from general to soldier.

22
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,180
Only this kind of army

23
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,420
can keep the secret.

24
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,660
This salt-salt season

25
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,580
is the fire of the evil.

26
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,420
They didn't find a tomb.

27
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,100
They deserve to conveyed the precious inside,

28
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,260
but they just record it

29
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,940
and then seal it,

30
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,220
so that people will later

31
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,740
dig back later.

32
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,960
So, you're blaming me just for that?

33
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,460
For what?

34
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,020
Don't the ancestors've blown up the store?

35
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,020
Right,

36
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,140
so you ancestors

37
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,060
must sendなくて.

38
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,540
I've beengrowing the noodles,...

39
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,540
When the late year comes, my ancestors' family will slowly fall down.

40
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:04,540
When he dies, it's a pity that the old man's clothes will be worn out.

41
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:10,540
After that, our family will be replaced by a few new people.

42
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,540
Until the late year, when my grandfather was a little rich,

43
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:23,540
I took the money and became the emperor, so I signed the ancestral grave and found a good place to seal the water.

44
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,540
I forgot about the descendants' generations.

45
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,540
I was preparing to sign the grave and pack the sea bones.

46
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,540
I found that all the things inside were rotten.

47
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,540
Only this cloth was kept well.

48
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,540
What's wrong?

49
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,540
Something's wrong.

50
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,540
It's okay.

51
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,540
The mountains are a little bit more.

52
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,540
It's okay. You can continue.

53
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:25,540
The End

54
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,540
Then I'll continue.

55
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:34,540
My grandfather doesn't throw up the words when he sees them.

56
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,540
So he took this cloth to find someone who can do antique business.

57
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,540
I found that the name of this cloth is not small.

58
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,540
The word is called the duck.

59
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,540
Only ducks can understand the legend.

60
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,540
This is the legendary wooden pole.

61
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,540
Where is it?

62
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,540
This is the tomb ground you found these years.

63
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,540
I didn't find a tomb.

64
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,540
After I found it, I'll seal it again.

65
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,540
I found that you need to seal it again.

66
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,540
These wooden poles are already sealed.

67
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,540
These are not sealed yet.

68
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,540
You mean to take out the remains of these poles

69
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,540
and sell them to the market?

70
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,540
Then you can fight with the market.

71
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,540
You're not smart.

72
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,540
You should be rich.

73
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,540
Boss Li, you have this kind of treasure.

74
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,540
You should give us more.

75
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,540
The ancestors' things are not useless.

76
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,540
Besides, this cloth is not so complete.

77
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,540
It only has 24 ancient places.

78
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,540
We're going to the last one.

79
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,540
But it should be the 20th.

80
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,540
The 20th is the best one among the 24 ancient places.

81
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:15,540
Boss Li, do you have a record of what's inside the tomb?

82
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,540
This one...

83
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,540
It's not a specific record.

84
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,540
But the treasure in this one

85
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,540
is a rare item.

86
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,540
It's a rare item.

87
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,540
It's a rare item.

88
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,540
It's a rare item.

89
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,540
So you must not be careless.

90
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,540
Yes, yes.

91
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,540
Let's follow them.

92
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,540
We'll eat a half of it later.

93
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,540
Don't go there.

94
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,540
What's wrong, Uncle?

95
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,540
It seems that the little hole is not only in the mountain.

96
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,540
Erma Zi, follow me.

97
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,540
It's the mountain team!

98
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,540
Hurry up!

99
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,540
Uncle, let's go.

100
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,540
Hurry up!

101
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,540
Go after them.

102
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,540
What?

103
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,540
They're scaring us.

104
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,540
They'll find us if we follow them.

105
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,540
Let's find a place to rest.

106
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,540
We'll follow them in the morning.

107
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,540
We'll follow them in the morning.

108
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,540
They won't leave.

109
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,540
They'll need a rest.

110
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,540
Where is this?

111
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,540
You two, where are we going?

112
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,540
Hello, Big Sister-in-law.

113
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,540
I want to ask about the village over there.

114
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,540
How many mountains are there?

115
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,540
You mean our village?

116
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,540
Yes.

117
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,540
Why do you two go to the village?

118
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,540
We've been there.

119
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,540
A year ago, one of our great-grandfathers

120
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,540
introduced us to the village.

121
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,540
We thought it was a good idea.

122
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,540
But we didn't know how to go back.

123
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,540
Look at you, you're so stubborn.

124
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,540
Who knows what you did to me?

125
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,540
I've seen a lot of people like you.

126
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,540
You're not here to hunt.

127
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,540
You're here to kill.

128
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,540
You're not good enough to lie to me.

129
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,540
Big Sister-in-law,

130
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,540
my brother is a bit rude.

131
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,540
But he's not a bad guy.

132
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,540
You're not a bad guy.

133
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,540
I've seen a lot of people like you.

134
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,540
I'm not a bad guy.

135
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,540
I'm not a bad guy.

136
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,540
I've seen a lot of people like you.

137
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,540
I've seen a lot of people like you.

138
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,540
You're not a bad guy.

139
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,540
You're not a bad guy.

140
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,540
You're a bad guy.

141
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,540
You're a bad guy.

142
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,540
You haven't seen a lot of people like me.

143
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,540
Okay.

144
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,540
You two are good friends.

145
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,540
You two don't talk.

146
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,540
You two go to the village.

147
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,540
There's a mountain.

148
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,540
There's a waterfall.

149
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,540
The water is flowing.

150
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,540
That's the fastest way to the mountain.

151
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,540
Big Brother, don't fool us.

152
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,540
Why should I?

153
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,540
Look at the weather.

154
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,540
You can't drive us to the village.

155
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,540
It's too hard to drive.

156
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,540
You two are not familiar with the road.

157
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,540
If you can't drive, you'll be in trouble.

158
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,540
If you're in trouble, you don't know where you're going.

159
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,540
Let's go to the front to hunt grass.

160
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,540
Wait a minute.

161
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,540
I'll hunt grass and we'll go together.

162
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,540
There's no danger here.

163
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,540
Well...

164
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,540
It's been three days.

165
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,660
We've been using the

166
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,540
same kind of hunting.

167
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,540
Let's go with them.

168
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,540
You can't lose your way.

169
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,540
Okay.

170
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,540
Big Brother, we're in trouble.

171
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,540
No trouble.

172
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,540
You're in trouble.

173
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,540
Okay.

174
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,540
Let's go, Big Brother.

175
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,540
Big Brother, we're in trouble.

176
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,540
What's the matter with the village these past two years?

177
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,540
It's still the same.

178
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,540
The wood is good.

179
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,540
You built two houses.

180
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,540
Did you build it yourself?

181
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,540
No.

182
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,540
We built it together in the village.

183
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,540
Sometimes, people in the village

184
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,540
want to go into the mountains.

185
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,540
It's too late to go back.

186
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,540
It's just a place to go.

187
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,540
Look.

188
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,540
These bags are all dry.

189
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,540
They're not in the way.

190
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,540
Don't talk, Big Brother.

191
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,540
Go to bed early.

192
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,540
You'll wake up early tomorrow.

193
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,540
I know.

194
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,540
Go to bed.

195
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,540
Let's go to bed early.

196
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,540
I'll go first.

197
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,540
Go to bed early.

198
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,540
The village is in the way.

199
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,540
The village is in the way.

200
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,540
The village is in the way.

201
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,540
The village is in the way.

202
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,540
The village is in the way.

203
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,540
The village is in the way.

204
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,540
The village is in the way.

205
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,540
The village is in the way.

206
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,540
The village is in the way.

207
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,540
The village is in the way.

208
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,540
The village is in the way.

209
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,540
The village is in the way.

210
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,540
The village is in the way.

211
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,540
The village is in the way.

212
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,540
It's just a place to go.

213
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,540
That's right.

214
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,540
It's a voice from here.

215
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,540
I'm tired.

216
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,540
I have a fever.

217
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,540
What's that?

218
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,540
Open your ears. I'll cut it.

219
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,540
No.

220
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,540
It's a person.

221
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,540
Let go of my hand.

222
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,540
I'll cut your hand.

223
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,540
I'll tear out your ears...

224
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,540
...for you to cover your mouth with glue.

225
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,540
Don't you know how much I love you?

226
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,540
uri.

227
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,540
You're Weifeng Xia's son.

228
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,540
Who's that?

229
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,540
My son is in there.

230
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,540
He is sick.

231
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,540
He can cure some people.

232
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,540
Even if he is sick, he can't be in such a place.

233
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,540
You are so cruel to his father.

234
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,540
I am just a son.

235
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,540
I feel bad too.

236
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,540
But there is no way.

237
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,540
He is so cruel.

238
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,540
I am so sorry.

239
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,540
I didn't see him at that time.

240
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,540
He and his cousin entered the forest.

241
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,540
We have lived in this forest for generations.

242
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,540
But there are so many places in Qin Chuan.

243
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,540
There are so many places.

244
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,540
Even the hunters who are hunting are not willing to walk around.

245
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,540
But they are so brave.

246
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,540
They said they were going to hunt.

247
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,540
We found that the children were missing.

248
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,540
We went to find them.

249
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,540
But we couldn't find them.

250
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,540
We spent ten days.

251
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,540
We thought they would never come back.

252
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,540
But the wife almost cried.

253
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:09,540
But we didn't expect them to come back.

254
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,540
We didn't find any prey.

255
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,540
We brought a bunch of common branches.

256
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,540
Common branches?

257
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,540
Yes.

258
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,540
It was probably common branches.

259
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,540
I heard it.

260
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,540
It was all green.

261
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,540
I heard it.

262
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,540
They found a big pit in the mountain.

263
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,540
There was a tree in it.

264
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,540
It was all made of the same kind.

265
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,540
Listen.

266
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,540
Isn't it a madman?

267
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,540
What else can I say?

268
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,540
With these branches,

269
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,540
I can achieve my wish.

270
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,540
I can live forever.

271
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,540
I am so ridiculous.

272
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,540
I know it's ridiculous.

273
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,540
But these two children are like a stone.

274
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,540
They are watching the tree.

275
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,540
Slowly,

276
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,540
we feel that the two children are not in the right mood.

277
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,540
They are acting weird.

278
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,540
What are you looking at?

279
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,540
Just look at it.

280
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,540
You can see a fart.

281
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,540
You can't do it anymore.

282
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,540
I am real.

283
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,540
What?

284
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,540
You are fake.

285
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,540
I am real.

286
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,540
I am real.

287
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,540
I am real.

288
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,540
I am real.

289
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,540
You can't lie to me.

290
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,540
You are dead.

291
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,540
Don't think you can be sincere.

292
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,540
I am here.

293
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,540
Don't try to hurt people.

294
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,540
No, don't hurt people.

295
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,540
He killed his cousin.

296
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,540
Our family spent 20,000 yuan with his uncle.

297
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,540
It's easy to say.

298
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,540
My son will be his uncle and aunt.

299
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,540
He will be his uncle and aunt.

300
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,540
It's a good thing.

301
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,540
But who knows what's more strange?

302
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,540
He said his cousin was dead in the pit.

303
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,540
He said he was a fake.

304
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,540
Listen.

305
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,540
Isn't it nonsense?

306
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,540
We have been watching the grown-up children since we were kids.

307
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,540
We can't tell if they are real or not.

308
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,540
Later, he became more and more normal.

309
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,540
It's not that my mom and I are fake.

310
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,540
When we were playing with the wood,

311
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,540
the wolf was biting to death.

312
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,540
Probably because of those days,

313
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,540
we found two bodies in the woods.

314
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,540
When we found out, the wolf was not alive.

315
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,540
We shouldn't let him see it.

316
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,540
We scared him.

317
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:37,540
But it's good that we can't even pull the cow back.

318
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,540
We were standing on the pillow of the house in the middle of the night.

319
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,540
We were scared to death.

320
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,540
We were scared.

321
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,540
Later, he started to fight with us.

322
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,540
I thought we were dead.

323
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,540
We could only tie him up with a rope.

324
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,540
But when his mom fed him,

325
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,540
he was biting his mom's neck.

326
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,540
He was lying on the bed with a little bit of blood.

327
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,540
I am fine with the death penalty.

328
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,540
I'm not going to do anything now.

329
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,540
Everyone here is different in the village.

330
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,540
Nobody is afraid of killing people.

331
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,540
I shall hang him up here,

332
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,540
My son!

333
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,540
It's all fake!

334
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,540
It's all fake!

335
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,540
It's all fake!

336
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,540
So what happened

337
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,540
after that?

338
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,540
My son had to protect him.

339
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,540
I buried him in the cave.

340
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,540
It's useless to keep the bronze ring.

341
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,540
How about you sell it to us?

342
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,540
No, no.

343
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,540
This is a evil thing.

344
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
It will kill people.

345
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,540
It's okay.

346
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,540
We are here to study the minority.

347
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,540
We are very interested.

348
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,540
We are not afraid.

349
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,540
No!

350
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,540
My son has become a lunatic.

351
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,540
Are you two still going to be lunatics?

352
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,540
It's all fake!

353
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,540
It's all fake!

354
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,540
It's all fake!

355
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,540
It's all fake!

356
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,540
It's all fake!

357
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,540
It's all fake!

358
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,540
It's all fake!

359
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,540
He's talking about real fake!

360
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,540
It's all fake!

361
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,540
It's all fake!

362
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,540
It should be real.

363
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,540
I'm sure the whole village knows

364
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,540
that someone went mad all of a sudden.

365
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,540
If he lies to us,

366
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,540
But we're not wearing them.

367
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,540
Because of the same material?

368
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,540
One of the acupoints can make people mad.

369
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,540
So many acupoints were made before.

370
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,540
How many people were there?

371
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,540
That's right.

372
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,540
I'm just a clever man.

373
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,540
I thought people would rob me of my treasure.

374
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,540
But the original one was so dirty.

375
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,540
Now it's in the bag.

376
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,540
It's so cruel.

377
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,540
What can we do?

378
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,540
We can't go to the hospital.

379
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,540
We'll be in trouble if we run into a murderer.

380
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,540
What if it's not here?

381
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,540
Let's go.

382
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,540
We have a book.

383
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,540
It's hard to read.

384
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,540
Go back and rest.

385
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,540
We'll be there tomorrow.

386
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,540
It's all fake.

387
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,540
It's all fake.

388
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,540
I'm sorry.

389
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,540
Fatty,

390
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,540
I've thought about it.

391
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,540
When we come back, we'll go to the mountains.

392
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,540
Send his son to the mental hospital.

393
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,540
I'll go there.

394
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,540
Can you help the police?

395
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,540
To be honest,

396
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,540
I can't help them.

397
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,540
But now,

398
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,540
I have to help them.

399
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,540
Why?

400
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,540
Don't go.

401
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,540
Fatty!

402
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,540
It's Dashan...

403
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,540
In autumn,

404
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,540
the рег...

405
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,540
Why are you two walking in front of me?

406
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,540
Go away.

407
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,540
Go away.

408
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,540
Go away.

409
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,540
Go away.

410
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,540
You two, you've been working all night.

411
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,540
Go to bed early.

412
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,540
I'll be here tonight.

413
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,540
No need. I'm fine. We're not tired.

414
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,540
Really, really, really.

415
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,540
Sorry, sorry. Look at me.

416
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,540
Look at our handsome man.

417
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,540
He's so handsome.

418
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,540
Then go to bed. I'll go to bed too.

419
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,540
Go to bed.

420
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,540
He should be alive.

421
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,540
Did we see him as a hallucination?

422
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,540
What a strange man.

423
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,540
In the most eerie light,

424
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:52,540
you were a dullỗ

425
00:28:53,540 --> 00:29:05,540
Wegiezuated his legs and left the Ark of Resurrection.

426
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:11,900
Let's all work together to attain top- cabeça.

427
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
You look good to be here.

428
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,280
It was a dream last night.

429
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,280
Uncle Dachan, where is my sister-in-law?

430
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,560
Your sister-in-law is in the village.

431
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
I'll go get her for you.

432
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,920
How far is she from the village?

433
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,240
She passed by the hill.

434
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,400
She's here.

435
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,400
Dasha! Dasha!

436
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,640
Dasha!

437
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,720
Dasha!

438
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,880
What's the matter? Tell me!

439
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,200
Wang Guapo and Zhang Shi are up again.

440
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,520
They're all in a hurry.

441
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,520
No one can stop them.

442
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,760
Wang Guapo, go and have a look.

443
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,880
That's a new thing.

444
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,240
Sorry, brothers.

445
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,680
We're in a hurry.

446
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,840
I have to go back and take care of it.

447
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,160
No, no, no.

448
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,000
We have to...

449
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,920
You have to take the road.

450
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,440
Yes.

451
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,640
I don't know the road in the mountain.

452
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,600
I heard from others.

453
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,240
How about this?

454
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,640
I'll find someone for you.

455
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,760
He knows everything.

456
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,240
Okay?

457
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,520
This...

458
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,240
Guapo is really a mess.

459
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,840
Hello, don't walk.

460
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,080
Hello, boss.

461
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,720
Hello.

462
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,240
We are liuhong,

463
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,680
Don't take us too far.

464
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,240
Don't you come?

465
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,600
Can't you see,

466
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,800
definitions of clientele are the same?

467
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,080
Young Master,

468
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,120
my gosh!

469
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,760
You realize

470
00:30:51,760 --> 00:31:00,960
the

471
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,960
Okay, okay. What about the road?

472
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,960
No matter what you are doing,

473
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
you can't go to the house at this time.

474
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
I'm not asking you to be busy.

475
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
It's not about money.

476
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,960
It's about the evil spirit in the mountain.

477
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,960
The evil spirit is so strong.

478
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,960
Then at night, the fire will be out of control.

479
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,960
It will be like a ghost city.

480
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Yes.

481
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,960
Master, although there are some things that can't be explained in science,

482
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,960
the fire you said is actually fire.

483
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,960
The one that is pointed at is people and animals.

484
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,960
You dare not say that?

485
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,960
If the ghost king hears it,

486
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,960
he will be angry and the whole mountain will be destroyed.

487
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
Isn't that so?

488
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Look, there is a ghost king here.

489
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

490
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,960
There is a ghost king here.

491
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,960
It's scary. It's a ghost general.

492
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
Right?

493
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
Come on, you have to say it.

494
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,960
We should listen to it.

495
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,960
These are all the words from the ancestors.

496
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
You go to the village and listen.

497
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,960
This is the time of the north.

498
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,960
The army was silent.

499
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,960
No one spoke.

500
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,960
At that time,

501
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,960
there was someone nearby who often heard the sound of the horse.

502
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
What you want to go to

503
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,960
is the same place as where they go.

504
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,960
When can we get a fire?

505
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
We should have a cup of hot coffee.

506
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,960
We can wait for the village.

507
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
I don't know when they will leave.

508
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,960
Come on, eat some hotpot.

509
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
With the character of the Wu Xie,

510
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,960
the sky will be bright.

511
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,960
You are really a lady.

512
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,960
You know the target so well.

513
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,960
You are a lady.

514
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,960
I think the Wu Xie is a good man.

515
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
He is really good.

516
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
Miss Ning told him to go to the east.

517
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,960
He didn't dare to go to the east.

518
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
The opportunity is coming.

519
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,960
Hurry up and join the Aomanshimp Jin Entertainment Center 94466.

520
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
Come on, eat some hotpot.

521
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
How do you know he didn't get up?

522
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
He is going to get up and can still follow our arrangement.

523
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,960
He is too curious.

524
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
Even if he knows it is a trap,

525
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,960
he will see what is in the trap.

526
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
Good people have good lives.

527
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
They can escape every time.

528
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
He is a man.

529
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Don't underestimate him.

530
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,960
So, he is still a dangerous person?

531
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
I...

532
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Can you take us a road?

533
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
I am old.

534
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
I can't ride.

535
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,960
No one has been to our village before.

536
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
Well,

537
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,960
if you have to go,

538
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
I will tell you a way.

539
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,960
As I said,

540
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,960
you can't ride for seven or eight days.

541
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
But you will be lucky

542
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,960
if you go in.

543
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
I will ask you one more thing.

544
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,960
Has the son of the Great Shandong

545
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,960
gone crazy?

546
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,960
The Great Shandong told me personally.

547
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,960
He is kind to me.

548
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,960
He wants to know the truth.

549
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,960
If he can cure it,

550
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,960
he will send it to the hospital.

551
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,960
What if he can cure it?

552
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
He can't cure it.

553
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,960
Why did you say he can't cure it?

554
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,960
He said he can't cure it.

555
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
The people in our village

556
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,960
are not the first ones to go crazy.

557
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
From ancient times,

558
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
there were people who went to the mountains to cut the bronze.

559
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,960
There were also some peach-cone pieces

560
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
and jade pieces.

561
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,960
But it's strange.

562
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
I have cut the bronze.

563
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960
If I don't throw it away,

564
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,960
it will go crazy

565
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
when it's cut.

566
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,960
If it's cut,

567
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,960
it will kill itself.

568
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
If it's thrown away, it will be good.

569
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,960
Why does his son still stay?

570
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
I promoted the Great Shandong

571
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
and asked him to throw it away.

572
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,960
But it's a lie.

573
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,960
The tree in their village

574
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
will be gone if it's cut.

575
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,960
But the boy is a coward.

576
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,960
He can't stand it.

577
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,960
He will stay

578
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,960
if he can't take it.

579
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
But

580
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
he is afraid of that thing

581
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
and will affect others.

582
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
Later,

583
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,960
he took the boy

584
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
to the village outside the village.

585
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,960
He took the thing away.

586
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,960
Do you know

587
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
how the village has been?

588
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,960
All around my village

589
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,180
ATH avons

590
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:38,960
can cost $1 million.

591
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,720
These rehabilitation doses are not shameful.

592
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,600
Not around.

593
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,560
What are those people withcat who put that vomit on me?

594
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,040
They are dirty and dirty.

595
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,240
What will be the ref Following?

596
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,960
I think there is a great possibility.

597
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,960
But there are two details.

598
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
I really care about it.

599
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,960
The first detail is that the people of that age have no culture.

600
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,960
Old people don't even remember who the national leader is.

601
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,960
They don't even know about the age.

602
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
But he has a mouth and is from the north.

603
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
So the age is the north.

604
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,960
It must be one of the fixed details in this legend.

605
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,960
The second detail is that

606
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,960
there is a military team who never speaks.

607
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,960
Even if someone hears the sound,

608
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,960
it's just a sound of the weapon bumping and the sound of the horse.

609
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,960
There is no sound of the horse.

610
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,960
So the north is a military team who never speaks.

611
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,960
What can you think of?

612
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,960
It's not the harmony that the boss said.

613
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,960
I think it's the possibility that there are 80% of them.

614
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,960
Don't be like a monkey jumping up and down.

615
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,960
The mountains and rivers are rolling,

616
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,960
the road is slowly moving, the sky is far away.

617
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
What's the next step?

618
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,960
I've been walking so much.

619
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,960
The top and bottom of the river?

620
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Not bad.

621
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
Anyway, there is no problem in the road ahead.

622
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,960
We have to go there.

623
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,960
Fatty, did I put the bag here?

624
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,960
Yes.

625
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
Where is the bag?

626
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,960
The bag is stolen.

627
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
It was here just now.

628
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
Monkey.

629
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,960
Fatty, we have to find the bag.

630
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
There is a clear bell inside.

631
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,960
No, it's useless even if it's clear bell.

632
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Have you been to the Emei Mountain?

633
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Where did the monkey steal the stuff and return it?

634
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
This dead monkey.

635
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
Let's go. It's useless.

636
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,960
Even if the bell is not found,

637
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,960
what about the equipment inside?

638
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
I have the equipment.

639
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,960
We can enter the woods without any problems.

640
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,960
Besides, how much money do you need to enter the woods?

641
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
Okay?

642
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
And how much money?

643
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,960
Let's go.

644
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Hurry up.

645
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
It's dark. How can we get in?

646
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,960
Wait.

647
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,960
What are you doing?

648
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,960
I'm afraid that the stinky monkey is stealing the stuff.

649
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,960
Let him know who is the boss of the forest.

650
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,960
No, thank you.

651
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
Thank you, I can't.

652
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,960
Look, this is the heaven's work, the ghost's work.

653
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,960
You should observe it carefully. I'm tired.

654
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,960
Can you stop being so noisy?

655
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,960
This is the broken-up rock of the earth's movement.

656
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
The ground rock movement.

657
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,960
What are you talking about?

658
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,960
Hurry up, give it to me.

659
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,960
Broken-up rock.

660
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960
Let's go.

661
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,960
What does he have to do with the broken-up rock?

662
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
You're a fool.

663
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,960
It's too hard to leave.

664
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,960
The development of the body is moving.

665
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,960
It can strengthen the body of the people.

666
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
Yes, it can strengthen the body.

667
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,960
Is that hole in the front?

668
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,960
Is it a hole in the mouth?

669
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
Fatty, what is it?

670
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,960
Look.

671
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,960
No, you're just acting like本.

672
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
O對, Tzu superhero.

673
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
I will destroy him.

674
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
convinced?

675
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,960
O efficient.

676
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
This character is such a great person.

677
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,960
That interesting voice.

678
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,960
Oh my god!

679
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,960
You can't believe I watched a movie.
