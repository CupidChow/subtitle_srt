Episode 1

2
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,160
I believe that my uncle really came here.

3
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,520
But I still can't explain why this place suddenly changed.

4
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,000
You're not here to talk, are you?

5
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,640
Fine.

6
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,160
I've been here.

7
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,840
My memory is not complete.

8
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,840
Many things need to be remembered before they start.

9
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Xiao Ge, you've lost your memory.

10
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,000
I want to find my memory.

11
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,640
What are you thinking about now?

12
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,600
If you find the list of the test teams,

13
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,800
I should have my name on it.

14
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,000
I thought it was the same name.

15
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,440
Don't brag.

16
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,240
Those were the tests years ago.

17
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,200
You're three years old, aren't you?

18
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,400
How can you be so good?

19
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,400
You're a vegetarian.

20
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,600
You're a vegetarian.

21
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,000
You're not a vegetarian.

22
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,200
I want to know that.

23
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,000
How much do you remember about this seabed?

24
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,000
Xiao Mei, look.

25
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,840
Look over there.

26
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,400
Isn't it beautiful?

27
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,200
Wen Jin.

28
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,200
Wen Jin.

29
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,000
What are you looking at?

30
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,200
Come and take a look.

31
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,600
I'm going down.

32
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,000
It's up there. Come down.

33
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,000
Hurry up.

34
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,000
I need your help over there.

35
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,000
Xiao Zhang, what are you looking at?

36
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,000
Hi.

37
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,000
We've been on the sea for almost half a month.

38
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,000
And you're tired of the sea view, too.

39
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,000
To be honest, I'm really missing something now.

40
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,000
I feel like I'm on the rock.

41
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,000
Where's Xiaoxian?

42
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,000
Didn't you see the seabed?

43
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,000
The seabed is here.

44
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,000
No.

45
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,000
I've checked it.

46
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,000
There's a lot of equipment and a lot of leather.

47
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't think so.

48
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't think so.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,760
There's still a lot of leather.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,760
Is Xiaoxian going to play with the water?

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,760
Wen Jin, did he tell you about it?

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,760
If he went to the seabed alone,

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,760
that would be too dangerous.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,760
I don't know when he went there.

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,760
How long did he stay under the water?

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,760
What we're going to do now

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,760
is to find him back.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,760
No.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,760
We still have to go down the rock today.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,760
Don't waste your time on him.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,760
Maybe he'll come back when he's done.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,760
Xiao Li,

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,760
your family is on the beach.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,760
The situation in the sea is complicated.

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,760
You don't know that.

66
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,520
What if something happens?

67
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,520
Who will be responsible?

68
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,520
It's okay.

69
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,520
She's really...

70
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,520
Come.

71
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,160
But who's in the ravines?

72
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,520
It'scheering.

73
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,520
Note the leavings.

74
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,020
Of course they're cheering.

75
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,520
The ambassador invited me.

76
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,420
You must all be ready.

77
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,520
A gift?

78
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,060
Contact had the eye on the point.

79
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,900
But the choice is most realistic.

80
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,980
Do you believe the Szabo..?

81
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:40,780
Minza recommended mine como termón killer.

82
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,780
The first time I saw a black-eyed man.

83
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,780
I thought he was a black-eyed man.

84
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,780
I thought he was a black-eyed man.

85
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,780
I thought he was a black-eyed man.

86
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,780
I thought he was a black-eyed man.

87
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,780
I thought he was a black-eyed man.

88
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,780
I thought he was a black-eyed man.

89
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,780
I thought he was a black-eyed man.

90
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,780
I thought he was a black-eyed man.

91
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,780
I thought he was a black-eyed man.

92
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,780
I thought he was a black-eyed man.

93
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,780
I thought he was a black-eyed man.

94
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,780
I thought he was a black-eyed man.

95
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,780
I thought he was a black-eyed man.

96
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,780
I thought he was a black-eyed man.

97
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,780
It is a monkey.

98
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,260
Did you hear any voice?

99
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,060
Right!

100
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,060
I'm listening.

101
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,940
This is an abode one,

102
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,500
and there is a bridge.

103
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,620
Let's go.

104
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,860
Okay.

105
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,140
What a pity!

106
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,540
This is an abode,

107
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,240
not a bridge.

108
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,700
There are noайн torches here,

109
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,560
none km away.

110
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Yes, yours, please.

111
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,040
It'suis allowing Simba to take care of the mistress.

112
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,840
Quick.

113
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,520
There are many tourists around us.

114
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,440
But today, they said

115
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,400
they would come for pleasure.

116
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,040
I'll try.

117
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,240
It smells good.

118
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,400
There's no smell.

119
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:08,620
autobiography

120
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,540
Nowadaysften them no eye ears, ears become不要非!

121
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,920
But these days there is no temporary happiness,

122
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,200
this is faded...

123
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,320
There is no hive of disaster!

124
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,300
We need life,

125
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,960
which makes life formable!

126
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,140
The sea level is monkey!

127
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,960
There is no way...

128
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:34,220
and stage effect.

129
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,220
Sea turtle?

130
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,220
What is this?

131
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,220
This is a sea turtle.

132
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,220
Look.

133
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,220
What are these pictures?

134
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,220
And this.

135
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,220
Look at this.

136
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,220
It smells good.

137
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,220
There is a smell of stinky wood.

138
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,220
It has no smell.

139
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,220
I have never smelled it.

140
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,220
Maybe it's only the wood they came in.

141
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,220
Maybe it's been a long time since it's been gone.

142
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,220
Brother, what happened next?

143
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,220
Let's go.

144
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,220
I think it's too fast.

145
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,220
You are a sea turtle.

146
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,220
Please go and make a sea dragon.

147
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,220
Stop.

148
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,220
Where are you going?

149
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,220
You are not afraid of any accidents, are you?

150
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,220
Listen up.

151
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,220
The situation in the wood is complicated.

152
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,220
If you are not careful, you will get in trouble.

153
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,220
Our mission is to stay in the original place.

154
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,220
The security forces are not allowed to move.

155
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,220
No one can move these things.

156
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,220
You can't move.

157
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,220
Did you hear that?

158
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,220
Yes.

159
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,220
San Xing is very experienced in this area.

160
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,220
Everyone listens to him.

161
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,220
Okay, I got it.

162
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,220
Okay.

163
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,220
Be careful.

164
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,220
San Xing.

165
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,220
Are you tired?

166
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,220
Why don't you sleep here?

167
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,220
I'm fine.

168
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,220
Don't be so smart.

169
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,220
You will be the one to do the next move.

170
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,220
Okay, I will take a break.

171
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,220
What happened?

172
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,220
I don't remember.

173
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,220
Did you eat a box of dried radish?

174
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,220
Yes.

175
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,220
It smells good.

176
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,220
I remember something.

177
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,220
What is it?

178
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,220
Tell me quickly.

179
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,220
Don't sell the coffin.

180
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,220
I saw a doll in the yard.

181
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,220
It looks like a black stone.

182
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,220
The boss put it in a honeycomb box.

183
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,220
It has a light fragrance.

184
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,220
I don't know what it is.

185
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,220
You are so kind.

186
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,220
Tell me quickly.

187
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,220
Fatty Fat is also a famous toy in the capital.

188
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,220
Do you know the fragrance?

189
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,220
It smells very good.

190
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,220
It smells like honey.

191
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,220
What is it?

192
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,220
It is a drumstick.

193
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,220
Drumstick?

194
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,220
It is a dragon-shaped incense.

195
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,220
It is a kind of stone.

196
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,220
It smells like a stick.

197
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,220
It is a good thing.

198
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,220
Of course.

199
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,220
What is a drumstick?

200
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,220
A drumstick.

201
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,220
It is a very good thing.

202
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,220
People who are not good on the side

203
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,220
call it a drumstick.

204
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,220
Those who are injured or lost their chicken

205
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,220
or are in a fight with the drumstick

206
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,220
would call it a drumstick.

207
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,220
What is it?

208
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,220
It's impossible.

209
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,220
Jinpoh?

210
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,220
Gu Xiang?

211
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,220
I remember it.

212
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,220
It's about Xiang.

213
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,220
Third Uncle did mention it.

214
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,220
Gu Xiang is rarely found in the world.

215
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,220
It's mainly because people think it's Jinpoh's bone.

216
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,220
It's not good.

217
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,220
If you encounter it, don't stick it.

218
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,220
If it's a missing one, you can use it.

219
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,220
It's faster than the soul.

220
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,220
It's a dream.

221
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,220
What dream?

222
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,220
It's not bad if you don't dream.

223
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:38,220
I slept in the wood and woke up.

224
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,220
Why?

225
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,220
It's like playing the game of drugs.

226
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,220
When I woke up...

227
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,220
The End

228
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,220
Wen Jin.

229
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,220
Wen Jin.

230
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,220
Wen Jin.

231
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,220
Where is he?

232
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,220
Where is he?

233
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,220
Wen Jin.

234
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,220
Wen Jin.

235
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,220
Where is the dead body?

236
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,220
The End

237
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:29,220
The End

238
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,220
The End

239
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,220
The End

240
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,220
I was saved by the fish boat.

241
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,220
I was sent to the hospital.

242
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,220
I almost lost my life.

243
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,220
Where is the next one?

244
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,220
The End

245
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,220
The End

246
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,220
I heard that I was saved by the fish boat.

247
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,220
The rest of the people were all missing.

248
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,220
The End

249
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,220
The End

250
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,220
Nothing is the End.

251
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,220
You have to listen to me.

252
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,220
Don't be angry.

253
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,220
Don't be like your uncle.

254
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,220
The End

255
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,220
I don't know if uncle said

256
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,220
that this is the end of the wood.

257
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,220
It's not over yet.

258
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,220
There are a lot of fragrance and a sea.

259
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,220
I should watch more magic shows.

260
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,220
The people in the box are afraid of the beauty.

261
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,220
This wise man,

262
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,720
it's like this.

263
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,220
TheThe End

264
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,220
There is a board.

265
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,220
These two circles

266
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,320
are39

267
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,220
There is a map.

268
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,220
I understand.

269
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,220
What do you understand?

270
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,220
The End

271
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,220
The End

272
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,220
You should listen to me.

273
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,220
I understand.

274
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,220
If there is a two-layer cage,

275
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,220
you come out of the second layer,

276
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,220
I will change another layer under the first layer.

277
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,220
When you come back,

278
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,220
the original layer becomes the second layer,

279
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,220
the original layer becomes the third layer.

280
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,220
So, what you went back to is the original layer,

281
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,220
not the second layer.

282
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,220
One, two, one, two, three.

283
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,220
You are talking about human beings.

284
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
Okay.

285
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,220
Let me tell you this.

286
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,220
There is another layer on the second layer,

287
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,220
or below.

288
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,220
These two layers are like a elevator,

289
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,220
they can move up and down.

290
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,220
Although the area is almost the same,

291
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,220
the things inside are different.

292
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
So, we go out and come back,

293
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,220
and find out that the oxygen level is low,

294
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,220
because this layer has moved to the top or the bottom.

295
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,220
I understand.

296
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,220
Isn't this...

297
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,220
Isn't this a trick of cheating children?

298
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,220
I thought it was so obvious and so deep.

299
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,220
Yes.

300
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,220
This trick of cheating children

301
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,220
has also cheated us all inside, right?

302
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,220
I clearly said that we should not think about complicated things.

303
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,220
I just want to think about how easy it is.

304
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,220
Then, shouldn't we just wait for the oxygen level to go up?

305
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,220
And then, when the earlobe changes,

306
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,220
we can bring the oxygen back.

307
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,220
No.

308
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,220
Why not? Am I wrong?

309
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,220
I was thinking about what you said,

310
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,220
he said that there is a big problem.

311
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,220
What problem?

312
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,220
He said that you have already fallen asleep in the earlobe.

313
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,220
He didn't go out of the earlobe, but went to the swimming pool.

314
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,220
No matter how the room is built,

315
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,220
it should be in the same earlobe.

316
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,220
How could there be a change?

317
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,220
That's right.

318
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,220
Then, is it true that when other people are asleep,

319
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,220
they moved it to another earlobe?

320
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,220
He woke up and found that everyone was gone.

321
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,220
Wait.

322
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,220
Third Master came in from the full-time.

323
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,220
He also went out from the full-time.

324
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,220
How many full-time people are there in this room?

325
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,220
We also came in from the full-time.

326
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,220
And the previous one, the one with the crown,

327
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,220
is different from the two ears that were left before Third Master.

328
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,220
The only thing I'm worried about now is

329
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,220
I don't know how the rules of this earlobe are.

330
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,220
If it's good to stay in Weizhou for an hour,

331
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,220
if it's a day,

332
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,220
or even a month,

333
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,220
I don't know how long the air here will last.

334
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,220
Don't talk about air.

335
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,220
There is no water or food.

336
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,220
Don't worry about that much.

337
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,220
Let's wait in the swimming pool.

338
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,220
Wait.

339
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,220
When the earlobe changes,

340
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,220
let's bring back the bottle first.

341
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,220
Good job.

342
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,220
You did a great job.

343
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,220
Based on our analysis,

344
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,220
the earlobe is on the bottom of the double floor.

345
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,220
The earlobe in this wooden wooden wooden house

346
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,220
usually has a symmetrical shape.

347
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,220
So this one doesn't have the same shape.

348
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,220
The coffin is made of gold and wood.

349
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,220
This head...

350
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,220
I'm telling you,

351
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,220
it's about the same size as the one

352
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,220
from the first place.

353
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,220
It's similar in size.

354
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,220
Even if it's the same, the silver isn't worth it.

355
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,220
Wu Xie,

356
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,220
this might be the coffin

357
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,220
you found when he woke up.

358
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,220
The next day,

359
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,220
the kid was idle.

360
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,220
He went in and dug.

361
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,220
It's a big deal.

362
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,220
This coffin is just a matter of time.

363
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,220
The head of the wooden house has to be more symmetrical.

364
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,220
The seal of the coffin is so weird.

365
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,220
The design is more like a masterpiece.

366
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,220
I don't know what the director wants.

367
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,220
Why are you so busy?

368
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,220
I have my soup stock here.

369
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,220
Don't talk.

370
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,220
What?

371
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,220
What are you doing?

372
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,220
Stay still.

373
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,220
You're always like this.

374
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,220
Why are you acting like me?

375
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,220
Order a candle and turn it on.

376
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,220
You can't lose the rules.

377
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,220
Where is the Dongnan Fortress?

378
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,220
Why is there air here?

379
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,220
Order a candle.

380
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,220
You're dead.

381
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,220
How much air can a candle have?

382
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,220
I don't have enough breath.

383
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,220
What's this?

384
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,220
It's a silkworm.

385
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,220
It's a burial item.

386
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,220
What are you afraid of?

387
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,220
Don't be so superstitious.

388
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,220
Who's afraid?

389
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,220
Listen,

390
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,220
you have to go to the temple.

391
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,220
I'm afraid of the dead.

392
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,220
I'm afraid of the dead.

393
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,220
I'm afraid of the dead.

394
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,220
I'm afraid of the dead.

395
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,220
Listen,

396
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,220
you have to thank me.

397
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,220
When you're not breathing,

398
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,220
remember this.

399
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,220
You're so naughty.

400
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,220
This wood is very strange everywhere.

401
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,220
It's not reasonable.

402
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,220
It has nothing to do with it.

403
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,220
It just leaves it.

404
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,220
It's all the same rules.

405
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,220
If we continue like this,

406
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,220
we'll have a problem

407
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,220
and we'll have a problem.

408
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,220
It smells so good.

409
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,220
It's all the same.

410
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,220
It's all the same.

411
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,220
It's all the same.

412
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,220
It's all the same.

413
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,220
I can't even do it.

414
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,220
It's all the same rules.

415
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,220
What's the rule?

416
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,220
It's too cruel to use this kind of dirty method.

417
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,220
Yes, it's too cruel.

418
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,220
It's all the same.

419
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,220
Is it not dirty?

420
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,220
It's a living dead.

421
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,220
It's called oxygen-hunger.

422
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,220
It's all the same.

423
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,220
It's all the same.

424
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,220
It's all the same.

425
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,220
How do you know?

426
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,220
You don't know what it is?

427
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,220
It's a food.

428
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,220
It's a water-based material.

429
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,220
It's usually used in mountain forests.

430
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,220
There are two good water-based materials

431
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,220
in one wood.

432
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,220
If they don't put any of them on the level,

433
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,220
the level will be filled

434
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,220
by the air in the sea.

435
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,220
It causes dirty things.

436
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,220
So one level is for the owner.

437
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,220
The other level is for the level

438
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,220
of the person who has blood relations.

439
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,220
The level is the same as the main wood.

440
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,220
It's called oxygen-hunger.

441
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,220
Have you learned it?

442
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,220
So many people are buried with it?

443
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,220
It's so hard to guess.

444
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,220
To get rid of the dirty water,

445
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,220
people's lives are taken away

446
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,220
like grass.

447
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,220
So I think

448
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,220
we should go to the next door

449
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,220
and get some water.

450
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,220
We need to get the water out.

451
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,220
You know, it's the worst

452
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,220
to get water out of the water.

453
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,220
Fatty,

454
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,220
you're doing this for the reputation, right?

455
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,220
Aren't we doing this for the reputation?

456
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,220
I'm not.

457
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,220
I'm...

458
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,220
Fatty.

459
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,220
What's wrong?

460
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,220
There's only one person in here.

461
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,220
Look carefully at his head.

462
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,220
Six people and six heads?

463
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,220
That's right.

464
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,220
No.

465
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,220
It's one person.

466
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,220
Look.

467
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,220
Except for the top one,

468
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,220
there's no other one.

469
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,220
There's no five-point.

470
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,220
Even the basic head is not long.

471
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,220
The most important thing is

472
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,220
all these hands are on the same joint.

473
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,220
It's just a big piece of meat.

474
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,220
A born man

475
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,220
has so many bearded chicken.

476
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,220
He'll be killed if he gets born.

477
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,220
There's no way he'll grow so big.

478
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,220
He must be thinking.

479
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,220
You're all so stupid in the stock market.

480
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,220
If I say we go to the next door

481
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,220
and get the water out,

482
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,220
we can see the truth.

483
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,220
But if there's anything

484
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,220
that can make us go out,

485
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,220
I want to see why this director

486
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,220
is doing these cruel things.

487
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,220
There.

488
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,220
What are you cooking?

489
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,220
Fish.

490
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,220
It's so hard to pick a bowl.

491
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,220
I can't even sell tofu.

492
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,220
I have to bite it myself.

493
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,220
Can I have some eye force?

494
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,220
These words are drawn on it.

495
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,220
It's about a group of people

496
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,220
building a small town.

497
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,220
There are stone,

498
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,220
and a garden.

499
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,220
And a tomb.

500
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,220
It's just that

501
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,220
the whole town is in the order of the building.

502
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,220
The whole town is in the order of the building.

503
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,220
This is so weird.

504
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,220
It's almost the same as the number

505
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,220
of the old house.

506
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,220
But the structure on it

507
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,220
is not the style of the garden.

508
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,220
Fatty,

509
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,220
think about it.

510
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,220
Where in the ancient Chinese era

511
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,220
is there such a big building?

512
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,220
Damn fatty.

513
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,220
You didn't tell me yesterday.

514
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,220
What's going on?

515
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,220
Where is the door?

516
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,220
Why hasn't the bloodline returned yet?

517
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,220
There are still many obstacles.

518
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,220
I can't pick a bowl.

519
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,220
There's no way.

520
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,220
What a woman.

521
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,220
One, two.

522
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,220
There are twelve hands.

523
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,220
Shouldn't there be twelve nannies?

524
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,220
Why are there only five?

525
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,220
It's not right.

526
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,220
She's coming out to see.

527
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,220
Fatty!

528
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,220
Brother!

529
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,220
Fatty!

530
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,220
Look here.

531
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,220
This door,

532
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,220
almost the same office as thelively is.

533
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,220
These little Ninzy,

534
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,220
what are you doing here?

535
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,220
We don't need work forbidden.

536
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,200
Brother,

537
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,880
Got the water from the spell.

538
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,640
And the거

539
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,880
The mental state that is thirty years old.

540
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,560
Record it.

541
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,920
The seagull boys

542
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,260
who are

543
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,240
The best skewer

544
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,680
at a spur of the moment,

545
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,080
and ya ya.

546
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,960
Everyhaast

547
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,960
Why only one minute?

548
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,960
Did I say something wrong?

549
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
Brother!

550
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Yes.

551
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
Xiang De Lun!

552
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
That's right.

553
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,960
In this dark and quiet environment, there will be a sense of fear.

554
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,960
In this dark and quiet environment, there will be a sense of fear.

555
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,960
So in this environment, people will feel that time is too long.

556
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
Yes.

557
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,960
It's good to know this.

558
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,960
That's not to be afraid.

559
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,960
The most horrible thing in this world is probably this sea-top.

560
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
No, no, no.

561
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,960
The most horrible thing is the sea-top.

562
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
It's the heart of people.

563
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,960
How can you scare yourself?

564
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,960
It's a cat's paw.

565
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
Now it's a paw.

566
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
Damn!

567
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
Grandpa!

568
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,960
미국

569
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,960
This woman really and her emotional burden is too heavy.

570
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,960
tee원 of it

571
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,360
Meanwhile, we should make sure to take it back.

572
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,120
In a minute, we will see.

573
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,040
Count.

574
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,280
I'll select whatever one of you prioritized.

575
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,640
You could watch my whoop the Lantern Rosary and turn him on.

576
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,600
Who have far, most among the elderly?

577
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,320
Sheikh of the glorious, impermanent city,

578
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,520
to which he kept with his reign,

579
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,780

tr thếmen.

584
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,560
I was firmly the most pitting leader

585
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,080
and prepared my出來 of heaven for him.

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:47,520
emed.

587
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,200
Does Kiss have magic tricks?

588
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,320
Wait for me to search самое museum.

589
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,280
I need to plow it on the spot.

590
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,680
Let's take the pressure cooker out.

591
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,480
One, two, three!

592
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,400
The stone bowl is so big, how can it be so heavy?

593
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,360
Stainless

594
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,120
Four sides of the millarys and core of the mine

595
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,380
Subугable

596
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,080
Why haven't you come out yet?

597
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,080
How long has it been?

598
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,080
Is it because this wood has been in use for hundreds of years?

599
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,080
Is it because the wood has been in use for hundreds of years?

600
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,080
Is it because the wood has been in use for hundreds of years?

601
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,080
Forget it.

602
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,080
It's useless to be anxious.

603
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,080
It's not related to those tools, is it?

604
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,080
Why do you say it's a common thing?

605
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,080
Maybe there's something new to discover.

606
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Why did youسمothe?

607
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
Wasn't it just soma...

608
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,080
You eat, don't you?

609
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,080
Follow me.

610
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,080
Since you were little you've already done a labour...

611
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,240
Good medicine for low-abis food.

612
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,260
Maison in five square bolts!

613
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,080
This is the first time I've seen a hole in the coffin.

614
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,080
This is the hole?

615
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,080
The hole is too sharp.

616
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,080
It can be put directly under the coffin.

617
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,080
The person who dug it had to be so sharp.

618
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,080
How did he dig this hole?

619
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
This is the sea bottom.

620
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,080
And this ear is not a tool to move it, is it?

621
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,080
The coffin should have another ear.

622
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,080
Why do we still have space for such a deep hole?

623
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,080
Look at the hole.

624
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
It's a hole.

625
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,080
You're right.

626
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,080
This hole is the hole.

627
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,080
This is a hole.

628
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,080
This hole is a hole.

629
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,080
This hole is a hole.

630
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,080
This hole is a hole.

631
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
This hole is a hole.

632
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,080
Comrade Xiao, you're wrong.

633
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,080
This hole broke the hole to hide the corpse.

634
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,080
Although the corpse is rotten,

635
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,080
it's impossible to make it disappear.

636
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,080
But this spiritual knowledge has become a waste.

637
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,080
And the entire wood's water structure

638
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,080
has been broken.

639
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,080
I tell you, we have to be careful.

640
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,080
Comrade Xiao, you should come here and talk.

641
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,080
What is this?

642
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,080
The whole house is full of mud.

643
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
We can't kill him. Run!

644
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,080
It's a coffin.

645
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,080
Why did the owner

646
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,080
repair his coffin into a bathhouse?

647
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,080
How much did he love to bath?

648
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,080
How deep is this?

649
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,080
There is a deep well in the room we've been passing by.

650
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,080
Is the water here

651
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,080
the deepest than the sea?

652
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,080
No.

653
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,080
It's like a elevator.

654
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,080
How did this much water

655
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,080
come here?

656
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,080
The place I'm in is...

657
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,080
My labors.

658
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,080
Your demulgization paper can

659
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,080
stops the treasure Xiaodou isуб Еng.

660
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,080
Your period.

661
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,080
Do I have more data on you?

662
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
Do you know

663
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,040
you're seeing him in the dimensions?

664
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,080
Look at him.

665
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,080
Very cute.

666
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,080
The yellow soil in the inner palace is long and thick.

667
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,080
But there is no one here.

668
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,080
By the way, the back palace is the place for the crown.

669
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,080
Why should the crown be placed in the palace?

670
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,080
Or a palace?

671
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,080
A palace is a war period.

672
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,080
Isn't this tomb the tomb of Mingqiao?

673
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,080
The crown is the place for the crown.

674
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,080
The crown is the place for the crown.

675
00:43:52,080 --> 00:44:12,080
The crown is the place for the crown.

676
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:48,080
The crown is the place for the crown.

677
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,080
The crown is the place for the crown.
