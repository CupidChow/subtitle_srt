00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

3
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I hope you can enjoy your fun.

4
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No, I have to go first.

5
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I went to the place where you ate spicy food.

6
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I went down to find the treasure.

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

11
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The most exciting game on the line.

12
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's go to the game.

13
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

14
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

15
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Everyone's clothes are messy.

16
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I can't tell who it is.

17
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I brought the bones out to bury.

18
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't know if you are the grand-grandfather

19
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
or the grand-grandfather of the Taizu family.

20
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

21
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why are you shooting at me?

22
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

23
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

24
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

25
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

26
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So many things happened.

27
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I remember your notes so well.

28
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Do you know why?

29
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He hopes that these stories will be in the soil.

30
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But at that time, Mr. Zhong might have got the book of war.

31
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He didn't know what happened after he got it.

32
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He didn't know what happened.

33
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Maybe he broke his hand with a gun.

34
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Then he and the grand-grandfather also got the signature.

35
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
He died by the side of the coffin.

36
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He didn't know what happened and he was in the woods.

37
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He was hit by a hand.

38
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He didn't know what happened.

39
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

40
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

41
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

42
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

43
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Mr. Zhong, Mr. Zhong...

44
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Shut up!

45
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So many years,

46
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
you've done all these things for me.

47
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Can't you see it?

48
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes.

49
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This job is our destiny.

50
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We can't escape it.

51
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But I hope you can do it.

52
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Don't worry about it.

53
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's not good to be a man.

54
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You are the only one in the Wu family.

55
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I hope you can live well.

56
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Live happily.

57
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Live a quiet life.

58
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Be simple and simple.

59
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
For the Wu family,

60
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
for the Wu family.

61
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The blood of the family is flowing in the Wu family.

62
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Of course, he knows how much he can't bear to remember.

63
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's why he's so excited.

64
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Will it be the pain

65
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
that makes Uncle San go away?

66
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You found Wu Sanxing?

67
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Xiaoyu, thank goodness you're here.

68
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I told you I wouldn't disturb you.

69
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Thank you for helping us.

70
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You're different from those non-sensey food.

71
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Otherwise, how could I help you?

72
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Don't worry.

73
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll definitely help you ask your father's opinion.

74
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Wu Sanxing

75
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
doesn't know my father's whereabouts.

76
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But it doesn't matter now.

77
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The person who's the most concerned about my father in this world,

78
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
you can't remember him anymore.

79
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Is Uncle Sanxing still ill?

80
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I have something to tell you.

81
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I've already taken over all the shares of the non-sensey food.

82
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Next month, I'm going to take my mother to the Rui family.

83
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The medical conditions there are better.

84
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And my mother likes the North more.

85
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're not going back?

86
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I won't come back for now.

87
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But don't worry. We still have a contract.

88
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And I've signed the contract with the Ministry of Revenue.

89
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll share it as a message.

90
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Someone will definitely help us. Thank you.

91
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Don't thank me for that.

92
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We can't go to the plane in a while.

93
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Go ahead. You're on your way.

94
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Xiaoyu, you and I are different.

95
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But you're very similar to us.

96
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I hope we'll meet again.

97
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I hope so.

98
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm Diana you're enjoying your business.

99
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:28,480
Why don't you go to the hotel

100
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,160
Instruction,

101
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,700
sustainable treatment,

102
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,700
not visited,

103
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,620
powdered sugar,

104
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,740
zzarella cheese,

105
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,400
dying juice.

106
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,940
Flame,

107
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,520
hot pepper,

108
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,240
Quickly, let him in turn and love me.

109
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,240
I have already loves you.

110
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,600
Okay, alright, I got it.

111
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,040
He truly drove me bonfire,

112
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,600
shows me that you can still get me a magnum.

113
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
You're making this for me again?

114
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
You're working for me?

115
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,360
We're just looking for Xiao Yue.

116
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,360
I haven't played enough since I came out.

117
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
You're going to Rui's?

118
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Go and see Xiao Mengmeng.

119
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Don't keep thinking about playing.

120
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
Go home and get some food.

121
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
Mr. San.

122
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
This guy is so annoying.

123
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
He's been flying for a long time.

124
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
Uncle San.

125
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
You're in the way.

126
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
Fatty, drive.

127
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,360
Grandma is coming down soon.

128
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Do you know what to say?

129
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Don't look at me like that.

130
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,360
I'll be fine in a minute.

131
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Come on.

132
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Grandma Huo.

133
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

134
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Grandma Huo.

135
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
You're still the same as before.

136
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
Call me Xiezi.

137
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,360
You're the Xie family's Your Highness.

138
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,360
I'm the Huo family's Your Highness.

139
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
According to your identity,

140
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,360
you should be a good person.

141
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
I'm Wan Bei.

142
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
I'm the Xie family's Your Highness.

143
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
I'm the Xie family's Your Highness.

144
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
I'm Wan Bei.

145
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,360
I'm not a good person in front of you.

146
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,360
Xie family and Huo family.

147
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Although they're family,

148
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,360
they're two families after all.

149
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,360
But they should be equal.

150
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
The Xie family's family

151
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,360
doesn't have to be so low-key in front of me.

152
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
Otherwise,

153
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,360
my old lady would be so mad.

154
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
She's bullying people, right?

155
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
If Xie family is alive,

156
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,360
I'll have to scold my nose.

157
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
No way.

158
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Grandpa always told me

159
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
that you're the only woman

160
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
in the old house.

161
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,360
But you're the one who's most worthy of her.

162
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,360
Xie family won't say that.

163
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,360
She's smart.

164
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,360
She's the one who's most worthy of her.

165
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,360
There are not many people

166
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
who can admit it.

167
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,360
But I can't help it.

168
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,360
Now, young people like you

169
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,360
don't even want to smile.

170
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,360
I remember when you were little,

171
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
you were a singer.

172
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
Then, Xie family

173
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
made you a singer.

174
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
But you didn't learn

175
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,360
the advantages of these two.

176
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
But it's not like that.

177
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,360
You're so talented.

178
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,360
You've got the right to be a singer.

179
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,360
Right?

180
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
Grandma,

181
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,360
don't be too much.

182
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
I'm the one who has to go with

183
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,360
Little Brother.

184
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
It's my fault.

185
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
You're so mean.

186
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,360
You don't even let people talk.

187
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
You're saying that you're bullying people

188
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
with your old lady.

189
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,360
I'll settle the score with you later.

190
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,360
Grandma, I've been kneeling here for a long time.

191
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Little Brother has wounds on his body.

192
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,360
I have a bad knee.

193
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
What's the point of sitting down

194
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,360
and talking?

195
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Come on.

196
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
You're so bad.

197
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,360
You don't even let me talk.

198
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
Grandma, I'm being obedient.

199
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
I didn't expect that

200
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
you'd be so troublesome

201
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
to go abroad this time.

202
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
I'm not far from here.

203
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
I'm going abroad.

204
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,360
I'm on the first floor of the house.

205
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,360
I'm so smart and strong.

206
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
How can I help you?

207
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
You two

208
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,360
don't even have a helper.

209
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Even if you can come back alive,

210
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,360
you'll be lucky.

211
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
There's a helper.

212
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
There's Brother Wu Xie,

213
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Wang Pongzi,

214
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,360
and Uncle Wu Jia.

215
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,360
How many times have I told you?

216
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,360
You're so close to Wu Jian.

217
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
What a coincidence.

218
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Grandma,

219
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,360
you and Master Guo are old friends.

220
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,360
Why don't you take his grandson?

221
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,360
My relationship with Master Guo

222
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,360
is about our lord.

223
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,360
You're old and you're old.

224
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,360
You're old and you're willing to be together.

225
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,360
Then we're young and we're old.

226
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
Besides,

227
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
I don't believe that when you were young,

228
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,360
if something happened to Master Xie and Master Guo,

229
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,360
wouldn't you help?

230
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,360
I'm so worried about you.

231
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
You're so bad.

232
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,360
You're so useless.

233
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
You're actually

234
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,360
going to take my grandson?

235
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
No.

236
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
I went abroad with Brother Xiao Hua

237
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,360
not just to help him.

238
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,360
Uncle Lian Hua was in trouble.

239
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,360
Aunt was not a good person.

240
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
Shut up!

241
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,360
What are you looking at?

242
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,360
This is yours.

243
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,360
Feng Jianzhen,

244
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,360
you're the only one who doesn't have a grandson.

245
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
Uncle Lian Hua,

246
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
you're more rich than I thought.

247
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
I'm not giving you the money.

248
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,360
I'm rich.

249
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
I'm rich.

250
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,360
Don't be so far away.

251
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
You can only look at this bowl.

252
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
You can't touch it.

253
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,360
Uncle Lian Hua,

254
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,360
your tea set is not a set.

255
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,360
Your tea set is a set that's good for you, right?

256
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,360
Be careful.

257
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,360
It's a common bowl.

258
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
If I don't pay attention to this,

259
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,360
I'll give you a hard time.

260
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,360
You don't have to feel bad.

261
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
You dare?

262
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,360
You're a bad boy.

263
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,360
You're a bad boy.

264
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,360
I know.

265
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
I'm not a good person.

266
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,360
Oh, no.

267
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
Oh, no.

268
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,360
Oh, no.

269
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
You're a bad boy.

270
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,360
I'm not a bad boy.

271
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
You're a bad boy.

272
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,360
I'm not a bad boy.

273
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
Listen,

274
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,360
you know Uncle Lian Hua.

275
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,360
He's not a bad guy.

276
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,360
Pay him.

277
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
I don't have money.

278
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
Uncle Lian Hua,

279
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,360
I spent all my money

280
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,360
on the things I bought abroad.

281
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
Really?

282
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
And I'm even more fat than you.

283
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,360
You don't mind me, do you?

284
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
Then I'll go to the second floor.

285
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
I'm leaving.

286
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,360
Don't waste time.

287
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,360
Pack up.

288
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,360
Oh, no.

289
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
I'm old.

290
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,360
Uncle Lian Hua,

291
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,360
you've got so many products in your house.

292
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,360
Can he have one?

293
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
Don't say that.

294
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,360
You're so good at your high-end.

295
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,360
What are you talking about?

296
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,360
If you really want to find a good man,

297
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
you can re-enact him.

298
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,360
You can really take a look at the game in the pit.

299
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
Little thief,

300
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
do you really think that Uncle Lian Hua doesn't have one?

301
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
Don't fall.

302
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,360
If you fall,

303
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,360
we'll all be in trouble.

304
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,360
I'll take it for you.

305
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,360
You really don't have any real things.

306
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
You have a stone, don't you?

307
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,360
Take a closer look.

308
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,360
I thought that was a stone.

309
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,360
I'll take it.

310
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,360
I'll take it.

311
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,360
I'll take it.

312
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,360
I'll take it.

313
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,360
I'll take it.

314
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,360
Is that the person who killed the sculpture?

315
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,360
Is it the one from the legend?

316
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,360
The one who chose the princess?

317
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,360
Yes, I thought so.

318
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,360
What about that eye?

319
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
It's very obvious.

320
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
There were four.

321
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,360
There were two less.

322
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,360
I assume that

323
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,360
the two princesses were taken away.

324
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,360
I think that's the one.

325
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,360
The two princesses were taken away.

326
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,360
Why did they only take two eyes?

327
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,360
Think about it.

328
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,360
I assume that

329
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,360
the stone is so precious.

330
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,360
Unless there's any reason to take two of them without time.

331
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
Otherwise, it's not reasonable.

332
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,360
Uncle Lian Hua,

333
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,360
you're really bold.

334
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,360
You know that the stone

335
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,360
might be as bad as your grandpa.

336
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
You're still...

337
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
I guess that...

338
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,360
the secret

339
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
is behind the stone.

340
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,360
The stone is so precious.

341
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,360
I'm sure that

342
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,360
the one who chose the princess

343
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,360
will be the one who killed the sculpture.

344
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
I'm sure that

345
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,360
the one who chose the princess

346
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,360
will be the one who killed the sculpture.

347
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,360
I'm sure that

348
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
the one who chose the princess

349
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
will be the one who killed the sculpture.

350
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
I'm sure that

351
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,360
the one who chose the princess

352
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,360
will be the one who killed the sculpture.

353
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,360
I'm sure that

354
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,360
the one who chose the princess

355
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,360
will be the one who killed the sculpture.

356
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,360
I'm sure that

357
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,360
the one who chose the princess

358
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,360
will be the one who killed the sculpture.

359
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,360
I'm sure that

360
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,360
the one who chose the princess

361
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,360
will be the one who killed the sculpture.

362
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,360
I'm sure that

363
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,360
the one who chose the princess

364
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,360
will be the one who killed the sculpture.

365
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
I'm sure that

366
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,360
the one who chose the princess

367
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,360
will be the one who killed the sculpture.

368
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,360
I'm sure that

369
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,360
the one who chose the princess

370
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,360
will be the one who killed the sculpture.

371
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
I'm sure that

372
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
the one who chose the princess

373
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,360
will be the one who killed the sculpture.

374
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
I'm sure that

375
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,360
the one who chose the princess

376
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,360
will be the one who killed the sculpture.

377
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,360
I'm sure that

378
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,360
the one who chose the princess

379
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,360
will be the one who killed the sculpture.

380
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,360
I'm sure that

381
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,360
the one who chose the princess

382
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,360
will be the one who killed the sculpture.

383
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,360
What is that bug?

384
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,360
It's a snake.

385
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,360
A red snake?

386
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,360
A red snake.

387
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,360
Back then,

388
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,360
we saw the snake

389
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,360
in the new Lu Wang Palace.

390
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,360
It was very cold.

391
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,360
A red snake.

392
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,360
Little thief,

393
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,360
you are so stubborn.

394
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,360
You are so stubborn.

395
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,360
Little thief,

396
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,360
you are so stubborn.

397
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,360
Little thief,

398
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,360
you have seen

399
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,360
the third uncle.

400
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,360
You are so stubborn.

401
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,360
You are so stubborn.

402
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,360
Do you think

403
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,360
the stone inside

404
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,360
is all like this?

405
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,360
The bug is so cold.

406
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,360
It's four fingers at a time.

407
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,360
How did it survive until now?

408
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,360
Later,

409
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,360
I asked a Taoist

410
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,360
and he told me

411
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,360
that this is not a stone.

412
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,360
What is that?

413
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,360
A pill.

414
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,360
A pill?

415
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,360
It's the kind of pill that the Taoist has practiced.

416
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,360
It can be used for the old days.

417
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,360
Then,

418
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,360
the second uncle

419
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,360
was like you

420
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,360
in the past.

421
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,360
He accidentally fell into the stone

422
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,360
and got poisoned.

423
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,360
That's how he became that.

424
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,360
Third uncle,

425
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,360
what happened later?

426
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Later,

427
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
I was also a human.

428
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,360
Later, I was scared to death.

429
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,360
I was scared to death.

430
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,360
I was scared to death.

431
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,360
After that,

432
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,360
I was taken out

433
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,360
of the Fairy Valley

434
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,360
and buried there.

435
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,360
Everyone,

436
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,360
now,

437
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,360
go to the west.

438
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,360
Hurry up!

439
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,360
Run!

440
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,360
Xie Lian Huan and Qiu De Kou escaped.

441
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,360
All the others were killed.

442
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,360
But the truth is,

443
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,360
they can't get out of the trap.

444
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,360
This is a bad luck.

445
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,360
I'm sorry.

446
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,360
Your uncle is the leader of China.

447
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,360
He helped me a lot.

448
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,360
This operation has set a good foundation for our cooperation.

449
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,360
Soon after, I heard that there was only a team

450
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,360
that was going to discover the hidden treasure.

451
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,360
So I let Wu San Xing get into the team.

452
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,360
Xie Lian Huan and Qiu De Kou survived.

453
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,360
Why did you go to the sea to see them?

454
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
I was also there.

455
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,360
You are so shameless.

456
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,360
You can't even look at me.

457
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,360
What was the situation?

458
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,360
We were almost dead.

459
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,360
The whole country was taken away.

460
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,360
Can the country be in a hurry?

461
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,360
What should we do?

462
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
We were so bad at the time.

463
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,360
We were so bad at the test team.

464
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,360
One of them was killed.

465
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,360
By the way, it was the one that Wen Jing was in charge of.

466
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
That's right.

467
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,360
It was the one that Wen Jing was in charge of.

468
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,360
Are you hiding it from me?

469
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,360
You were investigating your aunt in the north.

470
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,360
Grandma, aunt has been missing for so many years.

471
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
You can't let go of her.

472
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,360
I don't want to see you always being greedy in the night.

473
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,360
When Uncle Lian Huan was in trouble,

474
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,360
the other people in the test team were all in the wrong.

475
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,360
You always didn't let us come with Uncle Wu.

476
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
It was because you thought of Uncle Wu

477
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,360
that you would think of the missing aunt.

478
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,360
No matter what happened,

479
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,360
I want to make it clear.

480
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
What happened to aunt?

481
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,360
Is she alive or dead?

482
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,360
How could you give your aunt...

483
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,360
the most impressive jeu?

484
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,380
Fierce Sleep and Two

485
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,380
You were southern.

486
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,380
You were poor in one spot.

487
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:59,380
Usually, she would be like a little princess.

488
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:04,380
But, she is all the same.

489
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,380
She is a man who can't be taken back.

490
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:14,380
Do you think it's good to divide her into cultural institutions?

491
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,380
She is so stable and can play with the goods.

492
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:22,380
She can even get rid of the old business of the Huo family.

493
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:26,380
She can even satisfy her favorite.

494
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,380
That's why I didn't say anything.

495
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,380
Right?

496
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:35,380
But, she is still in the test team.

497
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,380
I'm sorry, grandma. It's all my fault.

498
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,380
I shouldn't have mentioned aunt.

499
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,380
Don't be sad.

500
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,380
It's all my fault. Please blame me.

501
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,380
We should sell these devices ourselves.

502
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,380
That's the chance to get a good score.

503
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,380
Got it?

504
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,380
I'll see who is more capable than me.

505
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,380
You are so stupid.

506
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,380
We are all old friends.

507
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,380
Even if I...

508
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,380
Enough.

509
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,380
You two are too young.

510
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,380
I'll tell you the truth.

511
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,380
You should go to the place you want to go.

512
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,380
Can you play with the team?

513
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,380
Brother San, please help me tell Wenjing.

514
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,380
Tell me.

515
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,380
What's the point of playing?

516
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,380
I...

517
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,380
I'm also a burden to the people.

518
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,380
Who?

519
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,380
What do you want to do?

520
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,380
An old man.

521
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,380
An old man who goes with you to the place you want to go.

522
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,380
Brother San, how do you know?

523
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,380
No matter how I know, I still want to ask you.

524
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,380
How do you know that bloodstain?

525
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,380
Qiu Dekou is not going.

526
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,380
Qiu Dekou?

527
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,380
That old man.

528
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,380
He lived in Changsha for a long time.

529
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,380
I know him.

530
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,380
Wenjing.

531
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,380
Brother San, this time you can't help me.

532
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,380
I really can't get into the test team.

533
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,380
Thank you so much.

534
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,380
Xiao Xi.

535
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,380
Xiao Xi, can you carry the box for me?

536
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,380
Okay, I'll go there later.

537
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,380
Thank you.

538
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,380
Brother San, I'll go and help them carry the box.

539
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,380
Be careful.

540
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,380
Since you think Xie Lian Huan has a problem,

541
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,380
and you don't want to fight with Qiu Dekou,

542
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,380
then why do you still want to take Xie Lian Huan to the test team?

543
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,380
Kid, don't you agree to use him?

544
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,380
Use him?

545
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,380
But I thought, since he's here,

546
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,380
he's just under my nose.

547
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,380
He can't do anything except my eyes.

548
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,380
Wenjing, be careful when you go down.

549
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,380
Brother San is thinking of you.

550
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,380
You still don't believe in my technique?

551
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,380
Don't worry, I'll be careful.

552
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,380
That's all.

553
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,380
I'll go down.

554
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,380
I'm afraid of Xie Lian Huan.

555
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,380
I'm not afraid.

556
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,380
You know what?

557
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,380
In the sea,

558
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,380
you see these dead bodies,

559
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,380
one by one,

560
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,380
just like that...

561
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,380
just like the lanterns.

562
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,380
This, that, the skin,

563
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,380
and the fear, and the beauty.

564
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,380
The deep.

565
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,380
The deep.

566
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,380
The dark, the fear, and the beauty.

567
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,380
The deep.

568
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,380
Then, with this director,

569
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,380
I feel like I can't use the drawing in the sky for five months.

570
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,380
I just used the body to draw one.

571
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,380
But,

572
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,380
how did Xie Lian Huan

573
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,380
know this secret?

574
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,380
Qiu Dekou told her.

575
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,380
He took Xie Lian Huan out of the water.

576
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,380
At that time, I was so angry.

577
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,380
I said,

578
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,380
after I got up,

579
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,380
I had to clean up.

580
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,380
Now, people are gone.

581
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,380
What's the use of saying that?

582
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,380
Then, according to what you said,

583
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,380
you had to

584
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,380
get Xie Lian Huan out of the water.

585
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,380
You're really a genius.

586
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,380
You should try

587
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,380
if you have any air-conditioning.

588
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,380
If you get caught,

589
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,380
you'll be fine.

590
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,380
It's fine.

591
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,380
Such a deep sea.

592
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,380
There's still air.

593
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,380
It's really deep.

594
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,380
Why is it only this light?

595
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,380
Xie Lian Huan.

596
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,380
Xie Lian Huan.

597
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,380
Xie Lian Huan,

598
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,380
there's no water in the lake.

599
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,380
I'm sorry.

600
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,380
I'm sorry.

601
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,380
I'm sorry.

602
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,380
I'm sorry.

603
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,380
I'm sorry.

604
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,380
I'm sorry.

605
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,380
I'm sorry.

606
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,380
I'm sorry.

607
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,380
I'm sorry.

608
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,380
I'm sorry.

609
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,380
We have a lot of experience.

610
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,380
This kid.

611
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,380
He doesn't understand the use of oxygen.

612
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,380
He is so terrible.

613
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,380
He has to be human.

614
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,380
I'm sorry.

615
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,380
I'm sorry.

616
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,380
I'm sorry.

617
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,380
We are not ordinary people.

618
