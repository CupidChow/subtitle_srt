1
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The road ahead is too dark.

2
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We can't get up there.

3
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Shall we take a break?

4
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We'll go up the map.

5
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's getting dark.

6
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We don't know the terrain here.

7
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's dangerous at night.

8
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We must...

9
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yes.

10
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We must go.

11
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes.

12
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We must go.

13
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes.

14
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The road ahead is too dark.

15
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Hey, boy.

16
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Tell me.

17
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I've been caught by Aniang at the front.

18
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They were fighting to get a drink.

19
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They were having a fight with Iron Curtain.

20
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
They were being killed by Tianzhen.

21
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's no use keeping them alive.

22
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I think I've been here before.

23
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why?

24
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
To find treasure.

25
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I think I've thought of something.

26
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's really a treasure.

27
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Where is it?

28
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Did you clean it up?

29
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're a criminal.

30
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You're not afraid of being caught by the fat man.

31
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You're not a criminal, are you?

32
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm telling you, this is a life-threatening thing.

33
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Tianzhen is very dangerous.

34
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Very dangerous.

35
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You should be careful.

36
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000

Miss Ni! Come here!

108
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Give me the hand!

109
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Miss Ni!

110
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000

111
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000

Wait for me, brother.

118
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Stop!

119
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Put some of it down, brother.

120
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Stop!

121
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Brother!

123
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
There's a cave here.

124
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Can it get in?

125
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Is it reliable?

126
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000

I've been here before.

129
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What's going on?

130
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
My memory is not so good yet.

131
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But here,

132
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I lost my way of life.

133
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I have a memory.

134
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I've searched inside.

135
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
There's no danger.

136
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I can leave here soon.

137
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's just the army of Alin.

138
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Okay.

139
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Save Tianzhen.

140
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
If it's a ancient skill,

141
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
we'll save it.

142
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Let's go.

143
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Miss Ni, we've found her.

144
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Let's go.

145
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Take it.

146
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Tianzhen!

147
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Tianzhen!

148
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Tianzhen!

149
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,240
I'm curious what happens here with the Jiaxin SIS.

150
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,640
Don't you think it's impossible to show our revolves?

151
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,040
Who's taking care of this here?

152
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,960
Where is this place?

153
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,880
We're not here.

154
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,480
Can you bind them back?

155
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,680
I think we can't.

156
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,960
The altitude is lower than yesterday.

157
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,720
Miss peace in Chinaakh road was covered by ice when it snowed.

158
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,120
We can rebuilt the troops someday.

159
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,120
I can't even go back.

160
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Let's borrow some equipment.

161
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,120
Or I can't stay up all night.

162
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,120
Tell your mom that it's too cold.

163
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
I'm not cold.

164
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,120
You're not cold, I'm cold.

165
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,120
An Ning, we're in a hurry.

166
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
Can you give them some equipment?

167
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Give them some tent.

168
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,120
Okay.

169
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
No tent!

170
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,120
Grab some more food in the tent.

171
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,120
Three, three, four, five.

172
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,120
Hurry up!

173
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,120
Three, three, four, five.

174
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Have you eaten?

175
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,120
An Ning, let's talk.

176
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,120
I have nothing to talk with you.

177
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,120
You have a lot to talk with me.

178
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,120
If you tell me what you're looking for in Tianzhen,

179
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,120
does it have anything to do with the nearby ancient records?

180
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,120
It's useless to pretend to be stupid.

181
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,120
What can we do together?

182
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,120
What's the big deal?

183
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,120
There's nothing new.

184
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Right?

185
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,120
Let's share the information.

186
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,120
We'll cooperate later.

187
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,120
Who are you?

188
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
Okay.

189
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
Xiaobai!

190
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
Xiaobai!

191
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,120
You have to remember,

192
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,120
how did you know that the bloodstain?

193
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,120
You've been here before, how did you know?

194
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,120
How did you know that the nearby ancient records?

195
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,120
I think we need your memory to save Tianzhen.

196
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,120
Xiaobai!

197
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
Xiaobai!

198
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
What's wrong with you?

199
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
I'm sorry.

200
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
What's wrong with you?

201
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
What are you doing?

202
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
Xiaobai, what's wrong with you?

203
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
I'm fat!

204
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,120
Xiaobai, what's wrong with him?

205
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
Why is he like this?

206
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,120
We found a blood disease in Mr. Zhang's blood sample.

207
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,120
Our medicine can only be controlled temporarily.

208
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,120
When we found him, he was already poisoned.

209
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,120
Sir, we want Navel to locate where Shunzi took a wuxia.

210
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,120
Shunzi's father had an accident with the expenditure years ago.

211
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,120
It's understandable that he has his own ideas.

212
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,120
Where Navel is questioning each other's back, it's not dispensable.

213
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
The snow has covered the tracks.

214
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,120
It's difficult to search at the moment.

215
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,120
Have you searched the yard where his father hunted him?

216
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Understood, sir.

217
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,120
Aniang, why are you leaving?

218
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
Do you have any news from Tianzhen?

219
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,120
Ask me about your brother.

220
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
Besides, did you trust me?

221
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,120
I gave you the account. No need to be polite.

222
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
Let's go!

223
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
The gun is good.

224
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,120
Give me a gun.

225
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,120
Leave some more.

226
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
What's wrong with us?

227
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,120
He didn't even put his butt in the car.

228
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,120
They didn't tell him about his wife anyway.

229
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
They said, he sullied象.

230
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,120
These two brothers money and water must be ins LEDUh.

231
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,120
Shunzi's father was there when he was hunting.

232
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,120
How will he find them?

233
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,120
That place is west of the forest.

234
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,120
The legend says that place is haunted.

235
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,120
We need to go there for a day.

236
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,120
You must have been trained outside.

237
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
Stay here and stay here.

238
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
If you can't find the rope, you lost your mind.

239
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
So you must find it.

240
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
Yes.

241
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,120
My demanded Father to be cared for.

242
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
I believe and am literate.

243
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,120
Why the aggressive posture?

244
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,120
To be sure?

245
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
My Taoism.

246
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,520
Mr Yan

247
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
You still have some crows?

248
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,640
Knowing that they should split...

249
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,960
They should przypadly need to 죽er,

250
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,360
but they will not lot into a battle ofSOVIUty.

251
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,400
Guys over there.

252
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,440
Watch things!

253
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,360
Comrade Jian Guan.

254
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,480
Repeat.

255
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,960
This whole territory was diseases.

256
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,040
Make it normal in the forest,

257
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,800
orders to take sides for manipulations.

258
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,760
¡ano!

259
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,760
What is the matter?

260
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,760
Miaoshan, itCharmili, come on!

261
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,680
What the division ofин the duel,

262
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,760
what if in the war,

263
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:14,420
become governmentف

264
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,840
that the important ВП which we think

265
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,300
won't get 이거를 after.

266
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,520
I understand.

267
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,620
We're not leaving,

268
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,620
We have to find out whether the Wu Xie is inside.

269
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,620
It's dark. We can't find Yan Tian.

270
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,260
Unknown

271
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,660
Too late.

272
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,620
well

273
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,480
Me too

274
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,020
And the boat

275
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:59,900
Make the country unique with your brother ASL.

276
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:08,140
Let's make our country unique.

277
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,060
We must congratulate everyone.

278
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,580
Thank you, eastern的劈变一年个子,

279
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:27,820
The

280
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,740
sudden

281
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:35,340
we

282
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,040
married

283
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,920
Come on.

284
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,240
Let me go!

285
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,440
What are you doing?

286
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,600
Let me go! I'm telling you, I'm a coward.

287
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,880
I'm not afraid of this.

288
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,960
But you know, I'm next to that guy.

289
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Wait for him to come in.

290
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:14,880
Don't move.

291
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,760
I'm telling you, you're all dead, you know?

292
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,560
I want to break you up.

293
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,360
Let me go!

294
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,520
Listen up!

295
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:59,960
—

296
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:16,400
anosvedko —

297
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
What?

298
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,400
How long has it been?

299
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
What?

300
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,200
It's time to eat.

301
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,000
According to my experience,

302
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
a little girl should come here

303
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
and send us a meal.

304
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,200
I think I should come in.

305
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,000
You miss us?

306
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,400
Did you have a meal?

307
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Let's go.

308
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,600
Be gentle.

309
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,400
It's all your fault.

310
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,200
Who's your fault?

311
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,000
Be careful.

312
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,200
Let's untie them.

313
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Be careful.

314
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,600
Who are you?

315
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,600
Don't, Fatty.

316
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
It's all your fault.

317
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Tianzhen!

318
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Tianzhen!

319
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Tianzhen is here.

320
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,400
What's wrong with you?

321
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Fatty.

322
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,400
Are you okay?

323
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Tianzhen.

324
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Tianzhen.

325
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,600
Do you remember me now?

326
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,400
Fatty, Tianzhen.

327
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
It's all your fault.

328
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Don't get me wrong.

329
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,600
Let me introduce you.

330
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,400
This is Mr. Chen.

331
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,600
He's the expert

332
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
who specially invited us here.

333
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,800
He's an old man.

334
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,000
Enough.

335
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,400
I won't talk too much.

336
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,200
We're going to the east-western part of the mountain.

337
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
The lower part of the Snake-Demon-Tong-Tong River

338
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,800
is very related to that area.

339
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,200
Sir, the east-western part of the Snake-Demon-Tong River.

340
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
What's wrong?

341
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
I haven't told you about the Wusan-Light.

342
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
What's wrong?

343
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,400
There's really a Snake-Demon-Tong-Tong River in this place.

344
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,000
Anyway, I've studied with Wusan-Light.

345
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
This time I'm looking for the east-western part.

346
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,800
I want to find the clue of Snake-Demon-Tong-Tong River

347
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,600
and find the Wusan-Light.

348
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,400
What's the Wusan-Light?

349
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,000
What's the Wusan-Light again?

350
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,400
You know it clearly in the book.

351
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,400
If you don't have any doubts,

352
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
I'll still be here to analyze it.

353
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,400
Huahe, wait a minute.

354
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,000
I'll study it.

355
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,200
Okay.

356
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,400
I've seen the map here.

357
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,200
There's indeed a dragon's pulse.

358
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,200
And I've also analyzed it from the water.

359
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
It's indeed a blood-stained map.

360
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,600
Wu Xie,

361
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,600
is there a black stone in there?

362
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Where's the stone?

363
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,800
I've seen it. No.

364
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,600
It must be in Jin-yang's house when it was fighting.

365
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,600
The stone is black and bright.

366
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,600
It's made of special material and has a delicate texture.

367
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,600
It's like it's combined with metal.

368
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Brother, what are you looking for?

369
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,600
That's a kind of special magnet.

370
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
And we're going to that place.

371
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
There's a huge magnet there.

372
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,600
It can interfere with the magnetic field.

373
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
The stone you're wearing

374
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,600
is a kind of magnet.

375
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,600
The stone you're wearing

376
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
is made of the material.

377
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,600
It won't interfere with the magnetic field.

378
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,600
But it's not easy to find it now.

379
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,600
I know where you're talking about.

380
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
But it's almost impossible to find it there.

381
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,600
There's a skyline there.

382
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,600
And there's a big age gap between you two.

383
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
It's okay.

384
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,600
Since it's hard to find it,

385
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,600
we'll just have to fix it.

386
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,600
We'll have to find it in time.

387
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
Where's the big brother?

388
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,600
He's out to solve his personal problems.

389
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
He'll be back soon.

390
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,600
Eat less.

391
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Big brother, you're going to be a big hit tonight.

392
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,600
Big brother, you're going to be a big hit tonight.

393
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Are you okay?

394
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,600
It's okay. I have my own way.

395
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,600
I can solve it for now.

396
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,600
Go find some people to repair the car.

397
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
You guys go and repair the car.

398
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Yes.

399
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Ask him to sell these.

400
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,600
Ask him to sell these as well.

401
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,600
I don't want to hear any more about the factory.

402
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,600
Ask him.

403
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
humility

404
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,600
humility

405
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,600
humility

406
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
toothpick

407
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
trucks

408
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
Turn off your light

409
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,600
Turn off your lights

410
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
Ingush.

411
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,640
You see?

412
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,920
What are you doing?

413
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,920
I've been away for a long time.

414
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,920
I'll go with you. I know where they are.

415
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,920
Mr. Qiu Doukang's phone.

416
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Yes, sir. I know.

417
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,920
I'll lead the team. Everyone listens to me.

418
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,920
Yes.

419
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,920
I'll lead the team.
