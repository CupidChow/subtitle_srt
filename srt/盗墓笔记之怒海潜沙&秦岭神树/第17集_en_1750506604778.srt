00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why is he looking for this?

3
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is the head of the people.

4
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The ancient people fought for many enemies to be their strategy.

5
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The whole world was moved back to the Tai Chen.

6
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The people cut off the head.

7
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You see, the reason why this head is on this stone is

8
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
because it was killed by the living man.

9
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No, you think that people are playing with the emperor's horse and the horse is brave?

10
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Why do you have to do this?

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You're so angry.

12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Fatty, look.

13
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
There are more enemies behind the hospital.

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It should be here.

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Let's go.

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Wait a minute.

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Someone has been here.

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Is it the old man who just abandoned them?

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The one who can get here is the master.

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Be careful when you get in.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's go.

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Let's go.

23
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The old man is here.

24
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Are you okay?

25
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm fine.

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Come here.

27
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's go.

28
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There is no way here.

29
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Fatty, there is a hole over there.

30
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Come.

31
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The water is deep.

32
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Wait a minute.

33
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Come back.

34
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What are you looking at?

35
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You don't understand, do you?

36
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Have you seen the wild boar?

37
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The back.

38
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
As long as you take this set and put it on your phone,

39
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
you won't be able to eat it.

40
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can still use it inside.

41
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Learn it.

42
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Have you learned it?

43
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
How is it?

44
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Are you coming?

45
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You'd better stay here and don't go out.

46
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's go.

47
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's go.

48
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The first day of the trip

49
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The first day of the trip

50
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The first day of the trip

51
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The first day of the trip

52
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The first day of the trip

53
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The first day of the trip

54
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The first day of the trip

55
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The first day of the trip

56
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The first day of the trip

57
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The first day of the trip

58
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The first day of the trip

59
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The first day of the trip

60
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The first day of the trip

61
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The first day of the trip

62
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The first day of the trip

63
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Don't do it!

64
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Wait a second!

65
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This way.

66
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
This way.

67
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Move it.

68
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Fatty, I think

69
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
there must be something here.

70
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm afraid that nothing will be fixed.

71
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What's the way?

72
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's so dirty.

73
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The wood is so big.

74
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
How can it not be fixed?

75
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Do you think it's rich and not fixed?

76
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
No money, it's fixed.

77
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This is the most dangerous place in the whole area.

78
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Look, the stone Yong is not finished yet.

79
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It should be the place where the craftsmen are.

80
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I guess this is what the horse said.

81
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This is the main wood of the mine.

82
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I tell you, it's better to see it.

83
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Don't let the real big man get into trouble.

84
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Come, let's go.

85
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's go.

86
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's not cold anymore.

87
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Let's go.

88
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Fatty.

89
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Fatty.

90
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Fatty.

91
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No.

92
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Stop.

93
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Stop.

94
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're also caught.

95
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
No.

96
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Water.

97
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Fatty.

98
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No.

99
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There's something down there.

100
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What's that?

101
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't know.

102
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What's that?

103
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What's that?

104
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What's that?

105
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You're going back a number 6?

106
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Okay, running.

107
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Then if you're caught,

108
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
then start running.

109
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah

110
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
OK, come , come.

111
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Time to run and run.

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,080
Isn't that common,

113
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,320
though your friends have told me

114
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,140
I will switch him out!

115
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,220
Bo Gold оказgame,

116
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,020
I'll help you.

117
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,180
You still can't have him with me.

118
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,580
Shut up, you bastard!

119
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,120
ability

120
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,400
You're 2018, so no lies!

121
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,580
Are you all right, ah?

122
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,080
Right.

123
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,200
Why are you like that?

124
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,520
Very crazy, you want to say no to us for a entirety year?

125
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,520
There's a way out. I'll go back.

126
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,920
Go!

127
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Wait!

128
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Tosya!

129
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Hurry!

130
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,200
We're going to be caught!

131
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Go!

132
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Go!

133
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:27,680
The

134
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,020
aking river.

135
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,420
You must live well!

136
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,020
I will never come to this place again!

137
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,020
I can't hear you!

138
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,420
I can't let you stay here!

139
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,020
Tell my uncle!

140
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,420
Ask him to find a partner!

141
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,420
Never come to this place again!

142
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,020
Tell him yourself!

143
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
Broly is the real weakness

144
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,820
of a robber's heart.

145
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,020
Anything can happen.

146
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,420
Kill me!

147
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,420
Get my money back!

148
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,420
Go to hell first!

149
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,700
Lu Fei.

150
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,800
Go ahead.

151
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,100
Another one…

152
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,260
Wake up...

153
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,760
Caga, Cag!

154
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,180
Me?

155
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,160
On my Shouldom.

156
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,600
Lao Yang?

157
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,300
Lao Yang!

158
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,160
After that, why are you here?

159
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,120
I had to save him.

160
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,800
You just saved me?

161
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,920
I'm not sure.

162
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,760
Did you see me?

163
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,480
I have a friend.

164
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Fatty.

165
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
Fatty!

166
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,200
Fatty! Fatty!

167
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,720
If your friend dies,

168
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,960
the body will be recovered.

169
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,160
There is no body in the water.

170
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
He must be dead.

171
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,760
The body was washed away by the water.

172
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,720
This is a turtle?

173
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,760
But your little baby is very fierce.

174
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,000
This one is small.

175
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,360
Then why is there a turtle here?

176
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,520
I don't know.

177
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,880
Forget it. Let's not talk about this fish.

178
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
You have so many things in your body.

179
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,160
You are so boring.

180
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,800
I... I don't know how long I've been here.

181
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,400
I remember three years ago,

182
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,040
I went to a place with a horse.

183
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
This is the place you came from.

184
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,400
Yes. How do you know?

185
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,120
This is very strong.

186
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,720
I don't attend to a waterer with a horse.

187
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,120
The teacher wanted to fire me to death.

188
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,720
From now on, I will take you here.

189
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,760
You were lucky.

190
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,840
I do not have a voice.

191
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,200
I'm afraid not.

192
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,600
I've never seen you before.

193
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
We met since elementary school.

194
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
I didn't realize you were so stubborn.

195
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,400
If you were stronger than now,

196
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,400
I'm afraid your mom would know you're here.

197
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,200
But now,

198
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,400
she knows you live in the mountains.

199
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,400
She must be so anxious.

200
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,200
What are you looking forward to?

201
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,500
Not looking.

202
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,700
Nothing.

203
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,900
I saw you grab something.

204
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,900
Follow her.

205
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,800
Here are 3 people's footprints.

206
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
One is Wu Xie, the other is Wang Pongzi.

207
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,900
And another one.

208
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,780
I don't have his information.

209
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,280
But according to the suspicion,

210
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,100
he must be a man who weighs 70 kg

211
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,600
around 180 kg.

212
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,440
He didn't get close to Wu Xie and Wang Pongzi.

213
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,140
He must be following them.

214
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,440
Wu Xie is so curious.

215
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,900
He went to the bronze tree and came here.

216
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,400
He's quite famous.

217
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Who is the person who followed him?

218
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,400
Miss Ning,

219
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,400
let's wait for them here.

220
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,100
They went up there.

221
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Let's go and see.

222
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Okay.

223
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,400
Lao Yang, this is the bell.

224
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,900
Do you like to see me off?

225
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,900
Don't move.

226
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
Does this bell affect you?

227
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,900
No.

228
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
That's good.

229
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,400
I have a big phone.

230
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
It's waterproof.

231
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,900
It was in the house.

232
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,900
I was kicked by a monkey and got stuck in the hole.

233
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
This fish is so big.

234
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,400
It's been eating me for several days.

235
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Do you want to eat it?

236
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
I don't eat it.

237
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,400
I don't eat it even if I starve to death.

238
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
This is ridiculous.

239
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,860
I'm sorry.

240
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,420
This person was just bitten to death.

241
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,620
Are you a friend?

242
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,220
No.

243
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,940
My friend is a big one.

244
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,780
It's impossible for him.

245
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,620
If he were me,

246
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,540
would you recognize him?

247
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,620
Just bring him here.

248
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,180
Don't say that.

249
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,780
We've known each other for three years.

250
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,500
Have you made new friends?

251
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,980
Would you like to study with him?

252
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,340
Have you made new friends?

253
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,460
How can I not know him?

254
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,420
Look.

255
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,620
Nobody knows him.

256
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,780
Look.

257
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,700
Since he was bitten to death,

258
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,060
would they have brought him here?

259
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,620
Yea.

260
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,980
This time, I can shoot two bullets.

261
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,980
But I can't push the bullet.

262
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,980
It's like a gun.

263
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,980
I can shoot the empty shell.

264
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,980
But the gun's weight is small.

265
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,980
It's okay to shoot small ones.

266
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,980
If you hit some big ones,

267
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,980
wolves, wild pigs,

268
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,980
and one shot is not dead,

269
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,980
you will be killed by the second shot.

270
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,980
Also, this is a short-range.

271
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,980
He will shoot a rabbit and do nothing.

272
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,980
Look, this fish's belly is heavy.

273
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,980
It means that he was attacked by us.

274
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,980
So, this person is not a detective,

275
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,980
but a thief.

276
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,980
This fish is heavy with iron bullets.

277
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,980
It's not powerful.

278
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,980
No wonder you are so close.

279
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,980
Kill him.

280
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,980
What are you thinking?

281
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,980
I'm thinking how this fish came here.

282
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,980
Is it a person?

283
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,980
It's not.

284
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,980
There is a tunnel under this tunnel.

285
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,980
The tunnel is connected to the underground river.

286
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,980
The underground river is connected to the river.

287
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,980
So, the fish came here from the river.

288
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,980
It's a wooden wood.

289
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,980
How could there be a tunnel?

290
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,980
There is no water equipment in ancient times.

291
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,980
How could there be a tunnel?

292
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,980
It's not a tunnel.

293
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,980
It was built by the valley.

294
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,980
This mountain is called Yanshi Mountain.

295
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,980
This mountain is made of the central area of the Taigu River.

296
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,980
It's called Yanmai.

297
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,980
If Yanmai is connected to Shanxi,

298
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,980
there will be a water system in the middle.

299
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,980
Once the Chinese people break through this water system,

300
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,980
there will be a big valley.

301
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,980
So, the reason why Yanmai is called Yancheng is

302
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,980
because Yanmai was broken.

303
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,980
So, there was no water system in the original.

304
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,980
Once it was broken, there was a water system.

305
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,980
There was a water system.

306
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,980
The owner of this water system can't pick up the water.

307
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,980
Lao Yang, I will go down this water system again later

308
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,980
to find my friend.

309
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,980
Wait for me here.

310
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,980
I will come back to save you.

311
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,980
No, I will follow you.

312
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,980
I will protect you.

313
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,980
I see.

314
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,980
I find it.

315
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,980
I look for Yan Zi's blood.

316
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,980
I would like to check why I don't need it.

317
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,980
This problem is over.

318
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,980
I need this blood.

319
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,980
I will go down this mountain.

320
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,980
This time for the 자기.

321
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,980
Stay with me.

322
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,980
This thing can't be stopped.

323
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,220
쓰�

324
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,420
It's here

325
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,200
This is where they disappeared

326
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:21,900
Hey!

327
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:23,680
It's got footprints

328
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,380
They must be shoe-bound

329
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,140
Only by有一 같아 можно найти

330
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,940
を �راッ...

331
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,340
Who would save us all?

332
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,020
Who will become our leader?

333
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,860
Everything we ever dreamed of would be found

334
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:55,620
to be co-lcze a [( inconsistencies, it's there, happenings stuck to beyond the imperial laws.)

335
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,300
Took place here and inherited it from theども.

336
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,420
And I just knew that you was affairs of the imperial court of nature.

337
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,540
So here you are in the chapel,

338
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:07,800
Oh...

339
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,540
What?

340
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,540
Is it a fish?

341
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,540
It's so shallow.

342
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,540
It can't even come down.

343
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,540
Let's go.

344
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,540
What's that?

345
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,540
It's a rock.

346
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,540
Is it a big fish?

347
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,540
It's so shallow.

348
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,540
It's not even going to come down.

349
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,540
Let's go.

350
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,540
Look, there's something else in the water.

351
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,540
Since you said this is a rock cave,

352
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,540
then the direction we're walking in

353
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,540
is not the right entrance.

354
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,540
Then let's go down the road.

355
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,540
This mining is the same as building decoration.

356
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,540
There are many ways.

357
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,540
The one that is divided into the waist or the one that is straight.

358
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,540
If the waist is down,

359
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,540
then it's fine.

360
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,540
If we find the way, then we can go up.

361
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,540
If it's straight, then it's not good.

362
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,540
Look, the distance is so far.

363
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,540
The last 100 years of building decoration

364
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,540
can't be used anymore.

365
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,540
Even if we go down the cliff,

366
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,540
it's hard to climb up.

367
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,540
Let's go one step further.

368
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,540
The fish is still in my heart.

369
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,540
Over there.

370
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,540
Let's go.

371
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,540
Be careful.

372
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,540
You're a fool.

373
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,540
You're a fool.

374
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,540
I'm a fool.

375
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,540
Wu Xie.

376
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,540
There's water in front.

377
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,540
There might be a big fish.

378
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,540
Let's go this way.

379
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,540
Look.

380
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,540
This is a swimming pool.

381
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,540
If we go like this, we'll be thrown back.

382
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,540
Let's go this way.

383
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,540
We have an old way.

384
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,540
Let's go to the pool.

385
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,540
No.

386
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,540
Citing.

387
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,540
Okay.

388
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,540
Come on.

389
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,540
We'll never lose.

390
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,540
We'll win.

391
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,540
Let's go.

392
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,540
What are you doing?

393
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,540
What are you looking at?

394
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
Do you have a promise?

395
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,540
If you do, I'll…

396
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,540
I'll…

397
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,540
I'll…

398
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,540
I'll…

399
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,540
Where did he go?

400
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,540
What's that?

401
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,540
The bear?

402
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,540
A Sedan?

403
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
A Sedan.

404
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,540
How long will it take?

405
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,540
You eat it.

406
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,540
It's mine.

407
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,540
I can't chew it.

408
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,540
Bring it down.

409
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,540
I can't eat it.

410
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,540
Are you sure?

411
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,540
No, I'm fine.

412
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,540
Here you go.

413
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:23,420
Fifty people are dead.

414
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,620
Lera, let's go back first.

415
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,620
We're all out of opposed operation.

416
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:44,780
This is the ass, here's our

417
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,260
With this kind of druid-leg,

418
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,940
now she is Poseidon.

419
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,460
And it seems...

420
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,740
The shrapnel.

421
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,500
پฮฺ Have you met.

422
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,260
If they don't want people to know where his tomb is,

423
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,740
they'll just prepare the materials.

424
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,980
That's not possible.

425
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,460
Wu Xie,

426
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,620
look at the people.

427
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,940
Why is it a building?

428
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,180
What kind of thing is this?

429
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,420
Why don't I have any idea?

430
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,300
You're a person who's not qualified for a history class.

431
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,660
You should have said you have a clue.

432
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,140
China's history of the Nishidiak is long-lasting.

433
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,060
Post-production culture,

434
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,580
andربation,

435
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,140
functioning instruments

436
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,420
were the primary tomorrow party method of our Llanxuang Alliance.

437
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,420
Although it's very close to my memory,

438
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,380
there's only the leader of Emperor Qian Shihuan.

439
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,780
Well,

440
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,740
then…

441
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:50,780
So,

442
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,780
tell me,

443
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,820
where's your name?

444
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,140
What's wrong with him?

445
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,500
Wu Xie, hurry up.

446
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,660
There seems to be a hole in the front.

447
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,660
Yang.

448
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,660
Yang.

449
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,660
Yang.

450
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,660
Yang.

451
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,660
Yang.

452
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,660
Yang.

453
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,660
Yang.

454
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,660
Yang.

455
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,660
Yang.

456
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,660
Yang.

457
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,660
Yang.

458
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,660
Yang.

459
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,980
Is there anyone else?

460
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,940
Let's jump to the timing.

461
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,100
Ok, stop it.

462
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,940
10 almond.

463
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,340
Just hold it?

464
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,340
Sach这里.

465
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,100
You didn't recognize me

466
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,020
right?

467
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,180
Hold it.

468
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,740
Where are you from?

469
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,260
Where do you live?

470
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,620
The hospital they want to help me.

471
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,700
Do you have friends who wouldn't ask you for help?

472
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,860
Hello, my name is Li Famiko.

473
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:50,920
V sic Dimitri

474
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
você que iyi.

475
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,480
Slow down, let's go together.

476
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,680
Lao Yang.

477
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,840
Lao Yang.

478
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,480
Lao Yang.

479
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,200
Lao Yang.

480
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,760
Lao Yang.

481
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,280
Lao Yang.

482
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,280
Lao Yang.

483
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,920
Where are you, Lao Yang?

484
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,640
Where are you, Lao Yang?

485
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,000
Lao Yang.

486
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Lao Yang.

487
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,680
Gu Xie.

488
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,400
Lao Yang.

489
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,080
Gu Xie.

490
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,840
I'm inside.

491
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,800
Help me, Gu Xie.

492
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,800
Don't be afraid, I'll be right here.

493
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,640
Gu Xie.

494
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,440
Besides, I need to ask you one more thing.

495
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,400
About three years ago,

496
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,840
have you heard about two young men

497
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,700
from the Zhennies' prison

498
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,080
to vessel you here?

499
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,100
Nope.

500
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,520
There's a Crusader scenario.

501
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,520
Men couldn't bring the Crusaders

502
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,520
to you due to the tourures.

503
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,580
Yet the Crusaders

504
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,520
they went to you

505
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,700
and едed yourself here

506
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,700
He speaks with a mouthful.

507
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,700
I don't understand.

508
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,700
There is a street.

509
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,700
He is talking to them.

510
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,700
That is a waste of time.

511
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,700
By the way, I remember.

512
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,700
They are also going to the house to hook up.

513
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,700
Are you two together?

514
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,700
Yes, we know each other.

515
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,700
They didn't come out.

516
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,700
Didn't come out?

517
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,700
I don't listen to my old man.

518
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,700
They must go to the house to hook up.

519
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,700
When they go in,

520
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,700
there is no signal.

521
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,700
That's not right, old man.

522
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,700
I just saw one in Beijing a day ago.

523
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,700
He is alive.

524
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,700
That's impossible.

525
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,700
This is going to be a mountain.

526
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,700
The road in our village is the most difficult.

527
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,700
Yang.

528
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,700
Yang.

529
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,700
Where are you, Wu Xie?

530
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,700
Where are you, Wu Xie?

531
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,700
Wu Xie.

532
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,700
Yang.

533
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,700
Wu Xie, that's great.

534
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,700
How many things have you hidden from me?

535
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,700
You have been here before, right?

536
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,700
What?

537
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,700
You have been here for three years.

538
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,700
You can't have not been to the Caisin Cave.

539
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,700
Why did you enter the cave behind me?

540
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,700
Wu Xie, you are seriously ill.

541
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,700
And, the stone tower is damaged.

542
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,700
You have never been here before.

543
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,700
You have hidden me.

544
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,700
What is it for?

545
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,700
Wu Xie, here.

546
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,700
I just came here.

547
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,700
I have been here for three years.

548
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,700
I just came here.

549
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,700
You...

550
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,700
What do you suspect?

551
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,700
What do you want me to do?

552
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,700
You don't trust me?

553
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,700
Fine, I trust you.

554
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,700
Then we will leave now.

555
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,700
Are you leaving?

556
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,700
I don't want to leave.

557
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,700
You can't tell me the truth.

558
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,700
Yang, I tell you.

559
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,700
I have been a brother to you since I was a kid.

560
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,700
I trust you 100%.

561
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,700
I have never done anything that sorry you.

562
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,700
Now, I don't care what you are doing.

563
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,700
Our friendship is over.

564
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,700
Wu Xie, I lied to you.

565
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,700
But I didn't want to hurt you.

566
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,700
I...

567
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,700
I treated you as my best friend.

568
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,700
My best friend.

569
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,700
Your best friend?

570
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,700
You lied to me because you lied to me?

571
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,700
You lied to me because you were right to marry me?

572
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,700
You...

573
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,700
Listen to me. I will tell you.

574
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,700
When I was with the boss,

575
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,700
after I got to this secret place,

576
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,700
I found a cave with no entrance.

577
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,700
The boss was afraid to go ahead.

578
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,700
You know I love adventure since I was a kid.

579
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,700
I decided to go down there alone.

580
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,700
I walked to the group.

581
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,700
I met a group of people.

582
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,700
There were 20 people.

583
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,700
I was very scared.

584
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,700
Many people died on the way.

585
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,700
I almost buried everyone.

586
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,700
I was buried in the stone.

587
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,700
I was holding my shoulder.

588
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,700
I couldn't move.

589
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,700
I was watching them.

590
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,700
They were all buried in the stone.

591
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,700
I almost had a hangover.

592
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,700
I was afraid that the whole place would be lost.

593
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,700
We were in this place.

594
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,700
But then...

595
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,700
I escaped from the cave.

596
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,700
I found that the boss had taken everything we had.

597
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,700
I met people in the mountain.

598
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,700
I was in their village for a while.

599
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,700
After I came out, I found that the boss was locked in the prison.

600
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,700
I felt that there was a sound.

601
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,700
It was calling me back.

602
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,700
But when I came here,

603
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,700
I found that I couldn't find the original way.

604
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,700
It was almost my obsession.

605
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,700
I couldn't find the way.

606
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,700
I couldn't leave this mountain.

607
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,700
Until I came with your fat friend.

608
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,700
I followed you and found that there was another way.

609
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,700
I could come in.

610
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,700
It's so dangerous here.

611
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,700
Are you crazy?

612
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,700
Yes, I am.

613
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,700
I am crazy.

614
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,700
Wuxian, aren't you here to find a tomb?

615
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,700
Our goal is to be friends for so many years.

616
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,700
We can fight together.

617
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,700
Isn't that good?

618
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,700
Yes.

619
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,700
Wuxian, no matter what you think,

620
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,700
I will never hurt you.

621
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:21,700
Now I want to go in and see what's inside.

622
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,700
Wuxian, you go with me.

623
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,700
Wuxian, you are here.

624
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,700
When I find the tomb, I will send you home.

625
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,700
I knew that you wouldn't leave me.

626
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,700
I won't leave you.

627
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,700
You are not to blame.

628
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,700
I am not to blame.

629
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,700
I am to blame.

630
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,700
I am to blame.

631
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,700
I am to blame.

632
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,700
I am to blame.

633
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,700
I am to blame.

634
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,700
I am to blame.

635
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,700
I am to blame.

636
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,700
The End

637
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,700
The End

638
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,700
The End

639
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,700
The End

640
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,700
The End
