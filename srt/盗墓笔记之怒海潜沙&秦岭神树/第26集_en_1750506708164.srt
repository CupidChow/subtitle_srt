O heaven

2
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,120
Hey, Areya!

3
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,920
Why are you here?

4
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,120
I didn't serve a meat refused!

5
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
Mom!

6
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,160
The game is very exciting.

7
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,160
The game is very exciting.

8
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,160
The game is very exciting.

9
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
The game is very exciting.

10
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,160
The game is very exciting.

11
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,160
The game is very exciting.

12
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,160
The game is very exciting.

13
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,160
The game is very exciting.

14
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,160
The game is very exciting.

15
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,160
The game is very exciting.

16
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,160
The game is very exciting.

17
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,160
The game is very exciting.

18
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,160
The game is very exciting.

19
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,160
The game is very exciting.

20
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,160
The game is very exciting.

21
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,160
The game is very exciting.

22
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,160
The game is very exciting.

23
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,160
Suyang.

24
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Is this you?

25
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,160
Yes.

26
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,160
It's me.

27
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Did you find a branch?

28
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,160
No.

29
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Now I'm moving my 많이.

30
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,160
Go in and see who I'm calling.

31
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Wuxian, did you find anything?

32
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,160
I found some precious mushroom inside.

33
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Some things.

34
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,160
And?

35
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,160
There is a vaccine.

36
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,160
It says that he came to this mountain three years ago with his companion.

37
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,240
But it seems that he was buried in the cave with a bomb.

38
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,640
He must be starving.

39
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,520
Yang, move it first.

40
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,840
I'll see if there are any other clues.

41
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
I'll come back later to help you.

42
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,040
Is there any other clues?

43
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,320
So, will there be any readings?

44
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,720
There is a wrote發現.

45
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:36,700
Eat a HEADP어리

46
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,220
These are all our clues.

47
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,920
Those were all clues in the placenta,

48
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,640
not information.

49
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,080
Oh, he found it.

50
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,960
Take it.

51
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,760
Ant.

52
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
Who are you?

53
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
Wu Xie,

54
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,080
it's not a good thing to know about something.

55
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,080
She is Xie Ziyang.

56
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
She is Lao Yang.

57
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
Who are you?

58
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
Shuo Yang,

59
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
I am also Xie Ziyang.

60
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
I am also Lao Yang.

61
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
How could this happen?

62
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
Are you crazy?

63
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
I am not crazy.

64
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
I killed myself.

65
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
I killed myself.

66
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Impossible.

67
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
Lao Yang.

68
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
Okay.

69
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
But are you Lao Yang now?

70
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
You've hidden me for so many times.

71
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,080
You didn't even tell me about the death of yourself.

72
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
What do you want to get?

73
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,080
Why did you do this?

74
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
It's very simple.

75
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
I don't want to let this world

76
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,080
have the second existence of myself.

77
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
So I killed him.

78
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,080
Now that you know about this,

79
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
don't you dare to live.

80
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Do you want to be my wife?

81
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Don't move.

82
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
Lao Yang,

83
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,080
I came here because of you.

84
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
I said I wouldn't take you home.

85
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
If you want to kill me,

86
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,080
come.

87
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,820

Lao Yang!

124

Don't move! Don't talk!

125
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
Don't move!

126
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
I told you not to move!

127
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,080
Wait a minute.

128
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
I'm fine.

129
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,080
I have something to tell you.

130
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
I'm sorry, brother.

131
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
I'm sorry.

132
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,080
I'm really sorry.

133
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,080
I've done a lot of things on this road.

134
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,200
To me,

135
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
literature is difficult.

136
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,240
And I even have to serve you.

137
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,080
Wu Xin, you've always been this way.

138
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,080
Protect anyone above you.

139
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
And especially me.

140
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,040
Have you ever been asking this question?

141
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,040
What exactly do you want?

142
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Right?

143
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:59,360
I brought you to the end of the Qing Ling

144
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:09,360
I want to save my mother

145
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
I know, I know

146
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
But this can't happen

147
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
You listen to me

148
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
Don't talk now

149
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
I will take you out

150
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Everything will end

151
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,360
Everything will be fine

152
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,360
Mom

153
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,360
Wu Xie, Wu Xie

154
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,360
I have been here for three years

155
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,360
I don't know who I am

156
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
I don't know what I am

157
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,360
I feel like walking on a rock

158
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,360
I feel like I'm crazy

159
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
I'm crazy

160
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,360
I know what I want

161
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,360
But for this

162
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,360
I did a lot of bad things

163
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,360
I killed someone

164
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:17,360
I feel like I should stay here

165
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:25,360
You are not a person

166
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
You killed your phantoms

167
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
It's all because of the Qing Dong tree

168
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,360
It's not your fault

169
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
I will take you out

170
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,360
I will take you out

171
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,360
Wu Xie, I appreciate you

172
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,360
You have been with me all this time

173
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,360
Thank you for always giving me up

174
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,360
It's you

175
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,360
You made me feel that I am not a person

176
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,360
You made me feel that I am really good

177
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:07,360
You made me feel that we are brothers

178
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,360
So I have nothing to do with this life

179
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
No

180
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
Don't say it

181
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,360
Yang

182
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,360
Wu Xie, Wu Xie

183
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,360
It's okay

184
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
It's okay

185
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
You said that in the next life

186
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,360
I will be able to meet you

187
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,360
You are such a good brother

188
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
I won't let you die

189
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,360
Are you willing to be my brother?

190
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
I will

191
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,360
It was the more that came here

192
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,360
Before.

193
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,360
Not shorties

194
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,860
Wang Yin

195
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,860
Yang

197
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:06,780
I didn't actually use any of the cards I found in that.

198
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:14,220
He gave my phone back so the card didn't fall down.

199
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,360

323
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,380

327
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,380
Put it down.

328
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,380
Doctor, I have a question.

329
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,380
He's...

330
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,380
What do you mean?

331
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,380
He's affected by the strong brain tumor.

332
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,380
The last one.

333
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,380
He's affected by the tumor.

334
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,380
But it's okay.

335
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,380
He'll be fine in a few days.

336
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,380

337
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,380

I'm telling you.

341
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,380
I don't know what's real or not.

342
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,380
The tumor is so strange.

343
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,380
I feel like we haven't been there.

344
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,380
But it's impossible to see the tumor.

345
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,380
Doctor.

346
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,380
Doctor.

347
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,380

I'll go to the doctor.

349
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,380
Don't talk.

350
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,380
Talk later.

351
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,380
This patient is a specialist in your gallery.

352
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,380
You're in the gallery?

353
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,380

You hit me?

355
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,380
You're so good.

356
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,380
Come here.

357
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,380
You bastard!

358
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,380

00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,380

363
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,380
Right.

364
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,380
This is Yavin.

365
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,380
I asked Xie Yuchen to find a expert in Dongya.

366
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,380
He asked him to translate it.

367
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,380
But there are some words

368
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,380
that even the expert doesn't understand.

369
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,380
But he's probably a good guy.

370
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,380
Say it.

371
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,380

372
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,380

373
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,380
How can you say Long?

374
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,380
He's a good guy.

375
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,380
Why don't you say Long?

376
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,380
I'm not saying it.

377
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,380
I'm not.

378
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,380
You...

379
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,380
You...

380
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,380
You should say it.

381
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,380
You can say it.

382
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,380
Say it.

383
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,380
Don't forget it.

384
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,380
Yang Guo...

385
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,380
is actually a professional in his profession.

386
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,380
He's a senior in the royal family.

387
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,380
He's just a part of the government.

388
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,380
He wants to be the emperor.

389
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,380
He's really good at the court.

390
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,380
He's against it.

391
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,380
He's sent troops to kill him.

392
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,380
So Yang Guo and the general Bu Yan Ji

393
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,380
are escorting the prince to the road.

394
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,380
There are many soldiers on the road.

395
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,380
Yang Guo, you know it.

396
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,380
You just take a look at the little brother.

397
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,380
He's a great guy.

398
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:36,380
Yang Guo broke a arm when he was protecting the prince.

399
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,380
Is that right, Yang Guo?

400
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,380
Of course not, Long.

401
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,380
Not a big deal.

402
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,380
The prince is a great man.

403
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,380
He's a great man.

404
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,380
He's a great man.

405
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,380
He's a great man.

406
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,380
He's a great man.

407
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,380
He's a great man.

408
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,380
He's a great man.

409
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,380
He's a great man.

410
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,380
He's a great man.

411
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,380
He's a great man.

412
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,380
He's a great man.

413
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,380
He's a great man.

414
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,380
He's a great man.

415
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,380
He's a great man.

416
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,380
He's a great man.

417
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,380
He's a great man.

418
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,380
He's a great man.

419
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,380
He's a great man.

420
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,380
He's a great man.

421
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,380
He's a great man.

422
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,380
He's a great man.

423
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,380
He's a great man.

424
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,380
He's a great man.

425
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,380
He's a great man.

426
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,380
He's a great man.

427
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,380
He's a great man.

428
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,380
He's a great man.

429
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,380
He's a great man.

430
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,380
The End

431
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,380
The End
