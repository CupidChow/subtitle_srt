00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Uncle San, why are you here?

澳門先普京娛樂城994466 com

25
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Uncle San, tell me

26
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What happened?

27
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Nothing happened

28
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Go away, kid

29
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Your friend is waiting for you

30
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Uncle San, why?

31
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why don't you tell me the truth now?

32
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I have no blood, uncle San

33
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I have no blood

34
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Uncle San, if you don't go, your friend will be dead

謝謝

79

這東西看著可真金貴啊

80

這是我最重要的東西

81
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
這是我最重要的東西

82
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
要我幫你嗎

83
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
沒事

84
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
沒事

85
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
你方便跟我講講

86
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
近帝的事嗎

87
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
近帝

88
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
是我們整座長白山底下

89
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
一條龍脈的源頭

90
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
龍脈

91
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
對

92
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
龍脈

93
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
這是我們這個村子裡

94
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
祖祖被被流傳下來的

95
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
看著是那樣的高貴和神秘

96
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
但對於我們來說

97
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
是非常可怕的

98
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
正是因為是龍脈的源頭

99
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
那個地方除了源頭那一片

100
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
其他的

101
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
全部是風水凶險的地方

102
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
窮山惡水

103
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
惡鬼地貌

104
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
寸草不勝

105
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
一旦有野獸闖了進去

106
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
便會遭到裡面磁場的干擾

107
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
導致凶性大發

108
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
喪事無感

109
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
最後發瘋致死

110
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
人也是一樣

111
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
即便是僥幸能夠活著回來的人

112
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
也都會多一種怪病

113
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
而且還會傳染

114
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
許多年前

115
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
登山隊曾經取下大價錢

116
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
要找一兵相逃

117
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
但是沒有人敢接

118
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
只要有大價錢

119
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
便會有大價錢

120
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
只要有大價錢

121
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000

Fly

148
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Who is it?

149
00:32:44,000 --> 00:33:01,000
The man is on the move. Anything we should do?

150
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I am a little too concerned about Xie. You should know the effect of that Wu Sanxing.

151
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Wu Xie hasn't recovered yet. He's not going anywhere. You need to stay put.

152
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Shun Zi, on the other hand, is a dubious character. Keep a mile of him and report to me whenever there are new developments.

153
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I understand.

154
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
The game is over.

155
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
The game is over.

156
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000

00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Xiao Ge?

183
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
The game is over.

184
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
The game is over.

185
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
The game is over.

186
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
The game is over.

187
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
The game is over.

188
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
The game is over.

189
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
The game is over.

190
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
The game is over.

191
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
The game is over.

192
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
The game is over.

193
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
The game is over.

194
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
The game is over.

195
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
The game is over.

196
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
The game is over.

197
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
The game is over.

198
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
The game is over.

199
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
The game is over.

200
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
The game is over.

201
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
The game is over.

202
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
The game is over.

203
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
The game is over.

204
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
The game is over.

205
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
The game is over.

206
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
The game is over.

207
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
The game is over.

208
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
The game is over.

209
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
The game is over.

210
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
The game is over.

211
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Having them off.

212
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
They are trying to hide the live.

213
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
If I didn't notice him just on time today,

214
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
you could've used your heads so easily.

215
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
No.

216
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,400
Brother Xiao, what's wrong?

217
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,520
I'm Wu Xie.

218
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,800
Why don't you recognize me?

219
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,880
Chen Jian optimism

220
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,440
Lai Dong

221
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,160
Brother Xiao

222
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,520
Help me

223
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,140
Subscribe

224
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:04,740
A 나가

225
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,640
Space

226
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,840
Xiao Ge, be careful!

227
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,480
Where can you find them?

228
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,720
Hey сегодня,

229
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,360
go save your friends for now!

230
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,540
Oh

231
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:00,720
Xiao Gao

232
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,120
You'll drag three wolves up

233
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

234
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one.

235
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

236
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

237
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

238
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

239
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

240
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Put it down!

241
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Xiao Ge!

242
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Xiao Ge, put it down!

243
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Don't go! Xiao Ge!

244
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Are you hurt?

245
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I'm fine.

246
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
This is not hunting.

247
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Why are you here?

248
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I met a familiar.

249
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
He followed me all the way.

250
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You have a familiar here?

251
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
His name is Zhang Qilin.

252
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
He wears a black dress.

253
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
He's tall.

254
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
He talks to me.

255
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
What you said...

256
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
is that monster.

257
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
You know him?

258
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I don't know him.

259
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
He's not from our village.

260
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
He came here three months ago.

261
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Three months ago?

262
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Brother.

263
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Brother.

264
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Brother.

265
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
You are too insolent.

266
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
This car is too small.

267
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Why are you insolent?

268
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'll give you a ride.

269
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I'm not going to let you go.

270
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I'm not going to let you go.

271
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
You.

272
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I don't want to go.

273
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I'm going to let you go.

274
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I don't want to go.

275
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I don't want to go.

276
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I don't want to go.

277
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I don't want to go.

278
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Why don't you go?

279
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I'll give you a ride.

280
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You are so stupid.

281
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
You don't even have enough money.

282
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
You don't know how far you've been.

283
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
What's wrong?

284
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Don't make me know where the snowy village is.

285
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I'm from the old house.

286
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
The old house is here.

287
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I came back from Beijing to see the house.

288
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Good guy.

289
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You are so noisy.

290
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
You have a car with 18,000 miles of road.

291
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
What's the use of that?

292
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
If it's not snowy, I'll go.

293
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I'm willing to go.

294
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Hurry up and fix it.

295
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You think the fat man is so scared?

296
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I told you,

297
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I was going to the mountain to get some guns.

298
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I told you,

299
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
you are so stupid.

300
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I have money.

301
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I won't give you money.

302
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
You want me?

303
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I'll wait for you.

304
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Stop right there.

305
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Come back.

306
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I'm from the old house.

307
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
The old house is here.

308
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I came back from Beijing to see the house.

309
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
You have a car with 18,000 miles of road.

310
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
What's the use of that?

311
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I'm willing to go.

312
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Hurry up and fix it.

313
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
You have a car with 18,000 miles of road.

314
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
What's the use of that?

315
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I'm willing to go.

316
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Hurry up and fix it.

317
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
You think the fat man is so stupid.

318
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
You have a car with 18,000 miles of road.

319
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
What's the use of that?

320
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I'm willing to go.

321
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Hurry up and fix it.

322
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
You think the fat man is so stupid.

323
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
You have a car with 18,000 miles of road.

324
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
What's the use of that?

325
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I'm willing to go.

326
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Hurry up and fix it.

327
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
You think the fat man is so stupid.
