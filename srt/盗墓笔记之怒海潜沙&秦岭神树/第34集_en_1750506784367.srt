Episode 1

2
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Bu Xing, this longevity tree is a good thing.

3
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Whoever sees it, will not be able to hold it.

4
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You are my brother-in-law, you are my family,

5
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
you are my most trusted person.

6
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I can understand you, even if I want to get the longevity tree,

7
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I never thought of taking you out.

8
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So you...

9
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So you can't forget my brother.

10
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Brother, those brothers

11
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
died in front of me.

12
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There is no longevity tree in this world.

13
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
If you keep being so obsessed,

14
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
you will be killed more.

15
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
If you still treat me as your brother,

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
give me something.

17
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Brother, blood is soft.

18
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We might not die.

19
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't want to see you destroy yourself.

20
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Those soldiers who tried to pull us back,

21
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
just remember once.

22
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's because you have done so much, I have to get the right answer.

23
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Do you know how small the number of times you have?

24
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Even if I am the only one,

25
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I will try to get the chance to get the 100,000,000,000,000,000.

26
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I can't do it.

27
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It doesn't mean I can't do it.

28
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
How can I walk to this position step by step?

29
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What are you relying on? Have you forgotten?

30
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's my smart talent.

31
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
My ability, my ambition.

32
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
To be honest, I can be the general of this general.

33
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But if you give me time,

34
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I can do it.

35
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's a pity that I have made the only mistake.

36
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I just trust you.

37
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I will never think of betraying me.

38
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Join the澳門先普京娛樂場994466.com

39
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's you.

40
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But you don't believe me.

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Please.

42
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I betrayed you.

43
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You want to be a monk or a monk?

44
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Do you know their whereabouts?

45
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Sit down.

46
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Sit down.

47
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I will go with you.

48
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay.

49
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What's wrong?

50
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Master.

51
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I've found the tomb. Where are you going?

52
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Where is your son?

53
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't know.

54
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But this seems to be a new problem.

55
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He often talks about it.

56
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He said he didn't understand what happened on the day of the master.

57
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But he knew that after that day,

58
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
he became a new member of the Chong Chong.

59
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What happened after that?

60
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They entered the tomb again.

61
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Did you find the longevity tree?

62
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't know.

63
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's been a long time.

64
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He knew that Zhang Gaoyuan wouldn't let him go.

65
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Why did they go back to the tomb?

66
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Master, we found it.

67
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Zhang Muxun and Dou Cheng went to the tomb.

68
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
They took all the tombstones.

69
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The tombstones should be in the war.

70
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What do you think?

71
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The boy was missing in the tomb for a few days.

72
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He must have found something.

73
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I told him not to talk to him again.

74
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I brought the gold and silver.

75
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I didn't believe him.

76
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You just took the gun and made a few holes in his body.

77
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He wouldn't say that.

78
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I saw him grow up.

79
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He was a hard-working man.

80
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He was soft and not hard.

81
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You forced him to do that.

82
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He didn't have any benefits.

83
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What should we do?

84
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Give me the green bottle.

85
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes.

86
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Master, here's your letter.

87
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What did she say?

88
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
She wanted me to go home.

89
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Dou Cheng, you've found time to take the green bottle.

90
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm relieved that she's around.

91
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
She's your new sister.

92
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But I know her better.

93
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
She and the commander, and you.

94
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm the most important person.

95
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm sorry, Master.

96
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I shouldn't have suspected her.

97
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But she's so good to you.

98
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Why did she come back to this place?

99
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
She won't give up.

100
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I can't just watch her grow up.

101
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What do you plan to do?

102
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Please take a step.

103
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I didn't think it through.

104
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm not sure what to do.

105
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You can stay here forever.

106
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's nice to stay here forever.

107
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's quiet here.

108
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I can't stay here forever.

109
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'll come back.

110
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
She gave up on you.

111
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Why do you have to do this?

112
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Even if she gave up on me, I won't give up on her.

113
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Don't move!

114
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You bastard!

115
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You really are An Lushan!

116
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You betrayed me!

117
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I can listen to you.

118
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But this won't work.

119
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Even if you kill me, it won't work.

120
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You want to be alone?

121
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Don't you understand?

122
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The so-called longevity tree is a evil tree.

123
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If you continue like this,

124
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
the people who will die will be killed.

125
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You're a big man.

126
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Do you have enough people to die?

127
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Listen to me.

128
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
If I can live forever, I'll make up for my people.

129
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
No!

130
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You'll be even more crazy!

131
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Brother!

132
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
No!

133
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
No!

134
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What's wrong with you?

135
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Don't come over!

136
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're crazy!

137
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You want to kill your brother?

138
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
No!

139
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I told you I won't kill you.

140
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm here to take Qingping away.

141
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You said that you wanted my life.

142
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Brother!

143
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You're dead!

144
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Go with me!

145
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Brother!

146
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
No!

147
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You can't hurt me!

148
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You must do this!

149
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'll take you as my brother.

150
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You take me as your guardian.

151
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
No!

152
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'll explain to you when you get out.

153
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Stop!

154
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Qingping, I'm sorry.

155
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I can only see you here.

156
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I have to let you go with me.

157
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Sit down.

158
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's cold in the mountains.

159
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Don't move.

160
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Stay away from home.

161
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You're bleeding.

162
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What's wrong with your head?

163
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's okay. It's not my blood.

164
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Let's go.

165
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Bu Xun.

166
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What's wrong?

167
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Bu Xun.

168
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Can you tell me what's wrong with you and my brother?

169
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Didn't I tell you last time?

170
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
My brother asked me to find Changsheng's book in the tomb.

171
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
He'll come back to you.

172
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You need to help me find it.

173
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But he said you found it.

174
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I did.

175
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I didn't find it.

176
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I only found some clues.

177
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If the bomb is full of viruses,

178
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
it'll be unimaginable

179
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
if it's blown up.

180
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
In this world,

181
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
if you want to get it,

182
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
you need to pay for it.

183
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Think about it.

184
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What kind of price

185
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
will you pay for Changsheng's book?

186
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
If you become a criminal,

187
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
you'll have no meaning to live forever.

188
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So you and my brother...

189
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You and my brother are enemies.

190
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Where are we going next?

191
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Qingping.

192
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Will you accompany me to the end of the year?

193
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
If we get Changsheng's book,

194
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
we'll be able to get the price of ten thousand.

195
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm laughing.

196
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Do you take responsibility for the wrongs of the bad people?

197
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But...

198
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Pingps,

199
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
喧困,

200
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,720
Aunt

201
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
.

202
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's good.

203
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Don't be so busy.

204
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Cheng has a rabbit today.

205
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Open a wedding for us.

206
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You come here later.

207
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
We are family.

208
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Can't we discuss something?

209
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
We must go this way.

210
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Family.

211
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I treat Bu Xun as my family.

212
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Bu Xun treats me as her family?

213
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But...

214
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
She is my husband after all.

215
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Qing biao,

216
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I know you are not close to Bu Xun.

217
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But I hope we can be together soon.

218
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Bu Xun is in trouble now.

219
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I can't control him.

220
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Bu Xun?

221
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Brother, Bu Xun is a stubborn girl.

222
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But he always treats you as his brother.

223
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I know that.

224
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He won't be afraid of you.

225
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Qing biao,

226
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Bu Xun is my brother.

227
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I don't care about him.

228
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I won't abandon him.

229
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But you must help me.

230
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Help me persuade him.

231
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Take out the things.

232
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We are family.

233
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
We are old and old.

234
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
We are always together.

235
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Okay?

236
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Zhang Bu Xun found out that his wife

237
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
was the spy sent by his brother.

238
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
He knows them so well.

239
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
He knows that Zhang Gaoyuan won't give up Changsheng tree easily.

240
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
He also asked his sister to live with him.

241
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Why?

242
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Maybe Qing biao

243
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
was afraid of what he would do.

244
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Now,

245
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
there is one more point.

246
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
In the diary,

247
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
on the day of the opening of the main office,

248
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
all soldiers were in the capital.

249
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
President Zhang asked Dou Cheng Hu to take the gun to support himself.

250
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But when he came back,

251
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
he disappeared.

252
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
In the next two days,

253
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
he found many times that he didn't find him.

254
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Later, President Zhang explained that

255
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
he was the one who dropped the gun.

256
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But it's so strange.

257
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's obvious.

258
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's a lie.

259
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's so strange.

260
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Everyone has become a funeral priest.

261
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
He didn't change.

262
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Don't you think it's strange?

263
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
There are not many people in the shop who can't eat.

264
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
After that,

265
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
they start to become a funeral priest.

266
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yes.

267
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Stop making trouble.

268
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You think it's a drama?

269
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
No, it's...

270
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
6 days later

271
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Master.

272
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Did my sister-in-law wake up?

273
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yes.

274
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Yes.

275
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Master.

276
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The reaction in Orvo is severe.

277
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Herguard Mr. Veren House is not okay.

278
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Or I will go to Dr. Burnshief.

279
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Alright.

280
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Master,

281
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,160
I was wrong.

282
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,680
I suspect that my sister-in-law

283
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,280
was sent to monitor you.

284
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,320
She's here to monitor me.

285
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,240
What?

286
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,680
Chang,

287
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,360
do you believe in longevity?

288
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,000
No, I don't.

289
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,760
Maybe

290
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,200
we've experienced many things

291
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,000
that we can't understand.

292
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,360
But the truth will never change.

293
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,320
We'll lose our friendship.

294
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,920
We'll get help.

295
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,600
We'll live a life of our own.

296
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,200
Many people

297
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,200
forget their good youth

298
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,920
for the sake of longevity.

299
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,320
They forget the simplest truth.

300
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,160
People

301
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,200
don't have to be close to each other.

302
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,200
Shizuo,

303
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,520
what's wrong with you today?

304
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You should have said something

305
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,480
that I don't understand.

306
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,720
It all happened because of you.

307
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,120
You can't tell people

308
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,960
who did it.

309
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,560
I'm just waiting for you.

310
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,600
If I say what I want to say,

311
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,480
I give up these things.

312
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,960
And you can't blame me

313
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,280
for What I said.

314
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,200
You can't blame me!

315
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,480
I can't blame you!

316
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,160
You should turn yourself in.

317
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:56,160
I hope they can get out of the dream of longevity.

318
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,160
That's all I can do for them.

319
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,160
I can't read the last word clearly.

320
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,160
But I feel there's a secret.

321
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,160
I feel he has a new opinion on longevity.

322
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,160
He seems to agree with his client's existence, but he still doesn't support him.

323
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,160
I guess he was hit by Zhang Gaoyuan and found out about longevity.

324
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
And he doesn't want to tell anyone.

325
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,160
It's because he saw Zhang Gaoyuan and he was chasing him for longevity.

326
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:58,160
And when the military news is exposed, there will be countless people like Zhang Gaoyuan.

327
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,160
He's always considered that he's more afraid of the virus than he is.

328
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:11,160
So he would rather keep this secret forever, even if he confesses to it.

329
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
Come on, let's do it.

330
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Those people are coming down.

331
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
They should be left alone.

332
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
We have the team.

333
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
We should be careful.

334
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
The one who uses the hammer is very weird.

335
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,160
If he has a war, we can't avoid the hammer.

336
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,160
They might not be simple people.

337
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,160
And you forgot that we don't even know who the one who put the fat guy in bed is.

338
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,160
We have no idea how many people he has.

339
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,160
The fat guy is looking for him.

340
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
Tell me what to do.

341
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,160
Do you remember that double-layered tombstone?

342
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,160
It's the key.

343
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,160
You have it in your hand too.

344
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
Don't move.

345
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,160
If you use the technique, the body might be poisoned.

346
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
You'd better prepare the room first.

347
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,160
You're too good.

348
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Where is it?

349
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
It's right here.

350
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
Where?

351
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
It's right here.

352
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
Where?

353
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
There's a knife.

354
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
Let's go. Don't let them catch us.

355
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
Come on, give it to me.

356
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,160
This road leads up to the first floor.

357
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
Go up and see if you know.

358
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
Is it the stone we lost?

359
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
Wait.

360
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,160
Brother.

361
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
New medicine?

362
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,160
Brother, I've found you.

363
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
Why are you here?

364
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,160
How did you come in?

365
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,160
When we entered the misty village, Master Zhai sent me a message.

366
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,160
He sent us a message.

367
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
So I told him.

368
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,160
Gao Ke, you're a good man.

369
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,160
You're a good man.

370
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
So I told him.

371
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,160
Gao Ke, you're a little bit unlucky here.

372
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,160
You made me suffer.

373
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
Brother, look.

374
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,160
I've cleaned this wood.

375
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,160
There's a door in front.

376
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
Door?

377
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Look.

378
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,160
Master Huo, are you okay?

379
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,160
Let's not let the road get on the road and pretend to be a chicken coop.

380
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,160
I don't need to explain the technique to you.

381
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,160
I guess I can't hear your IQ.

382
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,160
You've killed your father and your mother.

383
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
How can you be so scared of talking to you?

384
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
New medicine.

385
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
Is it true?

386
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
Let's go and see.

387
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
Let's go.

388
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
This tunnel is just like the one just now.

389
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
Remember to keep the road safe.

390
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,160
Be careful.

391
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
There are many tunnels in this wood.

392
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,160
It's complicated.

393
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,160
But our direction is right.

394
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,160
It's dark.

395
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,160
Qi, why are you here?

396
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,160
Long time no see.

397
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,160
Who are you?

398
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,160
Why are you pretending to be a cool guy?

399
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
You're wearing a dark eye.

400
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
You're a black blind.

401
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
You're a tough guy.

402
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
Qi, what are you running for?

403
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Right.

404
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Tell me.

405
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
I'm going to eat.

406
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Where?

407
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,160
I said, blind, you have a name.

408
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
You're a ghost.

409
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,160
I can make you blind.

410
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Really.

411
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,160
Hey, buddy, you lost it.

412
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
Look for your mom.

413
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
What?

414
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
Look for your mom.

415
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,160
What?

416
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,160
You're a tough guy.

417
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,160
I've tried.

418
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,160
No.

419
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,160
I think the service is like the non-stop service.

420
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
They're the patrol team.

421
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Fatty, be careful.

422
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,160
This equipment is interesting.

423
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,160
So funny.

424
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
Look for your mom.

425
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,160
Qi, I'm leaving.

426
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Run.

427
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
Run.

428
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
Get out.

429
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
You're a tough guy.

430
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Let's go.

431
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Run.

432
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Run.

433
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,160
They're still outside.

434
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,160
But they can't see the target.

435
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
So they stopped the attack.

436
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
We should be safe.

437
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Dau Stadium

438
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
Hey, blind.

439
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,160
How did you end up in such films?

440
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
These films aren't films.

441
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,160
It was said that there is the Paralympic嘿,

442
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
which illustrates good records.

443
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,360
I designed these bugs to protect the wood.

444
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,680
We accidentally hit it when it came in.

445
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,280
It's legendary.

446
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,520
How is it?

447
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,720
Did you sleep well?

448
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
You helped me to get pregnant.

449
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,520
I only helped you to get a pair of pants.

450
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,440
I also helped you find a coffin.

451
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,120
As for why you're wearing a mask on the wild,

452
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,680
I don't know. I don't want to know.

453
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,760
I'm telling you, don't talk nonsense.

454
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,600
You're looking for the person who's running.

455
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,000
Got it?

456
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,060
What's that?

457
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,280
Bastard!

458
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It must be made by the Tang dynasty.

459
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,000
The Buddha should be from the north.

460
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
This is the copper bar of the war period.

461
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,000
Have you finished exploring the tomb?

462
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
No.

463
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,800
There are three layers of the tomb.

464
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,800
The first layer is a mess.

465
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,800
The third layer was made by Mr. Zhang.

466
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,200
The second layer is the most unimaginable.

467
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
What did you say?

468
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,800
There are three layers of the tomb?

469
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,800
The third layer of the tomb is Mr. Zhang's.

470
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,200
This is the second layer.

471
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Be careful, Fatty.

472
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Don't move, Fatty.

473
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Be careful.

474
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
It's okay.

475
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I'm going to die.

476
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Wait.

477
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,000
It seems that the gold medal has some buildings.

478
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
The West Sea Tomb.

479
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Right?

480
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I think it's the Seven Stars Palace.

481
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Come and take a look.

482
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Come here.

483
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Do you think we can enter from here?

484
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
The location of the tomb is the same as the actual location.

485
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
This is also the tomb of Wang Zanghai, right?

486
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
No way.

487
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Wang Zanghai is from the Ming dynasty.

488
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But this is a tomb.

489
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Mr. Zhang is from the Ming dynasty.

490
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
He also considered this tomb as his own home.

491
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But you said it was quite lively.

492
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Wang Zanghai, Zhang Shizhang,

493
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
all of them are the same.

494
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It's like the Bajie in Beijing.

495
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
All the history of Beijing in Beijing

496
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
is re-enacted together.

497
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It's the same here.

498
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Good.

499
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
No.

500
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
The West Sea Tomb is obviously the tomb of Wang Zanghai.

501
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Is there any connection between these tombs?

502
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
There are 72 tombs in the North Sea.

503
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Wang Zanghai dug so many tombs.

504
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
He was afraid that he would be killed

505
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
and the tomb would be stolen.

506
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So he arranged several tombs.

507
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
There is no way to get rid of them.

508
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
You are right.

509
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Come and take a look.

510
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It seems that this is not a tomb.

511
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It seems that this is not a tomb.

512
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
This is a special form.

513
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
It seems that he wants to add incense

514
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
and then fix the tomb with it.

515
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Fatty, take a break.

516
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Look at this.

517
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
There is a little city outside.

518
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
This must be the old home of Wang Zanghai.

519
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Five cities.

520
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
This tomb is very big.

521
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
It could be the grave of this monk.

522
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
The grandfather of the Seven-Tongus

523
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
brought it home.

524
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Look.

525
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
He fixed a tomb.

526
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It is like the home of the Seven-Tongus.

527
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
It is written as five cities.

528
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But he put so many tombs together.

529
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Wang Zanghai is also a hundred-pointed tree.

530
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Wang Zanghai has been to the Jinling God's tree.

531
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Let me see.

532
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
He really fell into the dinner table.

533
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
He was eating and standing there.

534
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
He was gone.

535
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Come, come, come.

536
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Take a photo.

537
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Wang Zanghai has been to these places.

538
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
They are all tombs.

539
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
We have not been there.

540
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
After we go out, we will study it.

541
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
There must be a fat man's candy shop in here.

542
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Good thing.

543
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Fat man is not looking at his business at all.

544
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
No wonder he is young.

545
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
He is always on the side of business.

546
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Don't talk about it.

547
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Look, I took a photo.

548
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Fat man, hurry up and go out.

549
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I don't want to disturb you.

550
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
But we should find a exit here.

551
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
There is a room here.

552
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Room?

553
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Wait.

554
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Wait.

555
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Wait for me, baby.

556
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Wait for me.

557
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Is there a mechanism nearby?

558
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Yes, there is.

559
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
There is no mechanism.

560
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Pull the door.

561
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
How is that possible?

562
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I said, don't just look at me with your eyes open.

563
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Hurry up and open your hands.

564
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Come on, really.

565
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
You are so blind.

566
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Who are we?

567
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
The museum is very complete.

568
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
No changes have been made.

569
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Qi, do you know anything about this place?

570
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I know a lot.

571
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
But I heard there is no snake and no copper fish.

572
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
The museum is very complete.

573
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
The museum is very complete.

574
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
The museum is very complete.
