00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Master, they've already been caught.

3
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Isn't it better?

4
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm afraid they'll take the radish out and bring it to you.

5
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What about the Xie family?

6
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They've been in a bad mood lately.

7
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They've been shot by Lao Kang.

8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They've been killed by six people.

9
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Lao Kang's bastard,

10
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
thinks the Xie family is gone.

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
After Xie Jiuyue died,

12
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
many people thought the Xie family was not as rich as before.

13
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Even if Xie Yu Chen was there,

14
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
there were a few people who couldn't look at him.

15
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Lao Kang dares to do this.

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Think about it. Why?

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
In the face, this is the face of the Xie family.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
In fact, it's the eyes of the Lao Jiu family.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Fortunately, Xie Yu Chen is not a loser.

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You're right.

21
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This little flower is not for nothing.

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He's a traitor.

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Lao Kang's words made him fight.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Even Lao Kang himself doesn't know where he's going.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He's going to put his temper on the sword.

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The character of the killer Guo Jue,

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Lei Lifeng's method,

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
is definitely a little brother.

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He's clean.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's good.

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
San Yan, you rest a while.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll get you some.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay.

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Let's go.

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Who? Who?

37
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Who?

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,200
Sort of strange

39
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,140
Let's go to bed

40
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,180
Infà¥ˆ

41
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,840
Let's go

42
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,840
The best way to heal wounds is to be careful.

43
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,840
It's better to be a meat stew.

44
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
Stop talking nonsense.

45
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
How's the investigation going?

46
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,840
I'm not doing it.

47
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,840
Tell me your story.

48
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:23,840
The End

49
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,840
Xiao Yang Guo, I've studied the map on the book.

50
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
It should be in Guizhou.

51
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
But how do I remember?

52
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,840
That place seems to be in my grandfather's notebook.

53
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
I've never remembered it.

54
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,840
So you can read the map again?

55
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
No.

56
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,840
I've tried to remember some of his notes.

57
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,840
But most of them are from others.

58
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,840
I've never been there.

59
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,840
These old people are so mean.

60
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
They don't give us food.

61
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,840
If they have the chance, they'll cook and eat.

62
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
They'll give my grandfather some food.

63
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
Anyway,

64
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
I'll find my grandfather's notebook.

65
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
I'll study it.

66
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Hurry up. It's too boring here.

67
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
Hurry up.

68
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,840
Little Master, you've been here for a whole day.

69
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,840
I've never eaten or drank anything.

70
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
I'm not lying.

71
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
Master is really out.

72
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,840
I don't know where he's gone.

73
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,840
I don't know when he'll be back.

74
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
How about you come again some other day?

75
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,840
Master Wu.

76
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Yuchen.

77
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,840
It's been years.

78
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
You've grown up.

79
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,840
You're a snake.

80
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,840
Did you give it to someone else before the Ninth Lord was born?

81
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,840
I've been with him all these years.

82
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,840
To raise me up,

83
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,840
the great family will tell me everything.

84
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,840
Shen Wei Tong is my uncle's relic.

85
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,840
I won't give it to anyone.

86
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Nor will he tell me.

87
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
Uncle San.

88
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,840
What happened that year?

89
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,840
Since your grandfather didn't tell you everything,

90
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,840
it means he didn't want you to know.

91
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,840
I won't tell you.

92
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,840
Grandpa told me

93
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,840
that you went to the West Sea with him.

94
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,840
You found my uncle in the morning.

95
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,840
So you went to the sea.

96
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,840
Finally, you found my uncle's body.

97
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,840
And he had the snake-mei-tong fish in his hand.

98
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
Yes.

99
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
That's it.

100
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
Grandpa said

101
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,840
you guessed my uncle was because of some reason.

102
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,840
One night, he stole the wood.

103
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,840
And the snake-mei-tong fish

104
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
was brought out of the wood.

105
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,840
But grandpa didn't know

106
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
why I did it.

107
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,840
What was the reason?

108
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Or what caused his death?

109
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,840
I don't understand many places.

110
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,840
That's right.

111
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,840
My relationship with Liang Huan is good.

112
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,840
We know each other better.

113
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,840
He has no reason to tell me.

114
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,840
There are too many groups.

115
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,840
The test team is all missing.

116
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
You can't tell me.

117
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,840
But I have something to tell you.

118
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,840
Your uncle is dead.

119
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
He is dead.

120
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
This is a fact.

121
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840
I don't feel pain.

122
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,840
I don't feel pain.

123
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,840
I feel like I'm being stabbed.

124
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Is there any clue?

125
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,840
I promise.

126
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,840
I'll tell you the first time.

127
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Uncle.

128
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,840
The best way to cover the truth is to know the truth.

129
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,840
The longer you take it, the less clues you have.

130
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,840
I'll find out the truth before the clue is completely gone.

131
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,840
I'll tell you the truth.

132
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,840
You've grown up.

133
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,840
You're just like a dog.

134
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,840
I thought you were a dog.

135
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
A dog?

136
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,840
What is he doing?

137
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,840
He's like his father.

138
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
He's a smart boy.

139
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,840
He's smart and smart.

140
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:05,840
I suspect he's never been a red-faced man.

141
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,840
He's good.

142
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,840
He doesn't have to be like us.

143
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,840
Some time later

144
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
Nice.

145
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,220
The Othelia announces

146
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,020
I know

147
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,280
That's it

148
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,580
The Othelia at home

149
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,000
What are you thinking about Gun Labs?

150
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,780
It's covered by brain

151
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,000
Lack of bone

152
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,320
One of the missing brains

153
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,560
Not possible

154
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,080
All right

155
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,220
Turn the m Bread

156
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,220
Turn

157
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,020
With me

158
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:45,700
Un futures

159
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,300
The easiest way is to bring Wu Xie here.

160
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,780
Please.

161
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,100
You mean...

162
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,220
to tie him up?

163
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,220
The car accident

164
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,460
has caught the police's attention.

165
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,980
We should be careful.

166
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
After all, we don't want Wu Xie's life.

167
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,260
It's his secret.

168
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,660
Listen up.

169
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,460
This time, we must be quick.

170
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,940
This is a battle

171
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,300
between time and time.

172
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,700
amyà®®

173
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,940
What kind of bad things are they?

174
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,940
It's better to assemble it rpm the new ones than the old ones.

175
00:14:40,940 --> 00:15:06,060
Weà¸ˆà¸°

176
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,940
Since you're here today, I'll make it clear.

177
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,940
Honey,

178
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,940
when my parents left, I was still a child.

179
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,940
My father entrusted me to you.

180
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,940
You were busy with your work, although you didn't need my food.

181
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,940
But honestly, you didn't spend too much time on me, did you?

182
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,940
Really?

183
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,940
You're so kind.

184
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,940
You're so generous.

185
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,940
You grew up in the north of the West.

186
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,940
What do you think?

187
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,940
You're a housewife.

188
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,940
You've always been a housewife.

189
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,940
You don't know how I've been wronged since I was a child.

190
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,940
I don't know anything else.

191
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,940
You're so bad.

192
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,940
I don't know what bad things you did.

193
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,940
Okay, okay.

194
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,940
My parents' funeral is at your place, right?

195
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,940
I didn't see you when I was a child.

196
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,940
What are you so anxious about?

197
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,940
Uncle S, I've seen the family's accounts.

198
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,940
It was grandpa Six's business loss last year.

199
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,940
Grandma took a lot of money to make it up.

200
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,940
What funeral is there?

201
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,940
I don't know what happened.

202
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,940
But I don't want to take these old debts.

203
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:38,940
But I think my company has been heavily-funded these years.

204
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,940
What do you mean?

205
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,940
The family.

206
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,940
That's what I mean.

207
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,940
I don't care about other people's business.

208
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,940
But my house and my company are my business.

209
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,940
You have no idea, right?

210
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,940
It's your business.

211
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,940
And the shareholders of the Huo family are the treasures sent by the ancestors.

212
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,940
You should give me the money.

213
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:11,940
S, it seems that you're not only greedy, but also a little stupid.

214
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,940
So what?

215
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:20,940
I appreciate your kindness, but it's my business.

216
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,940
You can't fight because of your money, right?

217
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,940
I think this is what the Huo family should be like.

218
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,940
What do you mean?

219
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:35,940
You mean to say that the Huo family is all together?

220
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,940
It should be divided.

221
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,940
What age is this?

222
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,940
And the ancestral ancestral hall?

223
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,940
Even if you want to take the ancestral ancestral hall to Che Daji,

224
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,940
you don't have to be like the Huo family.

225
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,940
Xiaoxiao, what do you think?

226
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,940
Honey, why do you ask her a little girl?

227
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,940
She knows nothing.

228
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,940
What do you think?

229
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,940
Grandma, the Huo family can't be separated.

230
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,940
Well, you're my master.

231
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:18,940
I'm telling you, S, I'll give you one last chance.

232
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,940
I hope you'll be well.

233
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,940
Well, I'll leave the painting here.

234
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,940
You should think about it.

235
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,940
I'm a man with a lot of body.

236
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,940
I'm not good at it, but I don't want everyone to be bad at it, right?

237
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,940
You're so bright.

238
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,940
Bright?

239
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,940
Grandma, why did you become like this?

240
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,940
I'm so confused.

241
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,940
You go out and ask around.

242
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,940
What kind of people have you been in contact with these years?

243
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,940
Especially the people who sell this land.

244
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,940
You mean that there are foreigners in Gaogui?

245
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,940
The Cang Ying is not a phony.

246
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,940
You said that the Yulan is ruined.

247
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,940
You're still a phony.

248
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,940
You should have died sooner or later.

249
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,940
The Cang Ying is a phony.

250
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,940
You're a phony.

251
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,940
You're a phony.

252
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,940
You're a phony.

253
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,940
You're a phony.

254
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,940
You're a phony.

255
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,940
You're a phony.

256
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,940
You're a phony.

257
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,940
You're a phony.

258
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,940
You're a phony.

259
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,940
You're a phony.

260
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,940
You're a phony.

261
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,940
You're a phony.

262
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,940
You're a phony.

263
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,940
You're a phony.

264
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,940
So?

265
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,940
They're both pajamas.

266
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,640
Well then...

267
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,940
The person who invented this version of the D Guard's honor

268
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,940
What do you want to show here?

269
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,800
Camel,

270
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,980
butter,

271
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,380
hahaha

272
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,580
This is perfect for you

273
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,540
Good

274
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,820
You what?

275
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,940
Is there a village in China?

276
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,940
If there is, then no one can go there.

277
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,940
Didn't you say that your grandfather didn't go there?

278
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,940
Is it reliable?

279
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,940
If it is reliable, then we won't know.

280
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,940
Wait.

281
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,940
Little Third Master, you asked for these things.

282
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,940
You're going to make a joke?

283
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,940
Yes. Didn't I tell you last time that I found a cold?

284
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,940
Wait, didn't you say that you were going to make a joke?

285
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,940
Yes, that's right. I said that I was going to make a joke.

286
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,940
But there is a possibility that I will make a joke.

287
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,940
That's why I went there.

288
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,940
Didn't you say that you won't make a joke?

289
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,940
Why didn't you listen to me?

290
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,940
Then my grandfather asked him to marry his wife.

291
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,940
Did he listen to you?

292
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,940
But now he still wants to marry her.

293
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,940
By the way, you also reminded me of my uncle.

294
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,940
He is already a lot of years old. Don't be romantic.

295
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,940
You can't be romantic for years.

296
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,940
Well, you two are still in the same boat.

297
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,940
I won't say anything.

298
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,940
Say something, Third Master.

299
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,940
Third Master.

300
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,940
Well, Third Master, he is not with me.

301
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,940
Wait for me to introduce him to him.

302
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,940
Okay?

303
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,940
Okay, Pan Zi.

304
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,940
Then take some time to prepare everything I want.

305
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,940
Okay, no problem.

306
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,940
Pack it for me.

307
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,940
Third Master, we almost got caught.

308
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,940
You have to take care of this.

309
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,940
See?

310
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,940
How can I take care of it?

311
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,940
I grew up, I always take the rope and put it in my house.

312
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,940
So are those things ready?

313
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,940
Yes, ready.

314
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,940
Take care of the original price.

315
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,940
I want to go in first.

316
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,940
What do you say?

317
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,940
The ring.

318
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,940
Don't count yours.

319
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,940
The name of the letter is considered.

320
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,940
I see.

321
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,940
It's gone.

322
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,940
Let's become friends.

323
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,940
See you at the palace.

324
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,940
See you cards are visited.

325
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,940
See you, Third Master.

326
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,300
Was Bode Golden in a secretada from Kerem, where he doesn't go there

327
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,340
I believe the company affected by theime

328
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,100
That was meinem

329
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,140
Till Birthday

330
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,140
I'll do my best.

331
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,140
If anything happens,

332
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,140
let them contact me for a new phone call.

333
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,140
Okay.

334
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,140
Oh, right.

335
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,140
The new man's name is

336
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,140
half of the new man's family.

337
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,140
He can rely on the new man.

338
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,140
There will be no

339
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,140
a guy who can climb the ladder

340
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,140
without a horse or a horse.

341
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,140
Let's fix the car before we leave.

342
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,140
Hello, Xiu Xiu.

343
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,140
Nothing.

344
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,140
I just wanted to ask

345
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,140
how you've been looking

346
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,140
at the house I've been looking for the past few days.

347
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,140
I've picked a good few.

348
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,140
When are you free?

349
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,140
Let's go to the body together.

350
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,140
Sure.

351
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,140
You can go there tomorrow.

352
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,140
I'll be with you.

353
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,140
I haven't made up my mind yet.

354
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,140
It's okay.

355
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,140
Think about it.

356
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,140
Xiu Xiu.

357
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,140
Do you have anything to say to me?

358
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,140
No.

359
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,140
I just miss you.

360
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,140
I just want you to take me

361
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,140
to see the house.

362
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,140
It's okay.

363
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,140
By the way,

364
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,140
you...

365
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,140
No.

366
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,140
I just think that

367
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,140
I really admire you.

368
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,140
Xiu Xiu.

369
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,140
Mrs. Youqian.

370
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,140
My grandma called me.

371
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,140
Let's go back to the room.

372
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,140
Goodbye.

373
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,140
Go and check on the Huo family.

374
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,140
What's going on lately?

375
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,140
Huo family has been

376
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,140
in trouble lately.

377
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,140
But it shouldn't be

378
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,140
a big deal.

379
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,140
Grandma, you're looking for me?

380
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,140
Yes.

381
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,140
It seems that you've grown up.

382
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,140
What you said to Xie Zi

383
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,140
just now is that you've endured it.

384
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,140
Grandma, I'm not a child anymore.

385
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,140
You're not a child.

386
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,140
You should be a grown-up.

387
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,140
Right?

388
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,140
You're going to do

389
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,140
the grown-up thing.

390
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,140
Yes.

391
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,140
But you're still confused.

392
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,140
Look.

393
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,140
You and Xie Zi

394
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,140
are often playing together.

395
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,140
You don't want to be with our old man.

396
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,140
That's how it all happened.

397
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,140
But there's something

398
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,140
that you should know.

399
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,140
Xie Zi is an outsider.

400
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,140
She can't interfere

401
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,140
with our Huo family.

402
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,140
I...

403
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,140
I...

404
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,140
I know.

405
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,140
Good to know.

406
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,140
I know.

407
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,140
What if...

408
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,140
in the future,

409
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,140
you have a good family,

410
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,140
whatever it is,

411
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,140
you should keep our Huo family well.

412
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,140
I know.

413
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,140
The Huo Laosi who stayed in Changsha

414
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,140
wanted to make a place for himself.

415
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,140
But he didn't know how to do it.

416
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,140
There was another suicide killer

417
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,140
who was involved in the two-way deal.

418
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,140
Huo Laosi was especially

419
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,140
involved in the two-way deal.

420
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,140
But Huo Laosi didn't help him.

421
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,140
So Huo Laosi

422
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,140
asked someone else to help him.

423
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,140
He got the money.

424
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,140
But he didn't think

425
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,140
that he would die

426
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,140
when he was involved in the two-way deal.

427
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,140
He was in trouble.

428
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,140
His men were arrested.

429
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,140
He was also arrested.

430
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,140
Huo Laosi?

431
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,140
I heard that Huo Laosi

432
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,140
was going to give up on his son.

433
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,140
How could he

434
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,140
get into the situation so quickly?

435
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,140
I heard that

436
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,140
he was in a hurry to get out of the case.

437
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,140
Oh, right.

438
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,140
He has another crime.

439
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,140
A criminal.

440
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,140
I heard that his men

441
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,140
are helping the world

442
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,140
with the chaos.

443
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,140
No wonder you are so naive.

444
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,140
Shall we

445
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,140
help them?

446
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,140
Help Huo Laosi

447
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,140
to offend Mrs. Huo?

448
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,140
I feel a little bit confused.

449
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,140
But

450
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,140
Mrs. Huo

451
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,140
must be very eager to help her.

452
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,140
The ancient stone

453
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,140
can only be re-built.

454
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,140
Huo Laosi

455
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,140
is not a good man.

456
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,140
If uncle can live

457
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,140
in this house,

458
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,140
he will only be good to her.

459
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:39,660
Glimpu

460
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,460
EDM

461
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,740
Come on, manies.

462
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,740
Let's go.

463
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,740
The End

464
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,740
I tell you, this pan must be...

465
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,740
Uncle San made him beg you for a match.

466
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,740
He thought that you don't have money to buy equipment in the end.

467
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,740
And he didn't want to do that.

468
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,740
It's too expensive to do that.

469
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,740
Yes, you can't afford to go there.

470
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,740
You can't get anything out of the building.

471
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,740
You deserve it.

472
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,740
Yes.

473
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,740
It's too expensive.

474
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,740
Or I wouldn't sell my car.

475
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,740
Or I'd sell my gold cup.

476
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,740
But it's worth it.

477
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,740
After all, we have a secret recipe.

478
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,740
And this car is not a second hand.

479
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,740
I tell you, Tianzhen.

480
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,740
You can't think of anything else.

481
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,740
We are in a big wood.

482
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,740
We have a few small weapons.

483
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,740
You don't need to use them.

484
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,740
Uncle, it's not a big deal.

485
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,740
So selfish.

486
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,740
Okay.

487
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,740
Let's find a place to stay.

488
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,740
I'm tired of this.

489
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,740
I'll have to pay for it.

490
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,740
I don't even have time to drive.

491
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,740
Miss Xiao from Caimuogu.

492
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,740
She's carrying a bag.

493
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,740
Look, Caimuogu.

494
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,740
Let's eat the mushroom.

495
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,740
The mushroom is ready.

496
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,740
And the vegetables are ready.

497
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,740
Master, have a look.

498
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,740
Okay, I'm ready.

499
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,740
Sit down.

500
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,740
Let's go.

501
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,740
A many money.

502
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,740
You can't sleep in this car.

503
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,740
I'm a little tired.

504
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,740
I'm tired.

505
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,740
I'm tired.

506
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,740
I don't have money.

507
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,740
I don't have money.

508
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,740
I don't have money.

509
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,740
I don't have money.

510
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,740
I don't have money.

511
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,740
I don't have money.

512
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,740
We have a secret recipe.

513
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,740
We can buy it.

514
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,740
You took so much money from me.

515
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,740
Master, I'm sorry to bother you.

516
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,740
No, thanks.

517
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,740
I need to ask you something.

518
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,740
Is the dense fog village far from here?

519
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,740
The dense fog village?

520
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,740
I don't know.

521
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,740
The dense fog village is a dense road.

522
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,740
The fog is a dense fog.

523
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,740
There is no lake beside the village.

524
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,740
Lake?

525
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,740
The dense fog village has a lake.

526
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,740
I don't know which one you are talking about.

527
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,740
There is a mountain beside the lake.

528
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,740
A mountain?

529
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,740
I remember now.

530
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,740
Don't tell me you want to know about this.

531
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,740
You may not know.

532
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:41,740
But the dense fog village is the thing that Yuan Dato did in the imperial guards' time.

533
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,740
It's gone long ago.

534
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,740
What?

535
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,740
The village is gone.

536
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,740
Is the village moved?

537
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,740
Move?

538
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,740
Master, you may ask.

539
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,740
The year Yuan Dato died,

540
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,740
the situation was very chaotic.

541
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,740
The life of the people is so miserable.

542
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,740
The people are so poor.

543
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,740
The military and the foreigners

544
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,740
are not good enough for the people.

545
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,740
It's over.

546
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,740
At that time, in our city,

547
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,740
business is the best.

548
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,740
It's called the dense fog village.

549
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,740
Only the dense fog village

550
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:34,740
has people who go in and out of the dense fog village.

551
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,740
There is a person named Zhang Dazhu in the dense fog village.

552
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,740
He has a few good things in the dense fog village.

553
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,740
How good?

554
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,740
I don't know.

555
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,740
I haven't seen it.

556
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,740
I heard there is a single-seater railway.

557
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,740
Do you know what is it?

558
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,740
It's a dead end.

559
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,740
But Zhang Dazhu doesn't know it.

560
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,740
He just took it as a few dollars.

561
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,740
He is satisfied.

562
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,740
But later, I heard that Zhang Dazhu's village

563
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,740
has a wooden roof.

564
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,740
I don't know which dynasty

565
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,740
has such a big one in the wood.

566
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:21,740
The whole wood is full of good things.

567
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,740
It's all...

568
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,740
But the village is in the mountains.

569
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,740
It's far away and hard to walk.

570
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,740
Even the trainman

571
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,740
only goes there for two or three months.

572
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,740
But the trainman went there this time.

573
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,740
He was so scared.

574
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,740
Brother, where did they go?

575
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,740
Maybe they went to the wooden roof.

576
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,740
They went to find treasures.

577
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,740
The children and the old man should be at home.

578
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,740
They must have gone to the heat.

579
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,740
They can't go so clean.

580
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,740
There is no one left.

581
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,740
Uncle, where is everyone?

582
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,740
Dazhu, Dazhu!

583
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,740
Dazhu!

584
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,740
32!

585
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,740
Xiaohua! Xiaobao! Xiaobao!

586
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,740
Uncle!

587
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,740
What are you doing?

588
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,740
What are you doing?

589
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,740
What are you doing?

590
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,740
What are you doing?

591
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,740
Xiaofang!

592
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,740
Is anyone there?

593
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,740
Someone is back!

594
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,740
Dazhu! Xiaobao!

595
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,740
Uncle!

596
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,740
Come on, come on, come on,

597
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,740
try the Beijing wine.

598
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,740
Master, please continue.

599
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,740
The village's village's old man and old woman

600
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,740
have all gone.

601
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,740
They can't find them.

602
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,740
Later, they heard that

603
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,740
the village's people

604
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,740
were all taken by the old man.

605
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,740
They were taken by the old man?

606
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,740
That's all they said.

607
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,740
Maybe the village's people

608
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,740
moved things in the old man's house

609
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,740
and got the mechanism.

610
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,740
Then they took the whole chicken and goose.

611
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,740
The chicken is here, the chicken stewed mushrooms.

612
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:21,740
Look, the old man is not like that.

613
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,740
I heard that there was a passerby

614
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,740
who killed the villagers.

615
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,740
Right, madam?

616
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,740
I have a question.

617
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,740
Why did the chicken and the mushroom separate?

618
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,740
Isn't it a small chicken and a mushroom?

619
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,740
The mushroom should be put here.

620
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,740
I'm so mad!

621
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,740
It's okay, sit down.

622
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,740
Later, someone said

623
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,740
they were taken by the soldiers and the villagers.

624
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,740
There was a general named Zhang

625
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,740
who was passing by the village.

626
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,740
I remember his name.

627
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,740
His name was Zhang Gaoyuan.

628
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,740
I said, how old were you then?

629
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,740
You don't know.

630
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,740
I told him, he was so mad.

631
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,740
Not me, not me, you.

632
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,740
Didn't you hear your father say that?

633
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,740
Yes, yes.

634
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,740
Did anyone else go to this dense village?

635
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,740
Yes.

636
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,740
Didn't you ask about the old tomb in the storehouse?

637
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,740
But in the end, they didn't find the tomb.

638
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,740
Later, they said it was all blind.

639
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,740
The duck's nest is not in the tomb.

640
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,740
Besides, no one in the village

641
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,740
sold the treasure in the tomb.

642
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:43,740
I think there is nothing in the duck's nest.

643
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,740
It's just a ghost.

644
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,740
Anyway, no one went there.

645
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,740
I think they've been killed by the forest.

646
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,740
No one left.

647
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,740
Come, drink.

648
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,740
But the story of the Great Grandmother is so good.

649
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,740
We really got it.

650
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,740
The Great Grandmother

651
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,740
The food is so delicious.

652
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:51,740
Tianzhen, did you say that they said there are a few people in the Great Grandmother?

653
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:56,740
At least we know that the Mingwu Village is a wild village.

654
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,740
And the villagers in the Mingwu Village found a tomb.

655
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,740
Then it's closed.

656
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,740
There must be at least 100 people in the village.

657
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,740
Why did they disappear without a trace?

658
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,740
In that era, nothing happened.

659
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,740
The military law and the bandits were the villagers.

660
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:18,740
The lives of the people were like grass.

661
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,740
So many people, the villagers of one village

662
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,740
moved the tomb.

663
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,740
Fine, the fat man is here again.

664
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:32,740
I'm now more concerned about the single-digit iron ring.

665
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,740
I'm not concerned about the single-digit iron ring.

666
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:40,740
In history, the single-digit iron ring was used by the Han Dynasty.

667
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:45,740
But at that time, the single-digit iron ring didn't have the right to be free.

668
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,740
It was just a special honor.

669
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,740
If this ancient tomb really was made of single-digit iron ring,

670
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,740
it might be a real Han Dynasty.

671
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,740
I don't know which Han dynasty's bull is lying in the tomb.

672
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,740
I don't know which Han dynasty's bull is lying in the tomb.

673
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:38,740
The End
