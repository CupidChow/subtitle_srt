1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:23,440
Based on the

2
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,560
Is it Wuxie?

3
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,060
Not him. We have been watching him.

4
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,860
Ning, Wuxie is by the mission of yours.

5
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,860
There's no place for the sentiments.

6
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,440
I didn't.

7
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,360
When you were at the tomb of Ocean, you were in danger.

8
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,860
Indeed, you were able to get out because of him.

9
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,200
Father, he saved my life.

10
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,620
I didn't even thank him.

11
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,320
Ning, you're a good kid.

12
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,620
But softness is your weak link.

13
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,200
A Chinese saying suits the situation.

14
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,120
Yi Jiang Gong Cheng, Wang Gu Ku.

15
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,620
My child, what we do will alter the fate of the mankind.

16
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,120
And it is with endless danger.

17
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,620
If you can't control it, it may well ruin all of us.

18
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,200
So don't be soft with Wuxie anymore.

19
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,620
The fate of the human being.

20
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,620
Father, why exactly are we doing it?

21
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,620
I didn't mean to tell you the truth so early.

22
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,620
But...

23
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,620
Do you remember the question I asked you?

24
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:54,620
If we could live forever, maybe we can find a way to make people immortal.

25
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,620
No.

26
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,620
That's impossible.

27
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,620
I used to think it is human delusion.

28
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,620
But in the course of studying the silk book and the snake-eye-coupper fish,

29
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,620
I found a clue, and maybe immortality is not impossible after all.

30
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:22,620
In one word, remember, we are fighting for the destiny of human race.

31
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,620
We may not achieve the result in our lifetime, but we are sacrificing for a great cause.

32
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,620
So, don't be distracted by the trivial matters.

33
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,620
Take advantage point.

34
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,620
Separate yourself from these things and people.

35
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,620
Yes, I understand.

36
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,620
I'm sorry.

37
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,620
I just finished my day of the gold.

38
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,620
But tomorrow is the day to die.

39
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,620
Why is he there?

40
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,620
My mind is full of the snake-eye-coupper fish.

41
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,620
I saw him at the auction today.

42
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,620
I was also very surprised.

43
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,620
I wanted to tell you, but I forgot.

44
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,620
Didn't you say it well?

45
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,620
Do you have to think about it carefully?

46
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,620
I really forgot.

47
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,620
But I don't know how he found out about the auction.

48
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,620
But I can say that he came here for the sake of the god.

49
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,620
Will he affect our actions?

50
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,620
I don't think so.

51
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,620
I'm more worried about the people in the main room.

52
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,620
I'll send the information to your email.

53
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,620
I don't think so.

54
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,620
The place in the main room is a Zou.

55
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,620
But not a guest.

56
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,620
It's a American.

57
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,620
Okay.

58
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,620
I'll rely on you tomorrow.

59
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,620
Don't worry.

60
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,620
It seems that this is where the Hengdelei Museum is hidden.

61
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,620
I think it's not fake.

62
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,620
Is it something they are doing at the auction?

63
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,620
So, the snake-eye-coupper fish is also on it.

64
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,620
I don't think so.

65
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,620
I don't think so.

66
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,620
I don't think so.

67
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,620
I don't think so.

68
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,620
I don't think so.

69
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,620
Go back, now.

70
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,620
Don't worry, I won't get caught.

71
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,620
Commander.

72
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,620
Grand Marshal,

73
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,620
is these 100 rubles worth?

74
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,620
Yes, bla?

75
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,620
What's your plan?

76
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,620
What's your plan?

77
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,620
Look, they have three cars.

78
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,620
How can they steal the snake-meat-tongue from the middle of the car?

79
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,620
There's still a good enemy behind it.

80
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,620
Then we have to use RPG to buy it.

81
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,620
RPG is where we buy it.

82
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,620
Maybe we need to use air-conditioning.

83
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,620
Wait, wait, wait.

84
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,620
Wait.

85
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,620
What do you mean?

86
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,620
Car.

87
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,620
This...

88
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,620
This is a car.

89
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,620
What do you mean?

90
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,620
Car.

91
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,620
This...

92
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,620
They have three cars.

93
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,620
Maybe they have guns.

94
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,620
Can you eat them?

95
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,620
You can't.

96
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,620
Snake-meat-tongue is in front of you.

97
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,620
You don't want it.

98
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,620
Madam, there's a motorbike following us.

99
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,620
Do you want me to handle it?

100
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,620
No.

101
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,620
Fatty, stop chasing.

102
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,620
We have to go back to the hotel.

103
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,620
We need to borrow money.

104
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,620
We need to borrow money to take the snake-meat-tongue.

105
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,620
How many times can you pay for it?

106
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,620
There are many snakes, there are many insects.

107
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,620
Let's go back to the hotel.

108
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,620
Wait, wait, wait.

109
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,620
Madam, the motorbike didn't catch up.

110
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,620
Find a short cut in the front.

111
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,620
I'll sell another house.

112
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,620
When I have no place to live,

113
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,620
I'll move to Hangzhou to live in your house.

114
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,620
Eat your food.

115
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,620
You're not going back to the hotel.

116
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,620
Why are you still following me?

117
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,620
Yes, I'm going back to the hotel.

118
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,620
This is the way back to the hotel.

119
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,620
That's right.

120
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,620
You said you wanted me to follow them.

121
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,620
Who knows?

122
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,620
I'm not going to go back to the hotel.

123
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,620
Go.

124
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,620
Are you all right?

125
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,620
What are you doing?

126
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,620
Don't touch me.

127
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,620
Can I get up by myself?

128
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,620
What?

129
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,620
Fatty.

130
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,620
What are you doing?

131
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,620
Don't touch me.

132
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,620
Can I get up by myself?

133
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,620
Fatty.

134
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,620
What are you doing?

135
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,620
Don't touch me.

136
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,620
Something happened.

137
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,620
What are you doing?

138
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,620
What do you mean?

139
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,620
What's going on?

140
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,620
Something happened.

141
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,620
Something happened.

142
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,620
What do you mean by following me?

143
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,620
Who are you?

144
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,620
Who are you?

145
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,620
What are you going to do?

146
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,620
It's just a light.

147
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,620
We can leave.

148
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,620
Let's go.

149
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,620
Get in the car.

150
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,620
Get in the car.

151
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,620
Go.

152
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,620
Mr. Xia.

153
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,620
It's time to start.

154
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,620
What's up?

155
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,620
What's up?

156
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,620
Turn around.

157
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,620
This one.

158
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,620
Your left.

159
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,620
It's him.

160
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,620
Good.

161
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,620
What's up?

162
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,620
O.S. Yang.

163
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,620
Stop!

164
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,620
What's going on?

165
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,620
What's going on?

166
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,620
I'm going to the next place.

167
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,620
Yes, sir.

168
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,620
What's going on?

169
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,620
Let's have a good time.

170
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,620
Go up there and see.

171
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,620
Yes, sir.

172
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,620
Go!

173
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,620
Go!

174
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,620
Follow me.

175
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,620
Open the door.

176
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,620
I'm going to the next place.

177
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,620
Yes, sir.

178
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,620
Go!

179
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,620
Come here.

180
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,620
Go to the next place.

181
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,620
Follow me.

182
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,620
200 meters to the right.

183
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,620
Hurry up!

184
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,620
Go!

185
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,620
Go!

186
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,620
This is the Nenchi Island.

187
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,620
Don't worry.

188
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,620
What do you mean?

189
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,620
Go!

190
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,620
You saved them.

191
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,620
This is a good deal.

192
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,620
You can go.

193
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,620
Go!

194
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,620
Come here.

195
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,620
Go!

196
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,620
Stop!

197
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,620
Go!

198
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,620
Stop!

199
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,620
Stop!

200
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,620
Stop!

201
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,620
Stop!

202
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,620
Stop!

203
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,620
Stop!

204
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,620
Stop!

205
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,620
Stop!

206
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,620
What are you kidding me?

207
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,620
What the hell?

208
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,620
Stop!

209
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,620
Stop!

210
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,620
Stop!

211
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,620
What a great car!

212
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,620
Look, they are chasing us.

213
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,620
Do you want to beat them?

214
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,620
No.

215
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,620
Go!

216
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,620
Where are you going?

217
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,620
I'm going to the next place.

218
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,620
Go!

219
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,620
Go!

220
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,620
Go!

221
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,620
Go!

222
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,620
Are you hitting me?

223
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,620
Mom, are you hurt?

224
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,620
Are you crazy?

225
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,620
Is there anything wrong with your car?

226
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,620
Is there any insurance on the car?

227
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,620
Fatty, let's go.

228
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,620
Go!

229
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,620
Mom, go back to the country.

230
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,620
I'll pay you back.

231
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,620
Mom, you're so cool.

232
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,620
I'm so mad at you.

233
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,620
It's so fun.

234
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,620
What would you like to eat?

235
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,620
Anything.

236
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,620
Fatty, what's the difference between you and the other two?

237
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,620
I don't know.

238
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,620
It's a good day.

239
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,620
Stop talking nonsense.

240
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,620
Let's follow them.

241
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,620
One ticket, one ticket, one ticket.

242
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,620
Stop!

243
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,620
Fatty, stop!

244
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,620
What are you doing?

245
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,620
What's going on?

246
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,620
The traffic is too far.

247
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,620
What's the matter?

248
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,620
Why are you driving in the parking lot?

249
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,620
Where is it?

250
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,620
Forget it.

251
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,620
Let's go to the hotel.

252
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,620
Then let's go back.

253
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,620
Where do you think this thing is?

254
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,620
What's going on?

255
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,620
Wu Xie.

256
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,620
You meet again?

257
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,620
What do you mean?

258
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,620
I knew it was you.

259
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,620
I saw you and Xiu Xiu.

260
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,620
Why are you here?

261
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,620
Oh, right.

262
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,620
And what's going on with your two hands?

263
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,620
Who is the one who is so crazy?

264
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,620
One is Xiao Ge.

265
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,620
Xiao...

266
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,620
Our Xiao Ge.

267
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,620
Xiao Ge?

268
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,620
How do you know Xiao Ge?

269
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,620
We knew each other a long time ago.

270
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,620
Don't be jealous.

271
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,620
Who is the other one?

272
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,620
There is one more.

273
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,620
It's a black blind man.

274
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,620
This is awesome.

275
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,620
You know black blind man?

276
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,620
No matter if it's daytime or night,

277
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,620
you have to be strong.

278
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,620
You've been married a few times.

279
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,620
Although Xiao Ge is good,

280
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,620
he is also the boss.

281
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,620
Is this snake-eating fish

282
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,620
the one you lost before?

283
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,620
That's right.

284
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,620
We were cheated by them

285
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,620
by a short letter.

286
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,620
How do you know

287
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,620
the snake-eating fish is here?

288
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,620
You told me that.

289
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,620
That's right.

290
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,620
We have prepared for the carjacking

291
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,620
as you instructed

292
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,620
to let him take the copper fish.

293
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,620
But there was an accident.

294
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,620
It was snatched by someone else.

295
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,620
Why do we know about that person?

296
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,620
He was worrying how much, so no idea.

297
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,620
But he definitely knows Wu Xie.

298
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,620
As I was chasing, Wu Xie intercepted me.

299
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,620
He must know that man.

300
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,620
Bring Wu Xie to me.

301
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,620
Yes, sir.

302
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,620
Wu Xie is an unpredictable person.

303
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,620
He seemed to wield an amazing magnetic field

304
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:19,620
that makes things around him become unpredictable

305
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,620
and turned to his advantage.

306
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:29,620
I think it's time to meet the third generation of the Ru family.

307
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,620
Sir, I will start walking.

308
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,620
You called me three times.

309
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,620
You said that Qiu Dekou sold snake-meat and fish here.

310
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,620
So I came here.

311
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,620
Qiu Dekou?

312
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,620
No wonder Ning is here.

313
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,620
Is that Commander Hengdelie?

314
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,620
That's Qiu Dekou.

315
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,620
Yes, Qiu Dekou's name is Kalkas Hengdelie.

316
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,620
He is the Chinese name he gave himself.

317
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,620
Wait a minute.

318
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,620
You said that Commander of the Museum is Qiu Dekou.

319
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,620
That's not right.

320
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,620
Qiu Dekou is a half of the same as Master of the Museum and Master of the Xie.

321
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,620
Yes.

322
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,620
And isn't Qiu Dekou your boss?

323
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,620
He came to China very early.

324
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,620
My grandfather told me about it.

325
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,620
And he told me that Master of the Museum

326
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,620
had a big mouth on Qiu Dekou's hand.

327
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,620
My grandfather knew Qiu Dekou.

328
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,620
So I think that's not right.

329
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,620
He looks too young.

330
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:50,620
Do you think that Hengdelie is Qiu Dekou's son or grandson?

331
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,620
Aren't foreigners all like my son's grandson?

332
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,620
Is that right?

333
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,620
It's the same person.

334
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,620
Qiu Dekou is good at ordinary and long-distance talk.

335
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,620
So he has a good relationship with some Chinese people.

336
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,620
He met some local rich people.

337
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,620
He started to sell their fame to foreigners.

338
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,620
He took the opportunity to buy and sell them.

339
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,620
And then the business got bigger and bigger.

340
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,620
He slowly started to get along with the old wine cart.

341
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,620
The most famous thing in the past was Master of the Museum.

342
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,620
In 52, he taught Chinese to be the best.

343
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,620
Qiu Dekou set up a bureau before he left.

344
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,620
He used the fortune of many years to use the low deposit

345
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,620
to collect a lot of documents.

346
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,620
Among them, there was Master of the Museum.

347
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,620
But after he got on the ship,

348
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,620
he sent a telegram to the local police.

349
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,620
He leaked all the documents of the old man.

350
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,620
He made the old man run away.

351
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,620
He was a good man.

352
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,620
Master of the Museum was still hiding in the mountains.

353
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,620
He slept with his body for a few weeks.

354
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:56,620
That's the old man's case.

355
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,620
He's not a good man.

356
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,620
I've never heard my grandfather say this.

357
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,620
I've never written his name on the notebook.

358
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:15,620
Your grandfather was deceived by the foreign culture.

359
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,620
He almost died.

360
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,620
I told him I wouldn't tell my grandson if you wanted me.

361
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,620
Go back.

362
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,620
Come on.

363
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,620
She deceived our Hitomi.

364
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,620
You saved the reward.

365
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,340
This is where I'm looking – running.

366
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,380
They don't know me.

367
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,280
They'll probably get us nowhere.

368
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,620
We probably won't.

369
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,620
He doesn't think it's me.

370
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,620
Besides, he doesn't know us.

371
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,620
很好

372
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,540
Is that hisviet?

373
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,940
Wow

374
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,520
Ma Jiang Hu Le 2

375
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:37,100
Shang Jin Nui Wang, Xun Bao Huang Jin Cheng, Zhao Caimeng, Shang Jin Chuan Zhang

376

00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,840
Reward many opportunities, hurry up and join

378
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,560
Aom Shimp Jin Yule Cheng 994466, come

379
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,380
Aom Shimp Jin Yule Cheng 994466, come

380
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,380
Aom Shimp Jin Yule Cheng 994466, come

381
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,380
Aom Shimp Jin Yule Cheng 994466, come

382
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,380
Aom Shimp Jin Yule Cheng 994466, come

383
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:17,900
I say, Miss An Ning, we are all comrades who have been through life and death

384
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,620
Why are you tied up here?

385
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,580
Among the three of you, you have the most eyes

386
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,940
If you want to play with flowers, I will shoot you

387
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,820
If anything happens to Wu Xie, I will shoot you

388
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,540
We are all innocent children, you misunderstood us

389
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,700
We won't do that

390
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:46,420
An Ning, where do you want to take us?

391
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:50,460
I will know when I get there

392
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,420
I advise you to hand over the snake and the snake-meat-fish

393
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:59,180
I know you people, you are so hard to deal with

394
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:05,660
You can't do it, but you are most afraid of being hurt by your own brothers

395
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,140
If you are in trouble, I won't dare to protect you

396
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,780
It's moving, it's moving, I didn't move, you scared me

397
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,220
Snake-meat-fish is really not on us

398
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,580
Didn't you search for it when you helped us?

399
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,980
Where is it?

400
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,100
Snake-meat-fish is on our comrades

401
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,860
I guess it is on the plane now

402
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:37,100
An Ning, you should know that it is in the air

403
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,860
You should let us go

404
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,580
You stole my boss' stuff two hours ago

405
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,020
Now tell me this

406
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,740
You are doing it under the ground

407
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,300
The origin of the ancient island is obviously not clear

408
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,860
But you are now our servants

409
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,980
Okay, if you want snake-meat-fish, you can't do it

410
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,980
We can talk about it

411
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,980
What do you want to talk about?

412
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,980
What do you want to talk about? I want this one!

413
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,980
Run!

414
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,980
Let go!

415
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,980
Xiaohua!

416
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,980
Go! Go!

417
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,980
There on the way, let me show you

418
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,620
The ups and downs of总守

419
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,860
Look over there, water, good looking

420
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,420
Water!

421
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,700
Mae천 hè

422
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:16,460
Muddedこれ

423
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,420
Here we go.

424
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,140
But will you start fishing now?

425
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,100
Okay.

426
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,700
Go, go.

427
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,060
We'll soon get hold of the car.

428
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,900
Give me my sandals.

429
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,660
Yes.

430
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,900
OK.

431
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,100
Bye.

432
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,660
Go.

433
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,420
And what are you going to buy for Wuxian?

434
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,540
My belly burnt from Star madman.

435
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,540
It's okay.

436
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,860
Where's Wu Xie?

437
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,060
Isn't he with you?

438
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,140
No.

439
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,180
I told him to be with you.

440
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,820
Didn't you see my eyes?

441
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,020
You...

442
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,260
What should we do now?

443
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,820
Let's go back to the hotel and think of a way to save Wu Xie.

444
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,700
Okay.

445
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,300
You go that way.

446
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,820
This way! This way!

447
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,140
Run this way!

448
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,140
This way! This way!

449
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,580
Look!

450
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,140
They dare break us!

451
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,140
begin

452
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,140
Mara!

453
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,220
Sir, the man you asked for.

454
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,140
Let's know hospitality song

455
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,340
I should have called you Mr.Hendery

456
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,340
Or Mr.Chiu DeKao

457
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,340
Just call me Chiu DeKao

458
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,340
When we asked in Chinese

459
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,340
I think it's very close to using this name

460
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,340
Why lie to me here?

461
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,340
Stop hitting

462
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,340
Why is there such a coincidence?

463
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,340
Are you the one who sent it?

464
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,340
So you saw it, you want to see it?

465
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,340
Snake and copper fish?

466
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,340
Yes

467
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,540
You know what?

468
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,540
I've been studying it for so many years

469
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,540
I only know that its early childhood

470
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,540
Is in Ming dynasty

471
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,540
What do you think?

472
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,540
You want to investigate the Gang of the Sea?
