00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Should I call you Mr.Hendriy or Mr.Chudekao?

3
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Just call me Chudekawa.

4
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
When we were talking about Chinese, I think it's very close to the name.

5
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Why did you lie to me?

6
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Stop pretending.

7
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why are there such coincidences?

8
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You sent it, right?

9
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So you saw it. You want to see it?

10
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Snake-mei Tongyu?

11
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes, Snake-mei Tongyu.

12
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Do you know?

13
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I've been studying it for so many years.

14
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I only know its early days are in Ming Dynasty.

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What do you think?

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You want to investigate Wang Zanghai?

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Young people are always on fire.

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Of course, when it comes to Snake-mei Tongyu,

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
it's like the West Sea is the sea.

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But the Snake-mei Tongyu in the West Sea is still in the sea.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Where else is it?

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I want to know how Snake-mei Tongyu is found.

23
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Didn't Xie Lianhuan find it?

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Xie Lianhuan is a smart person.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But when he passed away,

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
he's almost the same age as you are now.

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's a pity.

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You know Xie Lianhuan?

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes.

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I know Wu Sanxin,

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and I know Xie Lianhuan.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do you want to know what's going on?

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm your grandfather,

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and he's his old friend.

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He's much more than you know.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Before the liberation,

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
China was on fire,

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and it was strong,

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and evil, and cruel.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
In order to survive,

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
some people used the name Qi

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
to pay for food.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Your old Wu Family is one of seven.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
At that time, your grandfather was very young.

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
LENG consumer

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Wu Xie Lianhuan

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,500
This is a disaster.

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This is a bloodline view.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,760
it's all going to end

50
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,720
It's gonna kill me

51
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
I can't continue.

52
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
Please.

53
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,720
The first round of the Olympic Games is coming up.

54
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
Please.

55
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,720
The most exciting game in the world is

56
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
the Ma Jianghu.

57
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
The Ma Jianghu 2.

58
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
The Queen of the Rally.

59
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
The Golden City of the Treasure.

60
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
The Cat of the Rally.

61
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
The Golden City of the Rally.

62
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
The Super High Poverty.

63
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
The Best of the Rally.

64
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
The Best of the Rally.

65
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Please join the Olympic Games.

66
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,720
The first round of the Olympic Games is coming up.

67
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Please.

68
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
No.

69
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Don't talk nonsense.

70
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
Look at your old man.

71
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
It's not convenient to push.

72
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Please don't go.

73
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
My brother and I,

74
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
we can go together.

75
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
What's the point of him?

76
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,720
Just stop him.

77
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,720
You and my son are still talking.

78
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Maybe we should leave

79
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
when we have time.

80
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,720
You should teach him more.

81
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
My sister.

82
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
I only have a box.

83
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
I can live in the West.

84
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Can you talk to him like that?

85
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
When he was running away,

86
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
you were still eating the food in your mother's belly.

87
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,720
My ancestors said

88
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,720
the blood was not enough.

89
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,720
There is blood in the blood.

90
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
We can't eat it.

91
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
If we don't go,

92
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
we will be beaten.

93
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
You dare to talk?

94
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
It's not a big deal.

95
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,720
You are the same when you are a mute.

96
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
This is called

97
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,720
being a good person and being a bad person.

98
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
Dad,

99
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
give me some face

100
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,720
in front of the teeth.

101
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,720
The fat blood is very small.

102
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
Last time,

103
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
your second husband

104
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
was digging in Luoyang.

105
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
It's still very hot.

106
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
I don't know what's going on.

107
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Are we going to scare him?

108
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
I'll go first.

109
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
You follow me.

110
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Take the rabbit behind you.

111
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
You don't need to go down.

112
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
I'm not a mute.

113
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
I can go there.

114
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
You are looking for trouble for me?

115
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
You are making me angry.

116
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Don't.

117
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
I'll give you a gold knife.

118
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
I don't want you to touch it.

119
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
I can do it myself.

120
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
You can't even push it.

121
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
You just stand outside

122
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
and pull the rabbit's tail.

123
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
We are under the blanket.

124
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
You just pull it up.

125
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
I won't.

126
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,720
No,

127
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
I'll give you a big treasure later.

128
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Grandpa,

129
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
did you put on your clothes?

130
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
I don't know.

131
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
You stay up there.

132
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Pull the rope.

133
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
You bastard!

134
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
Why did you shoot me?

135
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Dad!

136
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Grandpa!

137
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
Dad!

138
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
I've told you so many things.

139
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,720
It seems that I really treat you as a friend.

140
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
It's a pity.

141
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
He didn't expect

142
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
that he really treated his friend.

143
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
But he cheated the war-fighter

144
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
that he and his brother had been given to him.

145
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
He almost sent him to prison.

146
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
After the war,

147
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
when I met Wu Sanxing,

148
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
I wanted to see

149
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
the young dog Wu Laogou.

150
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,720
But you are much more ambitious than your grandpa.

151
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Do you understand?

152
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
About the name of the goddess,

153
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
between the two of you,

154
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
the fairy of the mystery,

155
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
Wu Sanxing and I were far away.

156
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
Even the dog Wu Laogou

157
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
felt more common.

158
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
At that time,

159
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
I was the chief of the New York University

160
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,720
of the Museum of Art and Art.

161
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
I wanted to collect more

162
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Chinese relics.

163
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
How can you say such a shameless thing

164
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
so openly?

165
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Your uncle is the person

166
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
I am in China.

167
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
He helped me a lot.

168
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
For example,

169
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
he took me to the aunt

170
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,720
who went to the country to play.

171
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Your uncle is a genius.

172
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,720
He is just like your grandpa's

173
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
eyes and mouth

174
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
and has a short legs.

175
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
We found him very successfully

176
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,720
and entered the snow tomb.

177
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,720
But it's a pity

178
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
that we had to

179
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
take out

180
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
some of the strength

181
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
in the tomb.

182
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
What's even more pitiful

183
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
is that the aunt was so greedy

184
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
that she couldn't go in anymore.

185
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
But

186
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
this time, the action

187
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
has set a good foundation

188
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
for our cooperation.

189
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
Not long after,

190
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
I heard that the ancient team

191
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
was going to discover

192
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
the rare sea-dwellers.

193
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
So I let Wusan Xing

194
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
enter the ancient team.

195
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
Your uncle

196
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
successfully entered the ancient team

197
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
and found the location of the sea-dwellers.

198
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
In the ancient team,

199
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
you secretly went down

200
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
the tomb

201
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
the day before the tomb.

202
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
But he was found by Xie Lian Huan.

203
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Xie Lian Huan followed the tomb.

204
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
You probably guessed it too.

205
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
I couldn't.

206
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Why?

207
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
They both had a fight

208
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,720
and Xie Lian Huan died.

209
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
How did he die?

210
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
Xie Lian Huan died

211
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
and was taken by the snake.

212
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,720
Then your uncle

213
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
handed him to Xie Jia

214
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
to forgive them.

215
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
Then

216
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,720
he asked for the real bear

217
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
and avenged Xie Lian Huan.

218
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
In Xie Jiuye's hand,

219
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,720
he sold the snake to me.

220
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
Nonsense!

221
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
But your uncle

222
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
used some means

223
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
to make it important.

224
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
But I really sold the snake

225
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,720
to you.

226
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,720
If you want it,

227
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,720
I can not only sell it to you,

228
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
but also sell it to you.

229
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
Why do you want to kill me?

230
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
I don't believe it.

231
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
What's the reason for lying to you?

232
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
An Ning,

233
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
where are you taking me?

234
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Don't you think your boss is weird?

235
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
He called me here

236
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
to tell me about my family's ancestors?

237
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
An Ning,

238
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
what's your relationship with your boss?

239
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Don't you think he's weird?

240
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
He's not good at keeping his appearance

241
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
and age.

242
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
An Ning.

243
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,720
An Ning,

244
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
get a better hand.

245
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
I'm with you.

246
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
I'm with you.

247
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
I'm with you.

248
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
I'm with you.

249
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
I'm with you.

250
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
I'm with you.

251
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
I'm telling you,

252
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
I'm not being weird.

253
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
I was too anxious.

254
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
But you keep your conscience.

255
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
When you were in the sea,

256
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
you saved us.

257
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
But I, Fatty and I

258
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,720
were all in the same room to save you.

259
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
I didn't do anything to hurt you.

260
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
But look at what you're doing now.

261
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
What's going on?

262
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
An Ning.

263
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
An Ning.

264
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
Brother.

265
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,720
Don't ask me.

266
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
I'm not leaving.

267
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
An Ning.

268
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,720
How could you come to face me?

269
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
I always thought

270
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
we've been through so much.

271
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Even if we're friends,

272
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
we're friends.

273
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
But you...

274
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
You didn't hesitate

275
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
when I was hurting you.

276
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Did you make a mistake?

277
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
You're finally here.

278
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
Tell me.

279
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
What?

280
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
It's okay.

281
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
I know

282
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
you don't know

283
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
what language to face me.

284
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
But it's okay.

285
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
If you're willing,

286
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
you can tell me

287
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
everything you know.

288
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Okay?

289
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
An Ning.

290
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
An Ning.

291
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Brother, hurry up.

292
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
An Ning.

293
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Help me out.

294
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Why did you change me?

295
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
An Ning.

296
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Madam, please.

297
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
How could you do this to me?

298
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Say something, An Ning.

299
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
An Ning.

300
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
When will you return

301
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
the snake-meat-tongue?

302
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
When will you be released?

303
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
How could I know

304
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
where the snake-meat-tongue is?

305
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
Besides,

306
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
I know it's impossible to tell you.

307
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
Then wait and see.

308
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
An Ning.

309
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
An Ning.

310
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Let me out.

311
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
Anyone here?

312
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
Anyone here?

313
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
The wound is deep.

314
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
Don't move.

315
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
How is it?

316
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Is it okay?

317
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
It's okay.

318
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
What should we do now?

319
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
We need to find

320
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
the fox-eater now.

321
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Yes.

322
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
Now,

323
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,720
we can only ask Xiao Yu to help us.

324
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Who?

325
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Xiao Yu?

326
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,720
Do you know Xiao Yu?

327
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
Yes.

328
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
Brother Xiao Hu and Xiao Yu

329
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
are very good friends.

330
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
No, that's a family.

331
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
We're family.

332
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
I'll contact you.

333
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
No need.

334
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
Xiao Xiao.

335
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Yes?

336
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
Use my computer

337
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
to contact me.

338
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
Okay.

339
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,720
Hurry up.

340
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
An Ning.

341
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
An Ning.

342
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
An Ning.

343
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
An Ning.

344
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
I'm flying.

345
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:34,900
The

346
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,720
idiotol without delay just enough for always

347
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
He still lies

348
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,700
in the dark without celebrity

349
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,720
I'll kill you right now.

350
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Calm down,

351
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,280
and then come out and get out.

352
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,120
Basically, it's just a lifetime.

353
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,800
Anyway, for us, this is the case.

354
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,840
We'll go in, then I'll know the life,

355
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,200
and then I'll have another partner

356
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,240
to take over the target.

357
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,120
But for this case,

358
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,080
basically, I'll just leave it in the snake

359
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,800
after I know the life.

360
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
I'll go alone.

361
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,080
No.

362
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,920
No, you still have wounds.

363
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,080
I didn't mean that.

364
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,920
I'll leave it in the snake.

365
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,240
The key is that you'll leave the wound

366
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,000
and go in.

367
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,120
You won't succeed, you know?

368
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,840
What should we do?

369
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,360
Xiaohua has wounds on her.

370
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,840
We must save Wu Xie.

371
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,680
Yes, you can't go with me.

372
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,280
I'll go then.

373
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,520
I'll take you with me.

374
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,480
I'll go.

375
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,480
You can't even hit me.

376
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,560
Okay, it's solved.

377
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,520
Go ahead.

378
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,040
Let's start your performance.

379
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:11,740
Want to speak with me �同

380
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,960
Ma'am, what is the matter?

381
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,100
You drunk!

382
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
The first time I saw a man with a gun.

383
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
I thought he was a man with a gun.

384

I thought he was a man with a gun.

I thought he was a man with a gun.

I thought he was a man with a gun.

00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,720
I thought he was a man with a gun.

392
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,720
I thought he was a man with a gun.

I thought he was a man with a gun.

397
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
The first time I saw a man with a gun.

398
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,720
I thought he was a man with a gun.

I thought he was a man with a gun.

Sveta!

405

Come on!

406
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,580
How is it? Can you leave now?

407
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,480
Yalha!

408
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,640
Yalha!

409
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,840

411
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,800
What's is so scary?

412
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,680

00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,880
Gu Xie.

418
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,800
How is it? Are you okay?

419
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,520
I'm fine.

420
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,280
What are you talking about?

421
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,120
What's wrong?

422
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,840
You didn't get any better?

423
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,680
Let me see.

424
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,840
Go.

425
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,040
I told you.

426
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,680
We have no problem with Xiao Ge.

427
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,840
Let's go.

428
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,240
What if they catch us?

429
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,440
Let's go together.

430
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,840
Xiao Ge.

431
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,800
Xiao Ge.

432
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,040
We're leaving.

433
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,000
Let's go.

434
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,720
We're running out of time.

435
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,880
Gu Xie.

436
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,360
You don't know Jian Bao.

437
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,000
Let's go.

438
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,560
It's okay.

439
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,040
Xiao Ge.

440
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,480
What are you doing here?

441
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,320
What a voice!

442
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:35,920
Hello?

443
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,360
Hello, I'm Xiao Ge.

444
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,080
Hello.

445
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,360
Hello.

446
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,080
Hello.

447
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,720
Sister, are you okay?

448
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,560
I'm fine.

449
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,800
What do you need me for?

450
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,760
I asked you,

451
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,040
do you know who it was?

452
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
You promised to let us go.

453
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,520
Click on it and let everyone know.

454
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,520
I'm not injured this time, I won't lose to him.

455
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,520
Where are we going?

456
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,520
To the Beben airport.

457
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
That's all.

458
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
Jiao Yu came here?

459
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,520
They found us?

460
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,520
They're chasing us?

461
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
Two more kilometers.

462
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
Fatty, here you go.

463
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
Here you go.

464
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
It's okay.

465
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
Sit tight.

466
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,520
I'll be back.

467
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
Wu Xin,

468
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
you can leave.

469
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
Stars are in the sky,

470
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,520
the sky is clear,

471
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,520
you and I will be together.

472
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,520
What do you mean?

473
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
It's the stars.

474
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
Stars are in the sky, right?

475
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
Stars?

476
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
I said they don't know how to do it.

477
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,520
What he said here should be stars.

478
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Stars?

479
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,520
It should be the stars in the snow.

480
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
Stars are in the south.

481
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,520
Stars are in the north and big stars

482
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,520
the 17 castles.

483
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,520
Icepack and markers.

484
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,520
Two stars are in the south and big,

485
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,520
the big star is in the north and south.

486
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
No,

487
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,520
the airport is in the south,

488
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
the north...

489
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,520
Uncle, don't you mean

490
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,520
they say we should go to the rocket team?

491
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
The airport is far away.

492
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,520
It's a great plan

493
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,520
to get off.

494
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,520
But what about time?

495
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,520
Hurry up!

496
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
The next sentence is

497
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
The day when the sky is clear,

498
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,520
The time is the most important.

499
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,520
Sky...

500
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,520
Xu Rishu

501
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,520
is also called the day when the sky is clear.

502
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
The day when the sky is clear is December 21st,

503
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,520
December 12th.

504
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,520
Isn't that December?

505
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,520
December...

506
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,520
December 12th, December 21st, December 22nd?

507
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,520
Wow!

508
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
It's been a minute and a half since the last time.

509
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,520
It shouldn't be.

510
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,520
The previous sentence has been mentioned as a continuation.

511
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
The next sentence can't be repeated.

512
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
So the day when the sky is clear

513
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,520
shouldn't be the point of action.

514
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,520
Is it December 21st?

515
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,520
It's December.

516
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,520
There is a festival in Hubei County.

517
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,520
It's called Chuan Tian Festival.

518
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,520
I went to play there when I was a kid.

519
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,520
That festival has been held every year on November 21st.

520
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
And there is a legend written there.

521
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,520
It's called the day when the sky is clear.

522
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,520
So the day when the sky is clear

523
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,520
should be the number 21.

524
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,520
21?

525
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,520
Is it 21?

526
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,520
Is it 21?

527
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,520
I think it should be the 21st station.

528
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
Fatty.

529
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
Go to the train station.

530
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
Wu Xie, your uncle is coming to the west.

531
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
He said you shouldn't go to the train station.

532
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
There is a festival there.

533
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
I'll go to the train station to find Shere.

534
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
The new day is coming.

535
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
The big brother is here.

536
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
It's so bright.

537
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
The three words are so good.

538
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,520
Shere.

539
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,520
Shere.

540
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,520
Shere.

541
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,520
Shere.

542
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,520
Shere.

543
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,520
Fatty, when did you start eating?

544
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,520
I have to eat on the way.

545
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
What do you know?

546
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,520
Shere, bring something.

547
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
Why is he not here?

548
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,520
Is he...

549
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,520
I don't know.

550
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
That's it.

551
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,520
Hurry up.

552
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,520
What are you doing?

553
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,520
Why are you so uneducated?

554
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,520
You want to take something away if he's not here?

555
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,520
I'm sorry.

556
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,520
You are...

557
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,520
You call me brother.

558
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,520
You are brother?

559
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,520
You are brother.

560
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,520
What?

561
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,520
Which one of you is Wu San Xing's nephew?

562
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,520
It's me.

563
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,520
He asked me to come to you.

564
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,520
What does it have to do with him?

565
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,520
Where is he now?

566
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,520
You are Wu Qian.

567
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,520
Good.

568
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,520
You look much better than your uncle.

569
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,520
Yes.

570
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,520
Wu Xie.

571
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,520
They are coming after you.

572
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
That...

573
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,520
Look, brother.

574
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,520
We really have to trouble you this time.

575
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,520
What are you doing?

576
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,520
Do you think I'm the one who's missing?

577
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
No.

578
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,520
You are...

579
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
No.

580
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
Brother.

581
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,520
We really have to trouble you this time.

582
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
Someone is chasing us.

583
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,520
You are the only one who can help us.

584
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,520
Wu San Xing.

585
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,520
He hasn't contacted me for more than ten years.

586
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,520
He's been asking me for trouble.

587
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,520
You are talking about the old man.

588
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,520
Okay.

589
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,520
I've prepared the boat.

590
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,520
Thank you, brother.

591
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,520
Okay, I'll go now.

592
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,520
The boat is ready.

593
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
Let's go.

594
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,520
Let's go.

595
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
Let's go.

596
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Let's go.

597
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,520
Let's go.

598
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
Let's go.

599
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
Let's go.

600
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,520
Let's go.

601
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
Let's go.

602
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Let's go.

603
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,520
Let's go.

604
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,520
Let's go.

605
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
Let's go.

606
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Let's go.

607
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,520
Let's go.

608
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Let's go.

609
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520
Let's go.

610
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,520
Let's go.

611
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,520
Let's go.

612
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
Let's go.

613
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
Let's go.

614
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,520
Let's go.

615
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Let's go.

616
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,520
Let's go.

617
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,520
Let's go.

618
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
Let's go.

619
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
Let's go.

620
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,520
Where are those guys?

621
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,520
I don't understand foreign language.

622
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,520
I'm telling you, don't bully Chinese people.

623
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,520
Where are they?

624
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,520
Who?

625
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,520
Four young people.

626
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,520
I don't have any people here.

627
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,520
Chase them.

628
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
Go.

629
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,520
Wait.

630
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
What?

631
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,520
All the boats here are not key.

632
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,520
If you don't believe me, you can search.

633
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
Hurry up.

634
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
Go to the next port.

635
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,520
This road is a bit difficult.

636
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,520
But we have a little brother, a black blind, and a uncle.

637
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,520
Although your uncle is a little mysterious, he is a little bit self-confident.

638
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,520
He is a big brother.

639
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,520
But it's so good, right?

640
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
Good.

641
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520
Do you want to eat?

642
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Don't eat.

643
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,520
Don't eat.

644
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
A Ning has arrived at the port just now.

645
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
Then we have to take care of this snake.

646
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,520
No.

647
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,520
A Ning is not a person who likes to eat.

648
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,520
You are a little bit naive again.

649
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,520
Brother Xiaohua.

650
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
Boss Chuan.

651
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,520
There is no room for a boat nearby.

652
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
We want to go down.

653
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,520
Why do you want to stop the boat?

654
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,520
Brother Xiaohua.

655
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,520
We will definitely wait for us at the next port.

656
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,520
We can only go down from here.

657
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
But...

658
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
I don't like A Ning.

659
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,520
Xiaotian really likes it.

660
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,520
Boss Chuan, listen to the boat.

661
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,520
Here.

662
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
Thanks.

663
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,520
Thanks.

664
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,520
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

665
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,520
Hey, you bastard!

666
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,520
He's sharp and massive.

667
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,320
How's the prisoner?

668
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,360
He's been half way down there.

669
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,480
Okay, I am changing my mind.

670
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,240
Mr.ning, alles okay?

671
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,160
Anything's okay.

672
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,920
I'm going in the car, and you tell me,

673
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,920
my guess is alright and your test is okay.

674
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,840
Is that true?

675
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
No.

676
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,440
It's just a littleastre that's linked our relationship.

677
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,840
Mr.ning.

678
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,840
I asked you where you went when you were back in Hangzhou.

679
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
He said you went abroad.

680
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,840
Then I came here to check the clues of the Snake Eye.

681
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,840
But I saw you and Qiu Dekou together.

682
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,840
Why didn't you tell me the clues of the Snake Eye?

683
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,840
I didn't tell you anything about Uncle San.

684
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,840
I just don't want you to be involved.

685
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,840
Okay.

686
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,840
Then I ask you.

687
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,840
What is your relationship with Qiu Dekou?

688
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,840
Kid.

689
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
Uncle San warned you.

690
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,840
I have nothing to do with Qiu Dekou.

691
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,840
I have nothing to do with you.

692
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
Understand?

693
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
It has nothing to do with me.

694
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
You and Qiu Dekou are still in the bottom line.

695
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,840
You are a national property.

696
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,840
You have no right to self-cultivate.

697
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,840
Do you really have a cooperation with those snakes?

698
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,840
Uncle San.

699
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,840
I don't want to get involved in some things.

700
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,840
But they are in front of me.

701
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,840
And they are all related to you.

702
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,840
I can't ignore them.

703
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,840
Uncle San.

704
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,840
If you are me,

705
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,840
many people will tell you that you are a bastard.

706
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840
And you have experienced many things.

707
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,840
You can't deny it.

708
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Can you not ask or not?

709
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
Uncle San.

710
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,840
Since we have time to face the situation,

711
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,840
why do you still keep your mouth shut?

712
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
Kid.

713
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,840
Let me tell you.

714
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,840
If someone says that you are Uncle San,

715
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,840
you are a bastard.

716
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,840
This person is either a liar

717
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,840
or afraid of you.

718
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Remember that.

719
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,840
Uncle San, what's wrong with you?

720
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,840
When you were little,

721
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,840
you used to have Uncle San every day.

722
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,840
Uncle San is like this.

723
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,840
Uncle San is like that.

724
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,840
Uncle San is like this.

725
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,840
Uncle San is like that.

726
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,840
Uncle San is like that.

727
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,840
Uncle San is like that.

728
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,840
How cute you are.

729
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Now you are grown up.

730
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
You are a young man.

731
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,840
You dare to fight with Uncle San, right?

732
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
You even suspect Uncle San.

733
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,840
Uncle San,

734
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,840
I have never suspected you.

735
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
In this world,

736
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,840
you are my most trusted person.

737
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,840
But I have too many things in my mind now.

738
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,840
No one can give me the answer.

739
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,840
Only you.

740
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,840
So I don't want you to lie to me.

741
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,840
Anni is the prisoner of the Qiu Dekou.

742
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,840
He and I were scared of the sea-leaf wood.

743
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,840
He knows everything.

744
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,840
But I almost died in the dark.

745
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,840
And I know that you went to the sea-leaf wood.

746
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,840
Did you tell them?

747
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,840
Sea-leaf wood

748
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,840
is the reason why you will never

749
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,840
know the truth in your life.

750
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,840
You know it well.

751
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,840
Uncle San doesn't want to say anything.

752
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,840
Is it because of Wen Jin'an?

753
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,840
This matter

754
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,840
has to be told to the old man.

755
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Oh, right.

756
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,840
That year, Changsha

757
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,840
sent a saying

758
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,840
called

759
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,840
the blood of the earth

760
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,840
is the gold.

761
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,840
Have you heard of it?

762
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
I have heard of it.

763
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,840
But I don't know

764
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,840
what exactly is going on.

765
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,840
The earth is covered with blood.

766
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,840
The earth is covered with blood.

767
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,840
This wood

768
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,840
is called the blood of the earth.

769
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
The people who can hide it

770
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,840
are all looking for a way to grow up.

771
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,840
They can't keep it.

772
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
They are like the emperor.

773
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
Of course,

774
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,840
it's all a legend.

775
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,840
But the blood of the earth

776
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,840
is too dangerous.

777
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
There are few people who can live

778
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
without it.

779
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,840
It's hard to survive, Xiaozi.

780
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
How hard it was

781
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,840
for the old Wu family to survive?

782
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,840
I want to cry.

783
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,840
The three people of the old Wu family

784
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,840
came to the battle country to fight.

785
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,840
The old man

786
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,840
lost his life.

787
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,840
The battle country

788
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,840
was cheated by the Qudakao.

789
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,840
Remember this man,

790
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
Qiu Zekao.

791
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
Later,

792
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,420
he contacted a group of

793
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,840
Chinese civil servants.

794
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,840
He was so grateful to the bad things.

795
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
You think about it.

796
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
You are a third-in-law.

797
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,840
You work with him.

798
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
Sometimes, I even want

799
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,840
to find a chance to kill him.

800
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,840
Liangzi

801
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,840
was in the prison in the Piaozi.

802
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,840
Later,

803
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,840
I was so worried

804
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,840
about the location of the blood of the wood.

805
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,840
I should be around the ghost village

806
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,840
in the Piaozi.

807
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,840
I didn't expect

808
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,840
the Xie Lianghuang and Qiu Dekao

809
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,840
I met.

810
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,840
Have I told you?

811
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,840
They look alike.

812
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,840
You haven't?

813
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,840
Third Uncle,

814
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,840
you mean

815
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,840
Xie Lianghuang

816
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,840
who worked with Qiu Dekao?

817
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,840
Because

818
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,840
you are very similar to him,

819
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,840
everyone thinks it's you.

820
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,840
The End

821
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,840
The End

822
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,840
The End

823
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,840
The End

824
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,840
The End
