Episode 9

00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Chop and Councill fire

3
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,320
This time, it's me again, I came to see them.

4
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,600
Just a Kalau activity,

5
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,440
but they worked a few huge regiments,

6
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,680
really strong.

7
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,280
And they found these rhyme writers

8
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,280
and historiographers here.

9
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,680
How many bottom to go and see?

10
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,120
Take a seat.

11
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,660
Under

12
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,500
tone

13
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,280
poem

14
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,920
I admire women.

15
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,840
She's soURring.

16
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,020
Come

17
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,840

18
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,320
Now if he begs

19
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,740
attaches the death dessis.

20
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,280
Besides

21
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,460
a good old boy

22
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,460
You're not telling the truth, are you?

23
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,460
Look at what you said.

24
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,460
Mr. Xiaowan.

25
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:10,460
I'm sincere and I want to make friends with you.

26
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:16,460
Didn't you just say that we are united and united?

27
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,460
We are in a united and united relationship.

28
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,460
This...

29
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,460
I...

30
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:29,460
I'm telling the truth.

31
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,460
Fine.

32
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,460
Let's go.

33
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,460
Come on, let me rub it for you.

34
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,460
It's done.

35
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,460
Come on, let me rub it for you.

36
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,460
It's done.

37
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,460
Xiaowan, the water is gone.

38
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,460
Are we getting farther away from the river?

39
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,460
The road is down.

40
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,460
Will it be directly in the center of the river?

41
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,460
I'm so worried, Miss An Ning.

42
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,460
You're flying to the ocean and you're here to torture me.

43
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,460
You should know the details of this tomb.

44
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,460
I don't know how to see you with your eyes closed.

45
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,460
Miss An Ning, don't ignore me.

46
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,460
I know that I'm dead.

47
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,460
Do you think I can believe it?

48
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,460
You were prepared for this when you were in the sea.

49
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,320
Unknownס is unknown área in the new Eid

50
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,200
How come they are so exploitation and read about such event on their own?

51
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,200
It's not like your usual behavior.

52
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,360
This time I'm an easy-going person.

53
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,500
I haven't planned to come here but myself.

54
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,100
I was surprised that there is some big fish.

55
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,100
You mean the big team is behind?

56
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,100
No.

57
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,100
Are you happy?

58
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,100
The road is blocked.

59
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,100
Is this the way to the exit?

60
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
This road should be left when the repair is over.

61
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
It's used to push the car and push the stone.

62
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,100
Then follow this road and go to the tomb.

63
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Thank you.

64
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,100
Do you know which way is the entrance and which is the exit?

65
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,100
Anyway, there is only one way.

66
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
It doesn't matter how you go.

67
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,100
Where is the entrance?

68
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
Is there a hidden entrance here?

69
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,100
Where did you get this sound from?

70
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,100
What is this?

71
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Don't talk.

72
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,100
Where is the entrance?

73
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,100
Where is the entrance?

74
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
Where is the entrance?

75
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,460
Existence

76
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,860
Kruglow

77
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,380
isse

78
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,080
To Riyashy

79
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,140
You'll know only when you die.

80
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,380
To do business, we need GIASTA!

81
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,720
But if IT IS wished to get unlimited life and get everyone from the side side,

82
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,440
It's impossible.

83
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,060
We will have to do everything grudgingly and eagerly.

84
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,940
But later regained lives.

85
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,940
We will need it painfully!

86
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,620
We go first, then film the film!

87
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,520
Good.

88
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,000
Brilliant.

89
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,820
None of my friends wore the disguise of Giani.

90
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
What?

91
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
It's like the stone wall in front of the Palace.

92
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,820
Someone saw the shadow of the Palace and the eunuch in the Qing Dynasty.

93
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,820
The scientists have verified that it was a matter of the site.

94
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,820
Someone recorded their shadow.

95
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,820
They didn't release it in the specific period.

96
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
Some were sound, some were images.

97
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,820
This happened in the whole country.

98
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,820
Yes.

99
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
Yes, I heard about it.

100
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
I don't know about the Palace.

101
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
That's because the thunder was raining.

102
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
Can it rain here?

103
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,820
Don't forget that there are many problems with the site.

104
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,820
The people who went there just now were wearing North Wei clothes.

105
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
Maybe they were here during the North Wei period.

106
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,820
But because of the site, they recorded the previous image.

107
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
That's why we could see it.

108
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,820
Yes.

109
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,820
The person who went there just now was wearing North Wei clothes.

110
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,820
That person's eyes were so scary.

111
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
It was a nine-star battlefield.

112
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
I don't know how many people were killed.

113
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
I heard that the horse was scared, the donkey was scared.

114
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,820
Why are you still scared?

115
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
The cat is scared of the appearance of a coward.

116
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,820
Go away.

117
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,820
Xiao Fei.

118
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
What's going on?

119
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,820
Let's go.

120
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
What's this place?

121
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
We've been here for a long time.

122
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
Why are we here?

123
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
What's this place?

124
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
We've been here for a long time.

125
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
Why are we here?

126
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
We've been here for a long time.

127
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,820
What's wrong?

128
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
Old man, you're too timid.

129
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
No.

130
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,820
When I was walking here, I felt that the neck was behind me.

131
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
I was walking.

132
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
I was walking.

133
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,820
Look.

134
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,820
The horse was blown to death.

135
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
I was too timid.

136
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
The horse was killed by itself.

137
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
I was so timid.

138
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
I was so timid.

139
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
I was too timid.

140
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,820
I was too timid.

141
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,820
Old man,

142
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
no matter what happens,

143
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,820
be careful.

144
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,820
This place is too remote.

145
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
We have to stay here.

146
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,820
This is a roadway.

147
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
Which way?

148
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,820
Left.

149
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Right.

150
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,820
How do you know?

151
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,820
I...

152
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,820
You take the road.

153
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,820
Okay.

154
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,820
I...

155
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,820
Forget it.

156
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
I'll listen to you.

157
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,820
Left.

158
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
I'll follow you.

159
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
It's better to walk on the left.

160
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,820
Old man,

161
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,820
do you think this place is familiar?

162
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
We won't be back again, right?

163
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,820
This time, it's Mr. Liang's turn.

164
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,820
Let's go this way.

165
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,820
I thought we should go this way.

166
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,820
Let's go.

167
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,820
Let's go.

168
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,820
Let's go.

169
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,820
Let's go.

170
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,820
Let's go.

171
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,820
Let's go.

172
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,820
Let's go.

173
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,820
Let's go.

174
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,820
Let's go.

175
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,820
Let's go.

176
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,820
Let's go.

177
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,820
Let's go.

178
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,820
Let's go.

179
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,820
Let's go.

180
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,820
Let's go.

181
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Let's go.

182
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,820
Let's go.

183
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,820
No.

184
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,820
No.

185
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,820
No.

186
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,820
No.

187
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,820
No.

188
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,820
No.

189
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,820
No.

190
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,820
No.

191
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,820
No.

192
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,820
No.

193
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,820
No.

194
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,820
No.

195
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,820
No.

196
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,820
No.

197
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,820
No.

198
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,820
No.

199
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,820
No.

200
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,820
We won't be back again.

201
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,820
No.

202
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,820
No.

203
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,820
It's not like

204
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
this is the spirit of the dead body.

205
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,820
We can't let it go.

206
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,820
Right?

207
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,820
Boss.

208
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
As you can see,

209
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,820
we are here

210
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
to discuss

211
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,820
the arrangement of Guancai Wall.

212
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,820
I'm sure

213
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
there are people

214
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
who have used

215
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
some magic arts here.

216
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
You all know

217
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,820
the eight-star painting, right?

218
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
You can hold

219
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,820
tens of thousands of troops

220
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,820
with a few stones.

221
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,820
With these Guancai Walls,

222
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
we can't be

223
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,820
a small family.

224
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,820
Don't talk about the money.

225
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
This is a secret palace.

226
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,820
Why not

227
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,820
a secret palace

228
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,820
but a magic?

229
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,820
Is it true?

230
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,820
I'm not a good person.

231
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
I can try

232
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,820
to break a magic.

233
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
But

234
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,820
from the look of it,

235
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,820
it's too big.

236
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
How long

237
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,820
can I break it?

238
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
I'll tell you.

239
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,820
Boss,

240
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
what are you doing?

241
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,820
If I say

242
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,820
we should burn this place

243
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,820
with this fire.

244
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,820
We'll burn it all.

245
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,820
What are you thinking?

246
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,820
We burned it all.

247
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,820
We'll be killed

248
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,820
if we don't burn it.

249
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,820
Let's go.

250
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,820
Where are we going?

251
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
This is the last road.

252
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,820
Where are we going?

253
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,820
Wait for me.

254
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,820
Wait.

255
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,820
Wait.

256
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,820
Come on.

257
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,820
Let's go.

258
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,820
Wait.

259
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,820
Wait.

260
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,820
I want it.

261
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,820
Wait.

262
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,820
Wait.

263
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,820
Wait.

264
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,820
What's wrong with you?

265
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,820
Well, well, well, well, well,

266
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,820
I have something in my wall.

267
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,820
Why is there a man in my wall?

268
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,820
Yes, yes, yes.

269
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,820
Old man, you're so small.

270
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,820
You still don't admit it?

271
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,820
I really didn't lie to you.

272
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,820
I really have something.

273
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,820
What's that?

274
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,820
Something!

275
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,820
There's something there!

276
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,820
You're so stupid!

277
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,820
What am I doing?

278
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,820
I have to learn how to play the game.

279
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,820
I'm so bad at this.

280
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,820
I don't want to die.

281
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,820
Old man, are you done?

282
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,820
If you're still here, I'll throw you out.

283
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,820
Go back yourself.

284
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,820
Wu Xin, what is it?

285
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,820
I didn't see it clearly.

286
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,820
But I really have something.

287
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,820
I've never seen it before.

288
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,820
I... I...

289
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,820
I'm not a thief.

290
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,820
Don't be so serious, young man.

291
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,820
Don't be so serious.

292
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,820
Think of a way.

293
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,820
What kind of a thief do you want?

294
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,820
How can you not even know how to protect yourself?

295
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,820
Oh my god!

296
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,820
Oh my god!

297
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,820
Oh my god!

298
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,820
What's going on?

299
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,820
Cut it out!

300
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,820
Let's cure him first.

301
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,820
I can't take it anymore!

302
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,820
I can't take it anymore!

303
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,820
Don't believe me!

304
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,820
What are you doing, Wu Xin?

305
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,820
I'm out of money.

306
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,820
What?

307
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,820
I'm dead if you keep on doing it.

308
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,820
I'm dead!

309
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,820
Come on, get up.

310
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,820
Uncle?

311
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,820
No wonder I can't find him.

312
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,820
I can't see him in the village.

313
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,820
Yes.

314
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,820
I was so scared just now.

315
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,820
Such a big uncle?

316
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,820
What kind of a person is he?

317
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,820
You never heard of him.

318
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,820
There was a Japanese Japanese team

319
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,820
in the northeast.

320
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,820
They trained the virus.

321
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,820
The uncle who was growing up was very strong.

322
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,820
Maybe he was also trained by the virus.

323
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,820
It's possible that he was a body-grown man.

324
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,820
But he didn't have much to train.

325
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,820
Look!

326
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,820
64

327
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,820
What have you seen?

328
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,820
Don't touch the coffin!

329
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,820
Be careful.

330
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,820
Okay.

331
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,820
Be careful.

332
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,820
What's inside?

333
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,820
The coffin is here.

334
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,820
What did you see?

335
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,820
All the money is for the money.

336
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
The money?

337
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,820
Don't touch them.

338
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,820
Let's go.

339
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,820
Go.

340
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,820
Go back.

341
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,820
Let's go.

342
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
Let's go.

343
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,820
Wait!

344
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,820
Let's go.

345
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,820
This way.

346
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,820
The coffin is here.

347
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,820
The coffin is here.

348
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:17,820
Where are we going?

349
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,820
I think...

350
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,820
I can't walk.

351
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,820
I think we can't go out.

352
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
Wait.

353
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,820
Do you have water?

354
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,820
Give me.

355
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,820
Why are you so troublesome?

356
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,820
The coffin is here.

357
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,820
The coffin is here.

358
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,820
The coffin is here.

359
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,820
Old man, what are you looking at?

360
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,820
Are you...

361
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,820
Are you out of your mind?

362
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,820
You want to make the bones your own?

363
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,820
Let me tell you.

364
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,820
I found a secret.

365
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,820
Come here.

366
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,820
Look.

367
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,820
Can you see any signs?

368
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,820
You...

369
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,820
I...

370
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,820
You...

371
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,820
Say it.

372
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,820
I...

373
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,820
Don't say it alone.

374
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,820
Little...

375
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,820
Little man.

376
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,820
Little man.

377
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,820
You come here to see.

378
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,820
Stop.

379
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,820
Say it.

380
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,820
Say it.

381
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,820
Look.

382
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,820
Look at the sharpness.

383
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,820
The bones of the god.

384
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,820
It's made of dead money.

385
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,820
Look.

386
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,820
The sharpness.

387
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,820
Yes.

388
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:20,820
It means that the time of the wound is very close to the time of the dead.

389
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,820
What...

390
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,820
What is the secret?

391
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,820
Listen to me.

392
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,820
The wound should be the cause of the death.

393
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:40,820
The reason is that the knife was cut off from the top of the coffin.

394
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,820
I was so surprised.

395
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,820
So I cut off the bones.

396
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,820
You've been talking about it for so long.

397
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,820
This person was cut off by a knife.

398
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,820
I don't know.

399
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,820
I observed it just now.

400
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,820
Many bodies were cut off like this.

401
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:14,820
Generally, the bones of the dead are cut off from the back of the coffin.

402
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:19,820
This kind of situation won't cause such a knife-hunt on the bones.

403
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:24,820
But these people in front of us are cut off by a knife.

404
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,820
So I decided that these people were killed in the battle.

405
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,820
Old man, this is a secret.

406
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,820
It's just a big secret.

407
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,820
The body is still behind.

408
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,820
Little man, look at this.

409
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,820
This is a fake of the bronze.

410
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,820
Yes.

411
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,820
And this is the armor of the dead.

412
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,820
Look at this.

413
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,820
It doesn't have a ID.

414
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,820
It's the armor of the dead.

415
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,820
The person died in the summer.

416
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,820
The strangest thing is this.

417
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,820
Look.

418
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,820
The hand.

419
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,820
Yes.

420
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,820
Yes.

421
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,820
I'm a good actor.

422
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,820
I knew it at first sight.

423
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,820
The body, the armor.

424
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,820
These are all from the Han people.

425
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,820
Why did they appear in the burial pit of the社 group?

426
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,820
If I'm not mistaken,

427
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,820
there is no burial pit in the world.

428
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:49,820
It's a battlefield.

429
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,820
According to my research,

430
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:59,820
the body here is divided into two people.

431
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,820
One is the guardian of this tomb.

432
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,820
The other is the army of the Han people.

433
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,820
Not a word?

434
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,820
Yes.

435
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,820
It should be the guardian of the社 group.

436
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,820
The set up to lure them here.

437
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,820
Use this complicated maze structure.

438
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,820
Try it.

439
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,820
Come.

440
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,820
Be careful.

441
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,820
Yes.

442
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,820
Master.

443
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,820
So you're not angry.

444
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,820
How did you get out?

445
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,820
I didn't think about it.

446
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,820
Then...

447
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,820
Or I'll tell you.

448
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,820
The fire is burned here.

449
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,820
As long as the five pillars are closed,

450
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,820
the safety will be sure to come out.

451
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,820
I'm not angry.

452
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,820
I'm not angry.

453
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,820
I'm not angry.

454
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,820
I'm not angry.

455
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,820
I'm not angry.

456
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,820
I'm not angry.

457
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,820
I'm not angry.

458
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,820
I'm not angry.

459
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,820
I'm not angry.

460
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,820
I'm not angry.

461
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,820
I'm not angry.

462
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,820
I'm not angry.

463
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,820
Be careful.

464
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,820
Just watch.

465
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,820
What are you thinking?

466
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,820

So what's the point?

470
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,820
Goodnight, Scholastic Bay Hubverts.

471
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,820
I wish now that

472
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,620

Wait a minute!

482
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,420
Hurry!

483
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,420
Hey!

484
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,420
Laoyang! Are you okay? Hurry!

485
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,420
We can't run away!

486
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,420
Laoyang!

487
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,420
Come back! Hurry!

488
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,420
What's that? It's a wound!

489
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,420
It's a corpse! It's all a corpse!

490
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,420
Run!

491
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,420
Come back!

492
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,420
What's wrong?

493
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,420
I'm not scared! What are you doing here?

494
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,420
Look! The coffin can move!

495
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,420
Is there a secret passage?

496
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,420
Fire!

497
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,420
Hurry!

498
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,420
Hurry!

499
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,420
Hurry!

500
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,420
There's a real one!

501
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,420
Laoyang!

502
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,420
Liangxuan!

503
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,420
Help me! I'm on fire!

504
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,420
I'm on fire!

505
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,420
Why are you burnt?

506
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,420
I'm on fire!

507
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,420
Why are you burning yourself?

508
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,420
You must have done too much!

509
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,420
Don't be afraid! Hurry!

510
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,420
Xiaowen, have you figured out the right way?

511
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,420
Yes.

512
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,420
Commander Fen, the coffin can move!

513
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,420
It must be near the crossroads!

514
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,420
You...

515
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,420
I found it!

516
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,420
Hurry!

517
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,420
Go!

518
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,420
What's that?

519
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,420
It's a dead fox!

520
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,420
Wu Xie, the coffin can't move!

521
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,420
It's completely broken!

522
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,420
Wu Xie, what are you doing?

523
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,420
My little fox!

524
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,420
Don't fight with that coffin!

525
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,420
Find a way!

526
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,420
Otherwise, the fire will come!

527
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,420
What should we do?

528
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,420
The End
