Episode 1

2
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Xie Lian Huan has no experience in diving.

3
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This boy, he doesn't know how to use the oxygen.

4
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is too scary.

5
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is for the people.

7
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Run freckles

8
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
What's up?

9
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,400
Brother SEN JU, look.

10
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,800
Look.

11
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I think it's the coffin of the director.

12
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't know who buried it.

13
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's just a human.

14
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Xia Lihua, look at your face.

15
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Human?

16
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Damn it, I'm scared.

17
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But this human is so weird.

18
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It looks like a heart-broken knife.

19
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It looks like a heart-broken knife.

20
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Brother San, this is a iron.

21
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The coffin is in the cave, right?

22
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This is a crown.

23
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What crown?

24
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The body is sealed, the coffin is worn.

25
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This is a crown.

26
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That means there's something inside.

27
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's not even a seed, but a medicine.

28
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's why the coffin is sealed.

29
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's a dead body.

30
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's a dead body.

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's a dead body.

32
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's why the coffin is sealed.

33
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's so scary.

34
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let the master go inside and take the treasure inside.

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Once the treasure is inside,

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
it can only be cut off from outside.

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's a good story, but it's impossible.

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The old ancestral tomb must have its reason.

39
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Brother San, don't you worry about what's inside?

40
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What's inside?

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's go back and take the black donkey's body and the fire-dryer.

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We'll be there in a few days.

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The coffin won't run away.

44
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's a good thing.

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The End

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Take a look, don't touch it.

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll go there and take a look.

48
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The End

49
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What should we do?

50
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What's going on?

51
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Brother San, I just threw a fire-dryer inside.

52
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I didn't expect it to be like this.

53
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You almost got it.

54
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're not learning this trick.

55
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You almost look like a lion.

56
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The body is under the following circumstances.

57
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The body is in the clothes.

58
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The body can be found.

59
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Can you even find a brain?

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Brother San, don't be so rash.

61
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
We have to find a way to extinguish the fire.

62
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You're so mean.

63
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What are you doing?

64
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Take the water.

65
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Water.

66
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes, water.

67
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I found it.

68
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Brother San, don't worry.

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Where's the water?

70
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Come on, pour it in.

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Where's the water?

72
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Where's the water?

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Take it.

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll find you later.

75
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm going to kill you.

76
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What should we do?

77
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Your mother is so ill.

78
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
She's dying.

79
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What?

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You can't even come to me?

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You're so cruel.

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're so cruel.

83
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,880
Siment emergency

84
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,700
Dude sentustered

85
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,460
S Forward

86
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,480
Igor.

87
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Stalin sent the most furious

88
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
General zum

89
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,860
S Okay

90
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,840
But someone is not

91
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,320
But I want to know

92
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,400
Who can talk with all of us

93
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,600
I have nothing to say

94
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,980
I'm afraid

95
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,260
Stand right there

96
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,760
S

97
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,940
You may increase

98
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,040
My hand

99
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,580
I can't

100
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,300
Your hand

101
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:35,780
Please

102
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,600
Thanks

103
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,700
I am hurt

104
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,900
He was an artist.

105
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,500
He did it on purpose.

106
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:45,980
Forget it.

107
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,260
The fire is burning.

108
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,100
It's burning.

109
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,580
It's been half a day.

110
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,180
It should be a dead end.

111
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,620
You're lucky.

112
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,780
Brother San.

113
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,940
Don't be so mean.

114
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,380
It's still clean.

115
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,020
Go back and be your master.

116
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,700
What's wrong?

117
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,140
Yuan Huan.

118
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,020
It's a poison bottle.

119
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,940
It can't burn.

120
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,820
Really?

121
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,580
Take it out.

122
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,260
Yong Lin, take it.

123
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:24,940
Oh, no.

124
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,700
It's a trap.

125
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,020
Don't move.

126
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,540
Xie Lihuan.

127
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,020
Xie Lihuan.

128
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,740
Don't move.

129
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,540
I'll go and see.

130
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,420
Don't go anywhere.

131
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,460
Stay here.

132
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,940
Brother San, come back.

133
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,580
Don't go anywhere.

134
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,660
Brother Han.

135
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,660
Brother Han.

136
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,980
Don't go anywhere.

137
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,820
Xie Lihuan.

138
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,460
Don't go anywhere.

139
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,220
Go somewhere else.

140
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,300
Don't go anywhere.

141
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,700
What should I do?

142
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,500
Leave.

143
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,340
I say go.

144
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,940
Don't go anywhere.

145
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,620
If I go,

146
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,420
I can understand him and him.

147
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,700
and died.

148
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
Lian Huan!

149
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Lian Huan!

150
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Lian Huan!

151
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Lian Huan!

152
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,700
Come out!

153
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,700
Come out!

154
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,700
Come out!

155
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,700
Where is your master?

156
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,700
Lian Huan!

157
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,700
Master!

158
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,700
Sun Zai!

159
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Lian Huan!

160
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,700
I'm not afraid of anyone.

161
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,700
You're going to die in the court.

162
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,700
18 years later,

163
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,700
you'll be a good-looking mother!

164
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,700
There's still some oxygen left.

165
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,700
I can't get out of the water today.

166
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,700
But I'm better than you.

167
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,700
Maybe I'll be able to live.

168
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
As long as I'm out,

169
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
I'll send someone to save you.

170
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,700
If I can't,

171
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
I'll stay in the prison.

172
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
You...

173
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,700
You're a wood.

174
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
I'll be back.

175
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,700
I'm just on the black sea.

176
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,700
I'm trying my best to get on the oil.

177
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
I just got out of the sea.

178
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
The oxygen level is low.

179
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,700
I'm done.

180
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,700
I'm really dead.

181
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
I'm really dead.

182
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,700
At this point,

183
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,700
I saw many bones

184
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,700
that I've been painting.

185
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,700
They were very close.

186
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,700
I found that these bones

187
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,700
were shaped by bamboo.

188
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,700
They were made of stone.

189
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,700
There was air inside.

190
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,700
I just made a hole.

191
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,700
I made oxygen, air, and oxygen.

192
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,700
I just made a hole.

193
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,700
I just kept thinking

194
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,700
who is the one

195
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,700
who is the one

196
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,700
who is going to kill me?

197
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,700
In that kind of environment,

198
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,700
except for you, Aunt Wenjing,

199
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,700
I don't believe anyone.

200
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,700
What happened next?

201
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,700
Later,

202
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,700
I found Xie Lianghuan's body

203
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,700
on the bridge.

204
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Maybe,

205
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,700
you saved him right away.

206
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
That's not the case.

207
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,700
What are you talking about?

208
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,700
I saved him.

209
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,700
I'm dying like that.

210
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,700
How can I save him?

211
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,700
How can I save him?

212
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
Fine.

213
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,700
It's Xie Lianghuan.

214
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,700
Is that enough?

215
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,700
Uncle San,

216
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,700
do you remember

217
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,700
who was the one who saved you?

218
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,700
Was it Xiao Ge?

219
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,700
Who are you talking about?

220
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,700
Xiao Ge? Zhang Qilin?

221
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,700
Uncle San,

222
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
look.

223
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,700
Wasn't he the one who fell with your sister?

224
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,700
He is indeed a kid.

225
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,700
Why didn't he get old?

226
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
He said

227
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,700
he was in the coma.

228
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,700
He lost consciousness.

229
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,700
He also had some physical problems.

230
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,700
Until a while ago,

231
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,700
we were in the coma.

232
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,700
He was making some lies.

233
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,700
Did he say where is Wenjing?

234
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,700
You know he cares about her.

235
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
Xiao Ge only said

236
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,700
he and a group of people

237
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,700
were in the tunnel.

238
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,700
He was in the hospital.

239
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,700
He didn't remember

240
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,700
how he got out of the grave

241
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
and how he got injured.

242
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,700
It's impossible for him.

243
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,700
He is much better than me.

244
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,700
He can kill me

245
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,700
if I have three or five lives.

246
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,700
It's impossible for him.

247
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,700
You are right.

248
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,700
Besides Wenjing,

249
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,700
I don't trust anyone.

250
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,700
I don't trust anyone.

251
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,700
Uncle San,

252
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,700
Xiao Ge said

253
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,700
you were pretending to be a woman

254
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,700
in front of Shi Wei

255
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,700
and trying to open a door.

256
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,700
Is that possible?

257
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,700
What?

258
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,700
Pretending to be a woman?

259
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,700
What's going on?

260
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,700
Xie Zi,

261
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
I think

262
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
you are a man

263
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,700
who has no expression.

264
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,700
I think

265
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,700
you should

266
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,700
be scared of him.

267
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,700
Brother Xiao Hua is

268
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,700
the one who doesn't want to be scared.

269
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,700
He always wears pink

270
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,700
and says it's a psychological study.

271
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,700
But I think

272
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,700
it's not so good.

273
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,700
A man

274
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,700
should be brave.

275
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,700
You should be like Xie Zi.

276
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,700
Brother Xiao Hua

277
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,700
has been trained since he was a kid.

278
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,700
I can't do it.

279
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
I am a little goldfish

280
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
who is trying to make her happy.

281
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,700
How many times have you said

282
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,700
that you forgot?

283
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,700
Your little head

284
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
is like a goldfish.

285
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,700
You forgot everything.

286
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,700
Grandma, we are abroad this time.

287
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
But we have some goods.

288
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,700
Right?

289
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,700
Yes.

290
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,700
Grandma,

291
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,700
we brought the snake-dust-fish back.

292
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
Look.

293
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,700
This is the one

294
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,700
we brought back from the sea.

295
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Yes.

296
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,700
The dog-dust-fish

297
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,700
brought the third uncle to our house

298
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
to get the snake-dust-fish.

299
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
The dog-dust-fish

300
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,700
will play this trick.

301
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Look.

302
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,700
He brought his son

303
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,700
back that year.

304
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,700
He came in and passed away.

305
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,700
The wife

306
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,700
and the grandchild

307
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,700
are useless.

308
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,700
But now

309
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,700
your aunt

310
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,700
has been gone for so long.

311
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
She hasn't even

312
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,700
found any clues.

313
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,700
We found the snake-dust-fish

314
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,700
in the sea.

315
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,700
Besides,

316
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,700
the brother

317
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
knows the sea-dust-fish.

318
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,700
We can

319
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,700
find out everything together.

320
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,700
Silly girl.

321
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Not every secret

322
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,700
has a answer.

323
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,700
Not every answer

324
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,700
is the truth.

325
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,700
You are young,

326
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,700
you have hope and pursuit.

327
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,700
You can stick to it.

328
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,700
Otherwise, you are like me.

329
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,700
It's useless to

330
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,700
stick to a rock.

331
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,700
Grandma, what are you saying?

332
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,700
A pretty beauty like you

333
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,700
will never be old.

334
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
Stop being so naive.

335
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,700
If you want to check it, then do it.

336
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,700
But you need to

337
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,700
keep the distance with that dog-dust-fish.

338
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,700
Don't be so close.

339
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,700
Keep it safe.

340
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,700
Got it?

341
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
Pied.

342
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,700
I'm old.

343
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,700
I'm really old.

344
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,700
I'm afraid that one day, I'll have a granddaughter.

345
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,700
I'll have a granddaughter.

346
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,700
Grandma Huo, don't worry.

347
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
I'll do my best.

348
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Where is he?

349
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,700
No, he's lying.

350
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,700
He's lying?

351
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,700
I was following them, and they were too big.

352
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,700
I couldn't see anything.

353
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,700
But he didn't lie to me.

354
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,700
But I did tell Fatty about something.

355
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
He didn't see you.

356
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,700
He heard Huo Ling say he saw you.

357
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,700
And he called your name.

358
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,700
If you say so,

359
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,700
if there's someone who looks like you,

360
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,700
or Huo Ling is the person...

361
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,700
What's wrong?

362
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,700
What's wrong with him?

363
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,700
He's so big.

364
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
He looks like me.

365
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
Why did he call my name?

366
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,700
So you think it's Huo Ling's problem?

367
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,700
He's a big man.

368
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
I've taught you for so many years.

369
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,700
What's the worst thing in this world?

370
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,700
People's hearts.

371
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,700
Don't think you're a common man.

372
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
You're a liar.

373
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,700
You have many secrets.

374
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,700
I can't tell you the truth.

375
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
Uncle,

376
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,700
he didn't lie to me.

377
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,700
You mean,

378
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,700
he's lying to you?

379
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
What?

380
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,700
Look at me.

381
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,700
I'll ask you again.

382
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,700
He's lying to you.

383
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
I'll lie to you again.

384
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,700
Uncle,

385
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,700
I thought you were the one who took this photo.

386
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,700
But Xiaohua told me he's Xie Lian Huan.

387
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,700
You look like him, right?

388
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,700
Is it because you're a very close friend?

389
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,700
So they recognized you as Xie Lian Huan.

390
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,700
Right?

391
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,700
No.

392
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,700
Xie Lian Huan died at that time.

393
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:04,700
So you still think it's Huo Ling's problem?

394
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,700
No.

395
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,700
But he died too.

396
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,700
And he's been looking for him for so long.

397
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
So,

398
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,700
you're a coward.

399
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,700
And you're a smart girl.

400
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,700
You're not blind.

401
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700
You don't believe what others say.

402
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,700
Okay.

403
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,700
Even if uncle wants to find a way out,

404
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,700
I'll bring you here to make a cup of tea.

405
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,700
Is that okay?

406
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,700
What's the use?

407
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,700
Uncle San,

408
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,700
I made a cup of tea?

409
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,700
It's too much.

410
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,700
I'm a little stubborn.

411
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,700
I made a cup of tea.

412
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,700
Okay,

413
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,700
don't worry about it.

414
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,700
It's been a long time.

415
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,700
I'll do it.

416
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,700
It's not like you.

417
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,700
What do you mean?

418
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,700
I even prepared dinner for you.

419
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,700
You're happy.

420
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
You're a good player.

421
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,700
We're not worth the money.

422
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,700
Okay,

423
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,700
okay.

424
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,700
Give me the bottle you bought.

425
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,700
I bought it for you.

426
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
I'll sell it for you.

427
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,700
Okay.

428
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,700
Uncle San,

429
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,700
I can't do it.

430
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,700
I want to go to the country.

431
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,700
If you want to see it,

432
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,700
you can do it.

433
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,700
You're a good player.

434
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,700
Why do you have to be a loser?

435
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,700
Uncle San,

436
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
you really have to be a loser.

437
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,700
Or

438
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,700
you should have a brother and sister.

439
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,700
Otherwise,

440
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,700
you're a treasure.

441
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
Don't give it to me.

442
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
You gave me the egg yolk.

443
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,700
I'll give it to you all.

444
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,700
What did you say?

445
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,700
Give it to me.

446
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,700
It hurts.

447
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,700
It hurts.

448
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
Just a little longer.

449
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
Give me a break.

450
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,700
No, no.

451
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,700
I'm telling you, I'm dead.

452
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,700
I'll spend all my money.

453
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,700
I'll smash all my stuff.

454
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,700
I won't leave it to you.

455
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,700
Get out.

456
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,700
You bastard.

457
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,700
I'll kill you.

458
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
Go to hell.

459
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
Where we fourار

460
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,700
Have a smoke.

461
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,700
Why get mad?

462
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Why did you swallow it?

463
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,700
Get the spotlights.

464
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,700
Get the spotlights.

465
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,100
I'm afraid of you.

466
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,500
Why didn't you play Shizong?

467
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
You're out.

468
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,700
You're back so soon?

469
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,700
I have a book.

470
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,700
No way.

471
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,700
No way.

472
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,700
You're really out of luck.

473
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,700
You're so stubborn.

474
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,700
You're so stubborn.

475
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,700
You're so stubborn.

476
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,700
You're so stubborn.

477
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,700
You're so stubborn.

478
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,700
You're so stubborn.

479
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,700
You're so stubborn.

480
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,700
You said you'd cut the green apple

481
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,700
in my place.

482
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,700
You should have cut it.

483
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,700
I'm so stubborn.

484
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,700
I'm not interested in these things.

485
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,700
I like

486
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,700
the stories behind them.

487
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,700
So what?

488
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,700
Did you understand?

489
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,700
I feel like I'm leaving Luo Sheng.

490
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,700
There are shops in Beijing,

491
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,700
tea shops,

492
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,700
restaurants in Beijing.

493
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,700
What's the door to Luo Sheng?

494
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,700
I can't go outside.

495
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,700
My uncle said

496
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,700
he has a problem

497
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
with Qiu Dekang.

498
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,700
Qiu Dekang said

499
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,700
he had to go to the blood test

500
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,700
with my uncle.

501
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,700
But my uncle said

502
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,700
Xie Lienhuan

503
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,700
had to go to the blood test.

504
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,700
Qiu Dekang said

505
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,700
he had to let him

506
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,700
get into the test.

507
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,700
Xie Lienhuan was in

508
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,700
the test.

509
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,700
But my uncle told me that Xie Lian Huan was the one who took her to the test team.

510
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,700
By the way, I told you about Xie Lian Huan's death.

511
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,700
He was the one who followed Xie Lian Huan down the sea.

512
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,700
But during the process, there was a mysterious man who attacked them.

513
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,700
He took all of them and took them away.

514
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
Xie Lian Huan was injured and was in the sea.

515
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,700
He was in the woods.

516
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,700
My uncle was on the road to his death.

517
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,700
He saved his life.

518
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,700
But when he wanted to go back to save Xie Lian Huan,

519
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,700
he found out that Xie Lian Huan had died in the church.

520
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,700
Who do you think is the real one?

521
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,700
I believe my uncle in love.

522
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,700
So you don't believe him?

523
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,700
One more thing.

524
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,700
I think Xie Lian Huan in my uncle's mouth

525
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,700
is a man who only took a little bit of money and wanted to steal.

526
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,700
But it's not the same as the character of Xie's family I know.

527
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,700
You should know that if Xie Lian Huan didn't die at that time,

528
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,700
now the family of Xie must be him.

529
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,700
But you...

530
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,700
Uncle said that he couldn't prove whether he was real or not.

531
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,700
He's dead, right?

532
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,700
He's dead.

533
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,700
It's not certain.

534
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,700
If we investigate Xie Lian Huan again,

535
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,700
many people will know about him.

536
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,700
If you continue to investigate him,

537
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,700
your uncle's relationship will be gone.

538
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,700
It's over.

539
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,700
But you're looking for trouble yourself.

540
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,700
What are you doing?

541
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,700
You've been through so many years.

542
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,700
You have to go through so many trials and errors.

543
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,700
What are you looking for?

544
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,700
I don't want to talk to my uncle.

545
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,700
But I just want to know what's the relationship between my uncle and Qiu Dekou.

546
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,700
In abroad.

547
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,700
Qiu Dekou told me about my grandpa's blood test.

548
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,700
But he said that if my grandpa didn't tell him personally,

549
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,700
he wouldn't be able to tell it.

550
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
But according to my grandpa's personality,

551
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,700
even if he's a good friend of Qiu Dekou,

552
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,700
he wouldn't tell him about such a secret.

553
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,700
Because that's a pain in my grandpa's heart.

554
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,700
He didn't even tell me.

555
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,700
So you think he told the outsiders but didn't tell you?

556
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,700
You're jealous, aren't you?

557
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,700
Yes.

558
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,700
No, it's true.

559
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,700
There's another possibility.

560
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,700
My uncle was drunk.

561
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,700
He said everything about my grandpa.

562
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,700
It's like what my uncle did when he was young.

563
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,700
But if it's true,

564
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,700
it's also proven that

565
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,700
what Qiu Dekou did was my uncle's blood test.

566
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,700
And it's not blood test.

567
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,700
That's what I'm talking about.

568
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,700
Why abroad?

569
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,700
Qiu Dekou met my uncle.

570
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,700
It's because he's so good at it.

571
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,700
They haven't contacted each other for so many years.

572
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,700
What else can they do?

573
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,700
I feel sorry for Xie Lianhua.

574
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
She's dead for a long time.

575
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,700
I'll have to cry for your uncle.

576
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,700
It's also possible that your uncle is telling the truth.

577
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,700
I'll feel sorry for your uncle.

578
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,700
Can I laugh at you?

579
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,700
What's wrong?

580
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,700
Fatty, I asked you to talk to you.

581
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,700
But you said everything.

582
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,700
What do you want me to say?

583
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,700
Uncle San is fine.

584
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,700
Shut up.

585
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,700
Uncle San is fine.

586
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,700
He didn't do it.

587
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,700
Are you happy?

588
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,700
Okay, I'm sorry.

589
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,700
I'm sorry.

590
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,700
I won't give you a bet.

591
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,700
Okay?

592
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,700
Go away.

593
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,700
Do you have a hotpot?

594
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,700
Give me one too.

595
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,700
I can't bear to eat this.

596
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,700
I'll eat it myself.

597
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,700
Wait till I get the news.

598
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,700
I'll treat you to some Beijing specialties.

599
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,700
Come on, drink.

600
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,700
Why didn't you move?

601
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,700
Come on, catch me.

602
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,700
Who's that?

603
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,700
It's me, Danyang.

604
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,700
Is it Fatty?

605
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,700
Come on, drink.

606
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,700
He's Danyang's Fatty.

607
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,700
Yes, you should go tomorrow.

608
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,700
No, Fatty, I'm Guo Guo's friend.

609
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,700
He introduced me to you.

610
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,700
He said you were paid for your food.

611
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,700
And I was in a hurry to go out.

612
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,700
No, you go ahead.

613
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,700
Go.

614
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,700
Fatty.

615
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,700
What's wrong?

616
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,700
What's wrong?

617
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,700
Fatty.

618
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,700
Come in.

619
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,700
Bring the door.

620
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,700
Appreciate it.

621
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,040
Little star of the film

622
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,220
If there is a chance to repay us,

623
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,540
we should join the evening Пр tat LLY

624
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,340
and leave our company at ArgentinianSockstone.com

625
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,720
This is Officer bulbs.

626
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,160
Whose?

627
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,120
Now, hurry up!

628
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,140
Yes, yes, yes, take a seat.

629
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:06,740
Have a seat.

630
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,500
You've been waiting for him for very long.

631
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,380
Right.

632
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,140
Thank you for taking care.

633
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:09,760
It's OK.

634
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,700
You want to eat?

635
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,700
You don't eat, eat some.

636
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,700
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

637
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,700
What's your name?

638
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,700
My surname is Ma.

639
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,700
Just call me Ma.

640
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,700
Ma? You should call yourself Ma.

641
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,700
What's that?

642
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,700
You are the best friend of my brother, right?

643
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,700
He is the best friend of my brother.

644
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,700
Since he is the one who introduced me,

645
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,700
I won't play with you.

646
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,700
I'll take this.

647
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,700
But I need to know his origin.

648
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,700
This...

649
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,700
He doesn't have any origin.

650
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,700
I just got it from the countryside.

651
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,700
It's not interesting to play with Mr. Fang.

652
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,700
Mr. Fang, this is definitely a good thing.

653
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,700
Yes, it is. But I need to know how he came here.

654
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,700
First, I need to know what kind of path he is.

655
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,700
I have a enemy in my heart.

656
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,700
If I can't take it, I can help you find a buyer.

657
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,700
Second, I'm the friend of my brother.

658
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,700
I'm the friend of my brother.

659
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,700
I'm the friend of my brother.

660
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,700
If I can't find a buyer,

661
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,700
I'm the friend of my brother.

662
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,700
Come on, this number.

663
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,700
Really?

664
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,700
Tell me.

665
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,700
Okay, I'll tell you.

666
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,700
It's actually quite simple.

667
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,700
Three years ago,

668
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,700
we went to Qinling together.

669
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,700
We went to Qinling together.

670
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,700
We had no experience in the wild.

671
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,700
We went through the forest together.

672
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,700
It was the first time.

673
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,700
But we were in the forest.

674
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,700
We walked for more than ten days.

675
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,700
We were lost at that time.

676
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,700
We almost finished eating the dried food.

677
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,700
We almost collapsed.

678
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,700
We were walking.

679
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,700
We found a cliff ahead.

680
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,700
Mr. Fang, don't be ridiculous.

681
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,700
The cliff is very high.

682
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,700
It's over 100 meters high.

683
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,700
It's cold.

684
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,700
Be careful.

685
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,700
Why do I feel that this place is not right?

686
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,700
It's hard.

687
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,700
Is there something dirty?

688
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,700
Don't think about it.

689
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,700
There are only some catfish and monkeys around.

690
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,700
There's nothing else.

691
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,700
Let's not go back.

692
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,700
There's something in front.

693
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,700
There seems to be something in front.

694
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,700
Let's go.

695
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,700
Let's go.

696
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,700
It's not the end of the world.

697
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,700
Mr. Fang, I'm telling the truth.

698
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,700
On that cliff,

699
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,700
we found a...

700
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,700
I don't know what era it is.

701
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,700
A foundation.

702
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,700
There's a bronze tree.

703
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,700
It looks like it grew from the bottom.

704
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,700
It looks like it grew from the bottom.

705
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,700
I remember now.

706
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,700
I was walking along the wind.

707
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,700
I was looking down.

708
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,700
I couldn't reach the bottom.

709
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,700
And that bronze tree,

710
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,700
I thought it must be 100 meters high.

711
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,700
He was jumping from the bottom.

712
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,700
That's like a rock.

713
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,700
But it's a dead rock.

714
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,700
No way to find it.

715
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,700
Who are you?

716
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,700
iser?

717
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,700
I am not supposed to enter...

718
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,860
Comrade, there's a flying man behind,

719
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,060
brilliant handsome face.

720
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,160
He�양得 photo smile叻singing

721
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,540
We were all meeting him today.

722
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,720
Yes.

723
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,680
Well,

724
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,500
how are you?

725
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,740
You just had a fight.

726
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,240
Don't think I want to worry.

727
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,240
What's this?

728
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
Yang.

729
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
What is it?

730
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
Yang.

731
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,240
It's nothing.

732
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
Yang.

733
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,240
What are you looking at?

734
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,240
This must be a secret of a few people.

735
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,240
A secret?

736
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,240
There must be a secret.

737
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,240
Wow!

738
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,240
Such a big altar!

739
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,240
Laoya, this time we'll be rich.

740
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
Hurry up, hurry up!

741
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,240
This time we finally found the treasure.

742
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,240
The treasure must be down there.

743
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,240
It's been a long time since I've been drunk.

744
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,240
I'm drunk.

745
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,240
Laoya, what's so funny about that tree?

746
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,240
You can't let me do it alone.

747
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,240
The treasure is out, but we're split.

748
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,240
Come down and help me.

749
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,240
Okay.

750
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,240
Laoya, hurry up!

751
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Come here!

752
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,240
I said there's something.

753
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,240
Right?

754
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,240
There must be something down there.

755
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,240
Hurry up!

756
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
There's another one.

757
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,240
Hurry up!

758
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,240
There must be many people down there.

759
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,240
Laoya, hurry up!

760
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,240
I'm so tired.

761
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,240
Hurry up!

762
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,240
What's this?

763
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,240
Laoya, what did you find?

764
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,240
Why did you take a risk?

765
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,240
I'll go in and see.

766
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,240
No, stop!

767
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,240
Don't die!

768
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,240
There might be danger in here.

769
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,240
I'll go in and see.

770
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,240
Stop!

771
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
Let's dig this treasure.

772
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,240
We've been together for a lifetime.

773
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,240
Hurry up!

774
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,240
You're not going to leave early, right?

775
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,240
Fine, I can't care about it.

776
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,240
Don't say I'm not good enough.

777
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
I'm leaving.

778
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,240
The End

779
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,240
The End

780
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,240
The End

781
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,240
The End

782
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,240
The End
