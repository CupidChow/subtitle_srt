Episode 1

2
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
Come on, my lord, let's go.

3
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
My lord, you're so serious.

4
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,960
You don't know what to do with your phone.

5
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,840
What can you do?

6
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,440
You can just throw a ball at me.

7
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
Exactly.

8
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Give me a drink.

9
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Do you want one?

10
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Here you go.

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Come on, drink.

12
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Come on, drink.

13
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't drink too much.

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't be like the previous one.

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Move!

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Come on!

17
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Come on!

18
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Come on, let's go!

19
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Come on, get your hands on him.

20
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Here you go.

21
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Walk by yourself, my very own gearbox.

22
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Do I look like I'm travel-grabbered to her?

23
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Is it myF Embassy?

24
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Excuse me.

25
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The first game of the game is the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of

26
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:59,000
the game of the game of the game of the game

27
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,240
Dinya didn't understand him at the beginning,

28
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:07,000
after he fell into the well during a pestilence with other models.

29
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,680
His brains belonged to hookers.

30
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,000
It was my hand's fault!

31
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,400
Like a fool!

32
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,440
What was wrong with Air?

33
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,800
I...

34
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,600
I just saw you at a place.

35
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,920
If I do you yourself, I will die on your 셋et.

36
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,340
It's the friend.

37
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,160
I can't live NGOs without you.

38
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,900
You're here, receptive.

39
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,060
Don't take it too far.

40
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,220
Hurry up.

41
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,720
Look over there.

42
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,480
Oh no, you don't have to take a lift.

43
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,560
Over there.

44
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,560
Take that ladder.

45
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,920
Are they female hooves? Go or not.

46
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,940
It's good to have wings here, so we got villas for tea.

47
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,680
Why so many villas?

48
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
It's too boring.

49
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
I'm so nervous.

50
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Yes.

51
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
Why is it so boring?

52
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,680
It must be a change of weather.

53
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
What smell?

54
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
What smell?

55
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
It's a scab.

56
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Look at the mountain.

57
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
It's like a big basin.

58
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
There are rivers and lakes.

59
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,680
I'm telling you, we're not stupid.

60
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,680
We're not fed up with smoke.

61
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,680
You're a fool.

62
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,680
Drink some water.

63
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,680
You have no smell.

64
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
Wanko

65
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Hold him.

66
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
Keep going.

67
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
Are you okay?

68
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,680
I'm fine.

69
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
There are some holes here.

70
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,680
There are stones.

71
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,680
There must be five meters of this hole.

72
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
Everyone, check it out.

73
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,680
I found it.

74
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
Boss, there is a hole here.

75
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
There is a hole here.

76
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,680
I'll go and check it out.

77
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
There is a hole here.

78
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
There is a hole here.

79
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,680
Why is there so much holes?

80
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Is it natural or human?

81
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,680
There are many stones here.

82
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
Will this hole be smashed by stones?

83
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,680
It must be a rock.

84
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
It's very secretive.

85
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
If it's raining,

86
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
people will stand under it.

87
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
It must be smashed into meat.

88
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:57,680
I didn't expect that those stones

89
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
would be useful when they were cleaned.

90
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
It seems that they were repaired

91
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
decades ago.

92
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,680
There are some metal parts

93
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,680
and some fruits.

94
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,680
Fruits?

95
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
It seems that there was a man who came here.

96
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,680
There are some metal parts

97
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
and some fruits.

98
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
It must be a very secretive arrangement

99
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
from ancient times.

100
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
The lost village is here.

101
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
The villagers here are the descendants of the metal parts.

102
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,680
But the alley is so far away.

103
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
The villagers don't know

104
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
their ancestors' secrets.

105
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Let's try these metal parts.

106
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
It's not easy.

107
00:11:45,680 --> 00:12:15,680
The village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village

108
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:39,640
The storm is so big. I'm afraid it's going to rain.

109
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,640
post

110
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,680
n

111
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
Come on, hurry!

112
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
Run!

113
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,680
Hurry up!

114
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,680
Get down!

115
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,680
Hurry up!

116
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,680
Come on!

117
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
Come on, hurry up!

118
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,680
Come on!

119
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,060
We can do it.

120
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,440
I'll give it to you.

121
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,420
Dregole?

122
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,080
Let's go look for a yellowец.

123
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,600
My god.

124
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,020
What's his name?

125
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,240
Cing Sigma.

126
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,680
Holy G platypum.

127
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,600
How can northp motives like this never come to life?

128
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,400
I don't think we'll ever find out that it belongs to them.

129
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,680
Look up there.

130
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,680
Eioni.

131
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,080
Get the mask on us!

132
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,240
Take everything!

133
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,240
Come on, let's get off.

134
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,760
Someone is POVing einen.

135
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,760
We're...

136
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
We're fine, right?

137
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,760
Look how many of our brothers are injured.

138
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,760
One of them is injured.

139
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,360
Two more injured.

140
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Zhu.

141
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,320
Send the injured two people to the fire.

142
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Throw the dead body out of the fire.

143
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
And then we'll split up.

144
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
When we come back,

145
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
we'll bring them home together.

146
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Yes.

147
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
It's my fault.

148
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
I didn't find anyone to help me.

149
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,320
The stone was made from the mountain.

150
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
The stone was made from the rock.

151
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
The stone was made from the mountain.

152
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,320
It was blown up by something.

153
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,320
A line of debris fell on our way.

154
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
There's a mechanism here?

155
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
The place we stayed just now,

156
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,320
there's a blind spot on the other mountain.

157
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,320
The location of the stone fell was obviously designed by the gold.

158
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
You mean, there's a secret passage?

159
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
The stone on this mountain

160
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
can't be completely destroyed.

161
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
It can't be that the stone fell off.

162
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
I guess,

163
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
someone saw us coming in

164
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
and sent the mechanism out.

165
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
There's someone here?

166
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,320
Maybe it's the guard.

167
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
Maybe it's the same person

168
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
who came to study here.

169
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,320
Be careful, there's a hole here.

170
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,320
The dead people took the Uhmomika and me hinted at the truth,

171
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
certainly the spirit вамi in the room.

172
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Have you seen through it,

173
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,320
Do you know if there's anyfear anywhere?

174
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Do you know if this is true

175
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
or not?

176
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Are there anyBelлов tribute?

177
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
No, nothing like that.

178
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,040
Stop it. It's getting serious.

179
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,440
Yang Yang.

180
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,240
It's not good.

181
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,640
What?

182
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,720
No need.

183
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,040
You don't need to worry about such a small thing.

184
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,160
I have this.

185
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,320
I mean, you always have this.

186
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,760
It's done. Let me see.

187
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,360
It's done.

188
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,280
It's done.

189
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,560
Ev Sapkin

190
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,960
So you lost them for nothing.

191
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,480
Kind of nervous.

192
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,360
We didn't have muchSmall� much chrysanthemums.

193
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,540
I didn't expect

194
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,620
you to touch it for so long.

195
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,360
Since your family happened,

196
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
you should go inside.

197
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:31,680
normally Secondary

198
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,380
Cattle

199
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,380
It should be very rich.

200
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,380
Okay, let's just look at this.

201
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,380
It's a bit more expensive.

202
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,380
Let's just rest here.

203
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,380
It's getting late.

204
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,380
Let's go.

205
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,380
The few rooms in front are better.

206
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,380
There's a small waterfall here.

207
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,380
It seems that this house used to have a lake.

208
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,380
What's wrong?

209
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,380
Let's go to the building.

210
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,380
No.

211
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,380
Master,

212
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,380
we've seen all the villages.

213
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,380
You're the one who's still the best.

214
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,380
You're pretty and the house is great.

215
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,380
Well, I'll take a break.

216
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,380
Don't mind me.

217
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,380
Okay?

218
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,380
Okay, let's not talk about it.

219
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,380
Hurry up and clean up.

220
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,380
You want to sleep in the back?

221
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,380
Cheng Mu,

222
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,380
you can sit here for a day.

223
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,380
I'll go to the gym and get some water.

224
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,380
I don't want to work, so I'll just say it.

225
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,380
Why do you use a gun when you're playing?

226
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,380
You don't play with your eyes here.

227
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,380
You can't play with your body.

228
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,380
You can't play with your body.

229
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,380
You're so good.

230
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,380
You want to eat chicken outside?

231
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,380
You can't eat it.

232
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,380
I can't lose my stomach anyway.

233
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,380
Well,

234
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,380
what's wrong again?

235
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,380
You don't know that I...

236
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,380
I've been there

237
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,380
for my stomach

238
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,380
for 45 times

239
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,380
when you didn't sleep.

240
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,380
What did you eat?

241
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,380
I can't admit it

242
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,380
because I'm a little hungry.

243
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
I'm not hungry.

244
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,380
I'm not hungry.

245
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,380
I can't admit it

246
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,380
because I stepped on the mushroom

247
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,380
last night.

248
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,380
I'll be back soon.

249
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,380
That's all?

250
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,380
You're going hunting?

251
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,380
Damn.

252
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,380
Yenaz.

253
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,380
Yenaz.

254
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,380
Yenaz.

255
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,380
Fatty.

256
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,380
Fatty.

257
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,380
Fatty.

258
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,380
Why are you still here?

259
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,380
Fatty.

260
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,380
Can you hear me?

261
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,380
Fatty.

262
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,380
Fatty.

263
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,380
Isn't this the end?

264
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,380
Where should I go to hunt water?

265
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,380
Fatty,

266
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,380
you've been hunting water for a long time.

267
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,380
Fatty.

268
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,380
I don't know

269
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,380
where to hunt water.

270
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,380
I know.

271
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,380
You're so ridiculous.

272
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,380
Fatty, come back soon.

273
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,380
It's getting dark.

274
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,380
Is it

275
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,380
someone from the Jiuyu Flower?

276
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,380
Someone from the Jiuyu Flower

277
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,380
is still outside the village.

278
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,380
It's impossible for them.

279
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,380
Is it Aning?

280
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,380
He was always

281
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,380
following the bloodless one.

282
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,380
After this,

283
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,380
he disappeared into the shadow of the jungle.

284
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,380
Seeing us

285
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,380
doing things for Fatty Wang,

286
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,380
we couldn't have done it.

287
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,380
This is not his style.

288
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
There's still someone

289
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,380
who's coming to hunt water.

290
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,380
You're getting more and more

291
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,380
into the dense forest.

292
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,380
Now we're

293
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,380
clear on the enemy's case.

294
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,380
What do you think?

295
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,380
They're obviously

296
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,380
protecting the bloodless one.

297
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,380
As long as we keep an eye on the bloodless one,

298
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,380
we'll find the way out.

299
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,380
It's the Jiuyu Flower.

300
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,380
They're all old men.

301
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,380
We need to keep an eye on them.

302
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,380
I see.

303
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,380
Then come to the Jiuyu Flower tonight.

304
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,380
No.

305
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,380
Let him go to the bloodless one.

306
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,380
We'll clean up

307
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,380
the bloodless one

308
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,380
for protection.

309
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,380
I see.

310
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,380
I see.

311
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,380
Fatty.

312
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,380
Fatty.

313
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,380
Fatty.

314
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,380
Fatty.

315
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,380
Fatty.

316
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,380
Fatty.

317
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,380
Fatty.

318
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,380
Fatty.

319
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,380
Fatty.

320
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,380
You're waiting for someone

321
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,380
who's not here yet?

322
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,380
Let's kill him.

323
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,380
Maybe he's already here.

324
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,380
He's just hiding from us.

325
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,380
He's so strong.

326
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,380
Bring him here.

327
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,380
Good job.

328
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,380
You've got all their equipment?

329
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,380
I've got them all.

330
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,380
Are you crazy?

331
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,380
I'm going to the hospital.

332
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,380
I'm going to the hospital.

333
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,380
I'm going to the hospital.

334
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,380
I'm going to the hospital.

335
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,380
I'm going to the hospital.

336
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,380
I'm going to the hospital.

337
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,380
I'm going to the hospital.

338
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,380
I'm going to the hospital.

339
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,380
I'm going to the hospital.

340
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,380
I'm going to the hospital.

341
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,380
I'm going to the hospital.

342
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,380
I'm going to the hospital.

343
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,380
I'm going to the hospital.

344
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,380
I'm going to the hospital.

345
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,380
I'm going to the hospital.

346
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,380
I'm going to the hospital.

347
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,380
I'm going to the hospital.

348
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,380
I'm going to the hospital.

349
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,380
I'm going to the hospital.

350
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,380
I'm going to the hospital.

351
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,380
I'm going to the hospital.

352
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,380
I'm going to the hospital.

353
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,380
I'm going to the hospital.

354
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,380
I'm going to the hospital.

355
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,380
I'm going to the hospital.

356
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,380
I'm going to the hospital.

357
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,380
I'm going to the hospital.

358
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,380
I'm going to the hospital.

359
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,380
I'm going to the hospital.

360
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:58,380
I'm going to the hospital.

361
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,380
I'm going to the hospital.

362
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,380
I'm going to the hospital.

363
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,380
I'm going to the hospital.

364
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,380
The doctor has called.

365
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,380
He said she's home.

366
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,380
He has called?

367
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,380
He said so you don't have to see him.

368
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,380
I don't think so.

369
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,380
