00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's right.

3
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I think we should stop talking about these crazy things.

4
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I beg you.

5
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't want to talk about you.

6
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The Yellow Box.

7
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why did you bring us here?

8
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Because of the temperature.

9
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What color is it?

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yellow.

11
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yellow Box?

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's what Mr. Feng Shui said.

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes.

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The Yellow Box is not a real Yellow Box.

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's talk about this place.

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It was built by the Yaba Army.

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Including these railway tracks.

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The legend says that the Yellow Box

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
was built in the two realms of Yin and Yang.

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Do you remember?

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This railway has been connected to the back of the steps.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If the words of Mr. Wang are true,

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the entrance of the tomb is behind this.

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So the ancient tomb is the so-called Yin-Cao-Difu.

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Why are you so sure?

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's talk about this Yimbing.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He is the Yaba Army of the Northern Wei Times.

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They found this tomb at the beginning.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But they don't know why they came back.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They may never go out again.

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So they left the legend of the Yimbing.

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Wu, don't scare me.

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The so-called Dadao Team is all destroyed.

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We can't afford to die.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Are you stupid?

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If everyone dies,

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
where does this tomb come from?

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We will go down to the Yin-Cao-Difu.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Maybe we will find the exit.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Also, you have been in the area for over a thousand years.

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Our equipment is much stronger than that.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This... This...

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This kind of equipment?

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's enough.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The only thing I'm worried about is that we don't have a flashlight.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We can use a fire extinguisher to get water.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I have an idea.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's burn that fire team up a little bit.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Then we can use the fire light to swim.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If we can use the fire light to swim,

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
we can use it to swim.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We don't have a flashlight in the tomb.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We have to.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Take off your clothes.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Put some water on.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You are smart.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Bai Xiaosheng.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll go first.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm stronger than you.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll go first.

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll go first.

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
How about you?

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Be careful.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What's wrong?

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I can't swim.

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Are you cold?

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm cold.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm stronger than the fish.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't want to die.

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Hold on, Xia Langyang.

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Mother, this is...

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's cold.

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The sound of the water is coming.

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's coming.

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I can't hold on.

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Hold on, Xia Langyang.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Wait.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Go.

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Xia Langyang.

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Look, the sound is coming from the tomb.

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I can't hold on.

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There is a fire.

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Hurry up.

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Go.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Go.

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Give me your hand.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Come on.

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Lao Yang.

92
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Someone came here.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll check it out.

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Mother, be careful.

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Wu Xie.

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're awake.

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Where did you get the flashlight?

98
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I picked it up.

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Wu Xie, did you find any exit?

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I searched everywhere but didn't find the exit.

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Except for the entrance of our complex,

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
we only have this step left.

103
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So, we're not alone anymore.

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Should we swim back?

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We'll swim back.

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Should we swim back?

107
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Wu Xie.

108
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Wu Xie.

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Wu Xie, what are you doing?

110
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Time Goes on

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,560
Having them put into the sea while they were fighting,

112
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,280
for attaining the great body of the captain

113
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,000
passar by from the bottom of the water,

114
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,360
they say they will be a nation that has until the end

115
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,080
never to return to the voyage Pangong.

116
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,360
Theara is not usually

117
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,280
surrounded by freezing smokes

118
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,600
and tinyуда.

119
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,160
And besides,

120
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,000
the landline was still falls canted

121
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,840
the only line was Ararat river.

122
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,620
And with more than 2.2 million people

123
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,880
because of the ocean.

124
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,320
Yoo Emilyiى

125
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,360
U Grairy

126
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,600
Gu Xian

127
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Why did I turn to the same place?

128
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Is this the same waterfall?

129
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
This...

130
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
This color...

131
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Yes, the color is different from the previous one.

132
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Yes, I was thinking the same.

133
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Follow him!

134
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
There's a line!

135
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,600
The following scene

136
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
It's the same again.

137
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
What's wrong?

138
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
What's wrong?

139
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
What's wrong?

140
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Do you remember how many steps we've taken?

141
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Three.

142
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Yes.

143
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
What's wrong?

144
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
I don't remember.

145
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
I don't remember.

146
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
I don't remember.

147
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
I don't remember.

148
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Yes.

149
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
This is a trap that can be found by three steps.

150
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
It's impossible.

151
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
For someone who is not determined,

152
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
he will take this situation as a temporary situation

153
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
and put himself in danger or be trapped in it.

154
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
No, how can we get out now?

155
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Go.

156
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Trust me.

157
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
We'll get back here after two steps.

158
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Wu Xin!

159
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Go.

160
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Wu Xin!

161
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
What's this?

162
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
This is the truth.

163
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Go.

164
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Go to our hotel.

165
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Wu Xin, did you find the hotel?

166
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
The hotel?

167
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Didn't you say that there would be a hotel when you came back?

168
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
The hotel?

169
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
What should we do now?

170
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
We can't get out now.

171
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
This is the temporary situation.

172
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
But the smoke is still there.

173
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
What's the use of the smoke?

174
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Can it take us back?

175
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
No way.

176
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
I have to go to heaven now.

177
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I have to go to heaven now.

178
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
I have to go to heaven.

179
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,600
I have to go to heaven.

180
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
I have to go to heaven.

181
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
I have to go to heaven.

182
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
I have to go to heaven.

183
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
I have to go to heaven.

184
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
I have to go to heaven.

185
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
I'm going in join for a drink.

186
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,700
What are you doing?

187
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,680
Well, normal rain.

188
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,100
Here we go.

189
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,420
Uchi.

190
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,080
Uchi.

191
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,160
Who is that?

193
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,160
Latino!

194
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,440
This belongs to the most important officers of the Soviet Union.

195
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,240
They're not the most important скоро.

196
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,280
But they tried to prevent me from甜 us hEng yearly.

197
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,640
My country is darG.

198
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,560
There's more.

199
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,800
Do you understand?

200
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,540
I don't understand it.

201
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,160
Red Cистak

202
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,360
Only Fab hogy原 is Herausforder

203
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,300
And browser rejected

204
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,240
And pertains the thing we want

205
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,420
I know

206
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,200
I don't care

207
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,860
Whatever thelay

208
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,860
I'm sorry.

209
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,060
Mr. Liang.

210
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,220
Mr. Liang, it's you.

211
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,660
Where's Mr. Liang?

212
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,660
Mr. Liang, why are you here?

213
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,860
I met you here. You're my blessing.

214
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,260
Wu Xie, are you okay?

215
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,860
Mr. Liang, what happened?

216
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,860
Since the water was washed down by the water,

217
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,860
I fell down.

218
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,860
It was so dark on the way.

219
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,860
I was alone in the mountain.

220
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,860
Mr. Liang, what's the point?

221
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,860
After the water was washed down by the water,

222
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,860
I got lost.

223
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,860
After I woke up, I got here.

224
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,860
I got here.

225
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,860
I got here for a few dozen times.

226
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,860
I couldn't find the exit.

227
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,860
A few dozen times? Are you sure?

228
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,860
Really? I lied to you.

229
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,860
I really got here for a few dozen times.

230
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,860
Mr. Liang, is this your own handphone?

231
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,860
It's not mine.

232
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,860
I'm so envious.

233
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,860
I'm here for a few dozen times.

234
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,860
I'm like a mirror to the owner.

235
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,860
I can't find the exit.

236
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,860
I saw this handphone in the process.

237
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,860
I saw it in the same place.

238
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,860
I picked it up.

239
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,860
That's right.

240
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,860
If you found this handphone,

241
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,860
it would prove my deduction.

242
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,860
This handphone is a huge handphone.

243
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,860
And we need to find the place where it belongs.

244
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,860
That's the point of this handphone.

245
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:53,860
If you want to find it in such a big environment,

246
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,860
it's even harder than climbing.

247
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,860
According to my research on this wood,

248
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:07,860
this handphone must be located in a very secret place.

249
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,860
It's not in the wood.

250
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,860
It's not in the wood.

251
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,860
And that...

252
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:26,860
Little brother, why don't you jump down?

253
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,860
If you fall again, I'll kill you.

254
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,860
Okay.

255
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,860
I'm not talking.

256
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,860
Little brother, did he...

257
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,860
find that handphone?

258
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,860
Yes.

259
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,860
The handphone is here.

260
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,860
I've been killing people for so long.

261
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,860
Nothing will happen.

262
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,860
What's the matter?

263
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,860
What is it?

264
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,860
What's going on?

265
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,860
What's going on?

266
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,860
I found it!

267
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,860
I found it!

268
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,860
What did you find, little man?

269
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,860
No, be careful!

270
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,860
Look, how did the cloth break?

271
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,860
What's going on?

272
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,860
Little man, let's go!

273
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,860
Run!

274
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,860
Look!

275
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,860
Little man, let's go!

276
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,860
Let's go!

277
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,860
Hurry up!

278
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,860
Hurry up!

279
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,860
Let's go!

280
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,860
Let's go!

281
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,860
Let's go!

282
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,860
SIX DAYS LATER

283
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,960
Check it out!

284
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,860
Show how to use it.

285
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,860
In that time, you didn't shoot, you didn't shoot.

286
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,860
What about acting llegó ở handьhop, understand?

287
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,860
Do you know?

288
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,860
Well, it's been a long time.

289
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,860
Why haven't you left yet?

290
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,860
Tianzhen!

291
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,860
Tianzhen!

292
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,860
What's wrong?

293
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,860
Water?

294
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,860
Water!

295
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,860
Water again?

296
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,860
You said you were lost?

297
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,860
You're lost.

298
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,860
Sit down.

299
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,860
Take a break.

300
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,860
You're not taking a break?

301
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,860
I am.

302
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,860
Why not?

303
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,860
I have to.

304
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,860
It's just a plan.

305
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,860
I'll take the mouse and put it in the hole.

306
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,860
Tianzhen!

307
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,860
Where are you?

308
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,860
You missed me so much!

309
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,860
Tianzhen!

310
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,860
Look.

311
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,860
The bloodstains are on the door.

312
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,860
I'm telling you,

313
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,860
there's a mine in the mountain.

314
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,860
It affects the mine.

315
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,860
Or

316
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,860
it's not clean.

317
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,860
What should we do now?

318
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,860
I'm going back, too.

319
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,860
A big river,

320
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,860
a blue river.

321
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,860
It's like a river.

322
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,860
The stars in the sky are so beautiful.

323
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,860
So beautiful.

324
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,860
You're back.

325
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,860
What's up with the neighbor?

326
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,860
Lost track.

327
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,860
I'm not sure.

328
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,860
So?

329
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,860
I have to go.

330
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,860
Tianzhen!

331
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,860
I'm here to see you.

332
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,860
I'm here to see you.

333
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,860
I'm here to see you.

334
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,860
Where are you from?

335
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,860
Are you crazy?

336
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,860
You're right.

337
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,860
You look like you.

338
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,860
Your knack for both sides.

339
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,860
What the hell?

340
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,500
Are you crazy?

341
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,680
You wanna go?

342
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,140
Are you shaking me?

343
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,640
Close the woods,

344
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,840
and fight with me.

345
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,680
I will survive.

346
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,920
How did you do it?

347
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,360
He did it all on his own.

348
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,840
What's the first thing I got?

349
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,600
Do you think he should keep orders?

350
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,080
Stop what you're saying!

351
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,720
Don't lie.

352
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,560
Don't be so rude!

353
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,560
There is no such way.

354
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,560
If it's like this,

355
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,560
will it be a disaster?

356
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
No...

357
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
My lady,

358
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,560
the road ahead...

359
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
the road ahead...

360
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,560
You know it, you know it.

361
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:53,560
Let's not go back in this way.

362
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,560
Don't be so angry.

363
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,560
The road ahead...

364
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,560
is gone.

365
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,560
Stop talking nonsense.

366
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
I'll push you down.

367
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
My lady, look.

368
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
Who is he?

369
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Let me help you.

370
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
My lady,

371
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
why are you like this?

372
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
What's wrong with me?

373
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
My lady,

374
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,560
there is a big pit ahead.

375
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
I can't go there alone.

376
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,560
This...

377
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,560
You...

378
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
You have to help me.

379
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Give me your hand.

380
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
My lady,

381
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,560
you have to catch me.

382
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,560
My lady...

383
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,560
Are you okay?

384
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
I'm fine.

385
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
Mother.

386
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,560
I'll be back soon.

387
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,560
I'll see you in the morning.

388
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,560
I'll see you in the morning.

389
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
I'll be back soon.

390
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,560
Don't be so angry.

391
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
You're a good old man.

392
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,560
I'm your wife.

393
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,560
You are better than me.

394
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
I'm your wife.

395
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,560
I'm your wife.

396
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
I'm your wife.

397
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,560
I'm your wife.

398
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,560
You are my wife.

399
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,560
I'm your wife.

400
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,780
What's wrong? What's the big deal?

401
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,600
So Д

402
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,520
Action.

403
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,800
Don't ignore your mother!

404
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,200
She's mute!

405
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,380
Tar rebellion!

406
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,920
Kill him!

407
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,180
Eternalidan!

408
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,060
Excuse me, carol!

409
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,460
You, help peace!

410
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,060
Ra-Chen!

411
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
What's your name?

412
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Chuanhai Honshan, Zhanjia Bay.

413
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
What are you pretending to be?

414
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
That's called foreign chess.

415
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,560
This is called foreign foreign investment.

416
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,560
You became a traitor, you know?

417
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,560
Don't talk about the big brother.

418
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
We all do this.

419
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
Where are you going?

420
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,560
Fatty is a red-hearted man.

421
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
He's definitely a law-abiding citizen.

422
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,560
What do you think you know about me?

423
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
Your idea.

424
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,560
You brought me here.

425
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,560
How are you going to fool us?

426
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,560
What do you think?

427
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,560
Who knows what you're thinking about?

428
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,560
Tell me.

429
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
What are you doing?

430
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,560
I said you'd give me back the snake.

431
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,560
Snake fish? Moushanka fish?

432
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Are you hungry?

433
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Don't go. Come back.

434
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
You're so smart.

435
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,560
You're going to kill me.

436
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,560
You're going to kill me!

437
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
Why are you doing this?

438
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Use your brains.

439
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
Let's work together.

440
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,560
Let's work together.

441
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Xiaowan, let's have a talk here.

442
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Moushanka, listen to me.

443
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,560
Listen to me.

444
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,560
We three came here with different purposes.

445
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,560
But now we only have three of us left.

446
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,560
The next trip will be more and more difficult.

447
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,560
It may be dangerous at any time.

448
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,560
Lao Yang, you've been here before.

449
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,560
You know the terrain well.

450
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,560
Mr. Liang, you've been here for a long time.

451
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,560
You've been studying the archaeological sites.

452
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,560
I was just being punished by you.

453
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,560
That's why I came here.

454
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,560
But also, you know that

455
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,560
we can't escape from any of the three of us

456
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,560
with all our equipment.

457
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,560
So, the next trip

458
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,560
will be with us three.

459
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,560
Mr. Liang, do you agree?

460
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Xiaowan, I'm listening to you.

461
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:01,560
I'm lucky to meet you this time.

462
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,560
Actually, I think that

463
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,560
the two of you are really good friends.

464
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,560
That's why I'm here.

465
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,560
You're really good friends.

466
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,560
Lao Yang, what about you?

467
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,560
The next trip will be with us three.

468
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,560
I...

469
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,560
Okay, I agree.

470
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,560
I'll take the road next.

471
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,560
But I don't want you to be separated.

472
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,560
Okay.

473
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,560
Did you hear that? Xiaowan is taking care of me.

474
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,560
If you bully me again,

475
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,560
I'll tell her everything in your heart.

476
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,560
As you said,

477
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,560
everyone will die if you say so.

478
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,560
Lao Yang.

479
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Little... Little man.

480
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
Old man, slow down.

481
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,560
Be careful.

482
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,560
You'll get it.

483
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,560
We're walking now.

484
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,560
It's called Xuan Guan.

485
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,560
It's a Chinese-Nanfang ancient minority.

486
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,560
It's one of its Tibetan tribes.

487
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,560
It belongs to the kind of sheep.

488
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,560
It's a kind of sheep.

489
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,560
It's a kind of sheep.

490
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,560
Be careful.

491
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,560
It's on the cliff.

492
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,560
It's said it's a long...

493
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,560
My hand is so weak.

494
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,560
These cans may be dangerous.

495
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,560
Be careful.

496
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,560
Anyway, be careful.

497
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,560
Be careful.

498
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,560
I can't lift it.

499
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
You're so arrogant.

500
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,560
Look at you.

501
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,560
You're just a little bit of a fag.

502
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,560
You'll be fine in a minute.

503
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,560
You're very smart.

504
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,560
People abroad

505
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,560
don't know there's wood in the mountains.

506
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,560
Do you have the satellite in the sky?

507
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
Or are all of your family's

508
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,560
dogs and legs raised in China?

509
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,560
Clean your mouth.

510
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,560
There's a lot of wood in this wood.

511
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
No one can swallow it.

512
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,560
You're just here to see

513
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,560
your professionalism.

514
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Find the right things.

515
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,560
We're not here to be famous.

516
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,560
People in Tianzhen are here

517
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
to protect the culture.

518
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,560
That's all for us.

519
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
Three, seven, four, six.

520
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,560
Okay. We're all set.

521
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Three people?

522
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
One of them is a hidden criminal.

523
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,560
You can't just be a part of Tianzhen

524
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,560
and not be a part of it.

525
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,560
We have two comrades.

526
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
One is dead and the other is missing.

527
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,560
But you can't just be part of them.

528
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,560
At least you have to pay for the tuition.

529
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,560
I don't know them.

530
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,560
I'm not familiar with them.

531
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,560
You...

532
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Zhang Qilin, what do you think?

533
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
I don't need to cooperate with you.

534
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,560
You're right.

535
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Look at the little brother.

536
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,560
With our ability,

537
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,560
you're relying on us to take the land.

538
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,560
We're not the only ones

539
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,560
who can do that.

540
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,560
We're going to take your mother.

541
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,560
You're kidding me.

542
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
You're teasing me.

543
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,560
Then let's go our separate ways.

544
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,560
No.

545
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,560
What do you mean?

546
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,560
Let's go our separate ways.

547
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,560
Or I'll kill you.

548
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,560
Did Wu Xie and you come together?

549
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,560
You miss him?

550
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,560
Yang.

551
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,560
Mr. Liang, I remember you were five.

552
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,560
Did you call him Mr. Li?

553
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,560
Where is he?

554
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,560
Why didn't you see him?

555
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,560
Don't mention it.

556
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
He's too smart.

557
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,560
When we came down from the mine,

558
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,560
he suddenly washed his face by the river.

559
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,560
He spit out a big fish and his head was blown away.

560
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,560
No.

561
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,560
He was just bitten to death.

562
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,560
Did you two...

563
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,560
No.

564
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,560
My friend was hit by a big fish.

565
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,560
He even took the brandy.

566
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,560
What's the name of this boss?

567
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,560
Mr. Li and Mr. Wang came from Guangdong.

568
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,560
Mr. Li is called Li Pi.

569
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,560
Mr. Wang is called Wang Qi.

570
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,560
The local ancient system is very famous.

571
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:37,560
Mr. Li's family is a copy of the ancient history of the ancestors.

572
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,560
It's said that this is the book of the royal family

573
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,560
and the book of the royal army.

574
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,560
It's written in a large number of ancient books.

575
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,560
Mr. Wang is the eldest of the dynasty.

576
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
Do you know what the dynasty is?

577
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,560
It's a high-level item in the shop.

578
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,560
It's made of solid solid solid solid.

579
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,560
The general general of the shop is the most protected person in the world.

580
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,560
It's said that it's a rare item.

581
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,560
That's right.

582
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,560
Mr. Wang is a very good person.

583
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,560
Mr. Wang's ancestor, Wang Xianchu, is like this.

584
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,560
He wrote a book called

585
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,560
The Way of the Ancient Jade.

586
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,560
It's written on it.

587
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,560
It's a treasure.

588
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,560
It's detailed.

589
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,560
The owner's information and his judgment.

590
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,560
So, this book is very valuable to the archaeologists?

591
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,560
A small person is a cultured person.

592
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,560
If this book is in the hands of a small person,

593
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:56,560
it will definitely be useful for the archaeology culture of our country.

594
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,560
You can continue.

595
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,560
No need to send me a horse.

596
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,560
Well, Mr. Wang,

597
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,560
although he is not very good at culture,

598
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,560
his memory is very good.

599
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,560
He wrote all the contents of this book.

600
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,560
Once, at a exchange meeting,

601
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,560
he saw a white jade poem.

602
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,560
It's like a box on the notebook.

603
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,560
It's very similar.

604
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,560
So, according to the notebook,

605
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,560
he put this white jade poem in the tea water.

606
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,560
After a long time,

607
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,560
the white jade poem opened its mouth.

608
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,560
It spit out a golden leaf.

609
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,560
It gave the whole work to Zheng.

610
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,560
From then on,

611
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,560
it would be famous and unbearable.

612
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,560
So, what is the secret of this book?

613
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,560
The notebook of the great court of the Wangs.

614
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,560
These two people are really close.

615
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,560
That's right.

616
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,560
I also met them this time.

617
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,560
I came to see the warm-up and the meeting.

618
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,560
But they used to work together.

619
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,560
They did a lot of great things.

620
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,560
They are very good.

621
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,560
The first one is the first one.

622
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,560
The second one is the first one.

623
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,560
The third one is the first one.

624
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,560
The fourth one is the first one.

625
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,560
The fifth one is the first one.

626
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,560
The fifth one is the first one.

627
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,560
The fifth one is the first one.

628
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,560
The fifth one is the first one.

629
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,560
The fifth one is the first one.

630
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,560
The fifth one is the first one.

631
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,560
The fifth one is the first one.

632
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,560
The fifth one is the first one.

633
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,560
The fifth one is the first one.

634
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,560
The fifth one is the first one.

635
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,560
The fifth one is the first one.

636
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,560
The fifth one is the first one.

637
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,560
The fifth one is the first one.
