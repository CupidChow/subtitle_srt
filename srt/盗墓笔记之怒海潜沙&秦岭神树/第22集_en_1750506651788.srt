00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,680
what impatient

2
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,940
You give out

3
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,840
vais publisher Bibli yanlış

4
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,120
But it's boring

5
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,840
what you will spend money on

6
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,480
idan

7
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Come on.

8
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Give me your hand.

9
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Be careful.

10
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't move.

11
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Are you okay, Ranya?

12
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Be careful.

13
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This way.

14
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
How are you?

15
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
My fire is gone.

16
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Put down your rope.

17
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Come on.

18
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Come on.

19
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Ranya.

20
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
My fire is gone.

21
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
How are you?

22
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Come on.

23
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hurry up.

24
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hurry up.

25
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hurry up.

26
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Hurry up.

27
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Liang Xun, did you see the box?

28
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I did.

29
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The rope is tied.

30
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Tie it up.

31
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay.

32
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Pull it.

33
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Pull it.

34
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay.

35
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
One, two, three.

36
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Three.

37
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Three.

38
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Three.

39
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't let go of my hand.

40
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
My life.

41
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What are you doing?

42
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm scared to death.

43
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't let go of my hand.

44
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I saw something.

45
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's gone.

46
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Come on.

47
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Hurry up.

48
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Come on.

49
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Hurry up.

50
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
One, two, three.

51
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
One, two, three.

52
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
One, two, three.

53
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
One, two, three.

54
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
One, two, three.

55
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
One, two, three.

56
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Liang.

57
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What's that?

58
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's not clear.

59
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why don't you pull it?

60
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Pull it.

61
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Pull it.

62
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Come on.

63
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hurry up.

64
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Liang Xun, give me your hand.

65
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Give me your hand.

66
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Give me your hand.

67
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't be angry.

68
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Let me untie the rope.

69
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Untie the rope.

70
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Don't touch it.

71
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I didn't do it.

72
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Hurry up.

73
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Go.

74
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Hurry up.

75
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Hurry up.

76
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Hurry up.

77
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Be careful.

78
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Wait, old man.

79
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm dying.

80
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What's wrong?

81
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What's wrong?

82
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What's wrong?

83
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What's wrong?

84
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What's wrong?

85
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What's wrong?

86
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Hurry up.

87
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Hurry up.

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't move.

89
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Hurry up.

90
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Liang, run.

91
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's a ghost.

92
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's a ghost.

93
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's a ghost.

94
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's a ghost.

95
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Come on.

96
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Fatty.

97
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Come on.

98
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Come on.

99
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Come on.

100
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Come on.

101
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's a ghost.

102
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
How did I know?

103
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Run.

104
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Come on.

105
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Fatty, be careful.

106
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Come on.

107
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Come on.

108
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Come on.

109
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Come on.

110
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Wu Xie, are you okay?

111
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Who is he?

112
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Why are you here?

113
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Wu Xie.

114
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You're back.

115
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm not your friend.

116
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
By the way,

117
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I've read a novel before.

118
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's said that ancient civilization trained the stars to be the cranes.

119
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Could it be that the community also trained a group of stars?

120
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's dangerous here.

121
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Let's go.

122
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Let's go.

123
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Let's go to see Mr. Liang.

124
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Why are you still taking a shower?

125
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What is this?

126
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Could it be the community they said?

127
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Wu Xie.

128
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Do you think we can still use this useless code?

129
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's useless at all.

130
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And we're a rebel.

131
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Since he can't leave now,

132
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
let's take a break here.

133
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Okay?

134
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What's wrong with you?

140
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What's wrong with you?

141
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Wake up.

142
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Where are you going?

143
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'll go.

144
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Go, go, go. I'll do it myself.

145
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'll go to the train station. Don't worry.

146
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Go, go, go.

147
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Are you going forward?

148
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Brother.

149
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Mother.

150
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
There's a hole behind you.

151
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I think...

152
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I think I saw a friend.

153
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Are you...

154
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Are you tired?

155
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Drink some water.

156
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I have.

157
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You brought it yourself.

158
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Lao Yang, I'll go to the dormitory and have a rest.

159
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Brother.

160
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Brother.

161
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Brother.

162
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I think I saw a bloodless man.

163
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Where?

164
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Where?

165
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Where?

166
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But he's not here.

167
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I saw him and he's not here.

168
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What's wrong with you?

169
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You're blind.

170
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Or you're like us, you're a illusion.

171
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Those stars won't follow us, right?

172
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Brother.

173
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Wu Xie.

174
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Wu Xie.

175
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Let's go.

176
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I think the King of Jin will come.

177
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I have no feelings.

178
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,400
I'm not feeling well.

179
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,480
I'm really out of energy.

180
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,120
You're a stubborn old man.

181
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,600
Take care of him.

182
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Okay.

183
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,480
What do you say?

184
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,000
Rest for a while.

185
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Jin Mao is here. I'll wait.

186
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,400
Thank you, miss.

187
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,720
Thank you.

188
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:08,520
Simon

189
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,920
What…what is it?

190
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,480
Did you saw it?

191
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,920
What was that?

192
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,080
We haven't seen it.

193
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,740
Could it be the monkey?

194
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,600
No.

195
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,320
Their steroids are not so fast.

196
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,200
Oh…

197
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,200
What is this?

198
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
You...

199
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Who...

200
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Wu... Wu Xie.

201
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
What's wrong?

202
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Blood.

203
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
What's going on?

204
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Don't rest.

205
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Go.

206
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Go.

207
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Go.

208
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Go.

209
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Uncle.

210
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Don't... Don't go.

211
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Uncle, it's just the upper body.

212
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
The lower body fell down.

213
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,200
Who... Who did this?

214
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
Why is Xia Rou so cruel?

215
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
These twigs look very good.

216
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
If the person is in the process of falling,

217
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
the height and the speed of the fall are enough,

218
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,200
then these twigs are like the blades of a wind.

219
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
Then... Then how high is this tree?

220
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Then I'll ask you, Lao Yang.

221
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,200
I... I... Why are you asking me again?

222
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
I really don't know.

223
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
You've been pretending to be a ghost all along.

224
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Don't you tell the truth?

225
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,200
I... I... I really don't know.

226
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,200
At this time, let's not get into trouble.

227
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
There's no way out.

228
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Let's find another way out.

229
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Look.

230
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
The tree is covered with blood.

231
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Look.

232
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
There's blood here too.

233
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Look.

234
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Here.

235
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Here.

236
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Here.

237
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Look.

238
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Look.

239
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Look.

240
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
Look.

241
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Look.

242
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Look.

243
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Look.

244
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Look.

245
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Look.

246
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Look.

247
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Look.

248
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Look.

249
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Look.

250
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Actually...

251
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
I've always had this question.

252
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Such a great greenskicker.

253
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
What exactly is his work?

254
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
It's related to the guitar that you found

255
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,240
It doesn't mean affected, but Turbanist화.

256
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,760
Which is why they can't cockpit any suitably VISTA.

257
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,240
The casing can be removed.

258
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,920
How can it be, such a accessory?

259
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,560
If the Myanmar��도 believes this,

260
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,840
its mechanics will be chase after.

261
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,560
yuan.

262
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,160
кольку it can be controlled by air force

263
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,080
all meringue.

264
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,320
Even the military poder can effectively play leader.

265
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,320
I think it's a good idea to use the same technique as the other one.

266
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,320
You mean the people of the society found this green tree

267
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,320
and put it into their mind and put the mark on it?

268
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,320
But in the West, green trees are not used to mark, right?

269
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
Yes.

270
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,320
But I think the original function of these patterns

271
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,320
is still a mark.

272
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Although the mark of the West is not so terrible,

273
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,320
it is still a mark.

274
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,320
The difference between the mark and the mark

275
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,320
is not the difference between the mark and the mark.

276
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
For example, the soil is filled with people.

277
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,320
The fire god is burned to death.

278
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,320
The river god is thrown into the river.

279
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,320
I think it's a big green tree.

280
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
They should be considered

281
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,320
as the gods of the forest.

282
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,320
It's possible that they are the gods of the forest.

283
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,320
Usually, such gods are used to mark.

284
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,320
Look, this blood has been flowing down.

285
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,320
If it wasn't for the scientific design,

286
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
it wouldn't have been so smooth.

287
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,320
And the blood on these trees

288
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,320
should be the mark of the mark.

289
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,320
That is to say,

290
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,320
the mark should be on the tree

291
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,320
and be put to death.

292
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,320
The blood has been flowing down

293
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320
and the mark has been flowing to the tree roots.

294
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,320
In this way, it's like the god's mark.

295
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,320
So, it's not strange that the mark is so deep.

296
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,320
But the mark should be filled.

297
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,320
It's like the blood is flowing down.

298
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,320
Stop!

299
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
Liang Xun.

300
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Why is he like this?

301
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Liang Xun.

302
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
Thank you.

303
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
Thank you.

304
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
Wu Xie, Wu Xie.

305
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
Well.

306
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,320
You haven't introduced

307
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
this pretty girl yet.

308
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
Her name is A Ning.

309
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
A Ning.

310
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,320
Her name is so good.

311
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,320
How did you know each other?

312
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
We've been sharing more and more.

313
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
It's not easy to get along.

314
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,320
There are some secrets on the tree.

315
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,320
It's easy to climb.

316
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,320
It's more than two meters apart.

317
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,320
We're not going to have a high-altitude landing.

318
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
If it's easy to climb,

319
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,320
how will the tree fall?

320
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,320
I don't know.

321
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
It fell on its own.

322
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
Or someone pushed it down.

323
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,320
Isn't there a boss up there?

324
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,320
No way.

325
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
I'm sure there is.

326
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,320
I've seen a lot of people like you.

327
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,320
It's a bit strange to climb up.

328
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,320
I haven't found it yet.

329
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,320
How can I climb up?

330
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,320
You must be on the tree.

331
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,320
What?

332
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
What's wrong?

333
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,320
We're going to climb up anyway.

334
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
It's too troublesome to climb up and down.

335
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Let's find another way out.

336
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,320
Let's split up.

337
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,320
I'll go with Wu Xie.

338
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,320
Stop.

339
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,320
Wu Xie will go with me.

340
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,320
Take her with you.

341
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Okay.

342
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,320
Well...

343
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,320
You...

344
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
You go find Lu first.

345
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
I'll stay here for a while.

346
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:34,320
Ning, did you see Xiao Ge just now?

347
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,320
Didn't you come together?

348
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,320
No.

349
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,320
Maybe I was wrong.

350
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Actually,

351
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,320
I want to ask you a question.

352
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,320
After you came out of the water,

353
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,320
why didn't you say goodbye?

354
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,320
We're not the same kind of people.

355
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,320
Why did you come to me?

356
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

357
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,320
You dare not admit that we're friends?

358
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
Come on, let's shake hands.

359
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
Hurry up.

360
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,320
Don't be so anxious.

361
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,320
Come on, let's shake hands.

362
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,320
Slow down.

363
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,320
Let's go.

364
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,320
I'm a blood sister to you.

365
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
I'm a dog.

366
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
A dog.

367
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,320
You...

368
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,320
What are you looking for?

369
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
Old man, don't talk nonsense.

370
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
If you want me to be Wu Xie,

371
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
I'll kill you.

372
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
What's wrong?

373
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Old man, come and save me.

374
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,320
You're a good man.

375
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,320
You're a good man.

376
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,320
You have to beg me.

377
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,320
Don't talk nonsense.

378
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,320
Come and save me.

379
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
I beg you.

380
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,320
You're bullying me on the way.

381
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
You, stop for a while.

382
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,320
Hurry up.

383
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,320
Old man, come on.

384
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,320
You want me to save you, right?

385
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,320
Okay.

386
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
You promised me a condition.

387
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,320
Okay.

388
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,320
Say it.

389
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,320
Tell me the secret of this tree.

390
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
I'll save you right away.

391
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,320
Okay.

392
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
I'll tell you.

393
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,320
You...

394
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
You have to die here.

395
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
Okay.

396
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
You're still a good man.

397
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
Come on.

398
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,320
No, no, no.

399
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,320
I'm a secret.

400
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,320
Enough.

401
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,320
Come on.

402
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,320
I want to save him.

403
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Really.

404
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
I'm a little worried.

405
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,320
I'm afraid that my body is not only going to save him,

406
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,320
but also going to kill myself.

407
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,320
Lao Yang, don't be angry.

408
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,320
It's okay.

409
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
It's really okay.

410
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,320
Wu Xie, I'll talk to Mr. Liao.

411
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Mr. Liao.

412
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,320
I'm sorry.

413
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
This is...

414
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,320
...only...

415
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,320
Don't tell anyone.

416
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,320
What...

417
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
What is this?

418
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,320
Mr. Liao.

419
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,320
What did he say?

420
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,320
He...

421
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,320
He...

422
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,320
He didn't say anything.

423
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,320
Really.

424
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,320
I don't know what he's doing.

425
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,320
What's going on?

426
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,320
Hurry up.

427
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,320
Hurry up.

428
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,320
What's going on?

429
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,320
He's got a hair.

430
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Maybe he's got a hair loss because of some reason.

431
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,320
It's like he's got a skin disease.

432
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
It's disgusting.

433
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
Oh, my God.

434
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,320
What's going on?

435
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
Is it a mask or...

436
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,320
How can it be in the flesh?

437
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
It's a mask.

438
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
How can it be in the flesh?

439
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
It's like it's growing together.

440
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
It's like...

441
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
...a breathable breath.

442
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
It's so hard to say.

443
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
This mask...

444
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
...makes them grow in the flesh.

445
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,320
They can cover their eyes with a mask.

446
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,320
They can use some method to see things.

447
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,320
Look at the pattern on it.

448
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,320
It's exactly the same as the pattern on the tree.

449
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,320
It must be related to the person who made the bronze book.

450
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,320
Put it down.

451
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,320
What's wrong?

452
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,320
I...

453
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
I'm alive.

454
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,320
Mr. Liang, what's going on?

455
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,320
I'm so ashamed.

456
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,320
I didn't expect it.

457
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,320
This bronze book...

458
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,320
...and the method of death...

459
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,320
...are all about the people who killed us.

460
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,320
It's not the people who killed us.

461
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,320
I'm so ashamed.

462
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
I'm so ashamed.

463
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
Just say it.

464
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,320
Well...

465
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,320
Listen to me.

466
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,320
I'll tell you.

467
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,320
Well...

468
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,320
I've been talking about it since...

469
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
Mr. Liang, don't worry.

470
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,320
Think about it.

471
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
Okay.

472
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,320
Well...

473
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,320
The blood of the devil...

474
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,320
...was not recorded in the history of the Han family.

475
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,320
But some minority people...

476
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,320
...were able to find out...

477
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,320
...that the period of Xizhou...

478
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,320
...was the slave society.

479
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,320
But there was also the study of the culture of the Xizhou...

480
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,320
...and the technology of the Yan family.

481
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,320
So, in some of the books...

482
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,320
...of the minority people,

483
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,320
Xizhou has a clear characteristic.

484
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,320
You mean...

485
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
...the bronze book...

486
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
...was not the leader of the Xizhou...

487
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
...but the leader of the minority people?

488
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
That's right.

489
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,320
The history of the minority people...

490
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,320
...is very mysterious.

491
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,320
Some of the books...

492
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,320
...will also use the magic of the tribe.

493
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,320
You'll protect their leader...

494
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
...and not the external enemies.

495
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,320
The fact that they attacked our great star...

496
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,320
...is the fact that they attacked the outsiders...

497
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,320
...with the magic of the spirit of the spirit.

498
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,320
I'm so surprised.

499
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,320
How did he get so close to the mask?

500
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,320
How did he get close to the mask?

501
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,320
How did he get close?

502
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
What is this?

503
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,360
It's a mushroom.

504
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,320
It normalizes animaluda.

505
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,320
You get used to it easily...

506
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,320
Those tofu,

507
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,320
will ran to freedom in battle asumpuic.

508
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,320
The monkey has been in the pit for a long time.

509
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,320
This is new.

510
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,320
It's been in the pit for a long time.

511
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,320
Then the monkey group is in the room,

512
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
the open-air bridge is not home yet.

513
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,320
It's in the warehouse.

514
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
Where is the new chief?

515
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
We are the two chiefs.

516
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,320
We can't separate them.

517
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,320
Go, go, go.

518
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,320
This is the first time I heard about the bone.

519
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,320
What does this bug look like?

520
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
It's still alive.

521
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
What's so strange?

522
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,320
The bone is still alive.

523
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,320
It's still alive.

524
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,320
What's so strange?

525
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
There are many kinds of insects.

526
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,320
Some of them can indeed enter the dead.

527
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Under the conditions of suitable conditions,

528
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,320
they will revive.

529
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,320
It's very difficult to eat fruit.

530
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,320
If it's revived, it will be troublesome.

531
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,320
We still have to prevent the owner

532
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,320
from any liver, dust, and moon people.

533
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,320
Wu Xie, I'll go to the front to check the road.

534
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,320
Don't forget, the Grand Uncle fell down from the top.

535
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,320
Maybe Boss Wang is here.

536
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,320
Be careful.

537
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,320
Okay, it's okay.

538
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,320
Wu Xie, there is a case.

539
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
I'll shoot a signal bullet.

540
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,320
What's going on?

541
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,320
Come, come and see.

542
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,320
What's this?

543
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,320
Lao Yang.

544
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,320
Wu Xie, come here.

545
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,320
Lao Yang, what's wrong?

546
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,320
There is something here.

547
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
Look.

548
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,320
Look.

549
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,320
It's all alive.

550
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
What should we do?

551
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
How can we go there?

552
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
Don't panic.

553
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,320
Look at the insects.

554
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,320
They must be afraid of light and heat.

555
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
If we light the fire,

556
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,320
they might not dare to come near us.

557
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,320
The signal bullet's brightness and brightness

558
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,320
are very high.

559
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,320
They are different from the fire.

560
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,320
Don't forget the monkeys.

561
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,320
They are not afraid of the signal bullet.

562
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,320
The fire is just a few times away.

563
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,320
Exactly.

564
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,320
If we can't go there,

565
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,320
we'll be surrounded.

566
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,320
We'll be dead.

567
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,320
What should we do?

568
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,320
Wu Xie.

569
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,320
What should we do?

570
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,320
What should we do?

571
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,320
The wind is blowing.

572
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,320
The wind is blowing.

573
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,320
