00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh my god!

3
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Lady Mozu, this is a mirror!

4
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh my god! This is so beautiful!

5
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There's such a beautiful place inside!

6
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's so incredible!

7
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is the whole mirror!

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's so beautiful!

9
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Look! This is the Night Pearl!

10
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So beautiful!

11
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The Night Pearl is actually blinded by the 50 stars?

12
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh my god!

13
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Lady Mozu, this is so beautiful!

14
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Lady Mozu, what are you looking at?

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:22,920
This should be the appearance of the sky in the

16
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,920
whole world!

17
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Yes!

18
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
That's right! It's so amazing!

19
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,920
Come and help me out!

20
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
I want to see it!

21
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Come on!

22
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Slow down!

23
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
What's wrong?

24
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,920
There's a world here!

25
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
That's right!

26
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,920
Zhang Qi Ling, what are you doing here?

27
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
Why are you fighting for this?

28
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,520
What the hell are you doing?

29
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,760
Or why are you so calm in the valley?

30
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,160
What's the purpose of your wedding?

31
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,040
Sister Wen, what's going on?

32
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,080
I don't care.

33
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,800
Look.

34
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,160
There's nothing here.

35
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,080
'' fall here by fire ''

36
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,600
'' I'd like to cover them for you ''

37
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,560
'' You are afraid? ''

38
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,760
'' You are afraid? ''

39
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,000
I think I've stopped there.

40
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,000
Then I'd rather become a woman.

41
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,720
You're coming home!

42
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,480
You've dreamt of becoming a woman.

43
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,240
So quite as to go on Return to heaven.

44
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,240
You go on. I'll deal with him.

45
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,240
How is it?

46
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Golden Sword.

47
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
How is it?

48
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
Don't be afraid.

49
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
What's going on?

50
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
Master!

51
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,240
Master!

52
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,240
Everyone, stay calm.

53
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Don't move.

54
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Go!

55
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
Go!

56
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
Go!

57
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Go!

58
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Go!

59
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
Go!

60
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Go!

61
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Go!

62
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Go!

63
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
Go!

64
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
Go!

65
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
Go!

66
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Go!

67
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Go!

68
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
Go!

69
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Go!

70
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
Go!

71
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Go!

72
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Go!

73
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
This is the shadow.

74
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,240
I'm glad to find this wall from a special angle.

75
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,240
The walls and the walls have formed this pattern.

76
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,240
That's right.

77
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
Everyone, don't panic.

78
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
This is a scientific phenomenon.

79
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
What is this drawing?

80
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Xiao Zhang, what did you find?

81
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
It seems to be a painting of a master.

82
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,240
It looks like a play of the Celestial Palace.

83
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
Look.

84
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,240
This palace is actually built on a very steep hill.

85
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
The hill is misty.

86
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
It's surrounded by the whole palace.

87
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
It's like it's on the clouds.

88
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Really?

89
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,240
It looks like a snow mountain.

90
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Look!

91
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Is that white snow on it?

92
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
The mountain is very high.

93
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
But I don't know which one.

94
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
It seems to be a high-rise.

95
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
The head is on my body.

96
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,240
These people are the ones who were buried, right?

97
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
So this is the Celestial Palace?

98
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
This is the tomb?

99
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,240
Who is the person who is in the coffin?

100
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,240
I don't think I've seen this historical record.

101
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
Me neither.

102
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Who is it?

103
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Why did you find the fire on this road?

104
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
It must be the Celestial Palace.

105
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,240
After the burial ceremony, they put the fire on it.

106
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,240
They destroyed the only road in the Celestial Palace.

107
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,240
If no one is there, the tomb will be safe.

108
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,240
But they can't even get out of here.

109
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,240
The Celestial Palace is surrounded by the dead bodies of the Celestial Palace.

110
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,240
The feudal society is too cruel.

111
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Why did the Celestial Palace disappear?

112
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Could it be that it's really on the sky?

113
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
This must be the Snow Mountain.

114
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
The Celestial Palace is surrounded by it.

115
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Can't you see it?

116
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
No.

117
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,240
It's the whole mountain covered by the snow.

118
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
Then this whole mountain

119
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
will become the tomb of the Huozhen Stone?

120
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
It's not a new season.

121
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
It's a great honor to bring the human spirit to the palace.

122
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
It's all fate.

123
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,240
I think the Huozhen Stone is also a part of the Yu Huai.

124
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,240
It seems that even if we find the Celestial Palace,

125
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
it will be hard to get it out.

126
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
I'm not afraid.

127
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
I believe that technology will be more and more developed.

128
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,240
We will find the Celestial Palace one day.

129
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Yes.

130
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
This one.

131
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
What's wrong?

132
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Someone's inside!

133
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
What's going on?

134
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Someone's inside!

135
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Who's there? Come out!

136
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
It's Wu San Xing!

137
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
I saw his face!

138
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Are you sure it's San Xing?

139
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,240
Can you see it clearly?

140
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
I... I only saw his face!

141
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
It's okay.

142
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:15,240
...

143
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:27,240
...

144
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,440
I'm scared.

145
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,360
What are you scared of? There are so many of us.

146
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,280
It's okay. Let's go together.

147
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,080
That old womangirl!

148
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,480
What are you doing here, woman?

149
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,120
Are you all right?

150
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,120
alien

151
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,440
Are you doing badly

152
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,880
Bubiblist

153
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,960
Don't make sound

154
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,640
and get inside

155
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,360
OK

156
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
Why is there water?

157
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:07,460
D buzzing

158
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,720
Whicion result will she get?

159
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,120
What such a weird response.

160
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,340
It's incredible

161
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,840
It's incredible

162
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,480
Suddenly you cry

163
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,040
And describe your drawing

164
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,200
It's beautiful

165
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,200
Not only about the dream, I don't even remember myself.

166
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Until a few months later,

167
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,400
I've been thinking about some of Lin Cui's shortcomings.

168
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,400
And after a few years, I've found that I've got some problems.

169
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,400
I don't remember the reason.

170
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,400
But three months ago, I met your uncle.

171
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
I think he's very strict.

172
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,200
I wanted to know more about myself, so I married you guys to the Seven Stars Dragon Palace.

173
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,200
There, I found that your uncle had some problems.

174
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:40,200
No, Ping'er. You said that you lost your memory after you came out of the sea.

175
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Maybe it's because of the smell of the organs here.

176
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
You've caused a hallucination.

177
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,200
So before you fainted, you didn't see my uncle.

178
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
It has nothing to do with my uncle.

179
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,200
The Golden Thread Embroidery you got from the Golden Thread Embroidery is fake.

180
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
It's true.

181
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
I'm not sure.

182
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,200
But the Golden Thread Embroidery you got from the Golden Thread Embroidery is fake.

183
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,200
It's true. You've already lost your memory.

184
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Li Youping,

185
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,200
how do I remember that you lost your memory?

186
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
No, it's your uncle.

187
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
He and Da Kui.

188
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,200
They were able to hit the coffin directly from behind.

189
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,200

194
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
It's impossible.

195
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
It's a dream.

196
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Think about it.

197
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
How many things did your uncle hide from you?

198
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
He lied to you.

199
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,200
You must know how many things your uncle didn't do right.

200
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
How about my uncle?

201
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
I know better than anyone else.

202
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
He can't have me killed.

203
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
If it's really your uncle,

204
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
he won't harm you.

205
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
But...

206
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
What do you mean?

207
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,200
You're talking about a fraud.

208
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,200
No matter who says it's true or not,

209
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,200
we have to wait until we get out.

210
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,200
You just want to stay here and stay here.

211
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,200
You can talk to the old lady in the office.

212
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
You can talk about the truth.

213
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Yes.

214
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Let Fatty dress up.

The Golden Thread Embroidery

217
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Fatty, you're really blind.

218
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
You're a girl.

219
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
You know what?

220
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
This is called a man's harmony.

221
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
At this moment, I'm the beautiful woman.

222
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,200
The beautiful woman is me.

223
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,200
The door is open.

224
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
Open.

225
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
Open.

226
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Okay.

227
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Fatty, I'm asking you.

228
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Shouldn't you go to the Palace of Heaven?

229
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,200
We can't just sit here and wait for the night pig.

230
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
It's good to have a few night pigs.

231
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
You're right.

232
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
I knew it.

233
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,200
When did you come to the Palace of Heaven?

234
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
You're wronged.

235
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
I have a plan for Fatty.

236
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Didn't Yabozhang say that the stone is upper floor.

237
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,200
Plus, the room with the wall is very high.

238
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Plus, the top floor is ten meters high.

239
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
How deep is the whole tomb?

240
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,200
If we want to go out, we have to go down from the top floor.

241
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,200
We have three ways to go out.

242
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
The first way is to go back the original way.

243
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,200
But we can't figure out the changes in the past.

244
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,200
I don't know if we can go back to the beginning.

245
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,200
The second way is to repair the tomb.

246
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,200
It will be a secret passage to prevent the burial.

247
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
But the secret passage is to the sea.

248
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
This is the problem before us.

249
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
The sea is so deep that there is no oxygen.

250
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
We can't go up there.

251
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
It's not like the cliff is also a hole.

252
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
So we can't go up there.

253
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,200
The third way is to go out.

254
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
It seems to be on the line.

255
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,200
When we just entered the tomb, I saw the water pressure.

256
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,200
At that time, our water level was only 13 meters.

257
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,200
The current water level is just above the tomb.

258
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
The water level is just above the tomb.

259
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,200
So we can't go up to 30 meters.

260
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
So...

261
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,200
The room with the sky-drying model is just below the sea level.

262
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
We can't go up to 10 meters.

263
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
We have a chance to go out.

264
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Fatty, you can do it.

265
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
You finally said something.

266
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
I'm not going up there.

267
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Stop pretending to be my mom.

268
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Stop wasting time.

269
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
Fine.

270
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
I won't bother you anymore.

271
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
By the way, I'm warning you.

272
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,200
If you really go in there, don't run away.

273
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
If you have a chance to go out,

274
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
you can't just die and die.

275
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
That's a bad idea.

276
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
The last warning.

277
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Don't touch the night table.

278
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
The last warning.

279
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
The last warning.

280
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
The last warning.

281
00:23:46,200 --> 00:24:15,240
okolade

282
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,560
You mean it's not even open?

283
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,240
Don't you love me anymore?

284
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,840
Not even me.

285
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,920
Will you go and ask for it?

286
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,240
Absolutely not.

287
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,200
I have promised you

288
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,240
I'm going to kill you.

289
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,240
I'm going to kill you.

290
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,240
I'm going to kill you.

291
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
Sofia

292
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,140
Yan Ming Chu

293
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,720
Yan Ming Chu

294
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,120
Yan Ming Chu

295
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,340
Yan Ming Chu

296
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,960
Yan Ming Chu

297
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,000
Yan Ming Chu

298
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,340
I bet the owner's crush is low-χa-rib action.

299
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,620
It is?

300
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm not shocked to see it.

301
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,840
The man is actually the local official.

302
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,340
Don't think he's the previous policeman.

303
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:59,480
St нужно

304
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,340
I guess it's a small town.

305
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,340
I guess it's not that big.

306
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,340
It's not certain.

307
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,340
He must have his reason for this.

308
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,340
After all, it's a shipyard.

309
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,340
There is a limit to space.

310
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,340
To make it more dangerous,

311
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,340
we have to save space here.

312
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,340
Besides,

313
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,340
if it's a child or a beast,

314
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,340
who can imagine a fat man?

315
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,340
Yes.

316
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,340
The ancient machine is a part of the modern world.

317
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,340
Fat man must be the first to talk about the body.

318
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,340
But that's money.

319
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,340
I'm not losing weight.

320
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,340
It's really...

321
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,340
No, this...

322
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,340
You're not losing weight.

323
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,340
Just now, you said you were stuck in the car.

324
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,340
No, this wall is a problem.

325
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,340
No, the wall is a temporary home.

326
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,340
Let's go back first.

327
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,340
Let's go.

328
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,340
No, you have to find a way.

329
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,340
Otherwise, the guys are here.

330
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,340
They'll get cold.

331
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,340
Let's go back.

332
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,340
Maybe there's a trap.

333
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,340
It's too late.

334
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,340
Go up.

335
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,340
Go!

336
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,340
Hurry up, fat man!

337
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,340
Go!

338
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,340
Wait for me!

339
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,340
Come on!

340
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,340
Go!

341
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,340
Come on!

342
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,340
It's so dangerous.

343
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,340
I told you, I don't want to be killed by a snake.

344
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,340
I don't want to be a demon.

345
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,340
Thank you, Your Highness.

346
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
He's a big man.

347
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,340
Go and rest.

348
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,340
Don't hurt the dog.

349
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,340
No, no, don't.

350
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,340
Don't.

351
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,340
Don't.

352
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,340
Look.

353
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,340
What?

354
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,340
Wu Sanxing killed me.

355
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,340
I was killed by him.

356
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,340
I'm a traitor.

357
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,340
Who killed Xie Lianhuan?

358
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,340
Why did he kill him?

359
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
Xie Lianhuan was also a reliable person.

360
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,340
He died in the stone bridge.

361
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,340
He was a traitor.

362
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,340
He was a traitor.

363
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,340
He was a traitor.

364
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,340
He was a traitor.

365
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,340
He was a traitor.

366
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,340
He was a traitor.

367
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,340
Is there a problem here?

368
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,340
Where could be a problem?

369
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,340
It's here, look.

370
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,340
It's not ready yet.

371
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,340
Let me see.

372
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,340
Give it to me.

373
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,340
What's wrong?

374
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,340
What's the problem?

375
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,340
He said it's not ready yet,

376
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,340
but he insisted on it.

377
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,340
He's so impulsive.

378
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,340
He's looking for a way out.

379
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,340
It's a chance to find a solution for you.

380
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,340
Don't you want to be a traitor?

381
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,340
I want to be your hero.

382
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,340
I want to see who is more capable than me.

383
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,340
You're so stupid. We're all old friends.

384
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,340
Let me do it.

385
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,340
Even I...

386
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,340
Enough, enough. Let's go to the store.

387
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,340
Why don't you give me a hug?

388
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,340
You can say it without a word.

389
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,340
Come over and take a look at this water tank.

390
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,340
There seems to be some problems.

391
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
I'm sorry.

392
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,340
I...

393
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,340
I...

394
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,340
I'll pretend to be a pervert.

395
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,340
Impossible.

396
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,340
What if you pretend to be a pervert?

397
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,340
I'm sure you'll...

398
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,340
Enough, enough, enough.

399
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,340
Wenjing, leave me alone.

400
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,340
Nobody knows you then.

401
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,340
Get out of the way.

402
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,340
Everybody, hurry up.

403
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,340
Okay.

404
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,340
Everyone is here.

405
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,340
What a propaganda-major.

406
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,340
A special 1970s car diy.

407
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,340
How come you came?

408
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,340
I came here to see you.

409
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,340
I've been talking to you for a long time.

410
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,340
Can you take me out to have a look?

411
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,340
What do you mean?

412
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,340
What do you want to see?

413
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,340
You're going to travel to your own place.

414
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,340
Can you play with the team?

415
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,340
San, please help me tell Wenjing

416
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,340
that I don't need your salary.

417
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,340
I can help you.

418
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,340
I'm better than the students in his hands.

419
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,340
Tell me, what's your idea?

420
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,340
I...

421
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,340
I'm also a person...

422
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,340
Join us soon.

423
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,340
At the A-Memory Theatre, 994466.

424
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,340
Come.

425
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,340
Who?

426
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,340
What do you want?

427
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,340
A foreigner.

428
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,340
The foreigner who will go with you to the label?

429
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:01,340
San, how do you know?

430
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,340
How do I know?

431
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,340
I want to ask you.

432
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,340
How do you know that Xie Shi Mu?

433
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,340
I want to ask him to take me to the label.

434
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,340
I want to ask him to take me to the label.

435
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,340
The foreigner who will go with you to the label.

436
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,340
He lived in Changsha for a long time.

437
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,340
I know him.

438
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,340
I don't know how he knows that Xie Shi Mu.

439
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,340
But he doesn't know the situation there.

440
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,340
So he wants me to take him there.

441
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,340
San, you don't know that it's too dangerous there.

442
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,340
I almost got killed.

443
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,340
You're a bastard.

444
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,340
You dare to go with him to the label.

445
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,340
You don't want him to send you to the scene in the newspaper?

446
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,340
It's okay, San.

447
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,340
Now it's business society.

448
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,340
It's all about brains.

449
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,340
I want him to take me to the label to help him.

450
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,340
But it's too obvious there.

451
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,340
There's no permission to go to the label.

452
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,340
The boat is not allowed.

453
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,340
Well...

454
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:07,340
It's convenient to go with the label.

455
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,340
Don't worry. I promise.

456
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,340
It's not going to affect the document.

457
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,340
If it's not convenient, forget it.

458
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,340
I'll think of a way.

459
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,340
It's not convenient.

460
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,340
But I can't do it alone.

461
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,340
I have to discuss it with Wen Jing.

462
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,340
Of course you have to listen to him.

463
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,340
Wen Jing is the leader, right?

464
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,340
Come on, come on.

465
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,340
Brother, I'll toast you.

466
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,340
Bastard!

467
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,340
How can you treat Xie Lian Huan?

468
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,340
How can you treat Xie family?

469
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,340
How can you treat Xie Lian Huan?

470
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,340
How can you treat Xie family?

471
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,340
How can you treat Xie Lian Huan?

472
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,340
How can you treat Xie family?

473
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,340
durchaus

474
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,340
The Remark

475
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,340
Part II

476
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,820
I remember there was a check boy

477
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,680
in my shop

478
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,200
where he felt like everything was strange

479
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,980
It looked like he eyed very big

480
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,480
maybe the lift Heinander

481
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,780
i can't even jump

482
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,460
I need to use a small boat

483
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,220
I don't know why

484
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,300
I carry him

485
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,180
I'm sorry.

486
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,980
It seems that this Xie Lian Huan is a master.

487
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,580
This is a self-proclaimed move.

488
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,260
Even if this is a small accident,

489
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,100
it won't cause a lot of danger.

490
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,900
Under such a tense situation,

491
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,020
it's still possible to be so calm.

492
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,300
It's not easy.

493
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,260
Xing Xi,

494
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,260
can you kill the old man?

495
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,260
Yabuzhang,

496
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,460
you are in the team.

497
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,820
With the old man's master,

498
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,540
you are in trouble.

499
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,540
I don't remember.

500
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,980
You should remember how to leave.

501
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,820
You should leave the hospital.

502
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,660
Let me ask you.

503
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,740
You were doing well before.

504
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,620
Why did we have to be added to the meat?

505
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,940
Did you take the wrong way?

506
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,460
Unless it's just a signal from the door.

507
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,420
It's possible that we didn't leave the door.

508
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,060
But the door of death.

509
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,780
Who can do this?

510
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,540
Ning.

511
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,220
I tell you, this girl is real.

512
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,780
I...

513
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,620
Maybe she wants to help Yü Sidi.

514
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,460
But she can't.

515
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,820
She's been acting like a monster.

516
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,140
So it's your uncle.

517
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,780
But don't think too much.

518
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,580
She can't be your nephew.

519
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,300
She wants to be Xie Lian Huan.

520
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,740
How bad is your uncle's relationship with her?

521
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,700
It's impossible.

522
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,500
Xie Lian Huan is close to my family.

523
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,140
She's almost three years old.

524
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,740
And I saw her when I was little.

525
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,900
I had an impression on her.

526
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,140
Are you a fight?

527
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,380
No.

528
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,860
Brother.

529
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,660
How much do you remember about Xie Lian Huan?

530
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,740
I don't remember.

531
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,500
Look.

532
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,620
But I have an idea.

533
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:32,340
If Xie Lian Huan and your uncle knew each other,

534
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,100
they would be close.

535
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,900
They didn't show up when they entered the test team.

536
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,820
But when they entered the first time,

537
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,860
Xie Lian Huan found out about the underwater tomb.

538
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,100
And he found out about the entrance to the underwater tomb.

539
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,940
He didn't tell anyone.

540
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,500
But he told your uncle.

541
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,620
It's hard to give up this opportunity

542
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,580
with their birth.

543
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,660
So they found out about the underwater tomb

544
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,340
while the test team didn't pay attention.

545
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,420
They're both experts.

546
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,500
It's hard for them.

547
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,420
But they're both experts.

548
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,020
They're both experts.

549
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,620
They're both experts.

550
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,420
They're both experts.

551
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,220
They're both experts.

552
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,140
They're both experts.

553
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,060
They're both experts.

554
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,020
They're both experts.

555
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,900
They're both experts.

556
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,900
They're both experts.

557
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,900
They're both experts.

558
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,900
They're both experts.

559
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,900
They're both experts.

560
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,900
They're both experts.

561
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,900
They're both experts.

562
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,900
They're both experts.

563
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,340
So the Excel team found out about the entrance want to enter.

564
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,220
mange

565
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:13,460
And to run away and run away again for good.

566
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,140
Sorry, thanks.

567
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,500
Say goodbye to the talk you saw.

568
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:30,580
It's too late to go to Similarly Credits Bureau.

569
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,580
Open the door! What do you mean? Open the door!

570
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:38,580
I'm not in the mood! I'm not in the mood!

571
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:42,580
Open the door! Open the door!

572
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,580
The bridge and the river in the water are all money.

573
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,580
How much do you want to spend to make yourself die in the tomb?

574
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,580
Don't do anything.

575
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,580
We can't know the exact reason for their rebellion.

576
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:02,580
But we can be sure that when Xie Lian Huan was walking on the road,

577
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,580
there was blood on the wall.

578
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,580
But he suddenly found out that the wall was empty.

579
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:13,580
So he used his equipment to make a tunnel here,

580
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,580
and saved his life.

581
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:22,580
But he died in the tomb afterwards.

582
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:28,580
Maybe Xie Lian Huan wanted to find your uncle after he was born.

583
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:33,580
But your uncle killed him.

584
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:26,580
We can't be sure that when Xie Lian Huan was walking on the road,

585
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,580
there was blood on the wall.

586
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,580
But he died in the tomb afterwards.

587
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,580
Maybe Xie Lian Huan wanted to find your uncle after he was born.

588
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,580
But he died in the tomb afterwards.

589
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:43,580
Maybe Xie Lian Huan wanted to find your uncle after he was born.

590
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,580
But he died in the tomb afterwards.

591
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:50,580
Maybe Xie Lian Huan wanted to find your uncle after he was born.

592
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:55,580
But he died in the tomb afterwards.
