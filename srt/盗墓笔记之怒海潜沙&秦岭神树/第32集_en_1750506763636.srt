00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,080
hope

3
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,140
this

4
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,640
was

5
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,300
Jon

00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,280
Shi

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,380
d

8
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,260
But it's definitely way safer when you threaten them in your house

9
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,880
Be careful

10
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,380
KAMÃ©ra

11
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,100
Kiss

12
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,780
Why do there are so many mirrors here?

13
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,740
It's a contour made by compounding mirrors.

14
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,380
We'll split up to find the exit.

15
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,380
Such a good fireworks shop.

16
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,380
If I did, I would definitely choose this place.

17
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,380
The first game of the second round of the game is the best.

18
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,380
The first game is the best.

19
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,380
The first game is the best.

20
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,380
The second game is the best.

21
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,380
The first game is the best.

22
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,380
The second game is the best.

23
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,380
The first game is the best.

24
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,380
The first game is the best.

25
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,380
The first game is the best.

26
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,380
The second game is the best.

27
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,380
The first game is the best.

28
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,380
The first game is the best.

29
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,380
The first game is the best.

30
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,380
The first game is the best.

31
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,380
The second game is the best.

32
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,380
The first game is the best.

33
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,380
Skate.

34
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,380
Skate.

35
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,380
Skate.

36
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,380
Skate.

37
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,380
Hang in there.

38
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,380
Hang in there.

39
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,380
Skate.

40
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,380
Open the door!

41
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,060
Where is he?

42
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,060
He went to your direction.

43
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,380
Where is he?

44
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,380
Kneel.

45
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,940
Open the door.

46
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,620
Father dismonters

47
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,100
how he is now.

48
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,020
Master, this is a passage.

49
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,900
Who are you concluded that?

50
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,980
To my son!

51
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,520
Look, what are you doin!

52
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,840
I'm owing you some young starfish.

53
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,680
Don't call me one.

54
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,060
The snow isn't over yet.

55
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,620
My husband can't figure it out.

56
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,620
This is the wooden structure that was built by people.

57
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,620
This door can only be locked from the outside.

58
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,620
It seems that someone wanted to go in before.

59
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,620
They thought that the door was not open because of the broken lock.

60
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,620
The gate's mechanism is not here.

61
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,620
I can't see the mayor of this place.

62
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,620
It's a hard-to-reach house.

63
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,620
Let's try this general's damage.

64
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,620
I'll try to get out of here.

65
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,620
The door is locked.

66
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,620
Fatty!

67
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,620
Fatty! Wake up!

68
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,620
Fatty! Wake up, Fatty!

69
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,620
Fatty! Are you okay?

70
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,620
This time, it was a good rain.

71
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,620
I was thinking about it.

72
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,620
Why are you here?

73
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:58,620
The beggar was so afraid that he ran to the fat man's head.

74
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,620
The police?

75
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,620
I don't know who it is.

76
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,620
Yaoheng, we came out of the wood.

77
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,620
Whose house is this?

78
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,620
Look at the rules here.

79
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,620
This should be the place where the mayor of Zhangshan lives.

80
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,620
But where is his body?

81
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,620
Is there a secret room here?

82
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,620
Okay, I'll do it myself.

83
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,620
This watch doesn't look like the one in this room.

84
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,620
Why doesn't it?

85
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,620
It's too strange to put it on the table.

86
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,620
This watch is so short.

87
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,620
Why does it look like it's in the middle of the table?

88
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,620
The more you see, the more strange it is.

89
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,620
People put it here. What's wrong?

90
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,620
What's wrong?

91
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,620
This should be the official of the mayor of Zhangshan.

92
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,620
The wood is sharp and the time is right.

93
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,620
Why are you still standing there?

94
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,620
Your hands are open. Come.

95
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,620
Don't open it.

96
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,620
Why not?

97
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,620
I've already brought a secret key.

98
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,620
I don't have to thank them.

99
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:44,620
Wu Xie, we should know who is the one lying here.

100
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,620
What's wrong?

101
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,620
Who is the one lying here?

102
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,620
Dule.

103
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,620
Come. One, two, one.

104
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,620
Xiao Ge?

105
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,620
Wu Xie.

106
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,620
What?

107
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,620
Dead.

108
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,620
What's wrong?

109
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,620
It's not Xiao Ge.

110
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,620
Xiao Ge will not be in trouble.

111
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,620
And even if he is in trouble,

112
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,620
he won't be here with the military uniform in the Ming State.

113
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,620
It's not him.

114
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,620
But Wu Gui and Wang Ba are the same.

115
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,620
This...

116
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,620
It's too similar.

117
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,620
If this person is not Xiao Ge,

118
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,620
will he be mayor Zhang?

119
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,620
By the way,

120
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,620
when I was going in,

121
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,620
I saw the person who committed suicide.

122
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,620
There's a clue inside.

123
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,620
Love is wrong.

124
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,620
Love is unparalleled.

125
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,620
God is the best.

126
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,620
These are all emotional.

127
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,620
Here.

128
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,620
I, Dou Cheng,

129
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,620
swear to God that I will live and die

130
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,620
as I please.

131
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,620
I will follow the law.

132
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,620
I will be sent to the Swordless Palace.

133
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,620
I will not leave.

134
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,620
It's all about the loyalty.

135
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,620
I think it's because his commander died in the past.

136
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,620
So he committed suicide.

137
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,620
He is like a dead man.

138
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,620
And he is not a passive burial.

139
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,620
He's the main person.

140
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,620
He said he was taken away.

141
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,620
He gave a name to a mayor named Zhang Buxun.

142
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,620
He's a soldier.

143
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,620
Zhang Buxun?

144
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,620
The mayor of the village,

145
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,620
is he...

146
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,620
Wait.

147
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,620
I'll look for him.

148
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,620
Here.

149
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,620
Commander-in-chief is important to me.

150
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,620
But we didn't expect that

151
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,620
this mission would be...

152
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,620
You're good.

153
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,620
Sometimes, you're too cunning.

154
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,620
What's the military's treasure?

155
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,620
It's not just one of us.

156
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,620
The Sun Dianyinlian

157
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,620
is the one who dare to dig the grave

158
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,620
behind the Grand Empress Dowager's back.

159
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,620
What's the big deal?

160
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,620
I don't want to be with them.

161
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,620
Commander-in-chief,

162
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,620
there are many brothers in the hands of my brother.

163
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,620
Even if I had to bear them to go to the northwest,

164
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,620
I wouldn't let them go to war with their stomachs.

165
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,620
Moreover, where did the military come from?

166
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,620
Did I ask the Ministry of Finance to go there?

167
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,620
You don't know that

168
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,620
those people have money to their own treasure.

169
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,620
Who would have thought that

170
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,620
they would go to the north of the country?

171
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,620
They would go to their own treasure.

172
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,620
Who would care

173
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,620
if our enemies would be starving to death?

174
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,620
Dou Cheng,

175
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,620
I won't send you a military message.

176
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,620
You still won't give your commander-in-chief the title of Deputy Commander?

177
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,620
Yes.

178
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,620
I gave you 100 lines of the Yangtze River

179
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,620
and you came to me as a Deputy Commander.

180
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,620
How was it?

181
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,620
Report, Commander-in-chief!

182
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,620
I just want to be a Deputy Commander with you.

183
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,620
You think I'm not as good as you, Commander-in-chief?

184
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,620
Report, Commander-in-chief!

185
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,620
I'm a man of fate.

186
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,620
Commander-in-chief saved my life.

187
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,620
I'm willing to give my life to him.

188
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,620
I'll give you a life of my own.

189
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,620
Good!

190
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,420
toppings mor justã§ 4 Ð±undink

191
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,620
Why isn't she on guard like you?

192
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,620
You don't have to worry about it.

193
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,620
Move it out and replace it with money.

194
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,620
As a military officer.

195
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,620
Don't let your brothers get sick.

196
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,620
Zhang Gaoyuan is a bit of an impression.

197
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,620
It's said that he is a military officer of the Yunkui generation.

198
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,620
He was a bit powerful in some time.

199
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,620
He is a bit manly.

200
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,620
It's said that he was born in a place where the people are more arrogant.

201
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,620
Or a big house.

202
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,620
One year, he took the bandits from the city to the city.

203
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,620
He took some men to the city.

204
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,620
He took the bandits' old houses.

205
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,620
Then he used the bandits' guns and ammunition.

206
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,620
He formed a army and established the People's Army.

207
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,620
That's the Yunkui's old gun.

208
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,620
Did the old man in the prison mention Zhang Gaoyuan?

209
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,620
Someone said that he was captured as a soldier and a man of the people.

210
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,620
At that time, there was a big man named Zhang.

211
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,620
He passed by the village.

212
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,620
I remember his name.

213
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,620
Zhang Gaoyuan.

214
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,620
A generation of arrogant.

215
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,620
I tell you, I think that Zhang Buxun is also a good person.

216
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,620
The commander of the Grand Marshal, Mr. Zun, found the tomb.

217
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,620
Anan.

218
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,620
A B sorting.

219
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,620
But I don't know how to make it!

220
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,620
Prepare plã°ã.

221
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,620
Boils of abalone are leftover from Umding River.

222
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,620
Sort the mutton.

223
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,620
Look, thishearted woman is friends.

224
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,620
List your people.

225
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,620
Other gods may come to fire on you...

226
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,440
for too long.

227
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,520
Thank you for teaching me how to be the best people in the world.

228
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,320
They have such great memories in their life.

229
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,700
Catch them!

230
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,320
Chen.

231
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,920
You said this person died hundreds of years later.

232
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,040
And they causedì£¼ë to die.

233
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,720
I've been dead for several hundred years.

234
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,320
It's worth it.

235
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,280
If you want to compare it to others,

236
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,760
there are many people who died

237
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,880
and have no place to bury them.

238
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,080
Isn't that more pitiful?

239
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,160
This is what you deserve.

240
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,240
I'll give you the military reward.

241
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,040
I'll give you the military reward.

242
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,560
Shen Zang.

243
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,200
I'll give you the military reward.

244
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,840
Yes.

245
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,000
Shen Zang.

246
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,240
Don't take it.

247
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,800
Take it back

248
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,960
and buy some jewelry for my sister.

249
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,120
Last time I went to the military camp,

250
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,200
my sister was in a bad mood.

251
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,640
The diamond ring is so big.

252
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,840
I feel ashamed.

253
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,960
Qing Ling doesn't like jewelry.

254
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,240
You're so stupid.

255
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,320
Which woman doesn't like to be in the gold and silver jewelry?

256
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,640
She doesn't tell you

257
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,800
that she doesn't want you to be in trouble.

258
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,400
No.

259
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,840
I'm just a brother to you.

260
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,320
I married my sister to you.

261
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,760
I don't want anything else.

262
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,600
But she must have

263
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,440
something else.

264
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,280
No.

265
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,680
It's settled.

266
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,720
I'll send someone to you later.

267
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,720
Let's go.

268
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,560
Uncle.

269
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,600
Tell me.

270
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,960
You're all so emotional.

271
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,640
You don't want to be in trouble.

272
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,880
Why?

273
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,200
You don't know

274
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,880
how terrible I was inside.

275
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,240
You hid something from the world.

276
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,480
If you didn't take us with you,

277
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,400
you'd be dead.

278
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
You'd be killed if you were alive.

279
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,600
You're afraid of the dead.

280
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,960
You're afraid of the dead?

281
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,160
Are you afraid of money?

282
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,960
Tell them

283
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,160
that the soldiers in the afternoon

284
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,760
can take 20 more diamonds every day.

285
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
The second one

286
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,760
can take 40 and one gold.

287
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,760
I don't believe

288
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,560
that someone is afraid of money.

289
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,240
It's comfortable here.

290
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,760
Yes.

291
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,520
Now forget about it.

292
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,360
I want to make a finishing point.

293
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,560
Don't bother.

294
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,760
Here, get the money.

295
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,880
All right.

296
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,160
Here, don't bother.

297
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,200
Okay?

298
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,720
Where is the money?

299
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,000
For the magic crown.

300
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,440
Where?

301
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Can I use it?

302
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,200
Your name?

303
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,160
No.

304
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,480
Here.

305
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Stop!

306
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
Get up!

307
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
Don't steal things!

308
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Don't steal our things!

309
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Hit him!

310
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Don't steal things!

311
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
What are you doing?

312
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
Don't run!

313
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
Go!

314
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
You are so strong!

315
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
You are very similar to your childhood.

316
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,480
I heard that you used to fight with your father.

317
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,480
I don't call him that.

318
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
I call him a fool.

319
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
Mr. Zhao,

320
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
say that I am a soldier.

321
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,480
I will fight.

322
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
I am not.

323
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
I...

324
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
I was a painter.

325
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,480
I will give you my life.

326
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
You are too young.

327
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,480
You want to fight and you want to be a soldier.

328
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
You need to study first.

329
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
You can fight if you study well.

330
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
Come on.

331
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
Send him to the palace.

332
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Yes.

333
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
I don't want to go.

334
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,480
Kid,

335
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,480
the orphanage is opened by our master.

336
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,480
After the school,

337
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,480
there will be food and books.

338
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
After the books are ready,

339
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
we will be soldiers for our master.

340
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
Like you?

341
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
It's different from me.

342
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
I am here.

343
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
I am a unique warrior.

344
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
Let's go.

345
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
Go!

346
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,480
Go!

347
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,480
Master,

348
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
the soup that madam made for you is ready.

349
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
What's the problem?

350
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
You are bleeding again?

351
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
Are you done?

352
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
No.

353
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
I am fine.

354
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,480
I am fine.

355
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
I am fine.

356
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,480
I am fine.

357
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,480
I am fine.

358
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
I am fine.

359
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,480
I am fine.

360
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
I am fine.

361
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
I am fine.

362
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,480
I am fine.

363
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,480
I am fine.

364
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
I am fine.

365
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
I am fine.

366
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,480
I am fine.

367
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
Are you done?

368
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Yes.

369
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,480
The new thief who was arrested by master

370
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
is his family.

371
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,480
I thought he was killed by you.

372
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
I want to find revenge.

373
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,480
What's the problem with that Wang family?

374
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,480
It's said that

375
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,480
the master of the famous Feng Shui is the master of the famous Ming dynasty.

376
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,480
But they are close friends of the master.

377
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,480
They are not close friends of the master.

378
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,480
The enemy is not clear where he is.

379
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,480
The master who was arrested

380
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
is a core person.

381
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
He has a lot of family secrets.

382
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
He is a good man.

383
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
He was killed by master.

384
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,480
He is sold out.

385
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,480
I don't know

386
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
whether his family wants revenge.

387
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
Where is the kid?

388
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
He is dead.

389
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Master said

390
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,480
the war is not possible

391
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
in the country.

392
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,480
It's important.

393
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
He is dead.

394
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
It's necessary.

395
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
But

396
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
he is still a child.

397
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
It's not a child

398
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,480
when he is killed.

399
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
Fortunately, you are fine.

400
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
If you are really killed by him,

401
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,480
would it be useful to pity him?

402
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,480
Cheng.

403
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
Sometimes I think you are

404
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,480
not good at this.

405
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
I am not good at life.

406
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,480
I am not good at the gods and monsters.

407
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,480
I am good at you.

408
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
You are good to me.

409
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
But you are not good at me.

410
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
That's because

411
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
you treat me well.

412
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
Cheng.

413
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
You are smart.

414
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
You know how to fight.

415
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
You are good at raising me.

416
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,480
Or

417
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,480
you go out and be a leader first.

418
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
In the future...

419
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
Mr. Xiu.

420
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
You don't want me anymore?

421
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Can you still be with me for a lifetime?

422
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,480
Why not?

423
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Which one is good at the gods

424
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,480
and not good at the front?

425
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
My best front

426
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,480
is to be a good man for you for a lifetime.

427
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
Don't.

428
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,480
To the throne.

429
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
To the throne.

430
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
Isn't it just to the throne?

431
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
You let me go to the throne.

432
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,480
I will go to the throne.

433
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
It's not like that.

434
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
Is it?

435
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
Anyway, I can't listen to you.

436
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
I can't care about you.

437
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Or you try.

438
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
You will be killed.

439
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
You...

440
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
He is there.

441
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Mr. Xiu.

442
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
You are so sensitive to the Japanese.

443
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Why don't you tell him

444
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
to change his person?

445
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,480
He is my friend.

446
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
I know.

447
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
You were the one who survived

448
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,480
because of the commander.

449
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
But the bandits' village

450
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
is your castle.

451
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
Only the villagers can survive.

452
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,480
You have already returned

453
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
the rest of your life to him.

454
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
It's not the case.

455
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
I don't know.

456
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,480
It's not the case.

457
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
The money is the money.

458
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480
The money is the account.

459
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
The grudge is the grudge.

460
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
The grudge is the grudge.

461
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
What are you doing?

462
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
You want to fight?

463
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
Don't be so serious.

464
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Did you hear me?

465
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
I heard you.

466
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
I heard you.

467
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Listen to me.

468
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,480
There is a problem with the commander.

469
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,480
You are waiting for the gun.

470
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
Who else?

471
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
You want to follow the commander

472
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
and report to the state

473
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
and attack the enemy.

474
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
You want to kill yourself

475
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,480
with this paper.

476
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Everyone will be sent to the military service.

477
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
Two and a half meters.

478
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
Get out of the way.

479
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
You didn't come.

480
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
You are my soldier.

481
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Brother.

482
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
Is this place

483
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
where we can go?

484
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Can we not go?

485
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
No.

486
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,480
I will kill you if I don't go.

487
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
I will go.

488
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
Sir, please come in.

489
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
The West Lake is a lake.

490
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
Sir, which army are you from?

491
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
Do you have a gun?

492
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Sir, please come in.

493
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,480
How much is the money?

494
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
How much is it?

495
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
Let's see how much you have.

496
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Please come in.

497
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
This is all?

498
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
Sir, we have only ten soldiers

499
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
here.

500
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,480
You...

501
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
Sir, please come in.

502
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
I said you would leave.

503
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
Please come in.

504
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
This is the watch.

505
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Can you support the Great Yang?

506
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
Go in.

507
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
Please come in.

508
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Sir, please come in.

509
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
Sir, please come in.

510
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Sir, please come in.

511
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Okay.

512
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
What are they?

513
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
What are they doing?

514
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
They are going to the temple.

515
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,480
Come in.

516
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Come in.

517
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
Come in.

518
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
Come in.

519
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,480
Come in.

520
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
Come in.

521
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,480
Come in.

522
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
Come in.

523
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
Sir,

524
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
do you have to

525
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
do this every day?

526
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,480
This is how it is.

527
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
After a few months,

528
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,480
we will have a new batch

529
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
of soldiers.

530
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,480
Our business is still the same.

531
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
Mr. Cai,

532
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
I heard that you recently

533
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,480
received a few houses.

534
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
You are like

535
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
my baby.

536
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
You can't see your man

537
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
in these days.

538
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,480
What's wrong?

539
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,480
What's wrong?

540
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
This time,

541
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,480
I went to Sichuan with my brother-in-law.

542
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,480
I have a lot of oil.

543
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,480
I have a good old man.

544
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
I cut a piece of fat

545
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,480
with the new batch.

546
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,480
Brother Xiao Zheng,

547
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
you are different.

548
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,480
You are a college student.

549
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,480
You even have a sister.

550
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,480
You are a soldier.

551
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,480
Have you been sent off?

552
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
Go back.

553
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,480
I will tell you a story.

554
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
Don't be arrogant.

555
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,480
What are you doing?

556
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
What do you mean?

557
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
What do you mean?

558
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
Look at me.

559
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
What are you looking at?

560
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Shoot!

561
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Are you dead?

562
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
Let me go.

563
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Let me go!

564
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,480
Let me go!

565
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
Let me go!

566
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,480
You want to go home?

567
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,480
Go back home.

568
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,480
You can go anywhere

569
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,480
but don't be embarrassed here.

570
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,480
Don't forget that

571
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,480
you are a soldier.

572
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Who is your boy?

573
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
He is the commander.

574
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,480
He just came back from the clouds with the commander.

575
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
You are the commander's

576
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
deputy commander, right?

577
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,480
Look at what you did.

578
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,480
You are a soldier.

579
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,480
You are a soldier.

580
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,480
You are mistaken.

581
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Come back.

582
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
áº©sc.

583
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
You!

584
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
You are the real sumo.

585
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
Come.

586
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,480
There you are, buddy.

587
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,480
áº©sc.

588
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,480
You thought you can get away with this!

589
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,480
What are you doing here?

590
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,480
I'm here to see what's going on.

591
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
What did you see?

592
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,480
It's a big mess of a city.

593
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,480
It's a big mess of a city.

594
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,480
Where's the second one?

595
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,480
He's here.

596
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
The world is a palace with a wife.

597
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,480
The country is a golden gang.

598
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,480
Things like this

599
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,480
can't be taught in the hands of these insurgents.

600
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,480
You're here to drink tea, aren't you?

601
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
Not bad.

602
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,480
Tell me why you wrote these things.

603
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,480
I have time to go.

604
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,480
I've already changed my mind.

605
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,480
I think you should tell me

606
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,480
why you wrote these things.

607
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,480
It's not like I did it.

608
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,480
I don't want it.

609
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,480
Zhang Buxun.

610
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,480
I'm Zhang Gaoyuan.

611
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,480
You should know where to find me.

612
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,480
Thank you.

613
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,480
It's getting cold.

614
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,480
This way.

615
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,480
Come on.

616
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,480
Come on.

617
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Come on.

618
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,480
Come on.

619
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,480
Come on.

620
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,480
Come on.

621
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,480
Come on.

622
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,480
Come on.

623
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,480
Come on.

624
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,480
Next one.

625
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,480
Thank you.

626
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Next.

627
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,480
Thank you.

628
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
Thank you.

629
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Congratulations.

630
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,480
Congratulations.

631
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,200
Congratulations.

632
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,200
Thank you.

633
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,200
Thank you.

634
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,840
Isn't this Mrs. Zhang?

635
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,440
Come on, come on.

636
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,160
Please come in.

637
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,840
Congratulations.

638
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,120
Sir.

639
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,640
Congratulations.

640
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,240
Thank you.

641
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,400
Come on, come in.

642
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,320
Congratulations.

643
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,120
Congratulations, sir.

644
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,560
Thank you.

645
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,560
Please come in.

646
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,600
Thank you.

647
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,120
Why didn't you come in and sit down?

648
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
To be honest,

649
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,160
you are different from those who are rich

650
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,720
and have a high salary.

651
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,200
Now is the best time to realize the new generation.

652
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
I, Zhang Gaoyuan,

653
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,160
want to build my own team.

654
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,400
I need your talent.

655
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,560
Don't make decisions in a hurry.

656
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,600
I won't force you.

657
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,120
But since you are here,

658
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,840
you should go in and sit down.

659
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,400
We are friends.

660
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,840
Besides,

661
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,520
I have something to return to you.

662
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,000
Now.

663
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:43,200
And be cool with the ê±´ï¿½

664
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,360
Such a good look

665
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,600
You are the one who is suitable for the army.

666
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
When I first saw you,

667
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,600
I liked your spirit.

668
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,600
When we are in a fight,

669
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,600
we will use this spirit to suppress the four directions.

670
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
Yes.

671
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,600
Trust me.

672
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,600
We will be better and better.

673
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,600
The current situation is very beneficial to us.

674
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,600
The war of the Dai Liu is inevitable.

675
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,600
According to reliable news,

676
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,800
the Dai Liu has sent people to the Communist Party.

677
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,600
Please return to the capital.

678
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,000
What does this mean?

679
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
This means that the Dai Liu has no foundation.

680
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,800
The Sichuan is in chaos now.

681
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,400
The Sichuan army is in a mess.

682
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,600
The Ding army is still in the back.

683
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,800
We can take this opportunity to win.

684
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,600
The Beiping Army won't let Sichuan go.

685
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,600
Come, I will introduce you to someone.

686
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,800
Qi Ming!

687
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
Brother!

688
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,000
I miss you so much, brother.

689
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,600
You are so handsome, brother.

690
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,600
Is it true?

691
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,600
You have been drinking the Yang Mo Shui for so long.

692
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
You haven't learned what it is called?

693
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,600
Is it something girls touch?

694
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,600
Let me see.

695
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,600
Besides, my brother,

696
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,600
I just went to Beiping to study a girl's smile.

697
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
It's not a Liu Yang.

698
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,600
Where did you get the Yang Mo Shui?

699
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,600
I haven't seen you for so long.

700
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,600
I don't care about you.

701
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,600
You are beautiful.

702
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,600
You look good.

703
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,600
It's the same.

704
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,600
Let's go.

705
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,600
Let's go.

706
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,600
Let's go.

707
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,600
Let's go.

708
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,600
The End

709
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,600
The End
