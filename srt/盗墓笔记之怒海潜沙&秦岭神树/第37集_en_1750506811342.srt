1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
V Love

2
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,060
Episode 1

3
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,500
Slow down

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm telling you, before the ambulance arrives,

5
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
you must not run around.

6
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Do you have a doctor here?

7
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Doctor? What are you looking for?

8
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I think something is wrong.

9
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's like a mess.

10
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I can't remember it.

11
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And the more I think, the more I feel headache.

12
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Our village head is very ill.

13
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But he won't help you.

14
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Think about it.

15
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Every person who comes back from the forbidden place has a curse.

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
His brother died because of this.

17
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He can't even come here now.

18
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
How could he help you?

19
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You don't have to worry.

20
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If I take the medicine for you...

21
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But...

22
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
There's no medicine here.

23
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm here to help you.

24
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You know what?

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The person who came back from the forbidden place,

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
he committed suicide.

27
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Your symptoms are different from his.

28
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Wait. He committed suicide.

29
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That was many years ago.

30
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
After he came back to the village,

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
he had a big scar on his body.

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
His skin started to feel bad.

33
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It caused serious illness.

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He was also strong.

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He insisted to go back to the hospital to find the medicine.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But he committed suicide.

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
His body was brought back by the登山 team.

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The登山 team?

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
When did it happen?

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It happened a long time ago.

41
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The last time...

42
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The登山 team met with a snow storm.

43
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I was still young then.

44
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
My sister was curious about the outside world.

45
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
After the登山 team came,

46
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
she was very happy.

47
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They were very happy.

48
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
They were very happy.

49
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
They were very happy.

50
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
After the登山 team came,

51
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
they were very happy.

52
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
When they met at our house,

53
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
my sister never saw the new players

54
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
who brought them to the mountain.

55
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So she was very excited.

56
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So you are very close to them?

57
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They left without much time.

58
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
At that time,

59
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
my sister and one of the members of the team

60
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
were very close to them.

61
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I saw my sister's letter and diary.

62
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So I know them very well.

63
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Why do you ask me these questions?

64
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Take a good rest.

65
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't mention the local matter to me again.

66
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Where is this map?

67
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Did you protect it?

68
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is the map of our snow group

69
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and the terrain around it.

70
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Every one of us

71
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
will protect this map.

72
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It will be passed down.

73
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Each one of us will update and replenish.

74
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So this is the place you said it was?

75
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yes.

76
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This place is not a place

77
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
where you can go.

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This is the place where you can go.

79
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes.

80
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No one can go in here.

81
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Draw the three-legged deer.

82
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't enter the place when you are hunting.

83
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't follow me again.

84
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Next time,

85
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
you may not have such a good luck.

86
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm going to ask you something.

87
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't know.

88
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No.

89
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You know...

90
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't know.

91
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Sir, I want to ask you something.

92
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There is a very young person with a very young face.

93
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He is so tall and young.

94
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He is handsome, but not as handsome as I am.

95
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Have you seen him?

96
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No.

97
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Think about it. Have you seen him?

98
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No. I haven't.

99
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I haven't.

100
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay.

101
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Can I ask you something?

102
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No.

103
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
No?

104
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I want to ask you something.

105
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You don't know.

106
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You are so unkind.

107
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
No.

108
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Sir, I want to ask you something.

109
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He is not as young as you.

110
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He is handsome, but not as handsome as I am.

111
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Have you seen him?

112
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
No. I haven't.

113
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Sir, I want to ask you something.

114
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He is not as young as you.

115
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Sir, I have seen him with a very young face.

116
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Have you seen him?

117
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No.

118
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He is about the same height as you.

119
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
No.

120
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Do you know him?

121
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I know him better.

122
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't know.

123
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yan Zhen!

124
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yan Zhen!

125
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yan Zhen!

126
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What's wrong?

127
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Sir, I have him here.

128
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Keep him for Wushu for the time being.

129
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Understood.

130
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The young women!

131
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
They are all beautiful!

132
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The young women!

133
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I am also beautiful!

134
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
They are all old women!

135
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You are wrong!

136
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You are wrong!

137
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You are all bad!

138
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You are all bad!

139
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You are all old women!

140
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You are all wrong!

141
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You are all bad!

142
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yes, yes, yes!

143
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Hurry up and untie me!

144
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Okay, okay.

145
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You!

146
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Wait,

147
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
you are so enthusiastic to ask me to come here.

148
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Are you thinking about your Fatty?

149
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What are you doing here?

150
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I am here because you are here.

151
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Did you hide Tian Zhen?

152
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You are so impudent.

153
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You have nothing to do with Tian Zhen.

154
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You can't make fun of me.

155
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You can't make fun of me.

156
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So, we all believe in Ru Bin.

157
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Tell me where Tian Zhen is hiding.

158
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Tian Zhen!

159
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Tian Zhen!

160
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Enough.

161
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You should find him here

162
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
through the GPS location of Wuxue.

163
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
If I hide the Wuxue,

164
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
you won't be able to find him.

165
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What do you mean?

166
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
To be honest,

167
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
we are also looking for Wuxue.

168
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We don't know where he is.

169
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You said you were close to Ru Bin.

170
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I will find Wuxue and you will cooperate with me.

171
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Don't cause me trouble.

172
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
How do you know?

173
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I am the one who is in trouble.

174
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Why don't you cause trouble?

175
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You are making fun of me.

176
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
This village is very strange.

177
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You should find Wuxue as soon as possible.

178
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You should stay here and don't listen to me.

179
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Tian Zhen, don't make fun of me.

180
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Get up.

181
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I am hungry.

182
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Do you want to eat?

183
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Jing Yang, look.

184
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What's wrong?

185
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I suspect that those people

186
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
weren't from the mountainous team.

187
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
They were looking for the treasure or the ancient skill.

188
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Why are you saying that?

189
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I didn't hear that there is a treasure here.

190
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Look at this map.

191
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The dragon is like a kite.

192
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It is like a turtle.

193
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It is a kind of a kite.

194
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
This is a kite that is extremely learned in the water.

195
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Look.

196
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
This village is just like the one in the mountainous team.

197
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It is just like this.

198
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And this is the mountainous team.

199
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
There are many trees and trees around.

200
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The map is red and white.

201
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
This is the place where the official is.

202
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It is also a great place to put the treasure.

203
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Well, you.

204
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It is a set of theories.

205
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But how can you see so much

206
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
with such a map?

207
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Thanks to the map is protected.

208
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So many maps are marked very carefully.

209
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And I just came back from there.

210
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Don't you think that I am curious?

211
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
This map was sent by your ancestors.

212
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You don't want to make up for it?

213
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't want to make up for it.

214
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Forget it.

215
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The area of the map is already enough.

216
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It is a lot of work.

217
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Why do you take this risk?

218
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Didn't you say that there is a gold mine nearby?

219
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So your ancestors came here specially.

220
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And they are already in good shape.

221
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And look at this map.

222
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I suspect that the gold mine

223
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
should be in this place.

224
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Do you want to go there?

225
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I mean, brother.

226
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I think that the treasure is enough.

227
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Why do you need to find trouble?

228
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Xin Yang.

229
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You said that you would go to the place to find your sister.

230
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
She is your only relative.

231
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You just give up?

232
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I think that my sister is dead.

233
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You want to see her alive and die.

234
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This is a human's smell.

235
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It is also a family's thought.

236
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I think that you are different from the people who saved you in this village.

237
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You dare to hide them and keep me.

238
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Then you won't give up your sister.

239
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
By the way,

240
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I have a bottle of Yanping here.

241
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Take it with you.

242
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
If you have a pillow or something,

243
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
use it.

244
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Xin Yang.

245
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Follow me.

246
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Wait a minute.

247
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Take Wu Xie away.

248
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Commander.

249
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I said, get out of here.

250
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's been seven days.

251
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We must take Wu Xie away.

252
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
If the mountain god is angry, who can stop him?

253
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Commander, it's been seven days.

254
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's too late.

255
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Get out of here.

256
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Let's go.

257
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Commander.

258
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Take her away.

259
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Let me go.

260
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Let me go.

261
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Commander.

262
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You are not done.

263
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Get out of here.

264
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Let's go.

265
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Commander.

266
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
All the checkers are ready.

267
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Get ready to go.

268
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yes.

269
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'll take you to the river.

270
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Go.

271
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yes.

272
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Wait.

273
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You don't need to go this time.

274
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Wait here.

275
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I think you'd better not show up.

276
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
In case they cause any conflicts.

277
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll go by myself.

278
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm sure of it.

279
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Don't worry. I don't want him to be hurt.

280
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
If you have any questions, you can talk to him.

281
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Why don't we let him go?

282
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
He will be fine if he takes him away.

283
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We can't let him go.

284
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What if anything happens in the village?

285
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I think he is the most dangerous in the whole village.

286
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Our grandson was burnt a few days ago.

287
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I don't know if it's because of him.

288
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He has been here for a few days.

289
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's not a big deal.

290
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's a bit strange.

291
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
How about we let him go and have a look?

292
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's impossible.

293
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
We are afraid of him.

294
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Sir.

295
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What are you doing here?

296
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We are talking about business.

297
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Don't make trouble for us.

298
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Actually, there is no choice.

299
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
We will punish Wu Xie for the most fair way.

300
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
If he takes the chance, he will punish him.

301
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
If not, we can't blame the good guy.

302
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You are a scumbag.

303
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You are even more vicious than you.

304
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You put a man in the wilderness.

305
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Without the god of the mountains, he can survive.

306
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Where did you get that bastard from?

307
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
How dare you insult our god of the mountains?

308
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Do you have the right to talk?

309
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yes.

310
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Look, Mr. Fatty, is this a wild thing?

311
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Lolo, let me tell you.

312
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You tied him up as my friend.

313
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Where did you tie him up?

314
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Tell me.

315
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Do you believe that you have broken your village?

316
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Be careful.

317
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Be careful.

318
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Let's go.

319
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I came to give you food.

320
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Have some water.

321
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Here.

322
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Are you poisoned?

323
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
How can you talk?

324
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I came to give you food.

325
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I am a good person.

326
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I am a good person.

327
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I am a good person.

328
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I am a good person.

329
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I am a good person.

330
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I am a good person.

331
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
How can you talk?

332
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I came to give you water.

333
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Are you a good person?

334
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yes.

335
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I am a cultured person.

336
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I am a good person.

337
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Look,

338
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
they are all illegal.

339
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
If my brother is sent to the mountains,

340
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
he will die.

341
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You have to let me go.

342
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I have to save him.

343
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
My dad did this.

344
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
There must be his reason.

345
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Your friend has a problem.

346
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I came to give you water.

347
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I am leaving.

348
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
No, he is a good person.

349
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
He is as kind as you.

350
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Do you want to see a good person

351
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
stuck in the snow?

352
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Will he die?

353
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Do you know?

354
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I have never had a mom since I was a kid.

355
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
She is the mom of my brother.

356
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
She is the one who pulled me out.

357
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I promised her that

358
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I would find her and bring her back.

359
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I came all the way from Beijing.

360
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I climbed the snow mountain for three days and three nights.

361
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I did all this for the sake of my parents.

362
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I promised them.

363
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You promised your dad.

364
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But I promised them first.

365
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
If I promised them first,

366
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
you should help me to do what I promised.

367
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Then you should do what your dad did.

368
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So,

369
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
do you know the logic of this?

370
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Let's talk about it later.

371
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
As you said,

372
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I promised my dad first.

373
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But I didn't promise you.

374
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
My dad said that you are not a good person.

375
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I can't promise you.

376
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Miss You, you are not only smart,

377
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
but also smart.

378
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
He is sick.

379
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
He is dead.

380
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
He is not allowed to do anything.

381
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
He is sick.

382
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You know.

383
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You know that he needs medicine to maintain his life.

384
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Only the big city can have this medicine.

385
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
He needs to see his dad before he dies.

386
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Do you understand?

387
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So, let me go.

388
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I will save him.

389
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Sir, are you all right?

390
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm fine. Give it to Miss Trint.

391
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yes.

392
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
We lost contact with Shun.

393
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
After he went looking for the village chef.

394
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
We see he is hidden.

395
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Wang is tracking down Shun.

396
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But we haven't talked yet.

397
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Sir.

398
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Fine, we will see immediately.

399
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I will see.

400
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Miss Trint,

401
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I will see you in the village.

402
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Sir.

403
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Fine, we will see immediately.

404
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I don't care what you have to do.

405
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The situation is growing increasingly.

406
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You need to keep it a pay.

407
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm running out to patients.

408
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:44,560
The

409
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
But Shun did run away.

410
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Look, the city chef said it was good.

411
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,560
youuckles and

412
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,780
key

413
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:03,440
tons of

414
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,440
forth

415
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,520
giant

416
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,580
owi

417
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,620
??

418
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,420
die

419
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:22,420
I am sent by God of the mountains to punish you.

420
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,420
You tied me here.

421
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,420
All the people in the village...

422
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,420
All sent to the mountains.

423
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,420
The old man's village chief!

424
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,420
Father, why don't I go and have a look?

425
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,420
Stop.

426
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,420
Sit down.

427
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,420
No one can go without my permission.

428
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,420
Oh.

429
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,420
What's that?

430
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,420
You're afraid that I'll come?

431
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,420
You're just saying that you're going to punish me

432
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,420
for being so handsome and illegal.

433
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,420
Don't you know how to do it?

434
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,420
What are you going to do?

435
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,420
You're going to wash your face.

436
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,420
You know what I'm saying?

437
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,420
You're so capable.

438
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,420
What do you want to do to me?

439
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,420
You're going to punish me and torture me?

440
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,420
I'll give you a break.

441
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,420
I'll go to the medicine.

442
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,420
I'll give you a break.

443
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,420
I'll give you a break.

444
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,420
I'll give you a break.

445
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,420
I'll give you a break.

446
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,420
I'll give you a break.

447
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,420
I'll give you a break.

448
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,420
I'll give you a break.

449
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,420
I'll give you a break.

450
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,420
Miss Lin, the camp is 100 meters away.

451
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,420
We've been under attack.

452
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,420
Are you sure that they won't meet their route?

453
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,420
Yes.

454
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,420
Did you find Wang Pongze?

455
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,420
If we find him,

456
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,420
we'd better find him before he comes to the base.

457
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,420
We checked the signal from Mr. Wang just now.

458
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,420
Where did he disappear?

459
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,420
At the village head's house.

460
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,420
Keep an eye on the hill.

461
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,420
Yes.

462
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,420
Come on, let's go!

463
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,420
Don't let him go.

464
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,420
I'm here to give you a meal.

465
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,420
You're so kind.

466
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,420
You should let him go.

467
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,420
Right?

468
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,420
You're wasting your time.

469
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,420
It's more dangerous in the mountains.

470
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,420
Your dad is a good guy.

471
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,420
Right?

472
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,420
Don't worry.

473
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,420
I won't come back to you.

474
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,420
I'm here to save you.

475
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,420
Why did you come all the way here?

476
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,420
Oh, God!

477
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,420
Well...

478
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,420
Miss,

479
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:06,420
you didn't realize the seriousness of this matter.

480
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,420
My brother was trapped in the mountains.

481
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,420
After he died,

482
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,420
your dad was the murderer.

483
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,420
You're the one who helped him.

484
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,420
You should be in jail.

485
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,420
You're lying.

486
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,420
My uncle died and nobody is in jail.

487
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,420
Why should my dad be in jail?

488
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,420
Hey, wait!

489
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:51,420
The End

490
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,420
What a pity!

491
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,420
Are you crazy?

492
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,420
Are you kidding me?

493
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,420
Fine, you're not going to pay me back.

494
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:04,420
I'm not going to drink this time.

495
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,420
You...

496
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,420
I'm not going to drink this time.

497
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,420
I'm not going to drink this time.

498
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,420
I'm going to starve to death.

499
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,420
You should be in jail.

500
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,420
Right?

501
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,420
You should be in jail if you're starving.

502
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,420
The dish was too soft.

503
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,420
It looks like pork stew.

504
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:40,420
The End

505
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,420
You're not going to drink this time.

506
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,420
You're going to starve to death.

507
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,420
You're going to starve to death.

508
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,420
Dad,

509
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,420
you're too tired to come down this time.

510
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,420
I'll come next time.

511
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,420
I didn't expect that

512
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,420
he didn't come down this time.

513
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,420
I'm a little nervous.

514
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,420
Luckily, Shanshan accepted this time.

515
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,420
I hope everything goes well.

516
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,420
I think Wu Xie

517
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,420
will be in jail.

518
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,420
I'm sure he'll be in jail.

519
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,420
I'm sure he'll be in jail.

520
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,420
What will happen next?

521
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,420
What are you doing?

522
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,420
Where did you hide Wu Xie?

523
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,420
What's the matter?

524
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,420
I don't know what you're talking about.

525
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,420
My dad is very tired now.

526
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,420
If you disturb him again,

527
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,420
I'll be very polite to you.

528
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,420
I know you're all from the outside.

529
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,420
You're capable.

530
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,420
But if I know that you're against my dad,

531
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,420
I'll have to pay you a price.

532
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,420
Mr. Jin, I think you misunderstood.

533
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,420
We're here to make a deal with you.

534
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,420
We need to buy the money we need.

535
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,420
I don't need money.

536
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,420
No one in the village needs money.

537
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,420
We can make enough money.

538
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,420
There's nothing you want.

539
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,420
Go back. Don't come any closer.

540
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,420
We need to exchange the money.

541
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,420
What?

542
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,420
The money?

543
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,420
The snow is falling.

544
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,420
Your money is not enough.

545
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,420
How much money do you have?

546
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,420
I don't know.

547
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,420
Tell me where Wu Xie is.

548
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,420
I'll send him tomorrow.

549
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,420
Well...

550
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,420
Shunzi took him away.

551
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,420
Shunzi took him away.

552
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,420
He's dead.

553
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,420
He's dead.

554
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,420
He's dead.

555
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,420
He's dead.

556
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,420
He's dead.

557
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,420
He's dead.

558
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,420
He's dead.

559
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,420
He's dead.

560
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,420
He's dead.

561
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,420
He's dead.

562
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,420
He's dead.

563
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,420
He's dead.

564
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,420
He's dead.

565
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,420
Shunzi.

566
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,420
Poor guy.

567
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,420
He's dead.

568
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,420
At some point,

569
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,420
let's call the police.

570
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,420
You know it.

571
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,420
If you let him man the money,

572
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,420
it's ok for you.

573
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,420
But you will be attempt.

574
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,420
it means wrong.

575
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,480
Hit with a Souls Psychcendant

576
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,120
Otherwise, it might be a lie.

577
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,540
They don't have Will.

578
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,620
There is spirit.

579
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,880
Do you think it's beamed up?

580
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
liberal

581
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
What's going on?

582
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Ning is here too.

583
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Why are we here?

584
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Where are we going?

585
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Do you know where Tianzhen is?

586
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I'm poisoned.

587
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I can't remember what happened before.

588
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
You're suspicious again?

589
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Why are you here?

590
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You should remember.

591
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Someone sent a message saying that

592
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
there's danger here.

593
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I saw it right away.

594
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I saw it right away.

595
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It seems that we were designed.

596
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
We can only follow it.

597
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
We'll find the Wu Xie first.

598
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
But where should we find it?

599
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
You don't know that I'm a spy.

600
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
This place is so boring.

601
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It's so boring.

602
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
This is the 21st century.

603
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I've never seen such a superstitious place.

604
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Really.

605
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
The first time I saw it.

606
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I don't know.

607
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I don't know.

608
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I don't know.

609
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I don't know.

610
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I don't know.

611
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I don't know.

612
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I don't know.

613
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I don't know.

614
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I don't know.

615
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I don't know.

616
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I don't know.

617
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I don't know.

618
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I don't know.

619
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
How did you come here?

620
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
How did you come here?

621
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
How did you come here?

622
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
How did you come here?

623
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
How did you come here?

624
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
How did you come here?

625
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
How did you came here?

626
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
How did you come here?

627
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Who are you?

628
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
How did you come here?

629
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Did youüm S ing?
