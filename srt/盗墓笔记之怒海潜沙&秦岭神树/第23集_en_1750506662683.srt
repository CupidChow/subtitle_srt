1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,820
Change

2
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:16,980
What to do, Wu Xie.

3
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,960
What should I do?

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,360
We can't just sit here and wait.

5
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,960
We need to find a way to get out of here.

6
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,720
This... This is so scary.

7
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,680
Look.

8
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,480
You're not done with this.

9
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,360
Sit down if you haven't thought about it.

10
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Thank you.

11
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,880
Look.

12
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,080
They're just a few minutes away.

13
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,680
They're coming up.

14
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,280
There's no way to get out of here.

15
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Let me think.

16
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,760
How about we go up?

17
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,280
No.

18
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,360
We'll be there in a minute.

19
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,720
We're running out of time.

20
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,840
We can't make it.

21
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,880
Look.

22
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,000
There's no food on the cliff.

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,680
The only way is to go there.

24
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,160
How can we get there so far?

25
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,800
We can't get there.

26
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,520
It's because there's a distance.

27
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,000
So we can't get there.

28
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,480
We can't get there.

29
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,920
We can't get there either.

30
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,360
Where did you get the rope?

31
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,760
We found a corpse on the tree.

32
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,360
We found it in the bag.

33
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
A 20-year-old man.

34
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,360
It's you, Tong Huo.

35
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
I'm the subordinate.

36
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,360
This rope is the closest to the special forces.

37
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,360
It can carry 3 tons of weight.

38
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,360
So we four should be able to get there.

39
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
So we four should be able to get there.

40
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,360
We don't know if the length is enough.

41
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,360
15 meters.

42
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,360
It's not long enough.

43
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,360
This is a 16-inch double-edged sword.

44
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,360
We can remove it and use it as a hand.

45
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Remove it?

46
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
Is it too thin?

47
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Don't pull it.

48
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
No.

49
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
We can get there.

50
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,360
We can use it as a rope.

51
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
We can get there.

52
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
To be continued...

53
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,520
0994466.

54
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,320
Come!

55
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,120
Wu Xie,

56
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,440
how come

57
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,300
there are thorns

58
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,840
over there?

59
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,480
I know

60
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,760
what you're gonna do

61
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,280
two things.

62
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:35,560
One.

63
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,340
Trust this rope

64
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:36,900
won't collapse.

65
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,400
Two.

66
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,680
Trust me.

67
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,260
Open it.

68
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,020
Bad blood für you.

69
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,960
Come, grab it.

70
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,340
You

71
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,800
Can't do this

72
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,640
You wuxi

73
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
this

74
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,900
Let me take it

75
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,300
Neither of us Leave

76
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,100
That went out

77
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,020
Hi visit

78
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,540
Enough, shut up.

79
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,020
I just...

80
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,540
When will you be so harsh?

81
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,740
I won't take you in anymore.

82
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,020
Let me do it.

83
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,380
I'll do it first.

84
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,580
Be careful.

85
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,580
I'll watch them.

86
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,020
Be careful, Wen.

87
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,700
Be careful.

88
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,500
Wu, is it reliable?

89
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,140
Yes, it is.

90
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,140
I'll try it.

91
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,860
Wait.

92
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,860
What's wrong?

93
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,220
Here, I'll give you the gun.

94
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,140
If anything happens to you,

95
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,140
you can protect yourself.

96
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,220
Withdraw time please.

97
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,140
I Rushed

98
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,640

99
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,640
I Rushed

100
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
I Rushed

101
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:50,140
Where am I enough?

102
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,920
Hi, my Rudik..

103
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,760

104
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,080
Xiaowen.

105
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,040
How's it going?

106
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Here she is.

107
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,480
It's okay!

108
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,000
Everyone comes together.

109
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,200
I... I will pass first.

110
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,640
I don't know if it's reliable or not.

111
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,640
I'll go first.

112
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm not a thief.

113
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
I'm not a thief.

114
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,800
Old man, you're a bit childish.

115
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,680
Old man, you're so ingrate.

116
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,960
Come over here!

117
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,380
But...

118
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,320
Maybe I'm a thief.

119
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,800
Oh, oh,онь?

120
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,800
Please, hold on.

121
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,320
Boss Yang went out.

122
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,560
He went into the closet.

123
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,360
And somebody ran him out.

124
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,440
Come on.

125
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,040
Let the window be opening.

126
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,160
Little man,

127
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,440
you are so capable.

128
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,960
vak around.

129
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,880
Next round of competition.

130
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,160
All right.

131
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:28,240
Lady постав罩别托我

132
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,840
You can go to me

133
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,500
Don't worry, it's not more than a good place

134
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,220
Do I have to trust you the least?

135
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:49,800
I don't know about my good heart

136
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,920
Tidus!

137
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,240
This is my ancestors!

138
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,600
Purr...

139
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Watch out, Commodore, there's a 그래서.

140
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,480
Hurry up, come here!

141
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,320
No, no, no.

142
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,000
I can't stand two people.

143
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,880
Mother, don't be afraid.

144
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,880
Hurry up!

145
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,280
No! Don't let him come up!

146
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,840
The rope can't be used.

147
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,960
It's so heavy.

148
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,200
Hurry up!

149
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,800
Take care of the way!

150
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,240
Father, why are you here?

151
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
I'm coming with the money!

152
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,540
Yes, mother, thanks.

153
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,960
Right!

154
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,200
You're going to pay!

155
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,320
Right!

156
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,000
переж rocks!

157
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,280
Hurry up!

158
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,960
Come on, stand up.

159
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,320
Father, you brainstorm!

160
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,000
Hurry, come here!

161
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What are you doing?

162
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,220
R�ay

163
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,480
Are you all right?

164
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:14,520
obrig

165
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Give me your hand!

166
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Don't! Don't!

167
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's a nonsense! We came here together!

168
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We can't save anyone!

169
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Mother, give me your hand!

170
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Mother!

171
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Are you okay?

172
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
My mother!

173
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
How dare you leave here!

174
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The late- exam is about to start!

175
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,900
Go away, thatぐ is coming after them!

176
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,860
My little human.

177
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,240
How could you do that?

178
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,040
You have a spirit of treason.

179
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,800
Don't override any limits.

180
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,880
I'll give you an impression,

181
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,840
he's just done his destined work.

182
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,680
Old man, we were very lucky.

183
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:50,360
I everywhere will haywire your high ills.

184
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
They're not coming.

185
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
Is it here?

186
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
I'm fine.

187
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
Don't move. Let me see.

188
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,040
This is impossible to climb up.

189
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
I'm afraid.

190
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
If you're afraid, then go back.

191
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
No one will come to you.

192
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
I'm afraid.

193
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
I'm afraid.

194
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
I'm afraid.

195
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
I'm afraid.

196
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
I'm afraid.

197
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,040
I'm afraid.

198
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
I'm afraid.

199
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
I'm afraid.

200
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
I'm afraid.

201
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
I'm afraid.

202
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
No one will stop you.

203
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,040
I'm afraid of that girl.

204
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Young man,

205
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,040
it's not a big deal to be wrong.

206
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,040
Maybe it's a life-threatening thing.

207
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
She's a girlfriend.

208
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
I hope you're worried.

209
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
You...

210
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
It's a wrong wound.

211
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,040
I'll help you fix it.

212
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Look.

213
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Look at the state of it now.

214
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,040
Look at the bones outside.

215
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
Do you know how high the bronze tree is?

216
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
Do you know?

217
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Do you know what's on it?

218
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Do you know?

219
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
No other work.

220
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Is it worth losing your life?

221
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Have you thought about it?

222
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,040
I don't know.

223
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,040
Let's go.

224
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,040
I'll go down.

225
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,040
What are you doing?

226
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Enough.

227
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
Now Qingyao is ready to fight.

228
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,040
The enemy can't solve any problem.

229
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
Can you...

230
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Can you be gentle?

231
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,040
I thought it was a white-haired man.

232
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
He's a star.

233
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
And a bug.

234
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
He must not be a white-haired man.

235
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,040
The rich man knocked on the door and sent money here.

236
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
You're not tired of killing the monkey.

237
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
Come on.

238
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Come on.

239
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Come on.

240
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Come on.

241
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
Come on.

242
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Come on.

243
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Come on.

244
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Come on.

245
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
Come on.

246
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,040
Come on.

247
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Sit here and rest.

248
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
No, hurry up.

249
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Eat something.

250
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Rest.

251
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Have you ever been to the valley when you came here?

252
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
I don't remember.

253
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,040
So you came here to find memories.

254
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,040
So you came here to report?

255
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
I don't remember.

256
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,040
No, you can't just eat and fight.

257
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,040
I don't know where Tianzhen is now.

258
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,040
I don't know if he's ever seen food.

259
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,040
I think I saw Wu Xie.

260
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
It's not a illusion.

261
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Is that the same as before?

262
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
Why didn't I see him?

263
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Xiaoge, I'll go there and have a look.

264
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Getting all the calluses out all of the time.

265
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Have I ever caught him?

266
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,040
quêsoo?

267
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,040
What do you want?

268
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
Look who is this?

269
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Don't move.

270
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Hello, you.

271
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Little brother,

272
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,040
you haven't eaten the Qilin Festival.

273
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
You've eaten the Qilin Festival.

274
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
This is the situation.

275
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
You want to kill?

276
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
Stop talking nonsense.

277
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,040
You are the head of the family.

278
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,040
You still don't know what's going on.

279
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Little brother,

280
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
your life is left.

281
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,040
It means you don't plan to kill me.

282
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,040
If you are in a bad temper,

283
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,040
you are going to die.

284
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
What?

285
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
Master Liang,

286
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
I've saved you so many times.

287
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
You are not only my friend,

288
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
but also a gunman.

289
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Why should we cooperate?

290
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Now,

291
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,040
we have to be responsible for each other.

292
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
You should think about it.

293
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,040
Do you want to cooperate with me?

294
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,040
I promise you won't be disappointed.

295
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
You can do it.

296
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
I heard this.

297
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
It's so easy to say.

298
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,040
Don't move.

299
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Don't touch him.

300
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
Don't touch him.

301
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
The wind is blowing.

302
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,040
It's time to be a man.

303
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Now,

304
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,040
you are going to take these two merchants.

305
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,040
How should we go?

306
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Is it up or down?

307
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
Have you considered it?

308
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
Master Wang,

309
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,040
you have a big fist.

310
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,040
You are going to use my blood

311
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,040
to deal with the bone.

312
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
And I can't die.

313
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Because if I die,

314
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
you don't know

315
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,040
whether you can afford to die.

316
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
Now I have equipment.

317
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,040
You have a spirit ring.

318
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,040
We can get money together.

319
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,040
You can't do that.

320
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,040
You can't do that.

321
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
Okay.

322
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,040
Listen to me.

323
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,040
After you died,

324
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,040
we have studied

325
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,040
the contents of the wood.

326
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,040
But the memory of the wood

327
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,040
is very random.

328
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,040
Sometimes it's used in Chinese.

329
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Sometimes it's used in Chinese.

330
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,040
Sometimes it's used in

331
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,040
a word that nobody knows.

332
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,040
Most of the wood is made of duck.

333
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Now, there are more than 20 people

334
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,040
who can read duck in the road.

335
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,040
What's not surprising is that

336
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,040
I am one of them.

337
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,040
According to the record of duck,

338
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,040
in the Northern Times,

339
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
there was a mining site

340
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
in Tai Bai Mountain.

341
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,040
They found a bronze pillar.

342
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,040
The wood has been deep into the mountain.

343
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,040
It can't be dug.

344
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
Some people say

345
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
it's a stick

346
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
that the emperor used to make.

347
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,040
The purpose is to

348
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
make the dragon's pulse

349
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,040
stick to the stone.

350
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
Otherwise,

351
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,040
the dragon will be very old.

352
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,040
Actually, it's all a piece of cake.

353
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,040
But the legend says

354
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
it's in the palace.

355
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,040
The emperor knows it.

356
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
It's interesting.

357
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,040
So he sent a duck army

358
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
to investigate here.

359
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,040
The duck army

360
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,040
not only found the bronze pillar,

361
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
but also found

362
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,040
a mysterious tomb nearby.

363
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
They also fought

364
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,040
with the chief minister of the minority.

365
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
At the same time,

366
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,040
the duck army also found

367
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,040
a stone box in the dragon's pulse.

368
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
It was empty.

369
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
There was a thing.

370
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
But it was...

371
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
Without Feng Xi,

372
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
it couldn't be opened.

373
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
The duck army couldn't move.

374
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
So they sent it to the palace.

375
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
The emperor was happy.

376
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,040
After he got the reward,

377
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
the duck army

378
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,040
drank it all at once.

379
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,040
There were some soldiers.

380
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,040
They were poisoned after the drunk.

381
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,040
They said they would climb the bronze pillar.

382
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,040
But the tomb

383
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,040
was covered with a stone.

384
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,040
It was a unknown stone.

385
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
I don't know

386
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,040
what's special about it.

387
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
I don't know.

388
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,040
I don't know what happened

389
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,040
after they climbed it.

390
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Since we don't know what happened,

391
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
we'll go up and have a look.

392
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
No way.

393
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,040
We don't know what's going on.

394
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
What else could happen?

395
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
It's not just a monkey

396
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,040
controlled by the bone.

397
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,040
We all climbed up from the tree.

398
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Listen, this is not a big deal.

399
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
As the saying goes,

400
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
be careful.

401
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
It's a long story.

402
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,040
We've come here.

403
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,040
How many people are there?

404
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Think about it.

405
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,040
It's a huge loss.

406
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
It's a life.

407
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,040
Ning, I'll go up and have a look.

408
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,040
My brother will leave it to you.

409
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,040
The little monkey is almost done.

410
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Time to go.

411
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Mr. Liang,

412
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,040
I'm sorry to bother you with these two friends.

413
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Don't worry.

414
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,040
If they have any trouble,

415
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,040
don't think about going out.

416
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Don't scare me.

417
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,040
I have this.

418
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
You go first.

419
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,040
The war is over.

420
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,040
We can save a lot of energy.

421
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
When we were repairing it,

422
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,040
we were going to give it to the emperor.

423
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
The work and the materials will be saved.

424
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Look,

425
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
the Russian of the Heavenly Army,

426
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,040
the Eagle-Fighting Wood,

427
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
and Zhao Zhouqiao,

428
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,040
are all the buildings of the 8th, 9th,

429
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
and 8th century.

430
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,040
The wind and the wind,

431
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,040
the wind and the wind,

432
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
the wind and the wind,

433
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,040
the wind and the wind,

434
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
the wind and the wind,

435
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,560
and the wind sought a lot of places

436
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,040
to the present.

437
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,360
You have these建 quartz

438
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:35,880
and these Kelsey

439
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,760
Yeah.

440
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,620
Yeah, baby.

441
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,820
Take it slow.

442
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,000
Got it.

443
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,500
Cool.

444
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,980
I'll take my driver.

445
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,580
我别放 …

446
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,800
I'm going to get out?

447
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,780
Sometimes I do have time.

448
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,340
Can I call my friend?

449
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,740
I'm going to take a taxi.

450
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,100
I won't say anything.

451
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,700
No огранич Black

452
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,820
I don't think you will replace…

453
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:12,900
What?

454
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,620
No.

455
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,620
You will not.

456
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,020
B‿

457
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:16,980
Spare me.

458
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,220
Good for you.

459
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,460
Have you figured out what's inside?

460
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,180
Calm down.

461
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:28,860
Check the Edin Capital,

462
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,020
and give me the briefcase.

463
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,020
What's here?

464
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:32,920
OK.

465
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,760
香港.

466
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,440
What happen here?

467
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,400
It's necessary to make a security check.

468
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,440
Go!

469
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,160
Sorry!

470
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,120
Sorry, sorry.

471
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,720
Take care!

472
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,920
Thank you.

473
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,140
Scew

474
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,340
A

Scew

477
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,880

479
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,720

00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:52,360
flyar.

481
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,540
Come watch it.

482
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,520
Get lost!

483
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,520
This coffin is too good.

484
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,160
Mi Fengxi was so small.

485
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,680
How could they place it inside the coffin?

486
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,600
Particularly this one,

487
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,400
The bottom of Lird-roofed herbs.

488
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,200
Ta-da.

489
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:24,240
Ju

490
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,480
Kimberly

491
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,900
Take your bags, fuck him, you pig.

492
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,540
Dad!

493
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,200
Who are you?

494
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,900
好像 я не dedim,line.

495
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,580
The

496
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,780
the

497
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,780
the

498
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,780
the

499
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,780
the

500
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,780
the

501
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,780
the

502
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,780
the

503
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,780
the

504
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,780
the

505
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,780
the

506
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,780
the

507
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,660
긴

508
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:55,660
in the

509
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,160
the

510
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,200
the

511
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
There are so many trees.

512
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,200
The fire is too loose.

513
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200
So there are so many times.

514
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
We have to be careful of our feet and our heads.

515
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
It's dangerous.

516
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Come on. I don't have any stones.

517
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
Let's go this way.

518
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,200
The fire is too loose.

519
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
Are you okay?

520
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Let's go.

521
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
Take a rest.

522
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
What is that?

523
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
I don't know.

524
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Come on.

525
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Let's go somewhere else.

526
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,200
It seems to be that green forest again.

527
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
Let's go further.

528
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,200
Why can't I see clearly?

529
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,200
Why are you so far away?

530
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
Go over there.

531
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,200
Okay.

532
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Hurry up.

533
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Let me do it.

534
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Give it to me.

535
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,200
Let me do it.

536
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,200
Let me do it.

537
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,200
Let me do it.

538
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,200
I know.

539
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
Hurry up.

540
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,200
I know. Don't push.

541
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Let me do it.

542
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
Give it to me.

543
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
It's dangerous. I'll go to the road.

544
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
I'll go first.

545
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
You...

546
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,200
Give it to me.

547
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Get up.

548
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
I'll do it.

549
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
I'll do it.

550
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
You...

551
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,200
I'll do it.

552
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
I'll do it.

553
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
The End

554
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,200
The End

555
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,200
The End

556
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
The End

557
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,200
The End

558
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,200
The End
