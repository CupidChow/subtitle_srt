77
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,980
I'm going to find him

78
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,980
You're so old

79
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,980
Don't throw me away

80
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,980
Where are you?

00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,980
Lao Suzi

82
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,980
You're quite young

83
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,980
Are you okay?

84
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,980
I'm so scared to see you

85
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,980
Where are we?

86
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,980
Are you hurt?

87
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,980
No

88
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,980
No

89
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,980
Let me help you

90
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,980
So big?

91
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,980
No wonder we can't even scratch our heads

92
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,980
Let me use it

93
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,980
Didn't you notice?

94
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,980
This book is made of bronze

95
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,980
It's a miracle

96
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,980
The God of the Ghost's Mansion

97
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,980
The God of the Ghost's Mansion

98
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,980
This is the real body of the bronze

99
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,980
So this book has been on it

100
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,980
It's the one you and the horse discovered

101
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,980
Could it be that the community is in trouble?

102
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,980
No

103
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,980
Such a big bronze

104
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,980
It's impossible to use such a good eye technology

105
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,980
Who made it?

106
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,980
How could it be here?

107
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,980
Could it be that the Jade-Demon has grown out?

108
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,980
Nonsense

109
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,980
Think about it

110
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,980
We're from the place in the Yellow Spring

111
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,980
It's not from the Jade-Demon

112
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,980
Where else could it be?

113
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,980
Come down here

114
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,980
There's a huge crowd

115
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,980
It must be the community

116
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,980
When they saw the wood

117
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,980
They found this bronze tree

118
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,980
But I don't know how deep it is

119
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,980
Lao Yang

120
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,980
Lao Yang

121
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,980
What's wrong?

122
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,980
I...

123
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,980
I don't know

124
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,980
I think we should climb up

125
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,980
We really are a monkey

126
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,980
Let's go

127
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,980
This book is too evil

128
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,980
You must be careful

129
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,980
Why is it a dead end?

130
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,980
They fixed the wood

131
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,980
After the stone is moved

132
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,980
It must be sealed

133
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,980
What should we do now?

134
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,980
This is good

135
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,980
Wait

136
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,980
You use this in the wood

137
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,980
You are a bloodbath

138
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,980
You cut the big hole and sell it

139
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,980
You use it

140
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,980
Wait until we get to the ground

141
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,980
You use it

142
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,980
I don't care if you buy it all

143
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,980
Okay?

144
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,980
What do you think?

145
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,980
Go

146
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,980
Open this

147
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,980
Why do you support me?

148
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,980
You are a drunkard

149
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,980
Miss Li

150
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,980
This place is a bit evil

151
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,980
We should go back to the ice

152
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,980
Mr. LE Recently

153
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,980
He has mine

154
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,160
Keep the spirit down.

155
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,440
In your distress,

156
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,820
illicit and immoral people at home are trapped in normal words.

157
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,240
While some people are b분 Where are you going?

158
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,480
You've complained to him!

159
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,980
Oh, I should have extract it myself!

160
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,980
Miss An Ning, does it hurt?

161
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,980
It's not good to be by Tianzhen's side.

162
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,980
This should be the scene of the shooting crew.

163
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,980
Where is the shooting crew?

164
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,980
The whole body is in the museum.

165
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,980
The director is here.

166
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,980
It's pretty good.

167
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980
It's orange.

168
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,980
You can move it if you don't mind.

169
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,980
The director is here.

170
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,980
The spirit...

171
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,980
You must be...

172
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,980
Stop it.

173
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,980
You want to move the roof, but we don't.

174
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,980
If you touch the spirit, you'll be in trouble.

175
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,980
You'll be in trouble if you get angry.

176
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,980
The director is here.

177
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,980
Director's POV

178
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,980
These birds are rare feathers...

179
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,980
...that are evenly numbered on one friend.

180
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,980
Uncle Th política told me that.

181
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,980
The egg bird was still better thanρ.

182
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,980
That egg was already in few figures.

183
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,420
There are only weeks until my father gets well soon

184
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,500
and the trouble will be guys who will support his프

185
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,520
my work.

186
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,260
I planned ab待.

187
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,760
My clients of my family came to me

188
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,140
to make a suggestion once again.

189
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
After Watchman Tada gave me a quarrel.

190
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,700
The two duyors came too soon.

191
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,260
I haven't ib interested on such things

192
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,620
since I usually come back since ال ones are two time.

193
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,380
It sounds like...

194
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,540
it's the usual conversation

195
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,980
You were wrong.

196
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,340
zero

197
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,940
Why?

198
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,140
Nothing.

199
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,620
You said to be żyland, but know dough dough.

200
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,820
End of Episode One

201
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,220
Damn it.

202
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,340
VODELKA

203
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,620
Hey!

204
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,860
Hey!

205

Come on! Come on!

209
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,620
What?

210
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,620
What are you doing? Did you just throw the car?

211
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,620
No!

212
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,620
In могли drove you!

213
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,620
Ask me to come out!

214
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,620
Ask where are you going to get the dead bosses!

215
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,620
Go away!

216
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,620
Why are you still driving?

217
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,620
Come out!

218
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,620
Go!

219
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,780
Lada

220
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,880
Inf Baltic

221
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,000
Sh freestyle

222
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,160
You horses

Meg questions

225

Zhang

226
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,360
The

227
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,980
They look for louses.

228
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,780
They smell good.

229
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,180
Where's Theykin?

230
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,020
I won't let him cool your pain.

231
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,680
How he would have run away?

232
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,060
He was your friend.

233
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,940
You are evil to him.

234
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,280
Ahora!

235
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,320
What's going on?

236
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,160
You didn'tress euquel?

237
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,680
You guys come take a look around.

238
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
There is a spf Э Christmas seat on the top.

239
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
What are you doing?

240
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
It's a double-body shot.

241
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,360
It's a shot of a bandit.

242
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,360
Why are you here?

243
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,360
Maybe the people of the bandit thought it was a miracle.

244
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,360
So they shot a bandit on it and said it was a monster.

245
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,360
Mr. Liang, you've seen a lot of things.

246
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Can you tell when the green tree was born?

247
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,360
What era was it?

248
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,360
Maybe it was in the Shang Zhou era.

249
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,360
It's been over a thousand years since the Shang Zhou era.

250
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,360
Mr. Liang, you're talking about the same thing.

251
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,360
This thing has to be tested with the special device.

252
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,360
It's just a physical eye.

253
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,360
How can it be seen at a specific age?

254
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,360
Look carefully.

255
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
The color is black.

256
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,360
It's black and gray.

257
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,360
It's probably a kind of the Xiching bronze,

258
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,360
and the Qianxing bronze.

259
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,360
It's probably the time of the Xizhou era.

260
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,360
How big is it?

261
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,360
You're so stubborn.

262
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
It's about five percent.

263
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,360
It's the same as I said.

264
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,360
The shareholders are mostly from the future.

265
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
They're not so good.

266
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,360
Mr. Liang can see that the Xizhou era is over.

267
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,360
Mr. Liang, if you count it as the Xizhou era,

268
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,360
according to the past industrial level,

269
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,360
can there be such a bronze tree?

270
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,360
My little soul,

271
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,360
you're even more difficult to deal with.

272
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,360
I only know that the bronze tree needs to be made of peach.

273
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,360
It's the peach tree's mold.

274
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,360
In theory, as long as it can be made of peach,

275
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
it can be made of...

276
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,360
How big is the bronze tree?

277
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
Impossible.

278
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,360
Of course, it's not impossible.

279
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
Let me tell you.

280
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,360
About a thousand years ago,

281
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,360
around the same time as the industrial era,

282
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,360
history was called the period of the miracle.

283
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,360
Many impossible things were created at that time.

284
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,360
For example, the Changcheng gold tower,

285
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,360
the Qin's imperial forest, the Barbita,

286
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,360
if you can't make such a big bronze tree,

287
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
it's hard to say.

288
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,360
After all, technology is mature.

289
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,360
The emperor ordered that the people below

290
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,360
would work hard and do it for ten years.

291
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,360
It's impossible to make it.

292
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,360
It's not a few thousand years.

293
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,360
You can't even make it.

294
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,360
Back then, Qin Shu Guang took the world's army

295
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,360
and made it twelve years.

296
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Such a big bronze tree

297
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,360
can be made of hundreds of gold.

298
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,360
Moreover, where did you get so many bronze?

299
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,360
Tell me.

300
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,360
You're a tyrant.

301
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,360
Maybe because you lived in this bronze tree,

302
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,360
when you became the emperor of Qin,

303
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
you had little bronze.

304
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,360
You could only make those twelve gold.

305
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,360
What?

306
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,360
You're a expert.

307
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,360
You're talking nonsense.

308
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
You're right.

309
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,360
You're right.

310
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,360
Didn't the boss say that

311
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,360
this tomb is more precious than the royal tomb?

312
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,360
But we've been walking for so long,

313
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
and we didn't find anything.

314
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Isn't there such a big bronze tree?

315
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,360
We're not talking about the same thing.

316
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,360
There's such a big tree.

317
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,360
The bronze tree of three hearts.

318
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,360
That's the national treasure, you know?

319
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,360
It seems that you can dig it out and sell it.

320
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
What's wrong with digging it out?

321
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,360
If you can really dig it out,

322
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
then you'll be in big trouble.

323
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Then dig it out.

324
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
You dig it out and sell it.

325
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,360
Don't miss it.

326
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,360
Yes.

327
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
I'm sure that the treasure of the boss Li

328
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
is not the bronze tree.

329
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
Do you want to find the treasure?

330
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,360
Even the coffin of the tomb is not found.

331
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,360
Don't mention the treasure of the tomb.

332
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,360
It's a pity that the boss Li died so suddenly.

333
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
Otherwise,

334
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,360
he would know how to get out of this tomb.

335
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
Wait for me.

336
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,360
Wait for me.

337
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Wait.

338
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
Wu.

339
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,360
You've taken all your life.

340
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
You can't take it anymore.

341
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,360
My friend, I'll help you.

342
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
Are you all right?

343
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,360
Yang.

344
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,360
You know that we had a serious fight with Mr. Liang.

345
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
And you've been in this tomb for so long.

346
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,360
You must have known where the bronze tree is.

347
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,360
Right?

348
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Come.

349
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
What is the secret of the bronze book?

350
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,360
Mr. Liang, did this person come with you?

351
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,360
I don't know.

352
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,360
We came here just for five people.

353
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,360
You've seen it before.

354
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,360
Xiaoyang.

355
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
What's wrong?

356
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,360
Xiaoyang.

357
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,360
This person should be dead.

358
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
He's still soft.

359
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,360
He's hot.

360
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
Did anyone come in?

361
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,360
Don't bother about anyone else.

362
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,360
Let's save him first.

363
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,360
Actually, I hate him when I was in the sea.

364
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
I didn't have anything to do with him.

365
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,360
I was just nervous to see him.

366
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,360
So I let him go.

367
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,360
I didn't have anything to do with him.

368
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,360
But now he's fine.

369
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,360
I don't have time to explain to him.

370
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,360
It's not good to be in a good mood.

371
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,360
What should we do now?

372
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
I'm asking you.

373
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,360
What should we do?

374
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,360
There's a entrance here.

375
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,360
You don't say there's an entrance in front of us.

376
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
You...

377
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,360
If you had said it earlier,

378
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
could you have made up your mind?

379
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,360
Xiaodian Zhen, could your wife have died?

380
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,360
And that Guo Erguo...

381
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
I just remembered.

382
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,360
I only know it now.

383
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,360
What else do you remember?

384
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
What else do you have?

385
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,360
What else do you have?

386
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,360
What else do you have?

387
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,360
Can you give me a little bit of a hint?

388
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,360
Very nice.

389
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,360
It's a great help.

390
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,360
It's a great help.

391
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,360
Thank you.

392
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,360
Thank you.

393
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
How did you get mad?

394
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,360
Although we don't know where he come from,

395
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,360
his goal is probably the same as ours.

396
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,360
So he died here without a clue?

397
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,360
Why did you let me feel the pain of death?

398
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,360
You're a loser.

399
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
If he didn't die,

400
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,360
we wouldn't fight with him.

401
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,360
You want to fight?

402
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,360
If he still has a companion,

403
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,360
we should have sent a number.

404
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,360
I don't know.

405
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,360
So now, we should have sent a number.

406
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
A number?

407
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Why?

408
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
I thought about it.

409
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,360
We've been here for so long.

410
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,360
We should have been far away.

411
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,360
But we didn't see anything other than the bronze tree.

412
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,360
Maybe, for ancient socialists,

413
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,360
the bronze tree is probably the miracle you said.

414
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
So they put the soil on the bronze tree.

415
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,360
Think about it.

416
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,360
Will their leader

417
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,360
put his soul in the place

418
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,360
where they think he is the closest to God?

419
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,360
You mean,

420
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,360
the owner of the tomb

421
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,360
put his coffin on the tree?

422
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
The treasure is on the tree.

423
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,360
So, we should send a number.

424
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
Send a number?

425
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,360
Yes.

426
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,360
I'm old.

427
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
My legs are not so good.

428
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,360
Can you keep me company?

429
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,360
Let's go.

430
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
Wait.

431
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,360
Here.

432
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,360
Put this on.

433
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,360
What do you mean?

434
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,360
You... You just take it

435
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,360
as a metal piece

436
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,360
of a high-pressure shop.

437
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,360
Okay?

438
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,360
To be honest,

439
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,360
I'll explain to you

440
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,360
later, okay?

441
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,360
Mr. Liang, let's go.

442
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,360
Let's go.

443
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,360
Stay with us.

444
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,360
Let's go.

445
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,360
You...

446
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,360
Stay with us.

447
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,360
Wu Xian, be careful.

448
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
Don't touch the tree.

449
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,360
Okay.

450
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
What?

451
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,360
Why are you climbing up?

452
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,360
You... You...

453
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,360
You... You...

454
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,360
You... You...

455
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,360
You... You...

456
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
Get off.

457
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,360
You... You...

458
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
Mr. Liang, it's okay.

459
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,360
Let's go up first.

460
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
Then, we'll pull you up.

461
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,360
You... You...

462
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
Don't... Don't pull me down.

463
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
If you want to pull me down,

464
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,360
let's pull you down.

465
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,360
Don't worry.

466
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,360
Where's the little man?

467
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,360
Be careful.

468
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,360
Be careful.

469
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,360
You're lying on the outside.

470
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,360
Don't touch the tree.

471
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,360
Be careful.

472
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,360
Come on.

473
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,360
Be careful.

474
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,360
Come on.

475
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,360
You...

476
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,360
You...

477
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,360
Hurry up.

478
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,360
Hurry up.

479
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,360
Come on.

480
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
Ready?

481
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
One, two, three.

482
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,360
Come on.

483
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,360
Come on.

484
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,360
Be careful.

485
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
Be careful.

486
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,360
This little man

487
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,360
didn't tell me

488
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,360
that there's a pit here.

489
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,360
Let's go.

490
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,360
Come on.

491
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,360
Come on.

492
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,360
It's a good place.

493
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,360
I've been here before.

494
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,360
I remember it.

495
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,360
This is the mark I'm used to.

496
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,360
I always have this mark

497
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,360
on my back.

498
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,360
When did you come here?

499
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
I think

500
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,360
I went to the Western Sea.

501
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,360
I don't want to let you in.

502
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,360
Just help me to find out

503
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,360
if there's a place

504
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,360
where the fat man is.

505
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
How many are there?

506
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,360
Do you think it's worth going in?

507
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
The tomb of the社 clan

508
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,360
is different from the tomb of the Chinese.

509
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,360
It's been rebuilt here.

510
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,360
Such a strong mechanism.

511
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,360
Maybe it's just a handkerchief.

512
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
Be careful.

513
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,360
My little man.

514
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,360
It's too tiring to climb this path.

515
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,360
Let's take a break.

516
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,360
I beg you.

517
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,360
Why are you so serious?

518
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
Luo Yang.

519
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
Let's take a break.

520
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
Thank you.

521
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
I'm so tired.

522
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,360
I... I have food here.

523
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,360
There are two here.

524
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,360
Here.

525
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,360
Thank you.

526
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,360
Give it to me.

527
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Little man.

528
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,360
You've been watching us

529
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,360
all the way.

530
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,360
Don't touch this tree.

531
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,360
What's the reason?

532
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
I don't want to die.

533
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
Just listen to me.

534
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
Little man.

535
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,360
It seems

536
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,360
you're familiar with the environment here.

537
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,360
But according to my knowledge,

538
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,360
even the owner of the tomb

539
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,360
hasn't mentioned this tree.

540
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,360
No, no.

541
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,360
You're not done yet.

542
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,360
You don't have enough sweat.

543
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
You can use your saliva to spray it.

544
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,360
Okay, I won't say it.

545
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
Wu.

546
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,360
We can't do this.

547
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,360
Look.

548
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,360
There are hundreds of meters above.

549
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,360
Just this much.

550
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,360
We might have to kneel on the tree.

551
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,360
Old man.

552
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,360
I think

553
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,360
there's something watching us.

554
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
No.

555
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,360
There's nothing here.

556
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,360
Except for the sand

557
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,360
and the dead below.

558
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,360
Could it be

559
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,360
his ghost is watching us?

560
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,360
Don't talk nonsense.

561
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
In this environment,

562
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,360
don't think nonsense.

563
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,360
If you think about it,

564
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,360
after watching the horror movie,

565
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,360
you'll think

566
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,360
there are those

567
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,360
who can't see the good brothers.

568
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,360
Little man.

569
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,360
What did you see?

570
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,360
Don't scare me.

571
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,360
Is there

572
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,360
anything else on this tree?

573
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,360
Don't think about it.

574
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,360
We found such a big tree.

575
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,360
If we informed the government,

576
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,360
would we use our name

577
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,360
to make it a secret?

578
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,360
Uncle Qing,

579
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,360
have you heard of the horse's head?

580
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,360
Is it a triangle?

581
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,360
Yes, it's a bit cold.

582
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,360
But give me some time.

583
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,360
I'll think about it.

584
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,360
Do you have any name with oxygen?

585
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,360
Mr. Liang.

586
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,360
Are you ready to take a rest?

587
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
Let's go.

588
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,360
Let's go.

589
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,360
Let's go.

590
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,360
Hurry up.

591
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,360
I can't.

592
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,360
I'm afraid of heights.

593
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,360
Come on.

594
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,360
Please start your performance.

595
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,360
Great.

596
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,360
What's going on?

597
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,360
What's going on?

598
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,360
What's going on?

599
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,360
I think someone's coming.

600
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,360
Could it be your companion?

601
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,360
It's impossible.

602
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,360
The outside world is on fire.

603
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
We can't kill them all.

604
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
It's impossible to kill them all.

605
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360
What's going on?

606
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
What's going on?

607
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,360
What's going on?

608
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,360
It's impossible.

609
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,360
It's impossible to kill them all.

610
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,360
So who are you talking about?

611
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,360
Could it be

612
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,360
the body's companion?

613
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,360
That's bad.

614
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,360
If we get in a fight,

615
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,360
it's not easy to handle.

616
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,360
I'll go down and take a look.

617
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
Don't move.

618
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,360
They have guns.

619
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,360
I have guns, too.

620
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,360
You finish it first.

621
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,360
We're the enemy now.

622
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,360
We don't even know how many people there are.

623
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
We can't be reckless.

624
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,360
We're in a hurry.

625
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,360
We'll keep moving.

626
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,360
Hurry up.

627
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,360
Hurry up.

628
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,360
Hurry up.

629
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,360
Go, go, go.

630
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,360
My lord, don't worry.

631
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,360
Go.

632
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,360
Hurry up.

633
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,360
Don't worry.

634
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360
Be careful.

635
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
Follow me.

636
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
Old man,

637
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,360
can you go up there?

638
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,360
Don't worry, Mr. Liang.

639
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,360
We'll do our best.

640
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,360
We'll pull you up.

641
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
By the way,

642
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,360
if we meet your companion in the process,

643
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
you'll be the one to go.

644
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
We'll work together.

645
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
We'll be in a good mood.

646
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,360
Don't worry.

647
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
We'll work together.

648
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,360
We'll work together.

649
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,360
Don't be so reckless.

650
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,360
Don't worry.

651
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,360
Come on. Give me your hand.

652
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,360
My lord.

653
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,360
Go.

654
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,360
Go.

655
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,360
Go.

656
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,360
Go.

657
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,360
Go.

658
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,360
The End
