00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,480
It's not a big deal.

3
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,880
Besides, you're like the one in the middle.

4
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,040
It's not a door.

5
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,480
What kind of style is this?

6
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,160
This one, this one, this one.

7
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,960
Don't worry about it.

8
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,800
Do you have a secret passage?

9
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,000
A secret passage?

10
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
You deserve it.

11
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,200
P Olympickeeper, look.

12
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,560
Those compensations could be taken from the holy bowels.

13
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,040
Hmm.

14
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,080
Most açık goes against decorations,

15
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,000
every tree has this special shape.

16
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
They are very serious about the injury.

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
They will be punished.

18
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I need to ask the manager to do something.

19
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's too hard.

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No, you are not a good person.

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's not your place.

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But this light is really...

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's impossible for you to get a reward.

24
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You are really not good.

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's really hard for me to give you any idea.

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
These things need to be organized.

27
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Excuse me, sir. May I talk with Hong Dui?

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Very moment. I will find you later.

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
All right.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What's the matter? May I help you?

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Good to see you. My name is Wu Xie.

32
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Mr. Wu, hello.

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You are really nice to me.

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I have lived in China for a long time.

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's a beautiful country.

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Thank you.

37
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
May I help you?

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's like this.

39
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I love the art.

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I am very honored to be a part of your museum.

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But I found some small problems.

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Some precious art can be protected better.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Just like those paintings.

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If their light can be changed,

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
it can be...

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's precious.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,360
This is Mr. Wu's contribution to those

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
of the princesses.

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Princesses?

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Most of them are famous and beautiful.

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The author is not famous.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
They are just a handful of them.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
To me, there is no big difference between them and the princesses.

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But you have taken them away.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You have the right to protect them.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's a responsibility.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Investment, sir.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is just investment.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
In my museum,

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
there are many more valuable art than them.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But we still need some...

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We still need some...

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's dive, old beach.

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I understand.

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You are not a fan of culture.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You are just a businessman.

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Businessman, artist, collector are just a symbol.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But no matter what,

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Chinese should thank me and people like me.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay, I understand you.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But you should understand.

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
If these cultural relics can be better protected,

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
their value will be higher.

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes, it's not difficult.

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It won't cost much.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But unless I can do it,

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I will be able to do it.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Otherwise, they will never be good to me.

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Don't you think about the future?

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
For a dead person,

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
it's not important whether they are grateful or grieved.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Mr. Andre, what's the most important for you?

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Life and death.

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Life and death.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That's the real deal.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You two are fighting.

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Why are you fighting?

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I've been around for a while.

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't have fish.

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You said I was going to come.

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I forgot about the auction.

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's okay, don't worry.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Hello.

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Come on.

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Come on.

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I...

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Come on, come on.

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Excuse me, sir.

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Do you know the auction in here?

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry, sir.

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You must be mistaken.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
There's no auction here.

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's fine.

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll show you the picture.

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Give me a second.

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Do you know the Chinese snake?

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I know their museum has a Chinese snake.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Do you know this?

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm sorry, sir.

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I've never seen this before.

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What does this mean?

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He's never seen the auction.

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No.

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No, no, no, no.

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We came here for this.

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We came from abroad.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
From Beijing.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
From Beijing Fly.

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
How could the big old man not have it?

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Sorry, sir.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We saw that on your museum's website.

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And we came here just for the Chinese snake.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What kind of the Chinese snake do you have?

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I have no idea.

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Let me tell you.

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The picture is short.

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If we don't see the auction,

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
why are we here?

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What a surprise.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Uncle San?

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What are you doing?

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What are you looking for?

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I saw Uncle San.

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Uncle San?

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Why are you here?

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Impossible.

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll go find him.

139
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You...

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You're sure that the Chinese snake is here?

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Hey, hey, hey.

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Where are you?

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Where are you?

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm so confused.

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What's he doing there?

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He's not with that man.

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Who's that?

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I saw him with the director.

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But I don't know what he's doing.

150
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He's a man.

151
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Ask him.

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hurry.

153
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Hello, can you help me take a picture?

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
No, it's okay.

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You can take a picture first.

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Thank you.

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Fatty, where's Uncle San?

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He's gone.

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He's just like Xiao Ge.

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Really?

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He's gone. What should we do?

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's go.

164
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Follow the foreigner.

165
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Let's go.

166
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Hurry.

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Follow him.

168
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hurry.

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Follow him.

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Hey, hey.

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You drive this car in China.

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You drive this car in China.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You drive this car in China.

174
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Hey, are you asking for money?

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You have a girlfriend.

176
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Stop bothering me.

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You said that this guy

178
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
took my uncle's box out again.

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Where is he going?

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He's not going to see Uncle San.

181
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He's going to meet me in the morning.

182
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's not a good idea.

183
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Fatty.

184
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What's the relationship between me and Nellie?

185
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And Gao Ge?

186
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What's wrong with the press conference?

187
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Is this snake and fish in the museum?

188
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
No.

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Can you ask me something?

190
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Fatty.

191
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I feel like my life is a huge mess.

192
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It seems that all the people are in the museum.

193
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But when I walk out, I find that

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
every road is a dead end.

195
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Can you control your emotions?

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Don't always call me this.

197
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What if we have no intention?

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Look.

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The short messages we received in Beijing and the Internet

200
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
are all because we came here

201
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
and we all think that we can find the snake and fish.

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But we found nothing here.

203
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I've been thinking about it.

204
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I've been thinking about it.

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There are two characters here.

206
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
One is a ghost.

207
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
No, four characters.

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
One is a ghost.

209
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You mean, someone is shooting a game?

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Can you hide your evil spirit from the country to the country?

211
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Only a few people?

212
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
This is not the style of my uncle.

213
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Don't always talk about uncle.

214
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You don't think about uncle.

215
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You never think about that person.

216
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That...

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Ning.

218
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Ning?

219
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They are in the company?

220
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But why?

221
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Haidimu didn't kill you.

222
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
He killed you abroad.

223
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And it's hard to find out what he did abroad.

224
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And...

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He killed your cost this time.

226
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
He made the money himself.

227
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's so quiet.

228
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But Ning doesn't know what's the problem.

229
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Not necessarily.

230
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Haidimu took your uncle to the country.

231
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And he said something about him.

232
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He knew that Xie Lianghuang was dead.

233
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
He took the snake-meat-tong fish.

234
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But the picture on the net is real.

235
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The snake-meat-tong fish is in your hand.

236
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Good.

237
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
He is exposed.

238
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You are good.

239
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You can break the case.

240
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Look, they are real bullets.

241
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
They are military base.

242
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't think so.

243
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Hello, sir.

244
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm a soldier.

245
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm a soldier.

246
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm a soldier.

247
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm a soldier.

248
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Hello, sir.

249
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Your invitation card.

250
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Fatty, it seems that there is an invitation card.

251
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yes.

252
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What should we do?

253
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
How do I know?

254
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Look, I look like an invitation card.

255
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Why do you look like it?

256
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You...

257
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Sir.

258
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Forget it. You can go down.

259
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Here, here, here.

260
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
This, this, this.

261
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You go down.

262
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You...

263
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You...

264
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
See you inside.

265
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What should we do?

266
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What should we do?

267
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Wait a minute.

268
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Please take out your invitation card.

269
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Hello.

270
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm a soldier here.

271
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I just forgot to invite you.

272
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Can I join tonight's activity?

273
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Sorry.

274
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I have to invite you.

275
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I can let you in.

276
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I really have an invitation card.

277
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
If I go back to get it,

278
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I will miss tonight's activity.

279
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But tonight is really important to me.

280
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Sorry, sir.

281
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I have to invite you.

282
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I can let you in.

283
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But your invitation card is here.

284
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Wait a minute.

285
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Please take out your invitation card.

286
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm with him.

287
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Tina.

288
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You go back first.

289
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'll go back.

290
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The color of the green is so nice.

291
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I hate it.

292
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Why did you help me?

293
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
In such a beautiful night,

294
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I need a young and handsome man.

295
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Please take me with you.

296
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm very honored.

297
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What should we do?

298
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What should we do?

299
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Let's go.

300
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I have to go with the camera.

301
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Drive away.

302
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Wait.

303
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But I want to go with him.

304
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You ruined my shirt!

305
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I don't mean it. I'll make it up for you.

306
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Good day, minister.

307
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Please.

308
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Please, sir.

309
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Please, miss.

310
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Hands up.

311
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay, please. Please.

312
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Please.

313
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Okay.

314
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Where's your key?

315
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Please.

317
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This way, please.

318
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Please, sir.

319
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Thank you.

320
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm glad to meet you.

321
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I think tonight will be a wonderful night.

322
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Hi, Alice.

323
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
My friend is over there.

324
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm sorry.

326
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
My friend is over there.

329
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'll take you there to introduce you to him.

330
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Of course.

331
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But my friend is here.

332
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I want to meet them first.

333
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Can you go to my friend first?

334
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Or your friend?

335
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll be back soon.

336
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay.

337
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm sorry.

338
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Father.

339
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What's the matter?

340
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm sorry.

343
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm sorry.

344
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm sorry.

346
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm sorry.

352
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You know, should I think about it?

354
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The truth is,

355
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I always want to be a better person.

356
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
The master Master Body.

357
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yes.

358
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The master of everybody else.

359
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's the true peach in which you're here.

360
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
We must do something together.

361
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Why do you hesitate?

362
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Sunday is heavy.

363
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Sometimes it's hard to quit.

364
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And the rest are up to date.

365
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's too late.

366
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,720
For sure.

367
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Me too.

368
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,560
But that's extremely unlikely.

369
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,360
Otherwise the world would be full of Aegean's humans.

370
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,200
Maybe it's something only few people get access

371
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,200
and full of unpredictable changes.

372
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,760
Father, you make it sound real.

373
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,000
THE VERSION

374
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,280
Is the auction ready?

375
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,280
Everything's ready.

376
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,560
The person you asked for has arrived.

377
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,400
I hope this man will not disappoint me.

378
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,760
I'm so gonna talk about this with your manager.

379
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
I don't mean it.

380
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,760
I'm so sorry.

381
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
Sorry, sorry.

382
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
Follow me.

383
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,760
No, no, no.

384
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
Follow me.

385
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
Follow me.

386
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Go.

387
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,760
Buy, buy, buy a car.

388
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
Did you find him?

389
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,760
The sight is not good.

390
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,760
I'm gonna go a little bit further.

391
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Okay.

392
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Almost there.

393
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
It's just a fool.

394
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,760
I don't think this catalogue contains all the exhibits.

395
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Let me take a look at it. Exhibit number 105.

396
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
Do you like this one?

397
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,760
This is a bit. Looks good.

398
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
Yeah honey, I like this one.

399
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
Miss, can I have a cup of wine?

400
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
Sorry, I'm sorry.

401
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Sorry.

402
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
Why don't you have a drink?

403
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
I can have a drink with you.

404
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,760
How is it? Do you hear me clearly? Do you want me to go over there?

405
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
Hello.

406
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,760
Sir.

407
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,760
Do you have a cocktail?

408
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
Why?

409
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
No, no, no. I don't want a cocktail.

410
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
No, no, no.

411
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
I don't want a cocktail.

412
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
No, no, no.

413
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,760
Okay, never mind.

414
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,760
Sorry, sorry.

415
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,760
Why are you here?

416
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,760
Why are you talking to Gui Ming?

417
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
No, no.

418
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
Why are you here?

419
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,760
I'm not Gui Ming. I don't want to be a waiter.

420
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
Do you like it?

421
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
No, thanks.

422
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760
What's this?

423
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,760
There are so many people here.

424
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,760
Look at the number of people.

425
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,760
It's really a lot.

426
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
It seems like...

427
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,760

432
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Hurry up.

433
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,760

443
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760

453
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
He's out.

454
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,760
Look at the ghost.

455
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Let's go and have a look.

456
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760

00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,760
Who?

461
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
The old man.

462
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
That one.

463
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
Hello.

464
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Why are we here again?

465
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
They're doing this kind of thing.

466
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,760
They're asking for the Buddha statue.

467
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,760
What's the use?

468
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,760
There are many tourists here.

469
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
They just want to see the Buddha statue.

470
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,760

Right, Pan Jian Yuan.

474
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,760
It's a Chinese tradition.

475
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,760
He's very interested in traditional craftsmanship.

476
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
He's learned it from a master's degree.

477
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
He's not good at it.

478
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
He and Dao Chun Han,

479
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760

We understand that you didn't study the study before.

495

00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:03,960
What's wrong?

501
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,220
You got sleep restrictions for the whole football game.

I can't do anything.

517
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,360
I can't do anything.

518
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,360
You're a big man.

519
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,360
Stop it. Get out.

520
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,360
I've known you for so many years.

521
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,360
I've never thought about you.

522
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,360
But I've met a difficult one.

523
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
Can you lend me some money?

524
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,360
What's your progress?

I didn't see you.

533
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,360
I heard about your business.

534
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,360
You want to borrow money, right?

535
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,360
Yes, yes.

536
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,360

The End

542
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
I don't drink.

543
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
I said I don't drink.

544
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,360
I don't drink.

545
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,360
What do you mean?

546
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
I'm looking for a house in Beik.

547
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,360
I'm selling it.

548
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,360
Take it and get it.

549
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,360

555
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360

It looks so formal.

564
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,240
This is the icon of fire Burn in hell out of the altercute Frigate Union.

565
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,640
The Chinese culture is nowもの is debts.

566
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,120
But this is rare even seen in China.

567
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,200
I haven't seen so many things of other countries.

568
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,640
It's all abroad.

569
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,600
Well, ladies and gentlemen.

570
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,520
It's the most beautiful vase while at the Domain's où Temple.

571
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,520
There's a touching story behind this proselyte vase,

572
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:48,520
which made the Jiu-Lan Kong shi in his most beautiful artwork.

573
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,520
You can save all the women, you can save all the men.

574
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,520
Of course, let me tell you the touching story behind it.

575
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:02,520
Only the luckiest man could have this beautiful vase.

576
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,520
It was in Qing dynasty and it is right now in a modern world.

577
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,520
He's right. This is the one that was in the Kangxin era.

578
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,520
The price is very high.

579
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,520
What did he say?

580
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,520
They use this beautiful vase as the symbol of their love.

581
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,520
He's introducing the history of this museum.

582
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,520
It's the most beautiful thing that love can last forever.

583
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,520
Look, time is right.

584
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,520
But Uncle Sam does not wish this to happen.

585
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,520
He must let her go now.

586
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:42,520
Ladies and gentlemen, the price of this proselyte bottle is 10 million.

587
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,520
Ladies and gentlemen, I've got 11 million over there.

588
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,520
Ladies and gentlemen, 11 million.

589
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:55,520
Ladies and gentlemen, 11 million going once.

590
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,520
11 million, 12 million now.

591
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,520
Ladies and gentlemen, over here.

592
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,520
You've got it right. That's not a luxury.

593
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,520
I know.

594
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,520
We can't let the foreigners shoot it.

595
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,520
It's him?

596
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
I'll play with you.

597
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,520
Wait a minute.

598
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,520
Chinese, Chinese.

599
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,520
That's Chinese.

600
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
You can't shoot it if you take it away.

601
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,520
Don't move.

602
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
Don't be impulsive.

603
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
13 million.

604
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,520
Oh, 14 million now from the gentlemen.

605
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,520
14 million, ladies and gentlemen.

606
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,520
I've got a 15 million.

607
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,520
What are you doing?

608
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,520
15 million, ladies and gentlemen.

609
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,520
Now, 16 million from the first row of women in the middle.

610
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,520
Stop it!

611
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,520
Just let him go.

612
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,520
Are you going to fight with him?

613
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,520
What's your relationship with him?

614
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,520
Is 16 million the highest bid, ladies and gentlemen?

615
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,520
Anyone else?

616
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,520
6 million going once.

617
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,520
16 million.

618
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,520
Isn't that Wu Xie?

619
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,520
Why is he here?

620
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,520
Who's the one next to him?

621
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
That guy with the double fat.

622
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,520
16 million going twice.

623
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:15,520
And 17 million from the young gentlemen

624
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,520
sitting in the first row on my right.

625
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,520
17 million.

626
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,520
Think about it.

627
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,520
The society is the same.

628
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,520
You're going to fight twice.

629
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,520
And which one is more important?

630
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,520
You're going twice.

631
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,520
You're going twice.

632
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,520
Don't shoot.

633
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,520
Give it to me.

634
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,520
Don't shoot.

635
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,520
Hurry.

636
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,520
Oh, 18 million.

637
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,520
Still the young gentlemen on my right in the second row.

638
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,520
18 million, ladies and gentlemen.

639
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,520
Hello, is the police here?

640
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,520
Wonderful, ladies and gentlemen.

641
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,520
18 million now.

642
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,520
When did I become so young?

643
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,520
Ladies and gentlemen, 18 million sold.

644
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,520
This vase belongs to this young gentlemen now.

645
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,520
That's my money.

646
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,520
Please, we'll be here in 10 minutes.

647
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,520
Ladies and gentlemen, please calm down.

648
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:36,520
I just received a tip saying that the police will arrive in 10 minutes.

649
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
Did you do it?

650
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,520
I just knew.

651
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,520
Why are we here now?

652
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,520
To attack.

653
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,520
There is no need to panic.

654
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
10 minutes is enough for everyone to leave.

655
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,520
Thank you.
