1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
WE Jimin

2
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Episode 23

3
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,500
Wake up.

4
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,260
Wash your shoes and wash them clean.

5
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,060
I want better see clear.

6
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The Great Wall of the Dragon

7
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
How did such a big piece of paper come here?

8
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There are broken marks on it.

9
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It must have fallen down from above.

10
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There are only stones on it.

11
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Look, the shape of the dragon is not symmetrical.

12
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It should be a double-dead pig.

13
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
There should be another side of such a stone.

14
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Usually, such a stone is engraved on the same stone door.

15
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Both sides are different.

16
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And from this broken situation,

17
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
it should have fallen down from above

18
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
because of the snow or earthquake.

19
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It fell down from above and fell here.

20
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So we can only wait for the dawn

21
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
to see if there is a way up.

22
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
There must be another half-way stone up there.

23
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's a big piece of paper.

24
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's a half-way stone.

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What stone door?

26
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This is the seal of the underground palace.

27
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Don't move.

28
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's over.

29
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Look, the long one is coming out.

30
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is the horse chain of the seal.

31
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This side should be the one of the court.

32
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I was wrong.

33
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But why is there a way up here?

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What's wrong?

35
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You moved?

36
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Wait.

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Have you ever smelled anything?

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It smells like a dragon.

39
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Dragon?

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Is there a hot spring nearby?

41
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It seems that someone has been here.

42
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
994466, come.

43
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Come here!

44
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I found the traces of the previous archaeological team.

45
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Come here!

46
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Come here!

47
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Come here!

48
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's right here!

49
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Someone has been here in such a secluded place.

50
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
These words are too old-fashioned.

51
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But the traces are not old-fashioned.

52
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There are still some traces of life left here.

53
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
These are the words on the book of the Emperor Lu's Book.

54
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What kind of a team is this?

55
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Can you see such a thing?

56
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Today is the second day of our trip to the hollow.

57
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We can already see the blood.

58
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What's wrong?

59
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Master Sa!

60
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Master Sa, are you okay?

61
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm fine.

62
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm fine.

63
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I have a good research on the bones.

64
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's find a way out.

65
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Zhao Yuzheng is a girl.

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Look at what this big street says.

67
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What are you looking at?

68
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
No need to look at it.

69
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I know.

70
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
How do you know?

71
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This is their notebook.

72
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It should be the record of this exploration.

73
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You need to go and take a look at the stone cage you just saw.

74
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Tianzhen, look!

75
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's empty.

76
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's go.

77
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There was nothing here.

78
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why is the Emperor Lu so important now?

79
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm at the bottom of the island.

80
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The bottom of the island is the root.

81
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let me see.

82
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's a bit warm inside.

83
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But it's too hard to see.

84
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It looks like there's a word.

85
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What word?

86
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I can't see it clearly.

87
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay, okay.

88
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Stop talking.

89
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's go and take a look.

90
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Look, there's a word.

91
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
There's another word.

92
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Look.

93
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I can't see it clearly.

94
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It looks like a man.

95
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It looks like Han.

96
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Han?

97
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This is the place.

98
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This is the female text.

99
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What's written here?

100
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm not that good.

101
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I need to take a look.

102
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll take it down first.

103
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's quite hot.

104
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's at least 30 degrees Celsius.

105
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Tianzhi,

106
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
we just met a person who was on the stone floor.

107
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
He's a man of the world.

108
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The stone stones outside

109
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
should be the stone factory they built

110
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
when they built the underground palace.

111
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
This cracker

112
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
is a very popular stone.

113
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's made of stone.

114
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's made of stone.

115
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's made of stone.

116
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's made of stone.

117
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's made of stone.

118
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's made of stone.

119
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This cracker

120
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
was found when they built the stone.

121
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But I don't know why.

122
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Later,

123
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
they used the style to block it.

124
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's getting heavier.

125
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Let's go.

126
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Come on, sir.

127
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Sit here for a while.

128
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It turns out

129
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
this is the entrance to the mountain.

130
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Mountain?

131
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Changbai Mountain

132
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
is a famous mountain.

133
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The last time it was blown

134
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
was in the 18th century.

135
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's about to wake up.

136
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's about to fall.

137
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We can't decide.

138
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Don't worry.

139
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We'll be gone

140
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
before you come back.

141
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'll take care of it.

142
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll take care of it.

143
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'll take care of it.

144
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll take care of it.

145
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll take care of it.

146
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'll take care of it.

147
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Can you say something

148
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
in a hurry?

149
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's too loud.

150
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Shouldn't we go this way?

151
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's too narrow.

152
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We need to put on some makeup.

153
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Xiaoge.

154
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Sir.

155
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Look.

156
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't know

157
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
what's dangerous

158
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
in this style.

159
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Why don't you rest here?

160
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We three

161
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
go in and explore.

162
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Little devil.

163
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You're playing with me.

164
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Are you afraid

165
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I can't hang on my old head?

166
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You're right.

167
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's not easy

168
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
to go through

169
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
this age.

170
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You all go in.

171
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
See what's inside.

172
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Sir.

173
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll go with you.

174
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'll go with you.

175
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You're too narrow.

176
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll be ruined.

177
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You'll be ruined.

178
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But you'll get old.

179
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
No way.

180
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm old.

181
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Look at this.

182
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's too unique.

183
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'll go with you.

184
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You'll be ruined.

185
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You'll be ruined.

186
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But I'll stay here.

187
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's not good.

188
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's old.

189
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Look at this.

190
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's too unique.

191
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's too unique.

192
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But it's getting hotter.

193
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Don't you think?

194
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's hot.

195
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I can't breathe.

196
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Take off your clothes.

197
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You can't do it.

198
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's too much.

199
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's too much.

200
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm worried

201
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
we'll be too busy.

202
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Fatty.

203
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
We've been far away.

204
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's a pity to go back now.

205
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Why don't we go down?

206
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
If we can't find it,

207
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
we'll go back.

208
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Okay.

209
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
We'll go back now.

210
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Let's go.

211
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You're not going to go back?

213
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
No.

214
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm not going back.

215
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I can't go back.

216
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'll go back.

217
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'll go back.

218
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'll go back.

219
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'll go back.

220
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll go back.

221
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'll go back.

222
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'll go back.

223
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Where are you going?

224
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Go.

225
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Go.

226
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
This is enough.

228
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Let's make a foot.

229
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
There's still a painting here.

230
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I don't know

231
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
if the previous detective team

232
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
came here.

233
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't know if they came here

234
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
when the Xie Liefeng

235
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
had been talking about him long ago.

236
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The painting on it

237
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
is the shape of a fairy.

238
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The entrance is blocked by the dragon-doll.

239
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
There's still a painting.

240
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What is it?

241
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
There's a wind here.

242
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's a cave.

243
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I can't see where it leads.

244
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It doesn't need to be explored.

245
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Let's find a comfortable place

246
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
to sleep in.

247
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think this place is suitable.

248
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Xiao Ge, what do you think?

249
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's okay.

250
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The place is a bit higher

251
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
with a bit of a high PN2.

252
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
There's no other problem.

253
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You can ask someone to come down.

254
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Xiao Ge,

255
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
did you feel anything

256
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
wrong

257
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
when you were climbing?

258
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Is there any problem?

259
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I was missing something

260
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
so I had a hallucination.

261
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Actually,

262
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
when I was up there,

263
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
the fat dropped down

264
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
and I saw the skeleton team

265
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
leaving the information.

266
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I had a hallucination.

267
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Are you okay?

268
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm fine.

269
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Are you okay?

270
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Forget it.

271
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Maybe

272
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I was too tired

273
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
and needed a rest.

274
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Don't worry.

275
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm fine.

276
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Go and call them.

277
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Okay.

278
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You're always so busy.

279
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm fine.

280
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Why don't you

281
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
go to the hospital

282
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
when I'm out?

283
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yes.

284
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I think I should go there.

285
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I was sleeping

286
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
while I was climbing.

287
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So I had a hallucination.

288
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Go and rest.

289
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'll give you a foot bath.

290
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Go and take a bath.

291
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Come on.

292
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Go.

293
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I don't know.

294
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
How long have we been chasing them?

295
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I don't know.

296
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I just know that we are not far from their destination.

297
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Where is the flat?

298
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Did you see it?

299
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I found it.

300
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Here?

301
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I have it here.

302
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You eat it.

303
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Mr. Sa, it's hot.

304
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Have a bite.

305
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't want to eat it.

306
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Mr. He, have a bite.

307
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Have some water.

308
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Look, this cave is made by nature.

309
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And it's so deep.

310
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Why are they painting here?

311
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's strange.

312
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
In this place, there should be a special information.

313
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But here, the fairy is not a fairy.

314
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's a long story.

315
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's not meaningful.

316
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Mr. He, look.

317
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The fairy is painting well.

318
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's funny.

319
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Fatty, what are you doing?

320
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Don't be a coward.

321
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You are a bad guy.

322
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Fatty, you...

323
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Fatty, what are you doing?

324
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Although these paintings are of no value,

325
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
they are of no value to the rich.

326
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
They can't be destroyed.

327
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I don't think it's that simple.

328
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It seems there are two layers.

329
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's not the reason you are destroyed.

330
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's not the reason.

331
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
But this place

332
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
can't be just a piece of mural.

333
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The fairy is so big.

334
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What is the purpose?

335
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I don't know.

336
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Shunzi, what's wrong?

337
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
This is not the hot spring I mentioned.

338
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What do you mean?

339
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's a hot spring nearby.

340
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But it's not that small.

341
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Go out and search for something nearby.

342
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
There must be something we need to find in that hot spring.

343
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I don't know.

344
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
The two hot springs are on the top of the hot spring.

345
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
We came from Yanfeng to that hot spring.

346
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
In fact, we used to go down from the ground

347
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
to the hot spring.

348
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
The snow covered the tree.

349
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The hot spring goes down.

350
00:24:43,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Slow Time

351
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I was wrong again.

352
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
At the same place,

353
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,120
So, we reach this place again.

354
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,400
Yes!

355
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,600
This is that不會 hahaha sausage whose family

356
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,020
led a sudden van where

357
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,340
their former friends didn't pass?

358
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,820
because of his new image.

359
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,560
All this work must be turned into an iceberg

360
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,300
which will no longer exist.

361
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,420
But we have failed to come up with an idea

362
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,400
to deliver that story.

363
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,480
This origin has never been a legendary village or a modern one.

364
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
No one knows where it ends.

365
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,320
Just name it longグ imperial palace,

366
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,440
and its famous 들링新高.

367
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,360
Not only canанием,

368
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,880
but even the 1976ression

369
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,340
is obviously abandoned.

370
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,560
Tea bag!

371
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,560
It's the same as the one on the top.

372
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,560
The color is dark and it's a bit dull.

373
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
Look at this place.

374
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,560
Fatty, you're the one who's looking at it.

375
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Let's do it.

376
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,560
Fatty, you're the one who's looking at it.

377
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
I've been flying over 800 meters

378
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,560
and I know how to do it.

379
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,560
It seems that the work is not done yet.

380
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,560
What do you mean?

381
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,560
After the first half of the day,

382
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,560
the top layer will be light.

383
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,560
It's like a green flag.

384
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
The color on it will not be easily faded

385
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
and it will be faded.

386
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
This is the one before.

387
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,560
It's hot and noisy here.

388
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
It's also affected by the painting.

389
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,560
Why are you looking at me?

390
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,560
You're right.

391
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,560
Don't think that I don't know

392
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,560
that you're a hunter.

393
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
I can also look like that.

394
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,560
It will take me a long time to understand

395
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,560
how a都是 beauty cannot be described.

396
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,760
Metamorphosis means

397
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,460
careless human being,

398
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,760
not effortless animal.

399
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,560
These clouds

400
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,460
and ant precisely

401
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
Fatty, Xiaoge, you remember,

402
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,120
Miss.

403
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,000
Master,

404
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,560
They hesitated in the dumb heaven.

405
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,540
Is it concerns any good

406
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,320
That the heaven must be decorated?

407
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,960
Call for help.

408
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:47,920
Let's go.

409
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,840
This is a war between the Dragon King, theómo Pix 맞아요!

410
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,340
Hey!

411
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,960
ế

412
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,700
sin I Ambहn

413
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,180
1941

414
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,460
This must be the Grand Investigation and TrailsAL

415
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,140
I wish he could go to Import Sainhu

416
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,720
to have a look at the history

417
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,440
Look, these soldiers with the ball and armor

418
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,440
are the soldiers of the King of Wanlu.

419
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,440
These are the soldiers of Mongolians.

420
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,560
Look, the Mongolian army

421
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,120
is far more powerful than the Eastern Army.

422
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,360
This is a battle of the Asian army.

423
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,080
No.

424
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,520
Why does the Eastern and the Western countries

425
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,200
look like women's army?

426
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,400
The Eastern and the Western countries are not reasonable.

427
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,800
No.

428
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,440
This is a feature of the Eastern and the Western.

429
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,400
Look.

430
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,480
All the faces of the people

431
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,480
are very young.

432
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,360
Look.

433
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,440
I've also checked some strange information on the site.

434
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,840
It seems that all the people who fought with the Eastern and the Western countries

435
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,160
said that the Eastern and the Western countries

436
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,200
couldn't see the old people.

437
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,440
Everyone is young.

438
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,600
The people of the court also said that

439
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,440
the Eastern and the Western countries

440
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,960
even had a young face when they died.

441
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,760
These paintings

442
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,440
are divided into two parts.

443
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,080
But the whole group is together.

444
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,120
It's so beautiful.

445
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,680
This piece.

446
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,640
Look.

447
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,880
This piece is in the form of a war.

448
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,480
The Eastern and the Western countries are united.

449
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,800
It's very brave.

450
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,000
But the Mongolians are still killed by the blood of the Mongols.

451
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,840
This battle...

452
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,200
This battle

453
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,800
has become a massacre.

454
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,880
I'm talking about it, brother.

455
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,560
You are really

456
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,960
a fool to look at these paintings.

457
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,200
You've made it clear.

458
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,720
You are so innocent.

459
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,840
I'm interested in this aspect.

460
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,200
I've seen a lot of information.

461
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,760
Of course, I know a lot.

462
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,440
Then what's the Eastern and the Western countries

463
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,000
going on about?

464
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,960
Tell us.

465
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,560
The Eastern and the Western countries

466
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,640
were killed by the women.

467
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,680
In the era of the Black Dragon River in the capital,

468
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,920
there was a regime.

469
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,880
The Emperor of the Republic of China

470
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,960
was called the King of the Wan.

471
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,920
According to some historical records,

472
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,000
this country is very likely to have

473
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,160
thousands of women in the hands of women.

474
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,680
Even their words

475
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
are women's words.

476
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,640
Later, the Mongolians went around the country

477
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,040
to attack the Eastern and the Western countries.

478
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,200
So,

479
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,640
the country has been around for more than 70 years.

480
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,480
Many experts in history

481
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,160
believe that

482
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,040
this is just a group of tribes.

483
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,280
From the political point of view,

484
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,080
to the territory,

485
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,960
to the population,

486
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,040
it's not enough to be a country's rule.

487
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,320
Wait.

488
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,640
Brother Si.

489
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
You said that you wanted to find

490
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,280
the ancient of the Eastern and the Western countries.

491
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,960
But the Eastern and the Western countries

492
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,640
only existed for more than 70 years.

493
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,920
There are not many people.

494
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,640
And from the architecture and the fashion of the painting,

495
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,760
the production power is not high.

496
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,000
How did they have the strength

497
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,960
to build a palace?

498
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,320
Even if they had the strength,

499
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,240
they didn't have time.

500
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,280
Yes.

501
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,920
And the architecture of ancient people

502
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,680
is very different.

503
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,840
How much does the palace have to face?

504
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,440
I heard you just said

505
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,920
the fashion of the Eastern and the Western people.

506
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,360
Have you seen it in other paintings?

507
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,520
In those paintings,

508
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,880
the woman wearing this kind of clothing

509
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,560
was buried on the snow mountain.

510
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,760
The center is the palace of the clouds.

511
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,760
Have you ever thought

512
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,480
that the Yunding Celestial Palace

513
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,520
is going to

514
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,120
be the same as the Eastern and the Western countries?

515
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,920
I have thought about this possibility.

516
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,920
But Brother Hua just said

517
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
that the Eastern and the Western countries

518
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,800
were the origin of the Yuan Dynasty.

519
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,520
But the Yunding Celestial Palace

520
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,720
is the work of Wang Zanghai.

521
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,040
It took hundreds of years

522
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
to build this palace.

523
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,160
Actually,

524
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,840
there are some clues in the history books.

525
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,360
The Mongolians

526
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,440
didn't eliminate the Eastern and the Western people.

527
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,520
They just retreated to the mountain.

528
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,520
I've studied the high-power system.

529
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,120
Until the establishment of the Ming Dynasty,

530
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,680
the Celestial people

531
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,400
saw people wearing the Western clothes alive here.

532
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,360
I think

533
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,000
the Eastern and the Western countries

534
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,840
are the people who are still alive.

535
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,680
And...

536
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,360
there's something

537
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,720
we can prove to you.

538
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,680
Snake became a fairy tale?

539
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,680
Sounds like he has history

540
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,680
but he does not.

541
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:51,400
I didn't knowaving in people turned himself

542
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,720
into裡人杀

543
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:04,200
Are you willing to give all the information on Gui first?

544
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,760
Shorty was brought here by a transported

545
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,200
man from East Xia,

546
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,160
and I think he was trained

547
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,960
by someone from East Xia.

548
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,320
One of the peculiarities is

549
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,040
that he hid an inexhaustible concept

550
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,000
which egyed smrain

551
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,440
shadowed in his face.

552
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,980
Mr. an constructed

553
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,960
The adopter of Queen and Lady

554
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,760
Save firing

555
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:49,760
Com

556
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,560
You see

557
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,320
The secret is here

558
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Good.

559
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,600
This fish's scales

560
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,000
hide 47 female needles.

561
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
How was it?

562
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
Isn't it amazing?

563
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,600
The ancient people have such memories and ideas.

564
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,200
When I first saw it,

565
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
the scales almost fell off.

566
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Mr. Wan.

567
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,600
What's written on it?

568
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,400
The data isn't complete.

569
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,000
I haven't figured it out yet.

570
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,800
But I'm sure

571
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,200
the fish wants to record the secret of the Eastern Xia.

572
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,000
The spiritual records on it

573
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,600
said that the Eastern Xia was retreating

574
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,600
to the border of the North and North.

575
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It has been hiding for a long time.

576
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
If we can find all the data,

577
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,800
we can reveal the truth of this story.

578
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,000
I knew it a while ago.

579
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,600
There was a snake in the hand of Xie Yu Hua.

580
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,800
I had already taken it,

581
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,200
but I gave it to your uncle.

582
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,600
You're so generous.

583
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,400
You gave him such important things.

584
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,600
He promised me to exchange the two clues.

585
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,400
And he promised me

586
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
to give me the data of the broken fish.

587
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I wouldn't be ashamed of it.

588
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
But it was not yet over.

589
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
Xia Gui Tou.

590
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Your uncle asked you to look for the fish.

591
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,000
I think he has already broken the information on the broken fish.

592
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
My lord.

593
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,000
Actually, I'm here to find the fish.

594
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,200
Actually, I don't know why I lost my memory

595
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,600
and couldn't contact my uncle.

596
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,400
Now I can only rely on myself.

597
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,800
Besides, if you didn't tell me today,

598
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,600
I wouldn't even know anything about the Eastern Xia and the Western Sky Palace.

599
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,200
I wouldn't mention anything else.

600
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,600
You're so stupid.

601
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,200
You always talk about the secret.

602
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,000
Now it's useless.

603
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
You even broke your own nail.

604
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,400
Who said it's not true?

605
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,200
My lord, I'm not lying to you.

606
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,000
I didn't break my uncle's nail twice.

607
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,600
Or he would have been my uncle.

608
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
All right.

609
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,000
Let's do it.

610
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,800
If it's true,

611
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,400
we might be able to find the treasure of the Eastern Xia

612
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,200
and the Western Sky Palace, right?

613
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,200
Come on, find it.

614
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,000
Hurry up.

615
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
Hurry up.

616
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
My lord.

617
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,400
You said it's behind the wall, right?

618
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
How about standing?

619
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,000
So dila is your mastermind.

620
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,400
This is great.

621
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Forget it.

622
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,900
Will you give me some advice?

623
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,100
I beg you.

624
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,200
Make up your mind now.

625
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,000
Then come again, we'll talk.

626
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,200
I'll fix it.

627
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,200
All right.

628
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,600
If your master doesn't have some interfacing,

629
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,800
he wouldn't operate it.

630
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,600
Since it's a suit,

631
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,400
this is enough.

632
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,800
You've got no F it here.

633
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,900
Fine.

634
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,400
Can we go to the Palace?

635
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
What?

636
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,800
This is a natural ice layer structure.

637
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,520
And there will be thick snow outside.

638
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,440
There is no crack or any passage in this hole.

639
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
And just now,

640
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,120
I put my hand in and felt the air flow in the layer.

641
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,880
There won't be any passage in this hole.

642
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,480
That's good, Wu Xie.

643
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,880
How did you know these knowledge?

644
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,600
My university is a architecture department.

645
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,680
Not good.

646
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,840
Boss.

647
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,160
Is it not a good thing for us to look?

648
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,200
If so, how could we go back?

649
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,080
You want to know

650
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,760
what is on this Twine ranged?

651
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,400
The last sentence of the female poem of the same fish is very interesting.

652
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,400
What is the last sentence?

653
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,400
It says, the king of the Wannu is not a human.

654
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
That's funny.

655
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
The king of the Wannu is a enemy.

656
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,400
If you don't go to Mala, you'll be in trouble.

657
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,400
You'll be scolded for not being a human.

658
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,400
Kang Zi, you're a good man.

659
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Kang Zi, you're really a good man.

660
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
That's not a bad man.

661
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,400
You can really say that.

662
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:07,400
It says, the king of the Wannu is a monster that crawls out of the ground.

663
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,400
Could it be that you treat the emperor as a dragon,

664
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,400
but not a mortal, and you're going to compare him with that?

665
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
We thought so too.

666
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,400
But then we found out that he just wanted to write some secrets.

667
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,400
But the body of the same fish is limited.

668
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,400
So it's very objective to use the word.

669
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,400
There's no comparison to the rest.

670
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,400
And if you're right,

671
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,400
would anyone express the idea of the emperor as a dragon,

672
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
and express it with this word?

673
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,400
It's not clear.

674
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,400
It's just that the data is not the right one.

675
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,400
If we can get the other part,

676
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,400
we'll understand the meaning of this word.

677
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,400
I'm so stupid.

678
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,400
I can't even make it through.

679
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,400
Let's not talk about the whole thing.

680
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,400
It's a strange thing to be a monster when you're a monster.

681
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,400
We'll be in trouble.

682
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,400
I mean, the comparison is better.

683
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,400
Right, Pao?

684
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,400
You're right.

685
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,400
By the way,

686
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
have you ever thought about

687
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,400
why that person drew the mural here,

688
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,400
and added a layer of it as an example?

689
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,400
I think so.

690
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
I mean,

691
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,400
it's possible that after they finished drawing,

692
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,400
they took this piece down and put it in the map.

693
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,400
It's possible that it's very warm,

694
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
and it's also a place where the craftsman can rest.

695
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
And then, it's all right.

696
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,400
It's time to paint.

697
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,400
I think so.

698
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,400
Unless you find the person who drew the mural,

699
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,400
or else, he'll never know.

700
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,400
It's just like the language exam.

701
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,400
What's the meaning of writing this part?

702
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
You can't just call the author.

703
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
It's not like you can fill it up.

704
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,400
It's the same.

705
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,400
Fatty, I found out that sometimes,

706
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
you really need someone so big to be by your side,

707
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
so that you can keep your hands on the wall.

708
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,400
You need to be by your side.

709
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
If you're not around,

710
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
about the knowledge,

711
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,400
we don't know what the point is.

712
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
It's all up to you.

713
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
You're just a normal person.

714
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
Fatty,

715
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
why do you sound so stupid?

716
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,400
Yes, yes, yes.

717
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,400
I think everyone's tired.

718
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Go back and rest.

719
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,400
Let's go.

720
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
Wait.

721
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,400
What's wrong?

722
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400
I need to go out.

723
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,400
It's snow.

724
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,400
Mr. Snow, go!

725
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,400
Let's go!

726
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
Run, Run!

727
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,400
Mr. Snow!

728
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,400
Come on!

729
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Run, run!

730
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,400
Come on!

731
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,400
Hurry up!

732
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,240
Let's go.

733
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,240
호진quele!

734
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,680
Together with Xie Presenter and Eromachan,

735
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,800
Wuxie 36, Dr. UHO,

736
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,120
and Dr. INDA,

737
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,080
are the pair of 2022 sill blurry.

738
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,960
The first match going on,

739
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,740
has chased round,

740
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,140
after the arrival of Shimei,

741
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,200
Wuxie 16 finally quelts out,

742
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,240
and Wuxie who was Cross-owi

743
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,120
ВоAy thanks for all the pressure.
