Why did you make me do this?

190
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
You even let me find a coffin.

191
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
You're afraid I'm dead.

192
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
You can't keep me in the house.

193
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,040
You even let me know about the consequences.

194
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Last night,

195
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,040
when I was looking for you,

196
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
a monster wanted to kill me.

197
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,040
Our equipment is gone now.

198
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,040
So it's the person who attacked us

199
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
and stole your notebook.

200
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,040
He was looking for the information.

201
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,040
It's possible.

202
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
But he was too despicable.

203
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,040
He didn't dare to confront me.

204
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,040
He sent a monster to kill me.

205
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Monster?

206
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Monster.

207
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,040
I remember now.

208
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
There's a man in our family.

209
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
His name is Kui Lei Shi.

210
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,040
He's a master of poetry.

211
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
He used very regular methods to manipulate the body.

212
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
After he was dead,

213
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,040
he made a bunch of Kui Lei.

214
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,040
He said he did the most delicate thing

215
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
that could steal your stuff

216
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,040
without your investigation.

217
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,040
These Kui Lei said they were trying to manipulate the body.

218
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,040
Someone said they were trying to manipulate the mouth

219
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
or the machine.

220
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Anyway, there are different methods.

221
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
You're right.

222
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,040
There's a chance that they could do it.

223
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
And this kind of Kui Lei Shi

224
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,040
has something to do with that foreign cultural relics.

225
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,040
In addition to Mr. Qiu De Kou,

226
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
who else?

227
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
The soul is gone.

228
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,040
I have only one question.

229
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Is this coffin

230
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
a special economic powder

231
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,040
for me?

232
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
What about the body?

233
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,040
Is it an empty coffin?

234
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
Is it an empty coffin?

235
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,040
It feels so clean.

236
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Yes.

237
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
It's so clean.

238
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
This is your bag.

239
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Let's open it.

240
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
It's so clean.

241
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,040
The flashlight is so bright.

242
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,040
The folding knife is so big.

243
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
Tian Zhen,

244
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,040
you're just using these equipment

245
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
to get into the final round.

246
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,040
You're so smart.

247
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
Fatty,

248
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
don't make fun of this person.

249
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
Tian Zhen,

250
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,040
we've been looking for this coffin for so long.

251
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,040
Now it's so easy to get in.

252
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,040
I'm not in the mood for it.

253
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
It's good that you're not.

254
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Someone has come in

255
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
before us.

256
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
It's better to be prepared for this day.

257
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,040
It's like a chicken.

258
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
Someone came to the front

259
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
when we were running.

260
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
They came in and got in the final round.

261
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
Let's pray.

262
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
Get up.

263
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
I hope you can get to the front.

264
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
It's your uncle.

265
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
At least,

266
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,040
your uncle can't hurt

267
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
his own life.

268
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Use this,

269
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
big brother.

270
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
No one is allowed to enter.

271
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,040
Someone should have entered this coffin.

272
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
But it's closed now.

273
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
If you want to enter,

274
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,040
be prepared for this.

275
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
Let's go.

276
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
I'm sorry.

277
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
I'm sorry.

278
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
I'm sorry.

279
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,040
I'm sorry.

280
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
I'm sorry.

281
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,040
I'm sorry.

282
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
I'm sorry.

283
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
I'm sorry.

284
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
I'm sorry.

285
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
I'm sorry.

286
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
I'm sorry.

287
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
I'm sorry.

288
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
I'm sorry.

289
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
I'm sorry.

290
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
I'm sorry.

291
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
I'm sorry.

292
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
I'm sorry.

293
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
I'm sorry.

294
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040
I'm sorry.

295
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
I'm sorry.

296
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
I'm sorry.

297
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
I'm sorry.

298
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
I'm sorry.

299
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
I'm sorry.

300
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
I'm sorry.

301
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
I'm sorry.

302
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
I'm sorry.

303
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
I'm sorry.

304
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
I'm sorry.

305
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
I'm sorry.

306
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
I'm sorry.

307
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
I'm sorry.

308
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,600
Don't fight with us.

309
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,080
I don't need to fight with you.

310
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,480
Come on.

311
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,440
OK.

312
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,360
Jay.

313
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
They're all dead.

314
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,720
Who are they?

315
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,480
They attacked us from the area near the lost village.

316
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,040
It seems some people don't want us to follow the Wu Xie project.

317
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Are they...

318
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,480
friends of Wu Xie?

319
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,760
His friends can't be so helpless.

320
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,520
I'm familiar with this method.

321
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,440
Follow me.

322
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,220
Don't let them harm you.

323
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,840
I don't want to.

324
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,360
We don't wear uniform.

325
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
a tiger is a Kolk TV.

326
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,400
Well,

327
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,320
we were touched.

328
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,600
I live at Peng...

329
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,320
and I'm also...

330
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,500
Would we rush all the way here to西哪爾遍當場 sk World?

331
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,940
He says I'd back into my front career.

332
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,140
Heesh, how could they take the lead?

333
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,300
These guys should be out there,

334
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:55,500
if they didn't œ

335
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,840
Man, that's all

336
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,240
Cl 빠k.

337
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
I just wasted a arm.

338
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
I don't know what kind of way these people are.

339
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,240
Yesterday, the one who stole the fat guy

340
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,240
should be the one who kept the money.

341
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Let them bite.

342
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,240
The more crazy, the better.

343
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
How about we

344
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
make two rounds of bulletproof clothing first?

345
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Did you hear the gunshot just now?

346
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,240
It's a light shot.

347
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,240
Not a gunshot.

348
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
Maybe they saw something.

349
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
It's possible that they hit people.

350
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
Didn't you move?

351
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
Let's go in and see.

352
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,240
No.

353
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
What if they didn't leave and wait for us inside?

354
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
What are you afraid of?

355
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Let's all come here.

356
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
What are you afraid of?

357
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Isn't it too late to do it?

358
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
Only people are the most afraid.

359
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
What do you think?

360
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
Let's go back.

361
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,240
I don't know the way back.

362
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
I know.

363
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
This part is straight.

364
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
The one in front of us is left.

365
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
That's the main road.

366
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,240
I fell from the top of the tunnel.

367
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Look at my face.

368
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Get out.

369
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Be careful.

370
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
¡Mount Maryailing!

371
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
¡Characteristic Stronghold!

372
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
¡Current ten!

373
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
¡M cherished and honoured-time!

374
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
¡Current twenty of you!

375
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
¡ thrust bloody wear!

376
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,440
I'm sorry.

377
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
There are many good things here.

378
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,240
There are also satellite phones.

379
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,640
There is no gun.

380
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Fatty, they are obviously not people.

381
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,240
And they are all dead.

382
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,240
I just said that.

383
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,840
People fight.

384
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,240
Two fire-seekers fight.

385
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
What?

386
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
What?

387
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
You didn't shoot?

388
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,240
It's okay.

389
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,640
Later, I will be your anti-aircraft gun.

390
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,040
You will see who is behind me.

391
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,240
Besides, you are a little guy.

392
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,240
Didn't you hear about it?

393
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,240
How many people are in this room?

394
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,240
No matter how many people come in,

395
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,240
they are dead.

396
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,240
I mean, this room is in the middle.

397
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,240
If there is no accident,

398
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,840
then this is the main room.

399
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
They are all inside.

400
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,240
We are always together.

401
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,240
Let them fight and get sick.

402
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,840
When we are in the middle,

403
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,240
we are on the same team.

404
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,240
You know? Let's go.

405
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,240
What are you doing?

406
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,240
Where is he?

407
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,640
I don't know.

408
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
Where is he?

409
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
Yaha?

410
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
Fatty, look.

411
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
There is another body upstairs.

412
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,240
There is another body upstairs.

413
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
It should be the time to take a break and be killed.

414
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,240
You can't take a break and get a hit.

415
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,240
You deserve it.

416
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
It's empty.

417
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
Look.

418
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
There is a big guy now.

419
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
It's okay.

420
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,240
Just be careful.

421
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,240
If he doesn't run after us,

422
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,240
it's okay.

423
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
The people who attacked them just now

424
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
must be alive.

425
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,240
Since they are not in this room,

426
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,240
then there must be a secret room inside.

427
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,240
There is a secret room.

428
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,240
There must be a secret room hidden in the treasure.

429
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,240
Fatty, we are in a mess.

430
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
We came here

431
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
because of the unsecured map.

432
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
It means that this place

433
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
was not unsecured before.

434
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,240
But there is no unsecured trace left here.

435
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
Maybe on the way,

436
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
the soldiers were killed.

437
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
Yaha didn't come in.

438
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
You are so naive.

439
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
I will kill you.

440
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
I will kill you.

441
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,240
I will kill you.

442
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
I will kill you.

443
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,240
I will kill you.

444
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,240
I will kill you.

445
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,240
I will kill you.

446
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,240
I will kill you.

447
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,240
I will kill you.

448
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
I will kill you.

449
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,240
I will kill you.

450
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
I will kill you.

451
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,240
I will kill you.

452
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,240
I will kill you.

453
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,240
I will kill you.

454
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
I will kill you.

455
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,240
Fatty.

456
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,240
What's wrong?

457
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
When they are fighting,

458
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240
how can they have time

459
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,240
to light the lanterns?

460
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
The position of the lanterns

461
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,240
and the location of the mirror

462
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,240
are the same.

463
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,240
I will kill you.

464
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,240
I will kill you.

465
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,240
I will kill you.

466
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,240
I will kill you.

467
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,240
I will kill you.

468
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,240
I will kill you.

469
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
The location of the mirror

470
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,240
must be a miracle.

471
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,240
Fatty.

472
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
Look.

473
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,240
There is a secret.

474
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
I will kill you.

475
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
Little flower.

476
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
I will kill you.

477
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,240
I will kill you.

478
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
I will kill you.

479
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
I will kill you.

480
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
I will kill you.

481
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,240
I will kill you.

482
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
I will kill you.

483
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
I will kill you.

484
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
I will kill you.

485
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
I will kill you.

486
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,240
I will kill you.

487
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,240
I will kill you.

488
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
I will kill you.

489
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,240
I will kill you.

490
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,240
I will kill you.

491
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,240
I will kill you.

492
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,240
I will kill you.

493
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,240
I will kill you.

494
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,240
I will kill you.

495
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,240
I will kill you.

496
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
I will kill you.

497
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,240
I will kill you.

498
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,240
I will kill you.

499
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,240
I will kill you.

500
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,240
I will kill you.

501
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
I will kill you.

502
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,240
I will kill you.

503
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
I will kill you.

504
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,240
I will kill you.

505
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
I will kill you.

506
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
I will kill you.

507
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,240
I will kill you.

508
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,240
I will kill you.

509
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,240
I will kill you.

510
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,240
I will kill you.

511
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,240
I will kill you.

512
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,240
I will kill you.

513
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,240
I will kill you.

514
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,240
I will kill you.

515
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,240
I will kill you.

516
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
I will kill you.

517
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,240
I will kill you.

518
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
I will kill you.

519
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
I will kill you.

520
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,240
I found you.

521
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,240
Watch out.

522
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,240
Watch out.

523
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,240
Don't use the bomb.

524
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,240
Dao Ge, let Samu solve An Ning's case.

525
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,240
Come back soon.

526
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,240
Samu.

527
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,240
Samu.

528
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,240
Samu, Samu, I heard the answer.

529
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,240
No response.

530
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,240
Boss, we are going to clear the enemy.

531
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,240
No matter if it's Ji Ye Hua or An Ning,

532
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,240
we will use the gun that we have.

533
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,240
This grandson wants to blow up Mu and return to the base.

534
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
We want to come back.

535
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
We have to use the bomb.

536
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,240
I am tired.

537
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
What about you?

538
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
Yifan.

539
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,240
No.

540
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
No.

541
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,240
Give me the gun.

542
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
How many people are there?

543
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,240
Three more.

544
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,240
The most dangerous one in the village.

545
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,240
We have to kill him.

546
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,240
That guy is too cunning.

547
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
He is hiding behind the cabinet.

548
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,240
He is still on the cabinet.

549
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,240
Liu Er, you are so brave.

550
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,240
Go.

551
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,240
My foot is on fire.

552
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,240
It's so fast.

553
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Who is that?

554
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,240
It's Kuei Lei.

555
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,240
He is here to explore the area.

556
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,240
This is the first time I have seen a technical house in the school.

557
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,240
This is a good toy.

558
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,240
I have never played with a toy car.

559
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,240
You said this is a toy.

560
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,240
Did he see us?

561
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,240
I am not sure.

562
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,240
He is so wasteful.

563
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,240
What are you doing?

564
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Protect me.

565
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240
Fatty.

566
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,240
Fatty.

567
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,240
Who are you?

568
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Little flower.

569
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Go.

570
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
He has a bomb.

571
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
Fatty, go.

572
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
Why?

573
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,240
He is not doing it.

574
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
I think he is going to kill me.

575
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,240
I am not going to kill him.

576
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
I am going to kill him.

577
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,240
I will kill him.

578
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,240
I am going to kill him.

579
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,240
Get out of the way.

580
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
I am going to kill him.

581
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,240
I am going to kill him.

582
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,240
You are so brave.

583
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,240
Go.

584
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,240
Go.

585
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
I will kill him.

586
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,240
I will kill you.

587
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
Go.

588
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,240
What are you doing?

589
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240
You are done.

590
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,240
Shut up.

591
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,240
Who is he?

592
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,240
I am not sure.

593
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,240
He is so brave.

594
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,240
He is so brave.

595
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,240
We were on the road.

596
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
He used the gas station to blow up a fire.

597
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,240
He killed several of my brothers.

598
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,240
The tear you saw just now

599
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,240
is their bomb.

600
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,240
It is very powerful.

601
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,240
As you said.

602
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,240
The bomb.

603
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,240
Yes.

604
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,240
So we need to avoid the front-line contact.

605
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,240
The bomb just now

606
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,240
has made the situation more difficult.

607
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,240
If Kui Lei makes a mistake again

608
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,240
even if we win,

609
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,240
we will not escape.

610
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,240
Is there any exit?

611
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,240
Mr. Huai.

612
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,240
Did you throw the fat man in the coffin?

613
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,240
So brave.

614
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,240
It is a lot of food.

615
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240
Wait.

616
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,240
Did you see

617
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,240
a coffin just now?

618
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,240
It is strange.

619
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,240
I didn't see it.

620
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,240
You also drank it.

621
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,240
No.

622
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,240
Look.

623
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,240
These coffins are all wood.

624
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,240
And they are not damaged.

625
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,240
When I came in just now

626
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,240
I saw a coffin.

627
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,240
It is not only damaged.

628
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,240
What is the clue?

629
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,240
Come with me.

630
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Wait.

631
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
There is a British man in here.

632
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,240
No way.

633
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,240
This coffin is from the ancient Han dynasty.

634
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,240
Why is it buried

635
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,240
in the modern world?

636
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,240
Fatty.

637
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,240
It was shot to death.

638
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,240
It is not only buried

639
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,240
by people who died in 2000s.

640
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,240
It is also used

641
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,240
to cross the era of the hot weapons.

642
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,240
It is also used

643
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
to cross the era of the hot weapons.

644
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,240
It is also used

645
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,240
to cross the era of the hot weapons.

646
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
Are these coffins

647
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,240
all from the Republic of China?

648
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,240
Maybe there is another possibility.

649
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,240
They are villagers from the Republic of China.

650
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,240
There is such a possibility.

651
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,240
If the villagers are really killed

652
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,240
and they are killed by the killer.

653
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,240
Why did they kill them first?

654
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,240
They put the coffin in the coffin.

655
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,240
Isn't it a lot of this?

656
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,240
There is another possibility.

657
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,240
They are not even a part of the family.

658
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,240
Where is it?

659
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,240
There.

660
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,240
This is it.

661
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
Open it.

662
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,240
Open it.

663
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,240
It must be you.

664
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,240
Fatty.

665
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,240
Wuxi.

666
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,240
I will go down first.

667
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,240
I will go down first.

668
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Come in.

669
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
Listen.

670
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,240
This is called Jin Sang.

671
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,240
Zhou Xuan.

672
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,240
It really changed the whole of China.

673
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,240
This is the emperor of the Gotan.

674
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
Grandma.

675
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,240
Uncle Si has announced the case.

676
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,240
You don't have to tell me the result.

677
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,240
From this year on,

678
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,240
it will be gone.

679
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,240
Uncle Si asked Uncle Zhang to get the whole family under water.

680
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,240
But he didn't say anything this time.

681
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,240
He confessed to the crime.

682
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,240
You think he is suspicious?

683
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,240
I asked someone to talk to him.

684
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,240
You can do whatever you want.

685
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,240
If you do something, you will kill him.

686
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,240
He is a man.

687
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,240
Aumei, Shimpujing, Yulecheng, 994466.

688
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Com.

689
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,240
The most exciting game on the line.

690
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,240
Ma Jiang Hu.

691
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
Ma Jiang Hu 2.

692
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,240
The Queen of the Gotan.

693
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,240
Huang Jincheng.

694
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,240
Zhou Caimeng.

695
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,240
The Super High Poverty.

696
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,240
The Best of the Best.

697
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,240
The Best of the Best.

698
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,240
The Best of the Best.

699
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,240
The Best of the Best.

700
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,240
Come.

701
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,240
Grandma.

702
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,240
I found out the case of aunt.

703
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
That case is a secret.

704
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,240
I found it.

705
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,240
But I found out that the records were changed.

706
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,240
Grandma, is it you?

707
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,240
What if it's me?

708
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,240
Grandma, you used to see those cases.

709
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,240
Why did you change them?

710
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,240
Grandma, I think you...

711
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,240
You don't want to know the truth.

712
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,240
Grandma.

713
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,240
The Queen of the Gotan.

714
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,240
The Best of the Best.

715
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,240

00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,240
The Best of the Best.

718
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,240
The Best of the Best.

719
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,240
The Best of the Best.

720
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
The Best of the Best.

721
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,240
The Best of the Best.

722
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,240
The Best of the Best.

723
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,240
The Best of the Best.

724
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,240

725
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,240

Fatty.

729
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,240
It seems that someone has come before us.

730
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,240
Except us.

731
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,240
The Queen of the Gotan.

732
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,240

733
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,240

748
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,240
The Best of the Best.

749
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,240
The Best of the Best.

750
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,240

They're really smart.

762
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,440
My uncle has a map here.

763
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,320
The unreal theres a picture of everyone

764
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,320
It's in the Mود aspiration.

765
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,880
It's not taken care of.

766
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
No.

767
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,080
Mind you, it's great.

768
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,240
Who is he?

769
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,520
I don't know.

770
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,080
I just know that

771
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,080
he was chased by a new mayor.

772
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,440
I don't know who he is.

773
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,080
A mayor who doesn't fight.

774
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,920
Why did he make a tomb?

775
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,480
He took this place as a underground library.

776
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,680
My friend,

777
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,560

reflected for the young soldiers in the 4003 Armstrong.

782
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,160
Your brother doesn't want

783
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,160
to kill us.

784
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,160
These two places are important to the family.

785
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
How is the letter?

786
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,160
It's called the best building, right?

787
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Yes, yes, yes.

788
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,160
They have a great family.

789
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,160
Really.

790
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,160
We'll call the old king.

791
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,160
We'll have a good day.

792
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,160
We'll have a good day.

793
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,160
If we don't say it,

794
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,160
we'll have so many things to do.

795
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,160
We should be able to go.

796
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,160
What are you doing?

797
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,160
I'm here to give the order to the mayor.

798
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,160
Zhang Buxun, Mayor Zhang.

799
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,160
Yes.

00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,160
You're lucky.

801
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,160
Mayor Zhang is very good to his brother.

802
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,160
It's a good day.

803
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,160
We don't have time to look carefully.

804
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,160
Let's go find the fat man.

805
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,160
Let's go.

806
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,160
It looks like a military dormitory.

807
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,160
But why did you make the story

808
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
like a dormitory?

809
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,160
Let's go to the dormitory.

810
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,160

The mirror is here.

814
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,160
There should be only one way out of this place.

815
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,160
So the people who are trying to steal our clothes must be around.

816
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,160
Be careful.
