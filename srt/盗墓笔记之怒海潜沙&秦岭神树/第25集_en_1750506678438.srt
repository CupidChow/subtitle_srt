1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The End

2
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Wu Xie, are you all right?

3
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's really you.

4
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why?

5
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why?

6
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Why?

7
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Impossible.

8
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Why?

9
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why is it useless?

10
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Why is it like this?

11
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's not.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Ya.

13
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's useless.

14
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Ya.

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why is it useless?

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What exactly happened?

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What happened?

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What happened?

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's useless.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Ya.

21
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Wu Xie, help me.

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Help me.

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hurry up.

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What do you want?

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
My mom.

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Help me.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
My mom.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Help me.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What does it have to do with your mom?

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Help me.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
My mom will die in this world.

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hurry up.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Help me.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Ya.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's impossible.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Impossible.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Impossible.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why doesn't Wu Xie help me?

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why?

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What do you want?

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What do you want?

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Wu Xie, help me.

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What do you want?

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Ya.

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Don't be sad.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm here.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I promised you to take you home.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And I'll help you.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But the thing is...

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You have to tell me everything you know.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Including your mom.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
If you want.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Wu Xie.

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
My mom has been dead for three years.

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
For three years,

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I've been missing her for no reason.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I think I've seen her.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I miss Wu Xie.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I really miss her.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Mom.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Mom, I'm back.

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Mom.

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
There's another dish.

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's about to start.

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Mom.

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What are you cooking?

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's all your favorite food.

70
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Go wash your hands.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's about to start.

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Hurry up.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm not washing my hands.

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You're not washing your hands?

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're a stinky brat.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You're so stubborn.

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Go wash your hands.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Mom, it's still that smell.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What smell?

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's mom's smell.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Mom's cooking.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But you can't cook grandma's smell.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Go wash your hands.

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Go wash your hands.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Mom.

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Mom!

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Mom!

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Mom!

90
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Mom!

91
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Mom!

92
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Mom!

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Mom!

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Mom!

95
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Mom!

96
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Mom!

97
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Mom!

98
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
There's another dish.

99
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's about to start.

100
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You're a stinky brat.

101
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You're so stubborn.

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Go wash your hands.

103
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Mom can't cook grandma's smell.

104
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Go wash your hands.

105
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
There's another dish.

106
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's about to start.

107
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You're a stinky brat.

108
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You're so stubborn.

109
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Go wash your hands.

110
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What smell?

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Mom can't cook grandma's smell.

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Go wash your hands.

113
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You're a stinky brat.

114
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You're so stubborn.

115
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Go wash your hands.

116
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I got it.

117
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Mom!

118
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Mom!

119
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's me!

120
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm Yara!

121
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Mom!

122
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Mom!

123
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Wu!

124
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I haven't seen you in a long time.

125
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What are you doing?

126
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Come and sit at home.

127
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Come.

128
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Mom!

129
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Why is your hair so long?

130
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Go and wash it.

131
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Mom!

132
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's been a long time.

133
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I've seen you.

134
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Look at you.

135
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You must have had a bad food.

136
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You're thin.

137
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Your face is black and thin.

138
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Mom!

139
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Mom!

140
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yara!

141
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Mom!

142
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Mom!

143
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Mom!

144
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Mom!

145
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Mom!

146
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Wu!

147
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
My mom is gone.

148
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
My mom is gone.

149
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Think about me!

150
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yara, wake up.

151
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You've seen all the bad things.

152
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
All the bad things.

153
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
All the bad things.

154
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Impossible!

155
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I saw my mom just now.

156
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
She was here.

157
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You saw her too.

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
She was right in front of me.

159
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Think about me.

160
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Think about me, Wu.

161
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Stop being crazy.

162
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Why didn't you tell me

163
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
that you had such a wish?

164
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Do you know how many people

165
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
can live without a care?

166
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Do you know that you killed them?

167
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
How could you be so selfish?

168
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't care.

169
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm willing to pay for my mom's life

170
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
for my mom's life.

171
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But if I pay for everything,

172
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
can I sacrifice other people's life?

173
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Mom!

174
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I beg you!

175
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'll help you, Wu Xian.

176
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Lao Yang, listen to me.

177
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Your mother is dead.

178
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's impossible for you to recover.

179
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Lao Yang, are you going to be forever in this tree?

180
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We can only accept and face it.

181
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The only thing we can do is leave here.

182
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Otherwise, you'll die here with me.

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Go!

184
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't care!

185
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
If I finally get here,

186
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'll die here!

187
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Go!

188
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Lao Yang!

189
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Lao Yang!

190
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Lao Yang!

191
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Go!

192
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Hurry!

193
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Why do we have to suffer?

194
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Didn't we agree to accept our fate?

195
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Why do we have to say this is our fault?

196
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm so tired.

197
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm so tired.

198
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I can't walk anymore.

199
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm so tired, little girl.

200
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Give it to me.

201
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Okay.

202
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Thank you, little girl.

203
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Why do we have to suffer this?

204
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Who is this tomb?

205
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Isn't it the tomb of the club?

206
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Why is there someone who doesn't remember?

207
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm confused now.

208
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Who is this tomb?

209
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
This coffin

210
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
shouldn't be opened for the first time.

211
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Then these people who don't remember

212
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
can't be replaced.

213
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Move the body of the club leader

214
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
out of the coffin.

215
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And put it inside your own coffin.

216
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But why?

217
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The body of the club is so good.

218
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
There is still a fish-tongue.

219
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Could it be that it's the coffin

220
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
that can keep the body well

221
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and grab the coffin?

222
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's very thick.

223
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's very thick.

224
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Do you know that

225
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
since we opened the coffin,

226
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
the PM2.5 has been out of stock.

227
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's alive.

228
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's alive.

229
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Little brother,

230
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
the sword can block your black bone.

231
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Be careful.

232
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Don't break it before you cut it.

233
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Keep it.

234
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Hurry.

235
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Hurry.

236
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Go.

237
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Langyang, stop.

238
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Go.

239
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Little brother,

240
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
come here.

241
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Come here.

242
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'll break it.

243
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Go.

244
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You're so soft to him.

245
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You want to break it, right?

246
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What's the matter with Wang Yue?

247
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Why are you still talking?

248
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm sorry.

250
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Why are you sorry?

260
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Where is the body of the head of the group?

264
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's burned.

265
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Who's the emperor now?

266
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't know.

267
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I've known you for a thousand years.

268
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Ertugov!

269
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Ertugov!

270
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Ertugov!

271
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Where are you?

272
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Be quick.

273
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Be quick.

274
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Wuxian, over here.

275
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,960
Come on, get away.

276
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,700
toRREEE

277
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,980
不 equestrian

278
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,500
T or로

279
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,760
2020

280
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:12,860
S

281
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,540
What is happening J

282
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,540
So small

283
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,660
don't believe

284
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's so big inside.

285
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Should I have a snake?

286
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Here.

287
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You stand here. I'll go inside and see.

288
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
No. What about you?

289
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'll go inside.

290
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I need this.

291
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Be careful.

292
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Be careful.

293
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
This is so interesting.

294
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
This is so interesting.

295
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Why are you shaking?

296
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You're shaking your head.

297
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Hurry up.

298
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Hurry up.

299
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Hurry up.

300
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Hurry up.

301
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Hurry up.

302
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Hurry up.

303
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,400
I've been waiting for you.

304
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
Only one?

305
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
Two.

306
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
One.

307
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,400
I can feel it.

308
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
I'm the North American.

309
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,400
I'm the Emperor's brother.

310
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,600
I'm the Tuoba.

311
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,800
I'm the insidious Buyan Ji.

312
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Oh, right.

313
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,800
He's a good guy.

314
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,200
You know Buyan Ji?

315
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,000
The five of us know what's not important.

316
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,200
And we know what's important.

317
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So,

318
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
you and I

319
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,200
are one family.

320
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,200
I'm too heavy.

321
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,600
I can't let the King down.

322
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,600
The King of Xinshan

323
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,600
wants to see the rise of the Heavenly Emperor.

324
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,400
He wants to kill me.

325
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,000
The General has advised us

326
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,600
to stay displaced.

327
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,600
We can't take our lives off.

328
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,600
It's pain without wiser.

329
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,600
It takes your povoy so much.

330
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I should have known it.

331
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
A thousand years.

332
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
A thousand years.

333
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
But it's still so.

334
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Then why do you still have a body?

335
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
He's dead.

336
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
A thousand years.

337
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
A thousand years.

338
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
A thousand years.

339
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
A thousand years.

340
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
A thousand years.

341
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
A thousand years.

342
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It's so good to have a body.

343
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm dying to fight you.

344
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's good.

345
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
God, you should go out and let those bad experts to research you.

346
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Calm down.

347
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
His life should have ended a thousand years ago.

348
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
My eyes.

349
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Don't say that.

350
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You should have heard Tian Zhen crying.

351
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You should have cried a lot.

352
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The clock?

353
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah.

354
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,280
To be continued…

355
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,780
You can rest.

356
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm not going to be a good girl.

357
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm going to be a good girl.

358
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm going to be a good girl.

359
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm going to be a good girl.

360
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I'm going to be a good girl.

361
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I'm going to be a good girl.

362
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I'm going to be a good girl.

363
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm going to be a good girl.

364
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm going to be a good girl.

365
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I'm going to be a good girl.

366
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I'm going to be a good girl.

367
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm going to be a good girl.

368
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm going to be a good girl.

369
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm going to be a good girl.

370
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I'm going to be a good girl.

371
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Wuxian! Wuxian, are you all right, Wuxian?

372
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,240
He's guessed it all.

373
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,240
OMAR SOULY

374
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,140
Ergantino!

375
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:29,780
Eridzhi Haili

376
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:50,340
发现根本没有 Daydream

377
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,340
How could you go there?

378
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,340
What are you doing?

379
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,340
Wu Xie!

380
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,340
Wu Xie, where are you?

381
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,340
What's going on?

382
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,340
Who's there?

383
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,340
Who's there?

384
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,340
Who's there?

385
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,340
Where are you?

386
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,340
Where are you?

387
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,340
Who's there?

388
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,340
26?

389
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,340
Where are you?

390
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,340
Where are you?

391
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,340
Where are you?

392
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,340
Where are you?

393
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,340
Wu Xie!

394
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,340
Is it you?

395
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,340
Wu Xie!

396
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,340
Lao Yang, are you okay?

397
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:30,340
I'm fine. That snake was poisoned by the hole.

398
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,340
How is it inside?

399
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,340
I'm fine. Maybe because the snake hit the machine.

400
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,340
The hole here was also blocked.

401
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,340
I'll get you out of here now.

402
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,340
I tried. Don't waste your energy.

403
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,340
There are so many holes in this line.

404
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,340
Let's find out if there's any other exit.

405
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,340
Be careful.

406
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,340
Lao Yang!

407
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,340
I'm out!

408
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,340
Who's there?

409
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,340
Is there anyone?

410
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,340
Is there anyone?

411
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,340
Who?

412
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,340
Who's there?

413
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,340
Who are you?

414
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,340
Who are you?

415
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,340
You're fake!

416
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,340
What's fake?

417
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,340
I'm outside.

418
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,340
I'm here. I'm out!

419
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,340
You're a fake!

420
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,340
You're a fake!

421
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,340
You're a fake!

422
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,340
You're a fake!

423
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,340
Don't go!

424
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,340
Don't go!

425
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,340
I'm out!

426
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,340
You can't do this to me!

427
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,340
You're a fake, aren't you?

428
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,340
You want to kill me?

429
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,340
You think I'm dead? You're real!

430
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,340
You're always a fake! You're always not real!

431
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,340
You're a fake!

432
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,340
Lao Yang!

433
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,340
Lao Yang! Be careful!

434
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,340
Are you still here?

435
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,340
I'm here.

436
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,340
I'm here.

437
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,340
Hey!

438
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,340
What's going on?

439
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,340
What's that sound?

440
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,340
What's that sound?

441
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,340
It's a sound of a gunshot.

442
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,340
Is that so?

443
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,340
It's a real sound.

444
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,340
Fire!

445
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,340
Fire!

446
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:05,340
Anyone? Anyone? Anyone?

447
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,340
Fire!

448
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,340
Fire!

449
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,340
Fire!

450
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,340
Fire!

451
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,340
Fire!

452
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,340
Fire!
