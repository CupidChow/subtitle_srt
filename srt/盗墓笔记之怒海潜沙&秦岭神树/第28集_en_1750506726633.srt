00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,880
The Date of My sang by Ayagmann

2
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,680
Episode 10

3
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,180
their second standard

4
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,460
has Presented a lot

5
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,220
So sorry, we'll give it a quick look

6
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,320
We can only study

7
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,040
a little from the clothing

8
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,340
Only messing with the car

9
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,200
When I'm dead

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm afraid nothing will be left.

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm a little bit careless.

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
A cloud of smoke, with the wind, the sun.

13
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Recently, the score is not very stable.

14
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Someone is trying to understand me.

15
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Is it because of the hangover and the rain?

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes.

17
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Recently, some rumors say that

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
there was a man who died in the hospital.

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And rumors say that the ambulance was hit by a car.

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Someone also said that the hangover and the rain

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
were just a conflict.

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is not a free-range relationship.

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's not a gang relationship.

24
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This is too unreasonable.

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And someone said that

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
your hand is too hot.

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You don't want to be lenient to your own people.

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's not fair to be in trouble.

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why are these people like old people in the dark?

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
They are not capable of anything.

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They don't let others have a good time.

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They seem to be in a lie.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
They can get a good place to be.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Since people are selfish,

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
they should be more active.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Sorry, my friends are here.

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Can we talk next time?

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Sure.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Have a good time.

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Bye.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Bye.

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Why are you back?

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I have some things to tell you.

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't know if you know it.

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Just give yourself some fun.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why don't you go to me first when you are back?

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You should be surprised that I am here.

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You have been back for a long time, right?

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes.

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You should go to someone else first.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You should not come to me first.

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I wanted to come to you a few days later.

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Who knows?

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You are so immature now.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I heard that you were almost caught by FBI in the US.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I just watched some of the private tourists who were in the car.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The first in the city of Almeida, Yule City, 9994466.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The most exciting game on the line.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The horse is running.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The horse is running.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The reward is the queen.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The treasure is Huang Jincheng.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The rich are rich.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The reward is the captain.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The super high salary.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The reward is the most high.

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The reward is the queen.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The reward is the queen.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The reward is the queen.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The reward is the queen.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The reward is the queen.

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The reward is the queen.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The reward is the queen.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The realazв is the国.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The rose mandarin Entrance is over.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The flowers were still blooming due to the hurry.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Come, hurry up!

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
They not found me.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You are picking ON is fun?

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,120
Don't know.

81
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
I will tell you.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So, you want to say goodbye to your life because you love them?

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,100
Do you have a question about me?

84
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,720
Do you have a mistake at all?

85
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
That's too stupid.

86
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,840
You must be serious.

87
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,120
Don't be evil.

88
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
Don't pick up words.

89
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,640
Speaking of the devil,

90
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,400
can I buy a lifetime film with you,

91
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,980
as this film is under your guidance from me?

92
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,660
It says Lao Yang is carrying the sqaure of the Board,

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,560
within the scope of life.

94
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,320
Regarding the date of sale of the idea of course,

95
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,680
Northern Personnel is the movie designed

96
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,280
to pay the italics.

97
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,720
You'd better tell my saos

98
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,400
just not to possible before me.

99
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,760
I couldn't get over Ji Yuhua.

100
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,000
Slowly.

101
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,700
Or

102
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,480
the jednak,

103
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,300
he might make a fool out of himself.

104
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,680
Things often

105
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,420
fly in my store.

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,320
You can do everything.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,320
This is my hobby.

108
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,520
Do you know what I write?

109
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,440
Did you eat anything?

110
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,240
Nothing.

111
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,840
I just want to eat some fish.

112
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,080
Then eat some自ай鍋.

113
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,960
Eat it.

114
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,720
I'm not full.

115
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,520
You're really...

116
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,120
You can't be with your own stomach.

117
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,120
It's good to come back and eat.

118
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,920
Okay, eat it.

119
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
I'll eat it when I'm full.

120
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,760
Okay, let's go.

121
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,080
Let's go!

122
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,120
weapons

123
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,880
Mister,

124
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,680
we've exceeded your request for food and water.

125
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,360
Yes.

126
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
What?

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Be careful.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What do you mean?

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm telling you, they're just here to kill us.

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No.

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What do you mean?

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What are you looking at?

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Come.

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What are you doing?

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I mean,

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
they seem to be looking for something.

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Before I fainted,

138
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I saw them taking away the luggage they had in the car.

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And we were all searched.

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
They were taken away by the Count.

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
They were taken away by the sword.

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
They were from the tomb.

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The army knew nothing about us.

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
No one else knew.

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Okay, I got it.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Dear!

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Siyan, you can't go in.

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Dear, you have to help me.

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Dear, he's in the house.

150
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Dear.

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Dear.

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What are you doing?

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Dear, what are you doing?

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Get out of my way!

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I want to see my husband.

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Where's he?

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Grandma is resting.

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Siyan, what's wrong with you?

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What's wrong with me?

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You were beaten.

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Didn't my husband say he had done something?

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
How did he do it?

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
A lot of people were in my company.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
They were beaten by the sword.

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And the law.

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Dear.

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Dear.

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What's wrong with you?

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
How could it be me?

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Dear, I didn't do anything wrong to you.

171
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
When you were little,

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I brought you a lot of fun.

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I bought you some food.

174
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
How could you...

175
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Dear, what do you mean?

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I hope you're safe.

177
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Safe?

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's what you want.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You're much older.

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You have a lot of heart.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You're not old, are you?

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You said in the case of Mingli

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
that you wanted to take the family.

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Don't you think

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
that you can bear such a big family?

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Can you bear it?

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll kill you.

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You've been having fun for years.

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Where did you get the money?

190
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's not like

191
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
our uncles and uncles

192
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
will come back

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
with a big word.

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Why do you have to

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
stand up for a word?

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You mean I only marry the family?

197
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Didn't I?

198
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I didn't see it coming.

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Dear, I suggest you to be more serious.

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This society is capable of doing it.

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That old lady is over 10 years old.

202
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What do you want?

203
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I...

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I...

205
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This family...

206
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
is so hard to bear.

207
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's a matter of generations.

208
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

209
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But the family needs

210
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
women to practice.

211
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Because women's minds are so strong.

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
They're stronger than men.

213
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's a matter of genes.

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's not your fault.

215
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
These years,

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
your uncles,

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
aunt,

218
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
brother,

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and son,

220
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
they've been living together.

221
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
They've been doing well.

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But...

223
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
why did you

224
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
do such a thing?

225
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You're so weird.

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You say,

227
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
who will you serve later?

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Who won't serve later?

229
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You're just making fun of me.

230
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Who are you torturing?

231
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You're already torturing the outside world.

232
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's because you're unfair.

233
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm not unfair.

234
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Then let me tell you.

235
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You don't know, right?

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
All your fun today

237
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
is for the women of the Huo family.

238
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You're here to exchange your life.

239
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Do you know that?

240
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You're still angry?

241
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You're not a gold-grey-leaf?

242
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You're a heartless dog.

243
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm telling you,

244
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I can't take care of it today.

245
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But I can't wipe your ass.

246
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You should do the right thing for you.

247
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You should pay the price.

248
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Do you understand?

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Aunt.

250
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm not your eldest nephew.

251
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You can't take care of me.

252
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm not your eldest nephew.

253
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You're not a good person.

254
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You're a good person.

255
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You say,

256
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'll use you.

257
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's useless.

258
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's useless.

259
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I dare not use you.

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You're a bad person.

261
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You should pay the price.

262
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You should be punished for what you should be punished for.

263
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Get lost!

264
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't want to see you again.

265
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Fine!

266
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If you're willing to give me back,

267
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'll give you back.

268
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Don't think I don't know what the Old Nine Gate is.

269
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Our Huo family is not clean.

270
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Look at your beauty.

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Huo family is like a piece of broken stone.

272
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The stage is already in the flesh.

273
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
If you don't wipe it off,

274
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
it's a piece of broken stone.

275
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
If you wipe it off,

276
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
it might be a piece of ice.

277
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Grandma, Huo family is the King's Law.

278
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're right.

279
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yes, it's definitely the King's Law.

280
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Get up, Ayao.

281
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You set up the bed at 8 a.m. yesterday.

282
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Get up, Ayao.

283
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You set up the bed at 8 a.m. yesterday.

284
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Ayao, get up!

285
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You have a lot of work to do today.

286
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Get up, Ayao.

287
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You set up the bed at 8 a.m. yesterday.

288
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Why am I so cruel to today?

289
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm not a good person.

290
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm not a good person.

291
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Thank you.

292
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Thank you for singing with me in the second month.

293
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What's wrong?

294
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You want to have two doors?

295
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You don't even want to open the door.

296
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
How could you think of this?

297
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
No matter what,

298
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
he's the grandson of the Ninth Lord.

299
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What's the age?

300
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
He's a general.

301
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Besides, Di Zhixue is not just a person.

302
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Don't forget, there's also a...

303
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
a medicine for the heart.

304
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Isn't the medicine for the heart

305
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
for the heart of the Ninth Lord's mother?

306
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's a medicine for the heart.

307
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Actually, it's a private life.

308
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Look, the Ninth Lord's son has been adopted.

309
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He's just given the child a space to live.

310
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Ayao and Yuchen have been in a bad relationship.

311
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
They've been together for a long time.

312
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
They're in love and they're here.

313
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I think, if it's not Jie Yu,

314
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
anyone can do it.

315
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You can change the house.

316
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The family name is Jie.

317
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The house is Jie's.

318
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Master Hua,

319
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
the elders and the old friends in the house

320
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
asked for a meeting.

321
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
When they were in the meeting,

322
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
you were the one who just became the family.

323
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Now you want a meeting again?

324
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
We can't give them this chance.

325
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The Ninth Lord said he'd do something for the people.

326
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
He said he'd let everyone join him.

327
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The Xie family can keep their life.

328
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I think, the Xie family has a rule

329
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
that the people don't have such rules.

330
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's a rule that's been raised by some people.

331
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What's the theme of the ceremony?

332
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's the family.

333
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
They're going to choose the family members.

334
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The Xie family is the heir to the family.

335
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
He's too ambitious.

336
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I heard he's been in touch with

337
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
the people who don't like your host.

338
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
He must be behind all this.

339
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
We used to play well.

340
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Master Hua, you're too emotional.

341
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You treat the Huo family the same way.

342
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You treat the Wu family the same way.

343
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You treat the Zhai Xingyao the same way.

344
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But you have to see if it's worth it.

345
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I agree.

346
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Tomorrow at 9 p.m.

347
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
the Xie family will meet.

348
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
No, Master Hua, why do you have to save them?

349
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
If I let them...

350
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Since the Xie family has such a rule,

351
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
as a family member,

352
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I can't let them choose the family members.

353
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You're right.

354
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Master Hua, you're right.

355
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Actually, I'm not that worried.

356
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The Xie family is more like you.

357
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
More.

358
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,700
Pound

359
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:39,500
People abused before taka

360
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,540
Really pretty

361
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,120
It seems prettyAmerica

362
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,200
In the future, we would definitely become Wing-opia.

363
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,080
I' ll grant you the Bill of Majesty

364
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,520
to gather various local拿e grades and grade.

365
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,000
With Tie-mian?

366
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,080
You're licking my throat.

367
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
That's too deep.

368
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,640
But it's really hot.

369
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,640
You won't have more time.

370
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,120
Good!

371
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Good!

372
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,120
Good!

373
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,120
Good!

374
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,120
Good!

375
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,120
Good!

376
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Go find her.

377
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,120
You are looking for me?

378
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,120
I found her.

379
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,120
Let's go.

380
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,120
I'm going to check the house.

381
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,120
I will go to the house.

382
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,120
I'll go to the house.

383
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,120
I will go to the house.

384
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,120
You go to the house.

385
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,120
I will go to the house.

386
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,120
I will go to the house.

387
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
I will go to the house.

388
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,120
I'm tired of swearing.

389
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,120
This house is very big!

390
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,120
Buy her some money at the market.

391
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,120
No, there are no more daddies!

392
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,820
Really?

393
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,120
Holy crap!

394
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,120
Are you married?

395
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,920
Between you and mine,

396
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
if you want to eat,

397
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,040
you can go to the kitchen.

398
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,040
You can leave now.

399
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Don't just talk nonsense.

400
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,040
What do you mean?

401
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Why don't you ask yourself?

402
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,040
What are you doing here today?

403
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Everyone has their own opinions.

404
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
But some people don't.

405
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,040
They think that if there are too many horses,

406
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,040
they can bite the elephant.

407
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Do you have the right to talk?

408
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,040
You are a traitor.

409
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,040
I can't compare with you

410
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,040
in terms of resources and ability.

411
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,040
You are a coward.

412
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
You are not qualified to teach me.

413
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
What are you saying?

414
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
You are a bastard.

415
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
Do you have any rules?

416
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Come on.

417
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,040
Sit down.

418
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,040
Don't talk to him.

419
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,040
It's so lively today.

420
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
Zhou San.

421
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Sorry, Mr. Zhai.

422
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,040
You are in the wrong position.

423
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
Please.

424
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
Everyone.

425
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,040
Who is going to be our young master today?

426
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
Let's sit down.

427
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Mr. Zhai.

428
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Sit here.

429
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,040
I'll sit here today.

430
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,040
I'll leave if you don't leave.

431
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
I'm leaving.

432
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
I'm leaving.

433
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Xie Yuchen may not come today.

434
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,040
But it's okay if he doesn't come.

435
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,040
The ceremony is in place.

436
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,040
You said that it's in place.

437
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
You are a bastard.

438
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,040
We are younger than Xie Yuchen.

439
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,040
He is his brother.

440
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
He is not here.

441
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,040
But I should be the one to lead the ceremony.

442
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Is there a problem?

443
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
I object.

444
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,040
The one who is not here

445
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,040
is not qualified to be the judge.

446
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
It's not.

447
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Today, we are going to change the new one.

448
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,040
I think everyone here

449
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,040
has the right to be the judge.

450
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,040
Didn't Xie Yuchen say

451
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,040
that he wants democracy?

452
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,040
We are going to decide

453
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,040
what democracy is for today.

454
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,040
So,

455
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,040
do you want to vote?

456
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,040
Come on.

457
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Let's change the new one.

458
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,040
Raise your hand.

459
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Have you decided?

460
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,040
The US president has been talking for four years.

461
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,040
Why can't we change the new one?

462
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,040
We are going to follow the development of the era.

463
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,040
The flow is not good.

464
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,040
The protection is not good.

465
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Xie Yuchen is also going to change the new one.

466
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
Okay.

467
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,040
We have decided.

468
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Let's discuss the second one.

469
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Who is going to be the judge?

470
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,040
I suggest Zhai Xingyao.

471
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Raise your hand.

472
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,040
Raise your hand.

473
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Raise your hand.

474
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
The day to review is also over.

475
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:05,040
Go to

476
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,040
seho employ

477
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,720
And another one's usually invisible

478
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,440
I don't see why

479
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,200
I cannot use a 24-hour principle

480
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,160
All I can do is prove to everyone

481
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
I need to know

482
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,960
what try sets' cameras

483
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:30,160
etch some test

484
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,680
and begren

485
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,020
I understand

486
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,560
See for myself

487
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,080
每 unhandled

488
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,080
may you never forget this promise

489
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,360
and find someone to Yarun

490
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,800
become a burden

491
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
wait

492
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,360
something

493
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,320
let's go

494
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,320
and the money you used on the account of the Xie family

495
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,320
and the transaction you made with the Xie family.

496
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
May I ask if I have any questions?

497
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,320
What's up?

498
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
Are you going to bite the shit out of me?

499
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
What are you doing?

500
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
It's not good to keep it here.

501
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
It's none of your business.

502
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,320
Why don't you care about my business?

503
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
Stop talking.

504
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,320
Shut up.

505
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,320
I owe you the money.

506
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,320
This money is yours.

507
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,320
I've seen so many times here.

508
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
Why is the interest still growing?

509
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:58,320
Uncle Liu, we have to eat at the South Island.

510
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,320
Then your interest is too high.

511
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320
I have an idea.

512
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
I don't need your money.

513
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Are you the art teacher of the art school?

514
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,320
I'm also the art teacher of the medicine school.

515
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,320
I'm telling you the truth.

516
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
These years,

517
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,320
Yu Chen has been working hard

518
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,320
to maintain the Xie family's reputation.

519
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,320
No one can kill this credit.

520
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,320
But he's too hard-working.

521
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,320
I'm a Tang scholar.

522
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,320
I don't care about the interest.

523
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Who can share the burden?

524
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
That's the medicine.

525
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
The medicine has the ability

526
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
to be the son of the Xie family.

527
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
It should be the power of the Xie family.

528
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
Am I right?

529
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,320
Yes.

530
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,320
Yes.

531
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,320
Yes.

532
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,320
The people are not here.

533
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
You should help him.

534
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,320
Wait for the money.

535
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,320
I've said it.

536
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,320
But he can't come back.

537
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,320
What do you mean?

538
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,320
How dare you?

539
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
Don't talk nonsense.

540
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
That's my brother.

541
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
You're too mean.

542
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
You're the leader of the Tang family.

543
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
You, you, and you.

544
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
You're not against it, are you?

545
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
I'm against it.

546
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,320
The Xie family should be replaced by the Tang family.

547
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,320
But the people should not be like this.

548
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,320
For the sake of their own good.

549
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,320
And the brotherhood of their own brother.

550
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,320
Brother, don't listen to the wind.

551
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,320
I'm the brother of Yuchen.

552
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,320
What brother?

553
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
Nonsense.

554
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,320
Yuchen's parents and Yuchen's mother are classmates.

555
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,320
At that time, a car accident was killed.

556
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,320
Yuchen's mother was pitiful.

557
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,320
That's why she adopted him.

558
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,320
You can do DNA.

559
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
I'm not a man.

560
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
Yuchen can do DNA.

561
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,320
Yuchen's parents adopted him for more than ten years.

562
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,320
The Xie family has always treated him as their own.

563
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
But what did he do?

564
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,320
To serve Yuchen's rights for their own sake.

565
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,320
This kind of person can be the Tang family.

566
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Yes, that's right.

567
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,320
I think only the Tang family can be the family.

568
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,320
If Yuchen can be the family, I'll take the double.

569
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,320
Yuchen, you said Yuchen was the one who wanted to be the family.

570
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
What evidence do you have?

571
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
He admitted it himself.

572
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
I just said it.

573
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
What?

574
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
You think he can't come back?

575
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,320
I got the news that Yuchen was attacked by people in the countryside.

576
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,320
You can't say nonsense.

577
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,320
Maybe he was just on the road.

578
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
Someone shot him.

579
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
It's not the US.

580
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,320
They just take the gun and leave.

581
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,320
Okay, okay, okay.

582
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,320
I'll be honest.

583
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,320
The so-called old Wu's work

584
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,320
has been a great success for us.

585
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:27,320
He took care of the Xie family for Yuchen.

586
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,320
But there's no problem with the accounts.

587
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,320
So, I think the position of the Tang family

588
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,320
is the best for the old Wu.

589
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,320
Do you think so?

590
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,320
I agree.

591
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,320
I agree.

592
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,320
Wu is a talented man.

593
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
He can be a talented man.

594
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,320
He can be the leader.

595
00:31:53,320 --> 00:32:00,320
Liu, I heard that you owe 6-7 million to Li Wei's factory.

596
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,320
You've been paying the money back.

597
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,320
Where did you get the money?

598
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,320
You've got money, you've got words.

599
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,320
You're a good man.

600
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,320
You deserve money.

601
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,320
If that's the case,

602
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,320
let's make a deal with the Wu family.

603
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,320
Let me see.

604
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:32,320
One, two, three, four, five.

605
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,320
Please raise your hands.

606
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,320
Some people have never been familiar with the Wu family.

607
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,320
They don't support me or the Wu family.

608
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,320
Are you going to support Xie Yuchen?

609
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,320
Except for the words, I don't support anyone.

610
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
Yes.

611
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,320
You've made up your mind.

612
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,320
A dead man can't protect you.

613
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,320
The flower is here.

614
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:46,320
This marks the end of 3rd of the program.

615
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,120
Thank you so much for watching my program.

616
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,320
December 6, 2012

617
00:33:53,480 --> 00:34:00,120
buyers

618
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,000
the face not read

619
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:09,400
vehicles

620
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,320
I can't work anymore.

621
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,580
I must give her my warning sign.

622
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,000
stalls

623
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,540
Older people

624
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,100
for an interview

625
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,920
I have no business

626
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:30,080
Why do you have to pay

627
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,360
I didn't mention it

628
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,740
Thanks for the hard work

629
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,580
Give it back

630
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,580
You...

631
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,580
Don't blame me!

632
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,580
You...

633
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,580
You're a traitor!

634
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,580
You're a traitor!

635
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,580
Don't drag your family down

636
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,580
if you're still in a hurry.

637
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,580
Leave some money

638
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,580
to your wife before you die.

639
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,580
If you kill Xie Yuchen,

640
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,580
you'll be the one

641
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,580
who can't escape this time.

642
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,580
You're the one who killed Xie Yuchen.

643
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,580
Are you looking for me?

644
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,580
Hey!

645
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,580
How do I look?

646
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,580
Brother.

647
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,580
Uncle Wu,

648
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,580
my brother's life is worth 10 million.

649
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,580
You're so petty.

650
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,580
You...

651
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,580
Don't try to be a traitor!

652
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,580
Just now,

653
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,580
Xie Yuchen and I

654
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,580
acted in a drama.

655
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,580
What do they want to do?

656
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,580
They just want to see

657
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,580
who's not interested in Xie Yuchen.

658
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,580
You...

659
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,580
Don't think too much!

660
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,580
Lu Ying and I

661
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,580
are all responsible for the police.

662
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,580
Third,

663
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,580
we'll make money

664
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,580
on the account

665
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,580
of the one who did it.

666
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,580
I hope you won't save me.

667
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,580
I'll give it to the police

668
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,580
in a week.

669
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,580
Yes!

670
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,580
Brother,

671
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,580
you're the one who's the most petty.

672
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,580
You're responsible for the water.

673
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,580
Besides,

674
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,580
Xie's family

675
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,580
doesn't belong to the Qingbari.

676
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,580
That's true.

677
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,580
The Qingbari won't be a bank.

678
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,580
You're not from the Xie family.

679
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,580
We're a family.

680
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,580
Why don't I belong to the Xie family?

681
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,580
What do you know?

682
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,580
I don't know.

683
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,580
You gave me the 10 million.

684
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,580
Why?

685
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,580
You're responsible for the water.

686
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,580
You're not my brother.

687
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,580
Why did I buy it for you?

688
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,580
You're not my brother.

689
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,580
What's wrong?

690
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,580
The notebook.

691
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,580
This is the old one.

692
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,580
It's a basic test record.

693
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,580
I didn't lose anything.

694
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,580
I'm sure

695
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,580
it was the one who did it.

696
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,580
Think about it.

697
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,580
What can they steal?

698
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,580
Could it be

699
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,580
the notebook of my grandfather?

700
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,580
Your grandfather lost the notebook.

701
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,580
Before I leave,

702
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,580
I'll put it and the snake-meat-tongue

703
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,580
in my parents' treasured treasured place.

704
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,580
Who will it be?

705
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,580
Qiu Tekao?

706
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,580
Name,

707
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,580
how's the investigation going?

708
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,580
We're still trying to track down those people.

709
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,580
Wu Xie nearly got run over by them.

710
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,580
The call and the house have been searched.

711
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,580
They were obviously looking for something.

712
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,580
A drunk check on the way.

713
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,580
Drink, driving and run-running.

714
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,580
It does look like an accident.

715
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,580
They are two cars or suspicious though.

716
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,580
They've got fake plates

717
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,580
with records of a hit-and-run.

718
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,580
Even the police couldn't identify

719
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,580
who the driver was.

720
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,580
Post the investigation.

721
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,580
Now,

722
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
you need to watch out.

723
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,580
We can't afford to lose Wu Xie yet.

724
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,580
Protect him.

725
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,580
Sir, any idea

726
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,580
who they are working for?

727
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,580
No, dad, at the moment.

728
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,580
This old man is the first person to be killed.

729
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,580
He has some money at home.

730
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,580
He likes to listen to the play.

731
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,580
He's a playmaker.

732
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,580
He's been to the meeting.

733
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,580
After the party, he handed over the factory

734
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,580
and became a worker.

735
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,580
But he's got a lot of money.

736
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,580
He's just a son.

737
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,580
He's not used to it.

738
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,580
He's lost his bet.

739
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,580
He's lost his bet.

740
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,580
He forced him to take all the money

741
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,580
and pay for it.

742
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,580
Besides the head,

743
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,580
he's got nothing left.

744
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,580
He wanted to sell his head.

745
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,580
But he didn't give up.

746
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,580
He said it was a trap.

747
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,580
Now, he's fine.

748
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,580
He's lost his bet.

749
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,580
He wants to sell his head.

750
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,580
He wants to keep the money.

751
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,580
Are you sure it's his head?

752
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,580
I've found a person.

753
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,580
It's true.

754
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,580
The same head.

755
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,580
He's seen it by the old man.

756
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,580
It should be him.

757
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,580
So,

758
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,580
he's got a lot of money and money.

759
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,580
He's got a lot of money.

760
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,580
And a lot of money.

761
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,580
Sir,

762
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,580
can I have your hand?

763
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,580
I haven't come back for a long time.

764
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,580
I've got some things to do.

765
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,580
The bed in the south

766
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,580
is still comfortable.

767
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,780
I'm not sure.

768
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,780
Mr. San.

769
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,780
You said Mr. San is there.

770
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,980
Why don't you go and see?

771
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,580
Me?

772
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,580
To see him?

773
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,780
He's not dead, not dead.

774
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,780
I'm not going.

775
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,180
What's going on with those two?

776
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,380
They're just like Mr. San in the car.

777
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,380
They're both human beings.

778
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,580
They're not my own.

779
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,780
They're doing this for the sake of money.

780
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,980
They don't know who the boss is.

781
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,980
But they did it

782
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,780
according to the boss's order.

783
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,780
They put it in the drawer of the supermarket.

784
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,380
But the surveillance is not very good.

785
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,980
They can't find out who did it.

786
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,580
Mr. San,

787
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,780
do you have any suspicious target?

788
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,180
Tell me. I'll do it.

789
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,980
No.

790
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,380
The secret weapon is not moving.

791
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,380
Mr. San is saying that they're in the secret.

792
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,780
If they do it again,

793
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,180
I'm afraid Mr. San won't be so lucky.

794
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,180
My nephew is not a fool.

795
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,580
And he has a friend to help him.

796
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,980
If they do it again,

797
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,180
no one will be able to say no.

798
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,580
Mr. San,

799
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,980
it's better to find them out earlier.

800
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,580
I'm afraid they'll take the radish out and bring it to you.

801
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,180
Mr. San,
