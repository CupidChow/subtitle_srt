1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:14,160
быть

2
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,320
fast

3
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
Get up!

4
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Hurry!

5
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
Xiaoyu!

6
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
Run!

7
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,320
Run!

8
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,320
The End

9
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
Yang!

10
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
No!

11
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Why are you laughing?

12
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
I'm waiting for the basket.

13
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
Teacher, come home with me.

14
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
I... I'm locked up.

15
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
What's the matter?

16
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
Look up there.

17
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,320
The stone is still not finished.

18
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
It might be used.

19
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
But it's not used yet.

20
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
It's blown away.

21
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
Look.

22
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,320
This is a place where there are no waste.

23
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,320
There's no exit.

24
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,320
So,

25
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
the stones we just passed

26
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
are both sealed.

27
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
How do these stones

28
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,320
run?

29
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,320
They flow under the water.

30
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
That's troublesome.

31
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Is there a corpse in here?

32
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
No.

33
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,320
I've never heard of the fairy chain.

34
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
I'll go to the coffin.

35
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
And you, ask me.

36
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,320
There's no taste at all.

37
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
It must be the air.

38
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
There's something inside.

39
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Come and have a look.

40
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
How about opening it?

41
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,320
Hey.

42
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Is there a chance

43
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
to open it?

44
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
Yang, let's go.

45
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Yang, are you all right?

46
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Yes.

47
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
He...

48
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
He...

49
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
He...

50
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
He...

51
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
He's...

52
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
He's...

53
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
He's...

54
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
He...

55
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
He...

56
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
He...

57
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
He...

58
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
His hand...

59
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
You've been poisoned?

60
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
It's all right.

61
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
You're really the one who poisoned us.

62
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Why did you change your mind?

63
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,320
The guy who was with you that day?

64
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
This mother

65
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,320
shouldn't be the one you're looking for.

66
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
She's the one.

67
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,320
You're not looking for her, are you?

68
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
What do you know?

69
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
I know her.

70
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
She's enough for us.

71
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,320
This guy wants to find us.

72
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Mr. Ma.

73
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
Uncle Tan.

74
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
According to what Mr. Li said,

75
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
the place where the gossip was,

76
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,320
was the entrance to the underground tunnel.

77
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,320
But we couldn't see anything.

78
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
What's going on?

79
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
It's not the wrong place.

80
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
It should be here.

81
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
It must be the one who hid the entrance

82
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
when the gossip was being held.

83
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
The secret door must be in this room.

84
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
Wu Xin.

85
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
What are they doing here?

86
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
They're on their way.

87
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
We met them on the way.

88
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Mr. Yang.

89
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
What's wrong?

90
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,320
According to what Mr. Li said,

91
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,320
the path shouldn't be wrong.

92
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,320
If there's a secret door,

93
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,320
I don't think there will be anything else.

94
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,320
Mr. Yang must be in the underground...

95
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
...close of the bed.

96
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
One, two, three.

97
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
One, two, three.

98
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
One, two, three.

99
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
One, two, three.

100
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
One, two, three.

101
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Why are they so familiar with each other?

102
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
I thought they were from the same family.

103
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
But I can't remember them.

104
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
Come here.

105
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Go.

106
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
Mr. Yang.

107
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
What's going on?

108
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
We haven't visited this place.

109
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,120
Luoyang.

110
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,280
Get down.

111
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,440
Hurry up.

112
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,680
It's okay.

113
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,240
Get down. Hurry up.

114
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
Hurry up.

115
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,880
Wait.

116
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,520
Take this down.

117
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,200
It's too harsh if you're aliens.

118
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,760
Let it come out.

119
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,040
Just blow it engage your scope.

120
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:18,600
If you don't listen to my littleウittl

121
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,240
Och…

122
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:18,460
I don't want to lose you!

123
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:56,400
Today is the FIRST day for me.

124
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,600
Now it can be better

125
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,380
than to be friends evermore.

126
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,240
Here we go.

127
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,120
Oh my god.

128
00:11:48,600 --> 00:12:01,080
...

129
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,880
She's walking toward me.

130
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,840
What's wrong?

131
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,520
What's socy- punitive?

132
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:55,980
By the way, I'm sure to pass along Yanobi all my life and nothing will stop me.

133
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,740
but many more things have been done for us.

134
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,360
Miss Momoko.

135
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
I'm afraid.

136
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,360
Go back if you're afraid.

137
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
Miss Ning.

138
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
Miss Ning.

139
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Look at the few songs I brought this time.

140
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,360
The loss is so heavy.

141
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,360
Look at this money.

142
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
No.

143
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
This money can be not added.

144
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
Then find a name and share it with me.

145
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Okay?

146
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
Okay?

147
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
Miss Ning, you can do it.

148
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
Uncle Tai, be careful.

149
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
No.

150
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,360
The water is hot.

151
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
I didn't expect that.

152
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:10,360
The spiritual path of the tomb is like a river.

153
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
If it's not seen by the eyes,

154
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,360
it's hard to believe.

155
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
We can't go anymore.

156
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360
The water is hot and hot.

157
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
It's not good to be hot.

158
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
Boss Wang.

159
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,360
What should we do now?

160
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,360
Boss Li didn't write the map on the treasure?

161
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,360
When the map said that it was not good to visit the tomb,

162
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
there were two iron locks under the water.

163
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,360
If we touch the iron lock,

164
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,360
we can reach the entrance of the underground palace.

165
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Okay, I'll go down.

166
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
No need.

167
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
No, the water...

168
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
Uncle Tai,

169
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,360
there is a chain under the water.

170
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,360
It's not so bad as my brother's.

171
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,360
We can't walk on the water.

172
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
It's not very stable.

173
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,360
We can't walk on the water.

174
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,360
The water here is deeper than the water of Boss Li.

175
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,360
And it's hot.

176
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,360
If we touch the big fish,

177
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,360
we'll die more than Boss Li.

178
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
It's okay.

179
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
The water is so hot here.

180
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
There must be a hot spring under it.

181
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
The bigger the fish,

182
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,360
the more familiar it will be in the water.

183
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
Now

184
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,360
I'll show you the way.

185
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
Uncle Tai,

186
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
there is a road.

187
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
What's that?

188
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
It's a... a spirit.

189
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Bastard!

190
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Pull it back.

191
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
I'll shoot you.

192
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
Go.

193
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
Go.

194
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
It's burned to death.

195
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,360
It's all burnt.

196
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
It's a strong spirit.

197
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,360
Run!

198
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,360
Run, Lao Yang.

199
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Run.

200
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,360
It's a spirit.

201
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
Don't run.

202
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
Keep going.

203
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
There should be a trap.

204
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,360
Hurry up.

205
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Hurry up.

206
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Hurry up.

207
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
Hurry up.

208
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,360
Hurry up.

209
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
Lao Yang, there is a trap.

210
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
Hurry up.

211
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,360
Follow me.

212
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,360
Lao Yang, this way.

213
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
Uncle Tai, go up.

214
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,360
Hurry up.

215
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
Hurry up, Lao Yang.

216
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,360
Hurry up.

217
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
Help me.

218
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
Help me.

219
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Liang Shiyan.

220
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
Help me.

221
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
Wu Xie, are you crazy?

222
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
Help him.

223
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,360
No one can die.

224
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Liang Shiyan.

225
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
Wu Xie.

226
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,360
Wu Xie.

227
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
Liang Shiyan.

228
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
Help me.

229
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Help me.

230
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
Wu Xie.

231
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
Help me.

232
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
I can't hold on.

233
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
Help me.

234
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
Don't look.

235
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
Hold your hands.

236
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,360
I'll come to save you.

237
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,360
I'm scared.

238
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,360
Liang Shiyan, help me.

239
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
Hurry up.

240
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,360
Don't be afraid.

241
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
I've got you.

242
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Help me.

243
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
I'm scared.

244
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
I'm scared.

245
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
I'm scared.

246
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Put your hands up.

247
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,360
Put your hands up.

248
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Put your hands up.

249
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,360
Put your hands up.

250
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
Liang Shiyan.

251
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,360
Liang Shiyan.

252
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,360
Wu Xie.

253
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,360
Wu Xie.

254
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
Lao Yang.

255
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,360
Why are you here?

256
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
They...

257
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
They...

258
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,360
They fell into the water.

259
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
What should we do?

260
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
Take it easy.

261
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
Don't try to be a good man.

262
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,360
This is the only way out.

263
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,360
My hands.

264
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
Come on, hold on.

265
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
Wu Xie.

266
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,360
It's hot.

267
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,360
Be careful.

268
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,360
Hold on.

269
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,360
Wu Xie.

270
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,360
Come on.

271
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
It's so great.

272
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,360
Right?

273
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
It's better now.

274
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,360
I'll massage you every day.

275
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,360
Are you happy?

276
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
Of course.

277
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,360
Xiu, why don't you go out and play?

278
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,360
I want to play with grandma.

279
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,360
You can't even see a old woman.

280
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,360
You should go out and play with your young friends.

281
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,360
You know?

282
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
Just like the westerners.

283
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,360
They say that they play with each other.

284
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
They say that they're playing with each other.

285
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,360
I think that's the romantic part.

286
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,360
They ask,

287
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,360
what are you going to do?

288
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
I'm going to play with each other.

289
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Grandma,

290
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
do you know how to play when you're young?

291
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
Yes.

292
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,360
There are some things that you have to try when you're young.

293
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,360
I like to play, too.

294
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
You know?

295
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,360
What do you play?

296
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,360
How can you be happy?

297
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,360
For example, love.

298
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,360
Grandma,

299
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,360
when you're young, you still love your lover.

300
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
I'm different.

301
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
I'm a career.

302
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,360
Love is just a habit.

303
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
It's a life-changing nature.

304
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
Love brings happiness.

305
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
You can find it anywhere else.

306
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
It's because of love that you're upset.

307
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
It's sad and sad.

308
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
I can live well alone now.

309
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,360
That makes sense.

310
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,360
But I think,

311
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
as a woman,

312
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
you should always find a suitable person

313
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
to be with you.

314
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
Right?

315
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
Yes.

316
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,360
But it's not easy to be a good person.

317
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,360
You can do whatever you want.

318
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,360
That's right.

319
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Of course,

320
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
I think that if you don't

321
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,360
feel upset for your lover,

322
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,360
it's also a blessing.

323
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,360
Right.

324
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,360
Let me tell you something.

325
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,360
I told you to make some money.

326
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,360
Why did you go to the fish market?

327
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,360
I didn't go to the fish market.

328
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360
I have a phone to find a house.

329
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,360
Look.

330
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,360
There's a software called Backdoor.

331
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,360
It has any type of apartment.

332
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,360
It can be used as a VR view.

333
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
I don't understand.

334
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Look.

335
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
You can see the house

336
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
by clicking on the VR.

337
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,360
Look.

338
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,360
This is the bedroom.

339
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
Look.

340
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,360
You're so close.

341
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,360
Yes.

342
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
I'm not.

343
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
Come in.

344
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Mrs. La,

345
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
the driver of Changsha is here.

346
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,360
He wants to see you.

347
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
What's wrong with him?

348
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
He said he wanted to open a new apartment.

349
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,360
He was caught by someone.

350
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
He lost a lot of money.

351
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,360
I believe that Mrs. La

352
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,360
has a relationship with him.

353
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,360
He was just trying to

354
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
make a fuss

355
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
when I was not in Changsha.

356
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
He was so strong.

357
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
He was so cowardly.

358
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,360
So you mean...

359
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,360
Xiu Xiu,

360
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,360
why don't you

361
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
go see your uncle?

362
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
Mrs. La,

363
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,360
Xiu Xiu is a little girl.

364
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,360
Is it hard to talk to her?

365
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,360
What are you afraid of?

366
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
Back then,

367
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
when I was in charge of the Huo family,

368
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,360
I was two years younger than you.

369
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Look,

370
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
there was no one

371
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,360
who wanted to be my aunt.

372
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,360
They wanted to take a piece of meat

373
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,360
from me.

374
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,360
Do you know that?

375
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Mrs. La,

376
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
what if your uncle gets angry?

377
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
The men of the Huo family

378
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
eat soft rice, you know?

379
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,360
What's the bottom line for them to go on fire?

380
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,360
If you can't even do this,

381
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,360
just get married early.

382
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,360
Give me a grandson.

383
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,360
I may be able to

384
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
get rid of him.

385
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,360
I'll go.

386
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,360
Mrs. La,

387
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
you're behind me.

388
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
Xiu Xiu,

389
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
please sit down.

390
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,360
I've been saying

391
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
how to get married.

392
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,360
Now,

393
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,360
it seems that

394
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
the dead ones are already 708.

395
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
The Huo family

396
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
is going to wash the case

397
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,360
from the Huo family.

398
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
The Huo family

399
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,360
is a kind of person.

400
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,360
They are so talented.

401
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,360
If Xiu Xiu is raised,

402
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,360
the Huo family

403
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,360
will be a new generation.

404
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,360
In the future,

405
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,360
I won't be able to get rid of them.

406
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,360
I won't be able to see them.

407
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,360
Xie Jiu will still be the heir.

408
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
When Xie Jiu was young,

409
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,360
he sent him to the second-month-old.

410
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Who was the second-month-old?

411
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,360
He was a man of the past.

412
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,360
He was able to get rid of the old man.

413
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,360
He was also called the Fourth Prince.

414
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,360
In the second-month-old,

415
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,360
Xie Jiu was the most talented one.

416
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,360
He gave his own people to him.

417
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,360
Xie Jiu is a great man.

418
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,360
Xie Yuchen

419
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,360
is a great man

420
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
in this generation.

421
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
Yes.

422
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,360
I'm a little tired.

423
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,360
I'm a little tired.

424
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,360
What's wrong?

425
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,360
The light is on?

426
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,360
Tianzhen.

427
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,360
Where is Tianzhen?

428
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,360
He's here, too.

429
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
You can cure him.

430
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
Where is he?

431
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,360
Don't mention it.

432
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
We met a big fish

433
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,360
and we were in a mess.

434
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,360
Tianzhen saved me.

435
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,360
But now,

436
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,360
he should be in danger.

437
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,360
He's not in the wood.

438
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,360
Tianzhen,

439
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,360
how did you get in the wood?

440
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,360
How did you get here?

441
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Good.

442
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,360
You were a professional,

443
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,360
but you were so good.

444
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,360
You were so talented.

445
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,360
Now, you're a master of the field.

446
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,360
You can't get rid of him, right?

447
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,360
No.

448
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,360
Anyway,

449
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,360
when you see Tianzhen,

450
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,360
you should ask him.

451
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,360
Let's go.

452
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,360
Go find Tianzhen.

453
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,360
He's alone in the wood.

454
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,360
We can't do without him.

455
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
Do you know the way?

456
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,360
I know how to go back.

457
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
Mr. Wu said I was fine.

458
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,360
He wouldn't stay in the woods.

459
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,360
We'll keep going.

460
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,360
Maybe we'll meet him.

461
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,360
Mr. Wu!

462
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,360
Mr. Wu!

463
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,360
Where the hell is he?

464
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
Anyone?

465
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,360
Mr. Wu!

466
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,360
To be continued...

467
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,960
생金女王,檢保黄金城,找彩猫,赏金船长等!

468
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,360
超高 슈率,issue P400 Pro胡玩道 всё,

469
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,360
刚刚的報复机会多多趟紧将入。

470
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,840
啊们先にプ shirt ,ちなちのそー

471
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,640
Calm

472
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,240
While the others became EeT's,

473
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,900
if there're new Weird Troopers,

474
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,920
maybe the best team would have

475
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,560
been".

476
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,440
Ansi,

477
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,080
it's very dangerous.

478
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,960
I will get out grab the table

479
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,160
in case I fail.

480
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,680
So it means

481
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,080
We're up!

482
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,160
Back on it!

483
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,040
Old Yang...

484
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,040
I have already explained everything.

485
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,000
Did you expect me to write it down on the book?

486
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,360
He just said I have to write about your injury.

487
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,100
He said too much.

488
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,280
I will do it for traffic control.

489
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,320
Or else, I will leave it alone.

490
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,680
How about going for a trip?

491
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,240
It's crazy.

492
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,640
What's the secret?

493
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,120
We're experts in protecting the cultural relics.

494
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,160
Open it.

495
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,360
What's that?

496
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,240
It seems to be sent from the side.

497
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,240
Let's go and have a look.

498
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,080
Let's go and have a look.

499
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,920
It seems to be over there.

500
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,960
Sanshuk?

501
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,440
So now, I am fucking naked?

502
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,960
You son of a bitch!

503
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,940
Take a look at these...

504
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,100
flowers!

505
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,120
They havevent flown beyond grey!

506
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,200
Was it pleasant?

507
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,160
Do you need soup?

508
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,320
I'll take you on.

509
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,120
Then what?

510
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,580
Excuse me.

511
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,600
I need to see your father.

512
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,780
Tell me what's going on with him.

513
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,460
partial

514
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,660
She is now...

515
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,100
now going to Rep Armageddon

516
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,580
to find Alexander theoretic

517
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,020
to take the whole task of killing walks.

518
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:20,520
Heria,

519
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,220
are you crying?

520
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,140
I'm sorry,

521
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,160
but I haven't seen her yet.

522
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,040
She in heaven,

523
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,800
surely won't know what love is like.

524
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,900
She hasn't watched her son

525
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,520
and surpassed Natasha yet.

526
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,520
After that, we arrived at Qing Dynasty.

527
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:45,520
There are some people who came to see the water.

528
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,520
They said they wanted to find a place for rich people.

529
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,520
They went there for over ten days.

530
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,520
When they came out, they were out of the city.

531
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:01,520
They said that there was a place in the mountain called Huangquan tribe.

532
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,520
They wanted to find a place for rich people.

533
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:09,520
Do you think that the army went there?

534
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,520
It was a place where the few Feng Shui people went.

535
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,520
The army went there.

536
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,520
Think about it.

537
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,520
What kind of army could go there?

538
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,520
The British army.

539
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,520
Yes.

540
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,520
The British army went there.

541
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,520
After they found a place, they went back to the land.

542
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,520
Wu Xie.

543
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,520
You're awake.

544
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,520
Yang, I knew you saved me.

545
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,520
Are you okay?

546
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,520
I'm fine.

547
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,520
You're not hurt?

548
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,520
No.

549
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,520
Why are you sweating so much?

550
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,520
Are you okay?

551
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,520
Did you have a nightmare?

552
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,520
You had a nightmare?

553
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,520
What did you dream about?

554
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,520
Forget it.

555
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,520
It's okay.

556
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,520
You're safe.

557
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,520
By the way, what did you just see?

558
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,520
Such a beautiful view.

559
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,520
I didn't expect that there is such a scene in Tianmen Mountain.

560
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,520
Look.

561
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,520
The white bones on the ground are like wild animals.

562
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,520
The white bones are the teeth of these wild animals.

563
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,520
They were all buried here.

564
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,520
They couldn't escape.

565
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,520
And look.

566
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,520
This is the typical one.

567
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,520
Are you okay?

568
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,520
I'm fine.

569
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,520
This is the typical Kastel-Royal underground lake.

570
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,520
This kind of underground environment usually appears in the 4th century.

571
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,520
That's when it formed.

572
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,520
It needs to be expanded over ten thousand years to reach the current level.

573
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,520
So the history of the lava is longer than the history of humans.

574
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,520
Why are you laughing?

575
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,520
No.

576
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,520
You're still the old lady who likes to give people science.

577
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,520
I'm just a scientist, Bai Xiaosheng.

578
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,520
Bai Xiaosheng, how did you get out of the lab?

579
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,520
I think I know how to get out.

580
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,520
Really?

581
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,520
You know how to get out?

582
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:41,520
You know the place and the yellow circle, right?

583
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:47,520
Do you think it's a real place?

584
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,520
The village you've been to with the old horse,

585
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,520
there's an old fox, a new fox.

586
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,520
Do you remember what he said?

587
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,520
The ice-cutting thing.

588
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,520
And the yellow circle, the one Mr. Feng Shui said.

589
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,520
That's right.

590
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,520
I think it's a very interesting place.

591
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,520
But in this kind of place,

592
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,520
don't think about those things that are so mysterious.

593
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,520
I'm begging you.

594
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,520
I don't want to see you anymore.

595
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,520
The yellow circle.

596
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,520
The reason why we came out is because of the circle.

597
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,520
What color is it?

598
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
Yellow.

599
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,520
The yellow circle is what Mr. Feng Shui said.

600
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,520
