little bit

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What a long time.

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't care about it.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's beautiful.

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It looks good.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's not bad.

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's go.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Who is he?

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I will introduce him to you.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He is my good friend,

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Zhang Buxun.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Buxun.

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is the sister,

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Zhang Qingping.

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hello.

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Let's go inside.

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Who is he?

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He is so handsome.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He is so handsome.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He doesn't even give me a face.

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's go.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I am not happy.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I will help you to get your face back.

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's go.

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Brother, everything you taught me is done.

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay. Sit down.

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Look, this apple is really hard to peel.

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
By the way,

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
send some money back to your friends.

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's a big deal.

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Also,

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
you must take care of this fire pit.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's not easy to get this fire pit.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Come on.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Have an apple.

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Brother, you are so big.

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You never peel an apple for me.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Buxun,

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I will peel one for you.

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Brother,

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
show me some respect.

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,360
No one willOU

98
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,280
Why?

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
Duan!

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Zhang Buxun.

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What good are you to

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
help my brother

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
body and soul?

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What's your big deal?

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Brother, we're a family.

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm your sister.

108
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
She's an outsider.

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't know what she's up to.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why do you always talk back to her?

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

120
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I can act as a hostess from now on.

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He is not a very big fan of me.

128
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm not a big fan of you.

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's okay.

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The pilot's gun is here.

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Where's it?

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I've ordered a ticket.

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The rest of us go.

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Sir,

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Can you wait here?

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Sorry, sorry.

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What is this?

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Is this a book or a document?

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,320
I really don't understand.

140
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,600
What are you two doing together?

141
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,120
If you don't understand, that's right.

142
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,720
It proves that our relationship is not wrong.

143
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,560
Here.

144
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,840
You two...

145
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,960
You are family. I said we love each other.

146
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,680
My sister is like this.

147
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,200
Don't be mad.

148
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Here.

149
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,080
Rong Changren is a man.

150
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,240
He is a man of faith.

151
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,840
Although I understand Mr. Sun's intention to push Yuan Mo,

152
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,600
I don't agree with his idea.

153
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,720
Yuan Mo is indeed powerful and powerful.

154
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,800
But his idea is still different from the old man.

155
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't know how long it will last.

156
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,800
I don't know what to think.

157
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,240
Mr. Sun, the internship at the top and the wrong hasn't yet finished.

158
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,600
It's a pity that we lack force and laugh,

159
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,520
and Zhu Qiang at the disposal of comprehensive scientific and cultural figures.

160
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,000
National forces are important.

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,440
What he is trying to say is..

162
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,680
He is taking a responsibility.

163
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,440
If you go to Northern P や God is not fair.

164
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,540
Not it's better than what he isvorng it.

165
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Brother, I've already asked about that matter.

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
After two days of work, I'll be in the capital.

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay.

168
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Do you think we have a few points to make sure?

169
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No matter how many points,

170
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
now is the best chance for us.

171
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes.

172
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll be there.

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yes.

174
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Ready.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Fire!

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Fire!

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The End

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What are you doing here? Who asked you to come?

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What's wrong with me?

180
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Can't I come and see?

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Besides, I've already known about your relationship with Brother.

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Don't worry. I won't tell my father.

183
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
If my brother is trying to live a life,

184
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and wants to conquer his own world, I understand.

185
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But you?

186
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're a loser, who's got the nerve to fight and kill.

187
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Are you crazy?

188
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm done with the conversation.

189
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You're done?

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yes.

191
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You're really a fool.

192
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I've said a lot of things, but you've already said a lot.

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Are you unhappy?

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
No.

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Then smile at me.

196
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Smile?

197
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Smile.

198
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Smile.

199
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Not necessarily happy.

200
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Not smiling.

201
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Not necessarily sad.

202
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So, the inner heart of the woodhead face

203
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
is not necessarily a woodhead, right?

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Right? Right? Right?

205
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You're still not smiling?

206
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You went to the bandits with Brother this time.

207
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You've done a great job.

208
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Those soldiers from Fulu and Zhao'an,

209
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
they have guns and pills.

210
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
They're considered the right army, right?

211
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
If they have guns and pills,

212
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
they're not necessarily the right army.

213
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What else?

214
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
There's a strategy plan.

215
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We have to train our system

216
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
to train our system more strictly than the right army.

217
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
We're not only the bandits,

218
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
but also the traitors, the rebels, and the military.

219
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There are many things we have to do.

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'll go with you.

221
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll go with you.

222
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes, sir.

223
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
One, two, three.

224
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Two, three.

225
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Four, five.

226
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Four, five.

227
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Five, six, seven, eight.

228
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Come on.

229
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Zhao'an.

230
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Take the gun.

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yes.

232
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Raise it.

233
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Ji He.

234
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We all left the country

235
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
to fight for our nation's prosperity.

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Brothers, thank you.

237
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Thank you.

238
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Thank you.

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Thank you.

240
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Thank you.

241
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Thank you.

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Thank you.

243
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Fire.

244
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Fire.

245
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Fire.

246
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Fire.

247
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Fire.

248
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Fire.

249
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Fire.

250
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Fire.

251
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Fire.

252
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Fire.

253
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Fire.

254
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Fire.

255
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Fire.

256
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Fire.

257
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Fire.

258
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Fire.

259
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Fire.

260
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Fire.

261
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Fire.

262
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Fire.

263
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Fire.

264
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Fire.

265
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Fire.

266
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Fire.

267
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Fire.

268
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I didn't expect

269
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
someone would do something

270
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
against the old man

271
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
at the party in the hall.

272
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Commander, what should we do now?

273
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Does it have anything to do with the previous map?

274
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But we're not going to

275
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
close the door over there.

276
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Fine.

277
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Who are you?

278
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Do you know who I am?

279
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I know.

280
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You're Cai Heng Yuan's son.

281
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The commander of the former West branch.

282
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You sold the map to the South.

283
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You and your father were the same.

284
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You're Cai Wen Yuan.

285
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's you.

286
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Where's the map?

287
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Don't you dare!

288
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You can still put on

289
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
a few pants.

290
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
If you want to live,

291
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
don't put so much money

292
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
on it.

293
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The warehouse is on the 47th.

294
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That's just a part.

295
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Where are the others?

296
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
They're...

297
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
They're at the underground church in my house.

298
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
No.

299
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
No.

300
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Brother.

301
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
No.

302
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I know you're upset.

303
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But we're in revolution.

304
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Revolution is about bloodshed

305
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
and sacrifice.

306
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I know there are many old people

307
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
who are rich.

308
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But you can't choose.

309
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You can't let this

310
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
get in the way

311
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
once it's been approved.

312
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What should we do

313
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
with the brothers in the army?

314
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
No.

315
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Brother.

316
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I have something to tell you.

317
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I have a friend in Lu Jun Shou.

318
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
He always wanted me to help him.

319
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But I thought

320
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
the timing wasn't good enough.

321
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
But now I know

322
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
he's not a good friend.

323
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm sure he's not.

324
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But I know

325
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
he's not a good friend.

326
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm sure he's not.

327
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
He's not mature enough.

328
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But now I...

329
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You want to be a official?

330
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There's a good saying

331
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
in the official's mind.

332
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
We can do more

333
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
and get more people together.

334
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You know you want to be a official.

335
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You only need to pay.

336
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So I need this Yan Tu.

337
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But we don't know

338
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
the origin of that Yan Tu.

339
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
How can we do it?

340
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Do something for the country.

341
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Make happiness happen.

342
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You must know�

343
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
how precious you are.

344
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's impossible not to be smart.

345
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
We just

346
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
cover our heads

347
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
by這 baby灣."

348
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But

349
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,900
the limited 있는데

350
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
get out of control.

351
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,360
We are

352
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,700
faced with

353
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,700
and the one who has the face to do it.

354
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,700
We...

355
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,700
I mean we...

356
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,700
can teach them

357
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,700
what is the right thing to do.

358
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,700
How is it? I didn't lie to you.

359
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
We are the winners.

360
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
We are the winners.

361
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
Hu Xun, our dream

362
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,700
has been achieved.

363
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,700
We should say

364
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,700
we have a stronger dream.

365
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,700
Yes, and we will get closer.

366
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,700
The dog's family is dead.

367
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,700
The Qiyun Huo family is dead.

368
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,700
The Great Marshal has married the country.

369
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,700
I will give him a hand.

370
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,700
Yes.

371
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,700
Some of them are not clear.

372
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,700
But most of them are not important.

373
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,700
If you need any help,

374
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,700
you can call me

375
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,700
if you need anything.

376
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,700
And...

377
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
Miwu Village?

378
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,700
The gold medal is from Miwu Village.

379
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,700
The Marshal is very excited.

380
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,700
So he will go to Miwu Village

381
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,700
and see what happens.

382
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,700
Go, go, go.

383
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,700
Hurry up.

384
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,700
Hurry up.

385
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,700
Why are you going?

386
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,700
Go, go.

387
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,700
Go, go, go.

388
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,700
Hurry up.

389
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,700
Go, go.

390
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,700
Master, I don't know what you want.

391
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,700
I heard

392
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,700
that

393
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,700
someone in your village

394
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,700
dug a grave.

395
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,700
No, I didn't.

396
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,700
I just want to know

397
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,700
what you want.

398
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,700
I don't want to know.

399
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,700
I don't want to know.

400
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,700
I don't want to know.

401
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,700
I don't want to know.

402
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,700
I don't want to know.

403
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,700
No, I'm lying.

404
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,700
It's all rumors.

405
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,700
Master.

406
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,700
Brothers, there's a knife here.

407
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Go.

408
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,700
Master.

409
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,700
Master, there's no knife.

410
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,700
No, there's no knife.

411
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,700
Master.

412
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,700
Master.

413
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,700
Master.

414
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,700
Master.

415
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Master.

416
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,700
Master.

417
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,700
I heard that

418
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,700
someone in your village

419
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,700
dug a grave.

420
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,700
Yes, I did.

421
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
In this grave,

422
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,700
there's a treasure

423
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,700
that can be kept forever.

424
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,700
I mean,

425
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
the person in your village

426
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
dug a treasure

427
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,700
that can be kept forever.

428
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,700
No.

429
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
I don't know.

430
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,700
You don't know?

431
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,700
Master.

432
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
I really don't know.

433
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Did you dig this

434
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
from the grave?

435
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,700
Yes.

436
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,700
Look.

437
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,700
What's written on it?

438
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,700
Master.

439
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,700
I don't know.

440
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,700
You don't know?

441
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,700
Is there anyone in your village who knows?

442
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
Our village head

443
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,700
has been dead for more than a year.

444
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,700
He's been killed by the Bai family.

445
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,700
You don't know?

446
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,700
Then did you tell anyone

447
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,700
about this grave?

448
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,700
No.

449
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,700
No?

450
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,700
Really?

451
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,700
You...

452
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,540
They're all fools!

453
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,220
Get out of my way.

454
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,180
Now it's safe.

455
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,980
Any information?

456
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,220
Why did you kill them?

457
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,860
They're useless.

458
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,860
Did you find anything?

459
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,700
You don't need to kill more people on the battlefield.

460
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,700
But there's no need to kill more people.

461
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,700
Kill more people?

462
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,700
Brother.

463
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,700
How did you become like this?

464
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,700
You said you wanted to change China.

465
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,700
You wanted to save the people who suffered the pain.

466
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,700
But what are you doing now?

467
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,700
You're trying to kill the people.

468
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,700
You've been working hard to save the people.

469
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,700
You're trying to save the people.

470
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,700
You're trying to save the people.

471
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,700
You're trying to save the people.

472
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,700
This is not sacrifice.

473
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,700
This is a slaughter.

474
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,700
We are the people who have the power.

475
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,700
We don't need to care about the death of a few ants.

476
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Brother.

477
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,700
Are we ants too?

478
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,700
No.

479
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,700
I'm not.

480
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,700
I've never been.

481
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,700
What is that China in your heart?

482
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,700
China.

483
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,700
Fu Xun.

484
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,700
Don't think about these useless things.

485
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,700
Finish the task I gave you.

486
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,700
You will help me, right?

487
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,700
I'll go.

488
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,700
Miss.

489
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,700
Slow down.

490
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,700
Wait.

491
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,700
Okay.

492
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,700
Slow down.

493
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,700
Come.

494
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,700
Come.

495
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,700
Please.

496
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,700
Slow down.

497
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,700
Slow down.

498
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,700
Slow down.

499
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,700
This way.

500
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,700
Please.

501
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,700
Take it.

502
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,700
Take this.

503
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,700
That starfish said

504
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,700
that the Wang Zang Hai was here

505
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,700
and found the secret of the longevity tree.

506
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,700
You all listen to me.

507
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,700
Even if it's the third time,

508
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,700
you have to find it out for me.

509
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,700
Those old rumors

510
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
have wasted our time.

511
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,700
Since it's a rumor,

512
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,700
it's possible that it's true.

513
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,700
Then it's possible that it's true.

514
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,700
Qin Shi Huang

515
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,700
agreed to rule the world.

516
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,700
He gave the throne and the throne.

517
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,700
No one can deny it.

518
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,700
But in the end,

519
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,700
he lost his life and lived a long life.

520
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,700
He just left his life.

521
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,700
Brother,

522
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,700
we can't fight.

523
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,700
Don't think about those useless things.

524
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,700
If we can live a long life,

525
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,700
the Wang Zang Hai would have been long-lived.

526
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,700
How do you know that he's not long-lived?

527
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,700
A long-lived person

528
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,700
will stay in the original place.

529
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,700
He will leave his life

530
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,700
under the skin of his eyes.

531
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,700
But I've been looking for it for so long.

532
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,700
I've never found it.

533
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,700
Only good things

534
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
won't be found by anyone.

535
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,700
The better the things are,

536
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,700
the more deep they are.

537
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,700
There must be

538
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,700
the Wang Zang Hai's long-lived tree.

539
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,700
Fu Qian,

540
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,700
think about it.

541
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,700
If we can live a long life,

542
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,700
can we not

543
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,700
realize our wishes?

544
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,700
Brother,

545
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,700
if you want to be the president,

546
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,700
I can help you.

547
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,700
You are the general.

548
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,700
You are the general.

549
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,700
With you here,

550
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,700
I can always be at ease.

551
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,700
Brother,

552
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,700
can you say something for me?

553
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,700
All right.

554
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Don't worry.

555
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,700
We won't be here

556
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,700
to talk nonsense.

557
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,700
Brother,

558
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,700
but we go to

559
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,700
those useless things every day.

560
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,700
It's meaningless.

561
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,700
Don't you want to help me?

562
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,700
We should have saved the people.

563
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,700
Have you forgotten

564
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,700
our ideal?

565
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,700
Why did you forget

566
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,700
our ideal?

567
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,700
We won't be

568
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,700
prepared

569
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,700
to pursue our long life.

570
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Brother.

571
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,700
We have saved the people

572
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,700
under the control of the government.

573
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,700
Think about it.

574
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,700
If one day

575
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,700
we die,

576
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,700
who will come to save the people?

577
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,700
Who will come

578
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,700
to realize our ideal?

579
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,700
Brother,

580
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,700
can you

581
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,700
take care

582
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,700
of those villagers?

583
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,700
You can do it.

584
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,700
Brother.

585
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,700
Brother.

586
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,700
Shisi.

587
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,700
Shizuo,

588
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,700
there's another layer underneath.

589
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,700
I found a mechanism

590
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,700
that's double-layered.

591
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,700
Shizuo,

592
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,700
the layer on this layer

593
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,700
is completely different from the layer on the top.

594
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,700
The layer on the top

595
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,700
should be just a funeral.

596
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,700
This layer

597
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,700
is the mastermind.

598
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,700
We can

599
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,700
find something

600
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,700
that the Chief wants this time.

601
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,700
Didn't the Chief say

602
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,700
that as long as we try this time,

603
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,700
we should never

604
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,700
be so stubborn again.

605
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,700
Enough.

606
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,700
Don't tell the Chief first.

607
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,700
Tell him after we find it.

608
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,700
Let the brothers

609
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,700
put the layer on the top first.

610
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,700
Go.

611
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,700
Yes.

612
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,700
I'm so scared.

613
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,700
Shizuo,

614
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,700
it's really hot.

615
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,700
Look.

616
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,700
Look.

617
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,700
What's this?

618
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,700
Don't touch me.

619
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,700
Be careful.

620
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,700
Look over there.

621
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,700
Don't move.

622
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,700
What's going on?

623
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
What's going on?

624
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,700
What's going on?

625
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,700
Don't touch me.

626
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,700
Don't touch me.

627
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,700
Shizuo.

628
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,700
Don't touch me.

629
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,700
Don't touch me.

630
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,700
Don't touch me.

631
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,700
You should be careful.

632
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,700
Don't look.

633
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,700
Stop it.

634
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,540
Stop.

635
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,700
This is so good.

636
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,700
One more.

637
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,700
This is so good.

638
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,700
This is so good.

639
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,700
Let's take one.

640
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,700
Xiao Fang.

641
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,700
Shou Su!

642
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,700
Don't come any closer!

643
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,700
What's wrong with them?

644
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,700
They've already been poisoned.

645
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,700
Tell the brothers to bring the guy to cure me.

646
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,700
Go!

647
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,700
Take care of yourself!

648
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,700
Hurry! Be careful!

649
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,700
I'm going to kill you!

650
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,700
Xiao Fang.

651
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,700
Xiao Fang.

652
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,700
Shou Su!

653
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,700
What's wrong with them?

654
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,700
What's wrong?

655
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,700
What's wrong?

656
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,700
Shou Su!

657
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,700
What's wrong?

658
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,700
Be careful.

659
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,700
Shou Su!

660
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,700
Shou Su!

661
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,700
You brought a person with you.

662
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,700
You came back and said you didn't find him.

663
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,700
I've found him.

664
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,700
I didn't find him.

665
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,700
Where will he go?

666
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,700
I don't know.

667
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,700
I went up to get some guns.

668
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:01,700
I've lost my job and those monsters.

669
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,700
I've lost my job and those monsters.

670
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,700
How can you leave him there alone?

671
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,700
Are you hiding it from me?

672
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,700
Or are you asking him to find that thing?

673
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,700
Dachuan!

674
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,700
I've lost my job and those monsters!

675
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,700
How can I lose them?

676
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,700
I'm telling you.

677
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:56,700
If I knew that he'd take those things out,

678
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,700
you two,

679
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,700
I'm telling you, everyone

680
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,700
can't live without them.

681
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,700
I'm telling you.

682
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,700
Dachuan!

683
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,700
Shizu!

684
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,700
Are you okay?

685
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,700
Dachuan!

686
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,700
Let's go.

687
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,700
Brother.

688
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,700
You scared me.

689
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,700
Where have you been?

690
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,700
What happened?

691
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,700
We found the main tomb.

692
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,700
All the brothers had a hallucination.

693
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,700
They saw many trees and filled the fruit layer.

694
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,700
But they ate it.

695
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,700
They were actually the thousands of years of dead bodies in the coffin.

696
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,700
That's a lie.

697
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,700
Brother.

698
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,700
I almost died.

699
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,700
Why should I lie to you?

700
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,700
You're standing in front of me, aren't you?

701
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,700
Doucheng said that he'd found you in the underground court.

702
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,700
Where did you hide it?

703
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,700
I really don't remember anything.

704
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:57,700
I only remember that I came to you when I woke up.

705
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,700
I'm sorry.

706
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:21,700
Buxin, this longevity tree is a good thing.

707
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:26,700
Anyone who sees it will not be able to eat it.

708
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,700
Brother.

709
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,700
Brother.

710
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,700
Brother.

711
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,700
Brother.

712
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,700
Brother.
