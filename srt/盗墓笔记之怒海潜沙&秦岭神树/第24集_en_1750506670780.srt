00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,080
Film Festival

2
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,800
Volunteers

3
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Go away.

4
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Go away.

5
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
God!

6
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Go away.

7
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Go away.

8
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Go away.

9
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Go away.

10
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
God!

11
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
God!

12
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
God!

13
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Wu Xie! Wu Xie!

14
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Come here.

15
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Come here.

16
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You can see clearly.

17
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It seems that there is no one here.

18
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't know what is it.

19
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Come here.

20
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You!

21
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Go away.

22
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It seems that there is a table in it.

23
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It looks like stone.

24
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Come here.

25
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Go away.

26
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
There always becomes a θ-icano

27
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:19,340
is over place Fang

28
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,600
Fang, Fang, Fang.

29
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll do whatever I can for them

30
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,580
Master, look it is here

31
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,580
We have to find a person to go down the path first.

32
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,580
I'll go down first.

33
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,580
This system is quite complicated.

34
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,580
It's even more complicated than those things that are used in the Earth.

35
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,580
Besides, I don't know if these bronze trees are empty.

36
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,580
If we take a look, it will be very dangerous.

37
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,580
You're right.

38
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,580
So we can't go in at the same time.

39
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,580
We have to go down the path first.

40
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,580
Boss Wang, are you normal now?

41
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,580
This hole is too short for me.

42
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,580
You're thin, so you go down first.

43
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,580
I'll give you a call. Don't worry.

44
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,580
I won't be in trouble.

45
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,580
I know.

46
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,580
I mean, don't you think it's weird just now?

47
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,580
Why are we both in such a hurry?

48
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,580
What do you mean?

49
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,580
Look, you asked me to go down the path for you.

50
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,580
But you took some of the lead yourself.

51
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,580
Is that normal?

52
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,580
What do you mean?

53
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,580
I don't mean anything.

54
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,580
Then don't be so serious.

55
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,580
Hurry up and go down.

56
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,580
Don't waste time.

57
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,580
Okay.

58
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,580
I won't tell you the truth.

59
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,580
Since you asked me to go and kill you,

60
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,580
I have nothing to do with it.

61
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,580
If I die inside, you won't believe me either.

62
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,580
Hold this.

63
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,580
The power.

64
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,580
Wait.

65
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,580
If you're deep inside,

66
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,580
use this to talk.

67
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,580
The channels are ready.

68
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,580
Guys, I'll wait for you.

69
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,580
Hey, guys, are you blind?

70
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,580
What's going on?

71
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,580
I'm on the road.

72
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,580
There are two channels.

73
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,580
Two channels?

74
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,580
Yes.

75
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,580
There's a name and a password.

76
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,580
Two channels.

77
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,580
Which one should I go?

78
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,580
How would I know?

79
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,580
I've never been blind.

80
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,580
Hey, which way are you going?

81
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,580
Hey, hey, hey.

82
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,580
Hey.

83
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,580
Wait.

84
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,580
Wait.

85
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,580
Hey, guys.

86
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,580
Talk.

87
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,880
Quiet!

88
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,340
Sorry, welcome!

89
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
You?

90
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,760
Yes.

91
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,100
Stand still!

92
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,600
Why you help me?

93
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,600
It's all so complicated now.

94
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,180
Be careful.

95
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,220
Done!

96
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,080
ahahaha

97
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,000
Before that, she V那麼遠,

98
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,480
I never saw her.

99
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,760
Very beautiful...

100
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
very good....

101
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,000
Episode 11

102
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
I came out of the hole.

103
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
I saw a bridge and a valley.

104
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
Hey, there were two holes just now.

105
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Which side are you going?

106
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
The dark side.

107
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
Okay, you just stand there and don't move.

108
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,080
Wait for me to come over.

109
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,080
Little brother, I told you to stand there and don't move.

110
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
Why did you come over first?

111
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,080
There is no way that way.

112
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,080
Benchman.

113
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,080
So this is it, sir.

114
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,080
You?

115
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,720
Boss Wang.

116
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
What's wrong, Mr. Wang?

117
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Mr. Wang!

118
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Mr. Wang!

119
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,720
Mr. Wang!

120
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
It's okay!

121
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
Mr. Wang!

122
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
Mr. Wang, wake up!

123
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
Look, it's all a illusion!

124
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
Mr. Wang!

125
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Mr. Wang!

126
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Where am I?

127
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
What's going on?

128
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
What's going on?

129
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
You didn't see me?

130
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
All my friends

131
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
are looking down at me.

132
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
So what?

133
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
If there's no accident,

134
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
I'll kill you

135
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
and you'll be dead.

136
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
I'll kill you!

137
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
I'll kill you!

138
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
I'll kill you!

139
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
I'll kill you!

140
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
I'll kill you!

141
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
This is where we're going.

142
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
What do you mean?

143
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,720
We'll know after we've checked.

144
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
We're on the line.

145
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Don't touch it!

146
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Remember!

147
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Let's make sure

148
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
Don't touch it.

149
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Okay.

150
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,560
Be careful.

151
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Don't touch it.

152
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,440
No more!

153
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,560
Charters don't look good.

154
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,360
Poor guy.

155
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,000
Is he drunk?

156
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,200
What's wrong, little brother?

157
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,400
Is there any mechanism left?

158
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Just push it directly, okay?

159
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,200
You're not talking, right?

160
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,000
If you're not talking, don't blame me.

161
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,920
Hold this.

162
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,360
What's going on?

163
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,400
It can't dangerous to get to hear a passing words...

164
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,200
Can someone displace your passion?

165
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:33,460
Our

166
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,460
You're making a fuss again?

167
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,460
Don't tease me.

168
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,460
Where are you going?

169
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,460
Brother, you're the only one.

170
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,460
Fatty is with you.

171
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,460
Yes, we're together.

172
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,460
Why are you with Fatty?

173
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,460
I'm talking to you.

174
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,460
Fatty, come here.

175
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,460
What's wrong with you?

176
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,460
Put your hands up here.

177
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,460
Did you see it?

178
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,460
Brother, why can't I see Fatty?

179
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,460
What should I see?

180
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,460
Tianzhen?

181
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,460
Tianzhen!

182
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,460
Tianzhen!

183
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,460
Can you see him?

184
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,460
Can you talk to him?

185
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,460
Don't forget.

186
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,460
Don't tell him about Ning.

187
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,460
Or else his wife will be sad.

188
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:39,460
Brother, have you heard a strange sound?

189
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,460
Every time I hear this sound, I hear it.

190
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,460
And it's very far.

191
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,460
Have you heard this sound?

192
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,460
No.

193
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,460
We don't have this sound.

194
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,460
Wu Xie, what's wrong with you?

195
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,460
I'm in a difficult situation.

196
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,460
I can tell you something.

197
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,460
After Zhe Luo Gui and I were separated,

198
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,460
I met my friend.

199
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,460
His name is Lao Yang.

200
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,460
He came here with his wife three years ago.

201
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,460
Then we met a group of group of patrolmen.

202
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,460
The people I followed when I was in Mount Jin.

203
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,460
Something happened in the middle.

204
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,460
Only me, Lao Yang and a man named Liang Shiye

205
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,460
came here.

206
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,460
We three climbed together.

207
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,460
We met a group of group of patrolmen.

208
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,460
This is Ning who saved us.

209
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,460
Ning didn't die.

210
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,460
That's good.

211
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,460
After we separated the group of patrolmen,

212
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,460
Ning was injured.

213
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,460
Liang Shiye and Wang Laoban were together.

214
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,460
He threatened me to help them.

215
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,460
I'm on the way to Wang Laoban.

216
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,460
We found a light source.

217
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,460
We went down to look for it.

218
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,460
I don't know what happened just now.

219
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,460
I saw some vibration.

220
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,460
I ran into the light source.

221
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,460
So I met you.

222
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,460
What about Wang Laoban?

223
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,460
What's Wang Laoban?

224
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,460
Wang Laoban?

225
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,460
He found a light source.

226
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,460
But I can't see what it is.

227
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,460
Brother, I can see a light source.

228
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,460
It means we're not far away.

229
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,460
Don't worry.

230
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,460
I'll find a way to meet you.

231
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,460
You have to be careful.

232
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,460
As long as you and Fatty are safe,

233
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,460
I'm relieved.

234
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,460
Take a deep breath.

235
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,460
Finally, we found it.

236
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,460
I...

237
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,460
It should be here.

238
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,460
Hey, guys!

239
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,460
Come down!

240
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,460
We're here!

241
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,460
What did you find?

242
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,460
A target!

243
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,460
Come down!

244
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,460
Hurry up!

245
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,460
Brother,

246
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,460
I'm going down.

247
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,460
Be careful.

248
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,460
Tell him that Fatty will be here soon.

249
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,460
Fatty is not worried about him.

250
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,460
You? Tell him!

251
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,460
What did he say?

252
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,460
Tell me, don't be a fool.

253
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,460
Tianzhen!

254
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,460
Tianzhen!

255
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,460
Tianzhen!

256
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,460
Wu Xie?

257
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,460
Wu Xie!

258
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,460
You look so sad, my little girl.

259
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,460
Wu Xie!

260
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,460
Father?

261
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,460
Where is Wu Xie?

262
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,460
He was pushed down.

263
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,860
Have you brought me home?

264
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:13,860
Oh!

265
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,700
But there is no one else gone?

266
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:18,980
Yes.

267
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,740
Lin,

268
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,700
Are you in danger of death?

269
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,660
I have my way, dad.

270
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,860
You spared my life.

271
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,380
It's like a tailKEa

272
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,740
And complete ourselves

273
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,860
And lighten the way

274
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,580
Which may have been hidden

275
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,580
Will never ever old us

276
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,860
The de primer to cross the大家

277
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,300
We'll dunno

278
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,340
Will faceiry

279
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,380
This is exactly what we'll do

280
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,880
You, if you miss me

281
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,300
No

282
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,300
I will never let that happen again.

283
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:13,300
Although I'm a king, I'm not afraid of him.

284
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:21,300
From your childhood, I've been taking care of you.

285
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:28,300
I've seen you grow up with such a weak little thing.

286
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,300
But you've already come to me.

287
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:39,300
I'm worried if I'm not here, will you continue to fulfill your mission?

288
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,300
Who are you?

289
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,300
Who do you want me to be?

290
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,300
I'm a king.

291
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:24,300
My little girl, your mission is complete.

292
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,300
The End

293
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,300
Come on, come down. It's safe down there.

294
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,300
This is what you're looking for.

295
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,300
It seems to be a tiger.

296
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,300
You're a fool. What tiger? This is a corpse.

297
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,300
What's in this corpse?

298
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,300
It's worth your hard work to find it.

299
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:18,300
Is it the tomb of the social group?

300
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
It's inside.

301
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,300
This world can't be seen clearly through the eyes and the hands.

302
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,300
Except for the equipment with X light.

303
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,300
Fine, it's fine.

304
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,300
This place is so strange.

305
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,300
It's not a face-to-face.

306
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,300
It's two places.

307
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,300
But you can talk to her through video and voice.

308
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,300
And only you can.

309
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,300
I can't do it.

310
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,300
Why do you say that?

311
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:18,300
The End

312
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,300
The corpse is so well preserved.

313
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,300
I've seen a well preserved story before.

314
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,300
It's because of the prescription and the medicine.

315
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,300
It's also rotten.

316
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,300
And it's wrinkled.

317
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,300
The whole Zhu Bajie is in a coma.

318
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,300
Look at this.

319
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,300
It's not more than two hours.

320
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,300
Do you believe it?

321
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,300
I've seen it.

322
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,300
Who?

323
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:48,300
That road is a military team.

324
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,300
The cause is not a crime.

325
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,300
The end

326
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,300
Little brother, do you know how the corpse was made?

327
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,300
It's written in ancient books.

328
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,300
The corpse was used to make the shadow of the corpse.

329
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:33,300
It was to make the unmoved pregnant woman die in the medicine.

330
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,300
And then buried in the river.

331
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,300
When it was dug out in 17 years,

332
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,300
the baby in the stomach became the corpse.

333
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,300
The outside is the material of the unmoved pregnant woman's real life.

334
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,300
The tiger's color you see is actually made of the water.

335
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,300
I've heard about the corpse.

336
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,300
In the early years, someone found it in the village.

337
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,300
But it's like a man.

338
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,300
It's like a rock, like a tiger.

339
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,300
But it's not a baby.

340
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,300
It's a little animal.

341
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,300
It took me so long to find it.

342
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,300
It's really the first time I've seen it.

343
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,300
Qin Shi Huang killed a clean man.

344
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,300
No one knows what kind of technique it is.

345
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
But there's another saying.

346
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,300
It's just a technique to prevent the corpse from being rotten.

347
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,300
Use special mixed-medium-dry material to wrap the corpse.

348
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,300
This way, the house won't be torn apart.

349
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,300
There were many people who escaped during the war.

350
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,300
They were willing to send the baby to the warehouse.

351
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,300
My grandfather was in Hong Kong at that time.

352
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,300
He saw many good things.

353
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,300
One of them was the tiger's broken corpse.

354
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,300
The other one was the tiger's broken corpse.

355
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,300
It was a very beautiful one.

356
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,300
It's not a baby.

357
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,300
It's a real tiger.

358
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,300
I'm sure that he's not a baby.

359
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,300
It's not a baby.

360
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,300
The baby is a tiger.

361
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,300
It's a tiger.

362
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
It's a tiger.

363
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,300
It's a tiger.

364
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,300
It's a tiger.

365
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,300
It's a tiger.

366
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,300
It's a tiger.

367
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,300
It's a tiger.

368
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,300
My thing is a baby.

369
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,300
Treating me as a baby is Mitarged in this way.

370
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,300
My anus is a fits it and betrays me.

371
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,300
As long as I'm шتопп try,

372
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,300
I'll be braver and pull impacts.

373
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,300
Every time I strike my eye on you while dying,

374
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,300
you will see that I can run away from the master.

375
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,300
Home

376
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,800
On the spectacular day of Sharon Leak's life,

377

00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
No.

409
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
There won't be any mistakes.

410
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,600

411
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,000

There won't be any mistakes.

414
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,600
Mr. Wang,

415
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,000
you're so hard-working.

416
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
You're doing this to find your senior.

417
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,200
This...

418
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
This is it.

419
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,200
As a treasured person,

420
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,000
shouldn't you be more interested in fame?

421
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,200
Besides,

422
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
this world is so big.

423
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
You can't take it away.

424
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
What fame?

425
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
As long as we find the world,

426
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,400
we can find anything we want.

427
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,600
No.

428
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,400
You liar.

429
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
There won't be any mistakes.

430
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,200
What...

431
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,000
What's going on?

432
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,800
What do you want?

433
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,960
To see how he's doing.

434
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,000
Is he dead or what?

435
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,600
What?

436
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
Something has happened.

437
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,000
Baba Yan,

438
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,800
the male corpse is now dead.

439
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,600
Do you know where it's from?

440
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,800
Who knows?

441
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,200
How else can me不錯 know?

442
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,400
But when you mention the corpse, you're just saying it.

443
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:29,400
And you use my blood to make the corpse change.

444
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Maybe, Boss Ba,

445
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,400
I should call you Lao Yang now.

446
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Hello?

447
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Hello?

448
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,400
Hello?

449
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Wu Xie!

450
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,400
Wu Xie!

451
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Father!

452
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
Lao Yang!

453
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Lao Yang!

454
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
What's wrong with you?

455
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
What's wrong with you?

456
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
What's wrong with you?

457
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Where's Lao Yang?

458
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Lao Yang?

459
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
I'm asking you where's Lao Yang?

460
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,400
This... Lao Yang...

461
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Lao Yang killed Boss Wang.

462
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,400
While you were sleeping,

463
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,400
I gave you a magic pot.

464
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Said you were taking me to the hospital.

465
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
I was so worried.

466
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
I was so worried.

467
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
Said you were taking me to the treasure.

468
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
And I was deceived by him.

469
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
Xiao... Xiao...

470
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Xiao En, is it dangerous?

471
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
I... You...

472
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,400
Don't lie to me here alone.

473
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Wait for me!

474
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Wait for me!

475
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,400
The End

476
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,400
The End

477
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,400
The End

478
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,400
The End

479
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,400
The End
