00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You know that little Yang Guo.

3
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You just need to take a look at him.

4
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You know him.

5
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
He is a great man.

6
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He is a top-class man.

7
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
When little Yang Guo was protecting the prince,

8
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
he broke a arm and a nose.

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Isn't that little Yang Guo?

10
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Of course, there is no dragon girl.

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There is no big-doll.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Little Yang Guo.

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I think he is not only good at shooting.

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Do you think he will be a good man?

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He is afraid.

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He is too much.

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Too much.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He is too much.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's over.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
They just walk away.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then they think about the tomb of the club leader.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Then they take the tomb to the tomb.

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Of course, they have nothing to do with it.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Because when the first time the club leader entered,

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
he almost killed the club leader.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
When he entered,

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
he was hurt too much.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The prince was heartbroken.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So he moved the body of the club leader

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
out of the coffin.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He put the club leader in the coffin.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Why?

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You don't know that, right?

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I tell you.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
According to their news,

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
when the club leader was making his tomb,

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
he found that there was a bronze tree.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The bronze tree can make people die.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So the club leader put the handkerchief there

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
to revive the club leader.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The prince knew that.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He put the lamb in the coffin.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But they had to leave as soon as they could.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So the lamb was put in the coffin

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
before he died.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And he left the books.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He marked the lamb and the tomb.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
They went there.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But after more than a thousand years,

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
the lamb and the general

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
have become a couple.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We are the ones who opened the coffin.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And the lamb died in the light of the revolution.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's so easy to say goodbye here.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The sun is out in the west.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The water is cold today.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
By the way,

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I checked the bronze tree.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's called Chizhu.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
In 1984,

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
there was a piece of it in the basket.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But it's not that big.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And the piece of it

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
is completely embroidered.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
There is no line of text and memory.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What is it about?

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But the old man said

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
that he said a bunch of nonsense

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and wasted a few hours.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He said that the poem

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
about the Shanshai Jin and many minorities

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
is related to the Dragon of the Dragon.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Dragon?

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Isn't that a snake?

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
When I was in the Qingtong tree,

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I saw the most exciting game

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
in the world.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The horse was running,

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
the horse was running,

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
the queen of the reward,

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
the prince of the treasure,

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
the prince of the reward,

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
the prince of the reward,

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and the prince of the Wizard of衍.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Now I will apply

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Household Masterom errand will be done.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I will not use it.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
My mom毒州

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
is fresh like this cabbage leaf.

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The one you are talking now

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
is not it?

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The one you are talking with

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
is not quite yet correct yet.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So,

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
the完.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,700
Until he mein

97
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,700
I put a hand grenade in his mouth.

98
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,700
He drew it like a candle.

99
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,700
The main alcohol.

100
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,700
You mean the main alcohol?

101
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,700
Isn't that a legend?

102
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
Yes, it is.

103
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,700
But someone investigated it.

104
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,700
He said he lived in a city in the middle of the city.

105
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,700
Because he lived in the wild in the winter.

106
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,700
So his eyes are like a fish.

107
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,700
It is said that the ancient people used him to make long lanterns.

108
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
Because his body was thick.

109
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,700
His body was like a candle.

110
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:22,700
So I met a snake that I drew like a candle in the Qingtong tree.

111
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,700
Maybe it is the main alcohol.

112
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,700
No.

113
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,700
The Qingtong tree is so big and so strong.

114
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,700
It is to catch a snake.

115
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,700
And I have a question.

116
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,700
I don't understand why I and Xiao Ge

117
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,700
met the Qingtong tree together.

118
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,700
Although we are not in the same space,

119
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,700
we can see each other.

120
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,700
We can even hear each other's voice.

121
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,700
I can't answer some questions.

122
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,700
Mrs. Huo, look.

123
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,700
How beautiful the flag you chose for Miss Xiuxue is.

124
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,700
She must like it.

125
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,700
Beautiful.

126
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,700
Right?

127
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,700
Beautiful.

128
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,700
Beautiful.

129
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,700
Beautiful.

130
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,700
Give her some attention.

131
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,700
No problem.

132
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,700
It will be better if it is suitable.

133
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,700
Don't worry.

134
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,700
Take care.

135
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,700
Grandma.

136
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,700
Grandma.

137
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,700
Grandma, look.

138
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,700
I bought clothes from the micro-cash store.

139
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
Grandma, what's wrong?

140
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,700
What's wrong?

141
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
Are you unhappy?

142
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,700
Are you playing chess?

143
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,700
Is it for me?

144
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Who else can it be?

145
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,700
I don't like playing chess.

146
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,700
You are so good at it.

147
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,700
No.

148
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,700
There is a trend in the past.

149
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,700
People rely on clothes,

150
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,700
on horses, on an anna.

151
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,700
That's how the play is.

152
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,700
You are not necessarily not suitable.

153
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,700
You are just happy.

154
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,700
But now some girls are super short.

155
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,700
They are so good at running.

156
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,700
They are so good at running.

157
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,700
But they are so long.

158
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
They are so long.

159
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,700
They are good-looking.

160
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,700
My granddaughter is good at everything.

161
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
All right.

162
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,700
I will make up for my fault.

163
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,700
I want to make a hair tie.

164
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,700
All right.

165
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,700
Thank you, Miss Xiuxue.

166
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,700
Please have a look.

167
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,700
I will make you a hair tie.

168
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,700
Yes.

169
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Make it more careful.

170
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,700
Yes.

171
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,700
It's short and long.

172
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,700
We need it.

173
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,700
Grandma, the four-leafed goat is here again.

174
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,700
The horse is in the hospital.

175
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,700
He is sick.

176
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,700
Psycho.

177
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,700
I thought he was a fool.

178
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,700
I thought he was a fool.

179
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,700
I didn't expect him to be separated from the gods.

180
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,700
Is he like Dashan's son?

181
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,700
He is separated from the gods because he met the tree of the bronze tree.

182
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,700
He has a short time of contact.

183
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,700
Besides,

184
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
Dashan's family has met the tree of the bronze tree.

185
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,700
We have met it too.

186
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,700
Why didn't he get the illness?

187
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,700
This is a human body.

188
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,700
He has always been with the bronze leader.

189
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,700
Maybe it has something to do with that.

190
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,700
Besides,

191
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,700
many people

192
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,700
have a weak spirit.

193
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,700
They are easily affected.

194
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,700
Like the sheep.

195
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,700
I think

196
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,700
the sheep must have been three years ago.

197
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
When they met the tree of the bronze tree,

198
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
they were already sick.

199
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,700
Otherwise,

200
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,700
they couldn't have thought that

201
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,700
the tree of the bronze tree could be revived by his mother.

202
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,700
What's even more strange is that

203
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
in the tree of the bronze tree,

204
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
I also had a hallucination.

205
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,700
I saw his mother.

206
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,700
It has something to do with the sausage.

207
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,700
Just like we had a hallucination in the small group.

208
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,700
I tell you, if he was here,

209
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,700
I would have killed him like Guo Ruolan.

210
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Or I would have been killed.

211
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
Really.

212
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,700
But I hope that we can have no other evidence.

213
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,700
We can only stay in the hospital in Beijing.

214
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,700
But some problems

215
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,700
are not explained by hallucinations.

216
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,700
For example, when I saw the old sheep's body in the cave,

217
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,700
there was a living sheep outside the cave.

218
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,700
I thought it was scary.

219
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
Yang Guo,

220
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,700
the people who were standing with us for more than a thousand years

221
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,700
were fighting with us.

222
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,700
After that,

223
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,700
there was another one in the coffin.

224
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,700
It was like a corpse.

225
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,700
It slowly turned into ashes.

226
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
It was so scary.

227
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,700
Maybe it's because of the problem of the charity.

228
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,700
Time and space were disturbed.

229
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,700
Brother Jiang was right.

230
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,700
Maybe

231
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,700
two parallel universe

232
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
were at the same time.

233
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,700
That's why there were two people

234
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,700
who were the same.

235
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,700
And they were in the same space.

236
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,700
Did you hear the theory of parallel universe?

237
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,700
This concept

238
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,700
comes from the uncertainty of the quantum quantum.

239
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
When scientists analyzed the quantum,

240
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,700
they found that all the substances in the universe

241
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
were made by the quantum.

242
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,700
So, the universe was not just one.

243
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
There were even more similar universes.

244
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,700
After a few years,

245
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,700
they found that the theory of parallel universe

246
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,700
has developed into eight or nine different species.

247
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,700
When I was in the Qingtong tree with Yang,

248
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,700
there were similar things.

249
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,700
Xie Zi Yang?

250
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,700
You remember?

251
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Yes.

252
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,700
So,

253
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,700
for example,

254
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,700
you've played games.

255
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,700
You choose different.

256
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
The direction of the plot is different.

257
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,700
Compared to Fatty,

258
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,700
you play another game.

259
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,700
There are two choices.

260
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,700
The A-shape is the dance of Fatty.

261
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,700
The B-shape is the fight

262
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,700
of Fatty and Xiao Ge.

263
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,700
If you choose A,

264
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,700
you will be in the hospital.

265
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,700
No way.

266
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,700
You're right.

267
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,700
The different choices

268
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,700
of the plot are different.

269
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,700
But when you choose that moment,

270
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,700
there is a parallel universe.

271
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,700
And you are in the parallel universe.

272
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,700
You are in the parallel universe.

273
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,700
We are still the two of us.

274
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,700
We are still the one who came back from the Qingtong tree.

275
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700
And when you choose that moment,

276
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,700
you will be in the parallel universe.

277
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,700
You will be in the parallel universe.

278
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,700
When you choose that moment,

279
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,700
the plot changes the space.

280
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,700
So, the two universes have a parallel universe.

281
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,700
The fat of A-shape and the fat of B-shape

282
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
are all in this room.

283
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
That is to say...

284
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
That is to say, I'm making fat.

285
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,700
The fat next to me is dancing.

286
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,700
Yes.

287
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,700
Similarly,

288
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,700
put this thing on Lao Yang's body.

289
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,700
It's still A-shape and two universes.

290
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
Lao Yang of A-shape is in the cave.

291
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,700
It's trapped in the cave.

292
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,700
And the A-shape of B-shape is not in the cave.

293
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,700
When A-shape was in a hurry,

294
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,700
maybe at that time,

295
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,700
we had unexpected changes.

296
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,700
So when B appeared in space A,

297
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,700
the time line in space A

298
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
was in the space of Lao Yang's death.

299
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,700
At the same time, Lao Yang is still alive in space B.

300
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,700
So,

301
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,700
I saw two Lao Yangs

302
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,700
who were alive at the same time.

303
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,700
Similarly,

304
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,700
we are using this theory

305
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,700
to make a small-scale process

306
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,700
in space A.

307
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,700
When we first entered the coffin,

308
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,700
you called it.

309
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,700
And the small-scale process of B-shape

310
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
has been in the coffin for a thousand years

311
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,700
and became a corpse.

312
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Although

313
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,700
I still have some common places here,

314
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,700
but this is the most possible reason

315
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,700
that I can think of.

316
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,700
Really.

317
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,700
Don't call it this.

318
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,700
We are not scientists.

319
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,700
I tell you,

320
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,700
I want to know

321
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
why A Ning is in the coffin.

322
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,700
She is really

323
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,700
a woman now.

324
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
You can't throw her away.

325
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,700
The one next to A Ning

326
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,700
is the one who introduced Lao Ma to you.

327
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,700
Yes.

328
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,700
I have nothing to do with her.

329
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,700
She introduced the buyer to me.

330
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
Now she is in the right place.

331
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,700
She is the one who made us jump in the water.

332
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,700
Is this the cause of the death?

333
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,700
Think about it.

334
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,700
What is in that coffin

335
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,700
that you have been looking for?

336
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,700
And why do you keep

337
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,700
asking Wu Xie to be your slave?

338
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,700
I am a woman now.

339
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,700
I am a woman now.

340
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,700
Who made you angry?

341
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,700
Tell me.

342
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,700
Tell me.

343
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,700
Tell me.

344
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,700
Tell me.

345
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,700
This man of the Huo family

346
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,700
looks good

347
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,700
and sweet.

348
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,700
He is a good man.

349
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,700
He has nothing else to do.

350
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,700
Actually,

351
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,700
I have a high demand for him.

352
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,700
Look at this Huo family.

353
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,700
There is a woman named Huo family.

354
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,700
She is so good.

355
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,700
But you

356
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,700
are not capable enough.

357
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,700
But you are

358
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,700
a man of faith.

359
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,700
You are so ungrateful.

360
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,700
You can't blame me for this.

361
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,700
It's all because of that Lin.

362
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Did I allow you to talk?

363
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,700
Why don't you let me talk?

364
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,700
Do you have the right to talk?

365
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,700
I didn't ask for the punishment

366
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,700
but I want to give you the best

367
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,700
for your money.

368
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,700
Honey,

369
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,700
you are so mean.

370
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,700
You are so mean.

371
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
My parents died early.

372
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
But you are a man of faith.

373
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,700
If you make a mistake,

374
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,700
you should be a man of faith.

375
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,700
It's all because of your love.

376
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,700
But you can't

377
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,700
take it seriously.

378
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,700
The court's pass-in

379
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,700
is over.

380
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,700
Tell me.

381
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,700
Didn't I tell you?

382
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
Give up that land.

383
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,700
Why did you run away?

384
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,700
You don't understand business.

385
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,700
How much we invested

386
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,700
to take that land?

387
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,700
If you give up,

388
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,700
the loss is too big.

389
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,700
Uncle,

390
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,700
do you understand the loss?

391
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,700
You don't listen to me

392
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,700
but want to cooperate with that Mr. Lin.

393
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,700
You are being bullied

394
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,700
and killed on purpose.

395
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,700
Is it not a big loss?

396
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
We were framed.

397
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,700
Didn't you ask someone

398
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,700
to take the money?

399
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Didn't you have a meeting?

400
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,700
You didn't give money to others.

401
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
Why did others help you?

402
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,700
Besides,

403
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
each of the people

404
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
who took the money

405
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
is a total of

406
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,700
a thousand thousand dollars.

407
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,700
What?

408
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,700
I don't scare him.

409
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,700
They can be quiet.

410
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,700
They don't move.

411
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,700
The building can't be closed.

412
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Do you know

413
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,700
how much money I lost?

414
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,700
That's all because of the face.

415
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,700
Everyone knows it.

416
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
You don't understand.

417
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,700
Don't scare me.

418
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,700
You lied to me that day.

419
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,700
Why did I lie to you?

420
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,700
It's just that

421
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,700
you went back to the river.

422
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,700
It's not right.

423
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
The idea you made

424
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
is to let the Huo family suffer.

425
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
Sometimes, you step back

426
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,700
and they will step in.

427
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,700
Right?

428
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,700
You step back

429
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
and they will take your land.

430
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,700
What?

431
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,700
You have to wait for the Huo family to fall.

432
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,700
Are you happy?

433
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,700
You are a liar.

434
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Don't you have a good relationship with them?

435
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,700
How can you talk?

436
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,700
I...

437
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,700
I know.

438
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,700
Go back.

439
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,700
Aunt,

440
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,700
how can you be so jealous?

441
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,700
I said I knew it.

442
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Okay, okay.

443
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,700
I'll wait for your good news.

444
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,700
I'll be in a hurry.

445
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,700
I'll be in a hurry.

446
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
The guard is the director.

447
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Forget it.

448
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Which team do you buy next?

449
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,700
Okay.

450
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,700
Mr. Huo.

451
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,700
I got it.

452
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,700
I got it.

453
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,700
You are so good at handling things.

454
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,700
You have to be careful.

455
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,700
You don't know what's going on with Mrs. Huo.

456
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,700
She is pregnant.

457
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,700
She has a grudge against her.

458
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,700
She has nothing to do with it.

459
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,700
She won't let us down.

460
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,700
You are so stupid.

461
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
I'm telling you.

462
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,700
It's hard to convince her.

463
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,700
Especially for our family.

464
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,700
Don't think that

465
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,700
she is the one who is

466
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,700
the bad guy now.

467
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,700
She is a maid after all.

468
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
She is the one who is the best.

469
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
You are so stupid.

470
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,700
I have a problem with her.

471
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,700
What you said is true.

472
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,700
The traditional street-by-catch thing

473
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,700
is about men.

474
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,700
Mrs. Huo is

475
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,700
in a coma.

476
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,700
She is lying

477
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,700
and she is so stubborn.

478
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
She is so stupid.

479
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,700
She is so stupid.

480
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,700
She is so stupid.

481
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,700
She is so stupid.

482
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,700
What's this?

483
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,700
She is a bad guy now.

484
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,700
A bad guy.

485
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
Mr. Huo.

486
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,700
Where are we going tonight?

487
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,700
Where are we going tonight?

488
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,700
We are going to get the Mags.

489
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,700
The Mags.

490
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,700
Episode 8

491
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,700
Why are you so afraid?

492
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
It was my fault.

493
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,700
It was my fault

494
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,700
I didn't deal with

495
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,780
Mr. Yue.

496
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,700
I told you earlier.

497
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,700
Everyone here

498
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,700
has to have a species.

499
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,700
You must be strong.

500
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,700
You must be very careful.

501
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,700
Because you treat her like a child.

502
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,700
Don't you often play with the crab?

503
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,700
Look at how she handles these things.

504
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,700
Brother Xiaohua...

505
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,700
What's wrong with her?

506
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,700
When she was a child,

507
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,700
she was much younger than you.

508
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,700
You see, when the crab died,

509
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,700
there was no protection for the tiger.

510
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,700
At that time, she was not afraid of the sky or the earth.

511
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,700
She could hold on to it.

512
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,700
So she gave it to her. Do you know that?

513
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,700
Grandma, I... I will try my best.

514
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,700
You are too much.

515
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,700
It's my fault.

516
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,700
I was wrong about something.

517
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,700
Grandma, don't be like this.

518
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,700
Okay, I will give you another lesson today.

519
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,700
Okay.

520
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
I'm a little hungry.

521
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,700
I'll go out and treat you to dinner.

522
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,700
Okay.

523
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,700
But I don't know where the treasure box is.

524
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
If the security guard sees it,

525
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,700
what will the police do?

526
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,700
Yes.

527
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,700
Let's go.

528
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,700
Aren't you hungry?

529
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,700
Wait a minute.

530
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,700
Brother Xiaohua.

531
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
I just don't understand

532
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
what the ball-calling is really about.

533
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,700
He lied to me and then he was silent.

534
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,700
He is now a spiritual figure.

535
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,700
You should be a personal witness.

536
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,700
He is not suspecting that you are his

537
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,700
13 years old son.

538
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,700
But it is true.

539
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,700
The most important thing is why the ball-calling is

540
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,700
and what he wants from you.

541
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,700
I don't have any value.

542
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,700
The only thing I can think of

543
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,700
is that he wants to influence my uncle through me.

544
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
But what will the ball-calling

545
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,700
have to do with my uncle?

546
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,700
It's easy to say.

547
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
But I tell you,

548
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
you should talk about it from the root.

549
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,700
Who is the ball-calling son?

550
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,700
Don't look at him as a worker.

551
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,700
He is a cultural person who is attached to his face

552
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,700
and is pretending to be a cultural person.

553
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,700
But what does he want from the root?

554
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,700
He is a cultural person.

555
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,700
What does he want from the cultural person?

556
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,700
He is a cultural person.

557
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,700
What about your uncle?

558
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,700
He is a real man.

559
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
He is a real man.

560
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,700
No, he is a stinky man.

561
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,700
He is a dirty man.

562
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,700
He is a dirty man.

563
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,700
You forgot?

564
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,700
When you were abroad,

565
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,700
you saw them.

566
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,700
You gave your uncle a handbag.

567
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,700
You gave your uncle a handbag to the auctioneer.

568
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,700
Who did they give the handbag to?

569
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,700
They are trading.

570
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,700
I think this is the relationship between the client and the supplier.

571
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,700
Maybe Qiu Tengka wants to get the goods from my uncle.

572
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,700
After he gets the goods,

573
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,700
he can take the bridge and abandon my uncle.

574
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,700
He won't abandon my uncle.

575
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,700
They don't want to break the fish.

576
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,700
So he will leave you.

577
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,700
He will drag you down.

578
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,700
You can't be a coward.

579
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,700
You can't ask him.

580
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
You are so curious.

581
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,700
You should study with your uncle.

582
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,700
You will know the source.

583
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,700
After you know the source,

584
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,700
you don't look like your uncle.

585
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,700
You should find a beautiful woman.

586
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,700
You will be in trouble.

587
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,700
I tell you,

588
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,700
you have a grudge.

589
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,700
Yes, you have.

590
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,700
But what is it now?

591
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,700
You are a dirty man.

592
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,700
You can't solve the problems with money.

593
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,700
You can't solve the race.

594
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,700
You can't solve the double race.

595
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,700
Understand?

596
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,700
Really, you have a great uncle.

597
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,700
Don't think that your uncle is a coward.

598
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,700
If you are really innocent and innocent,

599
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,700
it will be a year for him.

600
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,700
People will be angry at you.

601
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,700
You know what?

602
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,700
Besides,

603
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
I don't want to see your uncle.

604
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,700
I don't want to see your uncle.

605
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,700
I will not be angry with him.

606
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,700
Besides, is there any other analysis?

607
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,700
I have a good feeling about that.

608
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,700
Maybe you are the target of Qiu DeKao.

609
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,700
Not your uncle.

610
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,700
But what value do I have?

611
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,700
Maybe you don't even know.

612
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,700
The situation of Qiu DeKao is getting worse and worse.

613
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
Look, the sea top is so bold.

614
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,700
Let An Ning contact you directly.

615
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,700
Outside, it is a short-term cooperation between fake netizens to frame you.

616
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,700
And this time, this time it is more obvious.

617
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,700
I don't know what customer is under it, let you jump in.

618
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,700
I have thought it over.

619
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,700
We can't be so passive.

620
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,700
No matter what the goal of Qiu DeKao is, we must find the main power.

621
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,700
Take off your beard, bow down to your face, show your hands.

622
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,700
The shooting game?

623
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,700
I'm back.

624
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
They are gone.

625
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,700
They didn't eat.

626
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,700
Boss, let's fight.

627
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,700
Come on.

628
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
Wait.

629
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,700
I'm back.

630
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,700
I'm back.

631
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,700
I'm back.

632
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,700
I'm back.

633
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,700
I'm back.

634
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,700
I'm back.

635
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,700
I'm back.

636
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
I'm back.

637
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,700
I'm back.

638
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,700
I'm back.

639
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,700
I'm back.

640
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,700
I'm back.

641
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,700
I'm back.

642
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,700
I'm back.

643
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,700
I'm back.

644
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,700
I'm back.

645
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,700
I'm back.

646
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,700
I'm back.

647
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,700
I'm back.

648
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,700
I'm back.

649
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,700
I'm back.

650
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,700
I'm back.

651
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,700
I've been playing the role of the band for 60 or 70 years.

652
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,700
Now, the band is a family.

653
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,700
Grandfather and grandmother are good singers.

654
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,700
They are young and they like to listen to the plays.

655
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,700
Go to the Internet, TTV.

656
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,700
I don't think you can hold on to it.

657
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,700
Wait for me!

658
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,700
Okay, go!

659
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,700
The Internet

660
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,700
Although it's not long-term, it's still a bit of a hassle.

661
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:41,700
It's a shame that the poor people are still holding on to the Kunche.

662
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,700
When they are done, they will contact them.

663
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:52,700
Tell them that as long as they hold on to it, we will get to the bottom.

664
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,700
Okay.

665
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,700
Then, the small Yuzhu troupe in the village, do you want to go there?

666
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,700
The project team just hired a few graduate students from the theater.

667
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,700
Let them go.

668
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,700
Stop them.

669
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,700
Don't just sit there.

670
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,700
Okay.

671
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,700
The other two guys in the kitchen have found them.

672
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,700
How do we get out of here?

673
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,700
Bring them back.

674
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,700
I heard that Zhai Xing wants to find them.

675
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,700
I'll go with him.

676
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,700
I'll go with him.

677
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
Okay.

678
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,700
My job is to take you to see Huayin.

679
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,700
Please cooperate with me.

680
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,700
Don't let me...

681
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,700
Go find your uncle.

682
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,700
Go.

683
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,700
I can't get a call.

684
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,700
I can't find anyone.

685
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,700
I tell you, I don't want to see you, okay?

686
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,700
Tianzhen, you can think about it.

687
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,700
Your uncle is better than the other guys.

688
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,700
He's got the talent.

689
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,700
If the other guys are missing, they will not be able to climb.

690
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,700
You can think about it.

691
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,700
Hello, Mr. San.

692
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,700
Hello, Pan Zi.

693
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,700
It's me.

694
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,700
It's my uncle.

695
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,700
Mr. San, I told you.

696
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
If you call me, I'll tell you.

697
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,700
You can't run away.

698
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,700
If you have nothing to do, I've told you.

699
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,700
I'll ask you to go abroad.

700
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
Don't run away.

701
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,700
Tell him, I have something to talk to him.

702
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,700
Talk to him?

703
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,700
Mr. San is so mean.

704
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,700
Pan Zi, don't talk nonsense.

705
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,700
I found a tomb.

706
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,700
Did you hear that?

707
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,700
I'll go to see him in a few days.

708
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,700
If you're interested, just contact me.

709
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,700
You can frame him.

710
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,700
I don't believe it.

711
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,700
I don't know.

712
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,700
Anyway, my curiosity is in the head.

713
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,700
He's so big.

714
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,700
Mr. San, where did you find the tomb?

715
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,700
Do you believe it?

716
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
He's looking for it.

717
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,700
He wants me to find it.

718
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,700
Are you looking for it?

719
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,700
I'm looking for it.

720
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,700
What if he really knows?

721
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,700
He just came back from Qin.

722
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,700
Did he find anything?

723
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,700
But if you ask him, he'll tell you.

724
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,700
There are some things that I don't know.

725
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,700
It's a kind of protection.

726
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,700
But this guy doesn't understand it.

727
00:31:42,700 --> 00:32:09,880
The

728
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,700
My God, you're a fool!

729
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,700
I'm your friend!

730
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,700
I got you!

731
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,700
I got you!

732
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,700
I got you!

733
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,700
I got you!

734
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,700
I got you!

735
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,700
I got you!

736
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,700
I got you!

737
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,700
I got you!

738
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,700
I got you!

739
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,700
I got you!

740
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,700
What do you mean, Zhizhi?

741
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:47,220
What can you be afraid of?

742
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,560
I afraid to realize everything!

743
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,320
Now I dream about you.

744
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,780
There is nothing I can be afraid of.

745
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,360
So what?

746
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,840
No, he isπά

747
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,760
I don't know anything!

748
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,000
Once I wake up...

749
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,480
Miss Hao, I know that you have 6 partners in Guizhou.

750
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,480
The loss is a bit big, but it's dangerous to play in the lower level.

751
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,480
If you're afraid of death, you can kill your head.

752
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:35,760
The VVPモ Creative Leader

753
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,280
Brunoِّ

754
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
Why AAA Va Desktop Streaming you?

755
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,920
Do you find me a client?

756
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,640
What?

757
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,520
Uncle Kang, don't say that.

758
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,880
You said it wasn't enough for two families.

759
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,680
You asked me and Ma Yu to do it.

760
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,160
Mr. Hua,

761
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,280
your fire is on my mind.

762
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,120
I have a record.

763
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,160
You're a fool.

764
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,480
What's the record?

765
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,560
It's a pity.

766
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,120
It can be a disaster.

767
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,280
Jie Yuhua,

768
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,760
you said you wanted your two partners to be witnesses.

769
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,200
Didn't you say what they said?

770
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,640
Uncle Kang, you misunderstood.

771
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,080
You know what you've done.

772
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,320
I know it too.

773
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
I'm here today

774
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,080
to tell you something.

775
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,880
You broke my plate.

776
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,680
I know.

777
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,520
You think I'm afraid of you?

778
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,520
Tell me.

779
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,240
I thought I gave my father whom I'd once had.

780
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
YouUN�

781
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,440
don't forget why.

782
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,240
Uncle Xia was a invisible spirit.

783
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,440
He is the dead person now.

784
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,520
How can you be as a tailor

785
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,920
to touch you dad's stuff?

786
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,040
Can you give up?

787
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,360
You think you're in great labor.

788
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,720
Do you think there's a надage in his family?

789
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,800
Hey,

790
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,520
a fugitive wants to tie you up.

791
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,060
In 2019, O� συν cũng plastics,

792
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,840
with evidence to prevent yours from being besar

793
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,040
Stop but think.

794
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,200
At your age,

795
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
you've never said much,

796
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,240
or hit you before taking a hit

797
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,000
Uncle,

798
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,560
you must be a little confused,

799
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,400
the Xie family Specialosto is me today

800
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,120
Keep that from me.

801
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,940
I'll tell Kangaves I'm pregnant.

802
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,160
All right!

803
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,660
Then what to do with the lives of those six monkeys?

804
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,600
Get some money!

805
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,940
One budget will be worth one million as a螢ед.

806
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,320
You better go to buy a building.

807
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,200
Ever since we helped you before,

808
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,200
I've never Afghaned the next life in the hotel.

809
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,000
That has never happened.

810
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,320
So, what are you gonna do?

811
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,040
I can't compare with them.

812
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,400
That's true.

813
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,520
But they also have a disadvantage.

814
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,160
Because they don't dare to do anything,

815
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,760
they think very carefully.

816
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,880
They will even

817
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,200
think about any situation

818
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,880
to face it.

819
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,360
What is our advantage?

820
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,640
It's beautiful.

821
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,360
Except for the pig.

822
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,080
Handsome.

823
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
Yes.

824
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,080
Except for that,

825
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
our biggest advantage

826
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,080
is that we don't know what to do next.

827
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
Because even I

828
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,080
don't know what to do next.

829
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
So,

830
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,080
as long as we can control the main circle,

831
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,080
let them follow us,

832
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,080
then their actions

833
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,080
will be exposed sooner or later.

834
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,080
Not reliable.

835
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,080
That's right.

836
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
We'll know

837
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,080
whether it's reliable or not.

838
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,080
We'll know whether it's reliable or not.

839
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Kang's plate

840
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
came to the underground road today.

841
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
He can get the balance.

842
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,080
I've found the thing

843
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
he owns.

844
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
It's less than 3 million.

845
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,080
Put it away.

846
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,080
Give it to the family

847
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
who has been living in the fire.

848
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,080
In addition,

849
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,080
send it to the police as soon as possible.

850
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,080
Okay.

851
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,080
The things in the warehouse

852
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
are already cleaned.

853
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,080
One of the five is only the side.

854
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
There are many things

855
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,080
that are not visible on the photos.

856
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
I dare not open it.

857
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,080
Most of the things in the warehouse

858
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080
are left by Second Master.

859
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,080
Second Master's account

860
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,080
is clear.

861
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,080
But there are some things

862
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,080
that are not in the warehouse.

863
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,080
At that time,

864
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
people were not there

865
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,080
when the accident happened.

866
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
So,

867
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
I didn't take them back.

868
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
After a while,

869
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,080
I took a look at the inside

870
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,080
of the warehouse.

871
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,080
I was wondering

872
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,080
what is inside.

873
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,080
But some things

874
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,080
are too messy.

875
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,080
I don't know

876
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,080
what people in the warehouse

877
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,080
thought.

878
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,080
No. 31 of the accident

879
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,080
is in the warehouse

880
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
and what do you guess?

881
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
A few women

882
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,080
and children's clothes,

883
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
a pair of shoes,

884
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
a bowl of side dishes

885
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,080
and a fire.

886
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
Maybe for that person,

887
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,080
this is the most important thing

888
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,080
that cannot be lost.

889
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,080
Keep it.

890
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
The photos in the warehouse

891
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,080
are also cleaned up.

892
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,080
He can't contact his family.

893
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,080
Yes.

894
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,080
For that person,

895
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,080
it might be different.

896
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,080
Like Second Master,

897
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,080
there are many things

898
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,080
that are lost.

899
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,080
These years,

900
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,080
you are gradually going back.

901
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,080
The value of the money

902
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,080
is much higher than those things.

903
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,080
Second Master's life is full of

904
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,080
many experiences

905
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,080
but unfortunately,

906
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,080
we know nothing about it.

907
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,080
We can only chase

908
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
some things away from the past.
