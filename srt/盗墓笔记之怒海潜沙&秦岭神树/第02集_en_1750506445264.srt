I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:30,000
if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if

4
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
you can see it

5
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,700
My God!

6
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,800
Hz.

7
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,820
Little Him.

8
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,300
Hey, Fujiwara.</ichen.

9
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,300
Sounds good.

10
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,300
You're old-fashioned and ignorant,

11
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,500
you need to learn from me.

12
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:36,100
You know what, every time I can't think straight, I can go into a mirror and seen how cute I am

13
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,400
I'm afraid you are gonna have a Midwest to hide

14
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,200
Quick, get up, get up, quickly

15
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,400
Come over here

16
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,480
Come down here and let me tell you that once you have it insights can be Duo Duo's

17
00:04:52,480 --> 00:05:18,520
Now we find themselves somewhere else loyal to earth,

18
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,600
The first place in the second door is in the entertainment station 994466.

19
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,520
You all ate and didn't wait for us?

20
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,200
That's too much.

21
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,160
Hurry up and eat.

22
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,920
We're almost at the place of Chen Chuan.

23
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,520
You just got here, right?

24
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,520
If we were to eat seafood, we'd have to eat it on the sea.

25
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,720
Chen Chuan is fighting over there.

26
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,520
We're eating fresh food.

27
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,320
Stop looking.

28
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,520
It's going to be a long time. We can't drink.

29
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
Well...

30
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
Chen Chuan's location is your uncle's.

31
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,520
It's said that he's booked a place in the water.

32
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,520
You'll see it all later.

33
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
I told you I don't believe it.

34
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,520
I really didn't tell anyone about my uncle.

35
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
I just got interested in the taste.

36
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
I've read a few books.

37
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
But don't worry.

38
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,520
Since it's for my uncle,

39
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,520
I'll do my best.

40
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,520
Fatty, you're a drinker.

41
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
You're a drinker.

42
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,520
You're a drinker.

43
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,520
You're a drinker.

44
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
You're a drinker.

45
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
You're a drinker.

46
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,520
You're a drinker.

47
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
Come and have a drink.

48
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
Where's the wine from?

49
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,520
Where did you get it?

50
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
What's the name of the wine?

51
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
I've been drinking with her.

52
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,520
It's called the South North wine culture exchange.

53
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
Okay.

54
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,520
You guys try it.

55
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
No, you're not.

56
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
Come on.

57
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
Don't drink.

58
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
You can drink some.

59
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
I'm telling you,

60
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
I don't dare to take it.

61
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,520
But we can drink some.

62
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
It's good.

63
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,520
I can't drink it.

64
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,520
We're not drinking wine.

65
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
We're drinking wine.

66
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
Yes.

67
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
Come on.

68
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
The main thing is that

69
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,520
the three of you are experts in this.

70
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,520
Do you have any suggestions for the next wave?

71
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Are you sure about the location?

72
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
I'm sure.

73
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,520
Eight people are in the clean room.

74
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
That's good.

75
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
For the fat man,

76
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,520
it's just a matter of spending money on the water.

77
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
Do you have a chance?

78
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,520
Even if you have a chance,

79
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
it won't be too complicated.

80
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
First, it's under the water.

81
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
There are problems with water pressure and food.

82
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Second,

83
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,520
the wood is buried under the sea.

84
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
It's a big chance.

85
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
In the past,

86
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,520
the technological development era,

87
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
it's hard to imagine that there will be

88
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
a wooden thief in the future.

89
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
It's under the sea for a long time.

90
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
It's done.

91
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
So even if you have a chance,

92
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
it won't be too complicated.

93
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
Then what do you say?

94
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,520
A normal boat.

95
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
Come on.

96
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
Come on.

97
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
Come on.

98
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
Where is Ning?

99
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:32,520
Sir, everything's going as planned.

100
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Soon comes the crucial step.

101
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Keep your eyes on Wu Xie.

102
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,520
The Wu's are tricky.

103
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Don't let him off hook.

104
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Yes, sir.

105
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Sir,

106
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,520
was consultant Zhang involved in any of our project?

107
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
No.

108
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
Why about him?

109
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
I have a feeling.

110
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
It's just a hunch that

111
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
something's off about him.

112
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,520
If he threatens the operation,

113
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,520
take him out.

114
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
Yes, sir.

115
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Remember,

116
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
your safety is important.

117
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
Ning,

118
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,520
you're my most valuable asset.

119
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,520
I'm not going to let you go.

120
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,520
I'm not going to let you go.

121
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,520
I'm not going to let you go.

122
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
I'm not going to let you go.

123
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
I'm not going to let you go.

124
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
I'm not going to let you go.

125
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,520
I'm not going to let you go.

126
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,520
I'm not going to let you go.

127
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,520
I'm not going to let you go.

128
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
I'm not going to let you go.

129
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
I'm not going to let you go.

130
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,520
I'm not going to let you go.

131
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,520
I'm not going to let you go.

132
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,520
I'm not going to let you go.

133
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
I know.

134
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,520
They say the tunnel is long.

135
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
There's a place where the cave is.

136
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,520
They're using the quality of the price to fix it.

137
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,520
We'll go down when they're done.

138
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,520
I'm not going to let you go.

139
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,520
I'm not going to let you go.

140
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,520
I'm not going to let you go.

141
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,520
I'm not going to let you go.

142
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,520
I'm not going to let you go.

143
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,520
I'm not going to let you go.

144
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,520
I'm not going to let you go.

145
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,520
I'm not going to let you go.

146
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,520
I'm not going to let you go.

147
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,520
I'm not going to let you go.

148
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,520
I'm not going to let you go.

149
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,520
I'm not going to let you go.

150
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,520
I'm not going to let you go.

151
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,520
I'm not going to let you go.

152
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,520
I'm not going to let you go.

153
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
I'm not going to let you go.

154
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,520
I'm not going to let you go.

155
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,520
I'm not going to let you go.

156
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,520
I'm not going to let you go.

157
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
I'm not going to let you go.

158
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,520
I'm not going to let you go.

159
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,520
I'm not going to let you go.

160
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,520
I'm not going to let you go.

161
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,520
I'm not going to let you go.

162
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,520
I'm not going to let you go.

163
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,520
I'm not going to let you go.

164
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,520
I'm not going to let you go.

165
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,520
I'm not going to let you go.

166
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,520
I'm not going to let you go.

167
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,520
I'm not going to let you go.

168
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,520
I'm not going to let you go.

169
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,520

00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,220
There are many good things in here, especially in the stomach.

520
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,220
There's the housekeeper, you know?

521
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,620
That's worth the money.

522
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,220
Where did that kid go?

523
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,220
Baby.

524
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,020
Where did that kid go?

525
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,020
Baby. Baby.

526
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,220
So lucky.

527
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,420
Let the monk come to see you.

528
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,620
Be quiet.

529
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,220
He's a little kid. He's here to funeral.

530
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,420
You can't let him die.

531
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,020
The cat-clawed house is a fake.

532
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,420
Fine. If you don't find it, I'll see what's left in here.

533
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,820
Wait.

534
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,220
This coffin is different from the other.

535
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,220
Don't look at it.

536
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,620
We're not here to find the tombstone.

537
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,020
We should find the tombstone.

538
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,420
Don't waste time.

539
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,720
The villageor at the castle

540
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,120
It's too narrow.

541
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,020
Let's go down first and give it a shot first.

542
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,120
This video was shot at one of the future world's greatest allemands.

543
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,320
You could find it anyway.

544
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,620
Let's go to other places.

545
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,520
Another one to pass?

546
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,920
We can't just go in and out of this door.

547
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,680
We can either go and get some soup,

548
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,200
or we can go on the boat and buy a plane and go back to Beijing.

549
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,880
I'll treat you to grilled meat, grilled duck, and pork belly.

550
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,000
What are you afraid of?

551
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,200
Let's go.

552
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,000
Why are you hitting me? It hurts.

553
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,960
Get out of here.

554
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,320
Go.

555
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,120
We'll get out of here.

556
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:56,480
Recony

557
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,360
Song

558
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,280
Hey

559
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:14,940
Look at the

560
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,140
It's for scaring people.

561
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,140
What if he has a consciousness?

562
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
It's very impossible.

563
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,340
Okay, you two.

564
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,140
Let's go.

565
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:22,940
Wait.

566
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,540
Usually, there are some mechanisms for this kind of courage.

567
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,740
I'll check it first.

568
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,140
If my uncle came here...

569
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,940
The door in front is open.

570
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,540
Someone must have entered.

571
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,540
It shouldn't be my uncle.

572
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,140
If he had been here,

573
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,340
all the mechanisms in here

574
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,740
should have been broken or sent out.

575
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,140
There are many reasons for this.

576
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,140
There are many reasons.

577
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,740
Comrade Xiao, are you okay?

578
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,540
Follow me.

579
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,540
Okay.

580
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,940
What are you doing?

581
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,940
Let go of him!

582
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,540
Are you okay?

583
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,140
Fatty!

584
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,140
Go!

585
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,940
Don't panic!

586
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,940
Don't panic!

587
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,940
Don't panic!

588
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,940
Fatty, it's okay.

589
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,940
Look at you!

590
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,540
Look behind you!

591
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,940
Wait, wait a minute.

592
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,940
This is not right.

593
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,940
Why doesn't it hurt at all?

594
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,140
Yes.

595
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,940
It doesn't hurt at all.

596
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,940
Fatty,

597
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,940
you were shot to death.

598
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,740
You're so cool.

599
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,540
I didn't die.

600
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,540
I don't know.

601
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,940
What?

602
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,940
You!

603
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,940
You didn't cry?

604
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,940
Yes.

605
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,940
Are you really okay?

606
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,940
Go.

607
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,940
Go.

608
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,940
Go.

609
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,940
Zhang Guo,

610
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,940
did you find her?

611
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,940
She ran too fast.

612
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,940
I couldn't follow her.

613
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,940
You guys...

614
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,940
It's okay.

615
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,940
It's okay.

616
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,940
Where's Ning?

617
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,940
That bastard

618
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,940
knocked the door and ran home.

619
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,940
He took us as a shield.

620
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,940
He was so cruel.

621
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,940
I'm a rabbit.

622
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,940
Your master has seen her.

623
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,940
You don't follow her.

624
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,940
Ning just deliberately

625
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,940
shot the machine gun.

626
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,940
You...

627
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,940
You...

628
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,940
You're so stupid.

629
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,940
You lied to us.

630
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,940
This is a bow.

631
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,940
It doesn't hurt.

632
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,940
It doesn't hurt.

633
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,940
Do you want us to leave

634
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,940
after the machine gun is shot?

635
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,940
I'm telling you,

636
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,940
the owner is the owner of the house.

637
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,940
She's crazy.

638
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,940
She's going to kill us.

639
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,940
Why are you so mean?

640
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,940
The end.

641
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,940
Ning deliberately shot this trap.

642
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,940
She wanted to kill me on the surface,

643
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,940
but actually,

644
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,940
the arrow is a lotus head.

645
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,940
It doesn't hurt.

646
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,940
That's strange.

647
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,940
With her ability,

648
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,940
she can come to the Hanning tomb alone.

649
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,940
She wants to bring us here.

650
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,940
What's her purpose?

651
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,940
She thinks it's too easy to come in.

652
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,940
She can't use us.

653
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,940
So she's trying to kill us.

654
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,940
Do you understand?

655
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,940
Could it be that

656
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,940
she only knows the secret

657
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,940
through her uncle?

658
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,940
Anyway, she's trying to get us out of here

659
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,940
just to do

660
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,940
something we can't know.

661
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,940
She must know

662
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,940
that there's no girl.

663
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,940
She wants to be alone.

664
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,940
I think you're a foreigner.

665
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,940
You're too dark.

666
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,940
You can be dark if you want.

667
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,940
Don't be too kind.

668
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,940
Go after her.

669
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,940
Go to the left.

670
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,940
Chief,

671
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,940
don't write it.

672
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,940
Just write it down.

673
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,940
Can you believe it?

674
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,940
She must have brought

675
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,940
the deer with her.

676
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,940
She must have brought us

677
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,940
to the cave.

678
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,940
What are we going to do?

679
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,940
We're not going to sell it.

680
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,940
You can go to the left.

681
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,940
You're so sweet.

682
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,940
You're going to kill me, right?

683
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,940
Fine.

684
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,940
I'll listen to you.

685
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,940
Wait.

686
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,940
Go back and bring the eyes

687
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,940
to the bottle.

688
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,940
Don't be surprised.

689
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,940
Don't be too polite.

690
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,940
It's only ten minutes

691
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,940
after the first round.

692
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,940
Where's the thing?

693
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,940
Is it our place to start?

694
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,940
Ning took the bottle away.

695
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,940
No way.

696
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,940
She just entered the city.

697
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,940
Unless there's another way.

698
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,940
This is not

699
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,940
the place we stayed just now.

700
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,940
The ear didn't live there.

701
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,940
She's right.

702
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,940
The deer's eyes are gone.

703
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,940
The funeral is different.

704
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,940
And you're looking at the top.

705
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,940
How is that possible?

706
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,940
We're on the wrong way.

707
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,940
We're on the wrong way.

708
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,940
But there's only one way.

709
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,940
Don't look at me.

710
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,940
This is the way to the valley.

711
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,940
If I enter the wrong way,

712
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,940
I'll be the wife of the farmer.

713
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,940
You didn't tell me

714
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,940
where the sea-leaf wood is.

715
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,940
Brother.

716
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,940
Have you been to this wood before?

717
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,940
I don't know.

718
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,940
You haven't been here.

719
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,940
You've been eating.

720
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,940
I've been here before.

721
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,940
I feel like I'm in a similar place.

722
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,940
But I can't remember.

723
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,940
I'm a little friend.

724
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,940
The sea-leaf wood is so fresh.

725
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,940
I haven't told you before.

726
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,940
You should think about it.

727
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,940
I told you a lot of stories before.

728
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,940
But I don't know which one is real.

729
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,940
Which one is fake.

730
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,940
Okay.

731
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,940
I'll leave you to it.

732
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,940
I asked Ning before.

733
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,940
He's a good man.

734
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,940
He's a good man.

735
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,940
He's a good man.

736
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,940
I asked Ning before.

737
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,940
How did he know about the sea-leaf wood?

738
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,940
Ning said that he was on fire

739
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,940
and was on a boat in the west.

740
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,940
They found that there was a wood market down there.

741
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,940
The land of the wood market

742
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,940
was almost completely destroyed.

743
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,940
There were several other wood walls.

744
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,940
But they couldn't find a way

745
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,940
to enter the wood.

746
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,940
No.

747
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,940
What do you mean by completely destroyed?

748
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,940
You saw it when you came in.

749
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,940
It's not serious.

750
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,940
Ning said that

751
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,940
I'll give you the引.

752
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,940
It's just a trick.

753
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,940
Do you hear me?

754
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,940
Really?

755
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,940
What did I say?

756
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,940
Right.

757
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,940
There was a team of wood market

758
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,940
and the wood market.

759
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,940
They knew about it.

760
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,940
After the wood market was gone,

761
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,940
the wood market

762
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,940
investigated the wood market.

763
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,940
The wood market is closed.

764
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,940
There are water walls.

765
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,940
The land is sealed.

766
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,940
There must be a good place inside.

767
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,860
Zu Columbia

768
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,260
Zhejiang

769
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,060
Prof. Zhang.

770
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,060
It's a Ş occupied area.

771
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,560
Come.

772
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,100
Only a few sitting

773
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,580
와

774
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,580
the part of the building that was built by the government.

775
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,580
This box might be the weapon of the Ming Dynasty.

776
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,580
It should have been inside the military headquarters.

777
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,580
If you want to enter the tomb, you have to open the tomb wall.

778
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,580
But this is the bottom.

779
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,580
When you open the tomb wall, the sea water will flow into it.

780
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,580
No one will know what the tomb is like.

781
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,580
And the archaeological team,

782
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,580
protecting the first place of the cultural relics,

783
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,580
can't be as messy as I am.

784
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,580
The only thing that can be sure is that the entrance to the water is the key.

785
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,580
At that time, someone suggested that the tunnel was dug in the bottom of the tomb.

786
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,580
But after the exploration,

787
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,580
the soil here is not the original sand soil of the West Sass.

788
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,580
It is the white pebble near the Fujian Guanyao.

789
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,580
The area of the land is over 7000 square meters.

790
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,580
According to the ratio calculation,

791
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,580
the technology at that time was not at the bottom of the tomb.

792
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,580
But they dug it.

793
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,580
They dug 15 meters deep.

794
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,580
They didn't find the bottom brick.

795
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,580
And they dug for a long time.

796
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,580
They dug for a long time.

797
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,580
They didn't come out at all.

798
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,580
Plus, because of some objective factors,

799
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,580
the archaeological team withdrew.

800
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,580
They buried the soil here.

801
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,580
And the most annoying thing is that

802
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:24,580
the data of the archaeological team was missing.

803
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,580
In a few years,

804
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,580
another archaeological team came again.

805
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,580
Your uncle is inside.

806
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,580
This is too unorganized.

807
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,580
How can you go out alone?

808
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,580
You don't even ask for a favor.

809
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,580
That's right.

810
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,580
What if something happens?

811
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,580
You guys, look.

812
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,580
Look at the evidence.

813
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,580
Where?

814
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,580
Where?

815
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,580
I saw it.

816
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,580
Snake-meat-fish?

817
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,580
Yes.

818
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,580
As you said,

819
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,580
your uncle thought that

820
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,580
the dead body of the suspect

821
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,580
must have been buried in the sea.

822
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,580
The snake-meat-fish in his hand

823
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,580
is evidence.

824
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,580
So they searched nearby.

825
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,580
They found more than 40 huge rocks.

826
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,580
They saw those rocks

827
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,580
when they came here.

828
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,580
That's right.

829
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,580
Under the sea-water we are in,

830
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,580
there is a deep-sea-water tomb.

831
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,580
A deep-sea-water tomb?

832
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,580
It's the tomb on the boat.

833
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,580
Then, in the sea,

834
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,580
it's found a ancient land or a sea palace.

835
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,580
It's buried in the sand

836
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,580
and buried in the wind.

837
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,580
It's a deep-sea-water tomb.

838
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,580
It's the same as the land.

839
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,580
It's just a sea-water tomb.

840
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,580
It must be a small sea-water tomb.

841
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,580
It was later found in the sea.

842
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,580
My goodness.

843
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,580
It's a big treasure.

844
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,580
Can the ancient people make it?

845
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,580
Yes.

846
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,580
Wenjing, we finally found it.

847
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,580
What happened later?

848
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,580
Later?

849
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,580
Your uncle personally buried it.

850
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,580
After that,

851
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,580
the archaeology team withdrew the map.

852
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,580
They didn't know anything about it.

853
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,580
Until recently,

854
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,580
your uncle found An Ning's company

855
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,580
and wanted to re-enter the tomb.

856
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,580
I'll tell you again.

857
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,580
An Ning told me this.

858
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,580
I don't know the truth.

859
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,580
But I think it's not that big.

860
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,580
He doesn't have to

861
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,580
lie to me with this.

862
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,580
Unless...

863
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,580
Unless my uncle lied to him, too?

864
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,580
Yes.

865
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:24,580
....

866
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,580
I remember when I was a kid,

867
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,580
the way Uncle wasilos farewell

868
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,580
had been gone for a long time.

869
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,580
When he zealous came back,

870
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,580
he growled and became motherly.

871
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,580
The im suffering doesn't look so good.

872
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,060
But I still remember

873
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,580
he's been locked up

874
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,580
He said a few words in the room.

875
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,580
Grandpa even scolded him.

876
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,580
I believe that my uncle did come here.

877
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,580
But I still can't explain why this ear suddenly changed.

878
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,580
You're saying that I ran away, right?

879
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,580
Fine.

880
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,580
I've come.

881
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,580
I'll take you to fly.

882
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,580
I'll be with you.

883
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,580
Please don't be afraid.

884
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,580
I'll be brave.

885
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,580
I'll be free.

886
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,580
I'll be free.

887
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,580
I'll be free.

888
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,580
I'll be free.

889
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,580
I'll be free.

890
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,580
I'll be free.

891
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,580
I'll be free.

892
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,580
I'll be free.

893
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,580
I'll be free.

894
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,580
