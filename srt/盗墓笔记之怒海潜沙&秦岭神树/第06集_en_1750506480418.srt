00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to make a little bit of a

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a little bit of a

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
little bit of a little bit of a

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
little bit of a little bit of a little

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
bit of a little bit of a little bit of

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
little bit of a little bit of a little

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
bit of a little bit of a little bit of

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
little bit of a little bit of a little

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
bit of a little bit of a little bit of

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
little bit of a little bit of a little

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
bit of a little bit of a little bit of

little bit of a little bit of a little

bit of a little bit of a little

bit of a little bit of a little

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
bit of a little bit of a little

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
bit of a little bit of a little

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
bit of a little bit of a little

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
bit of a little bit of a little

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
bit of a little bit of a little

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
bit of a little bit of a little

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
bit of a little bit of a little

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
bit of a little bit of a little

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
bit of a little bit of a little

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
bit of a little bit of a little

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
bit of a little bit of a little

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
bit of a little bit of a little

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
bit of a little bit of a little

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
bit of a little bit of a little

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
bit of a little bit of a little

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
bit of a little bit of a little

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
bit of a little bit of a little

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
bit of a little bit of a little

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
bit of a little bit of a little

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
bit of a little bit of a little

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
bit of a little bit of a little

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
bit of a little bit of a little

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
bit of a little bit of a little

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
bit of a little bit of a little

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
bit of a little bit of a little

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
bit of a little bit of a little

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
bit of a

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
little

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
bit of a little

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
feedback

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:20,000
that

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There's still a possibility that Xie Lian Huan was killed by an accident.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
After all, when we found her, she was already missing two pieces of the body.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Since that, why did Sanshu bring you here?

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
When the ship took Xie Lian Huan's body back,

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
it left a few pieces of the body to us.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Most of our work was done on this piece of paper.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But no one thought that it would suddenly explode.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Our only way is to hide in a empty sea of ​​moves.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We'll talk about it when the wind blows.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But this completely removed your Sanshu's plan.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This is why Sanshu secretly brought us to the temple of Heaven Palace.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Later, he also brought us to the maze in that tunnel.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't know what happened after that.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But it can be sure that if these people are still alive,

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
they will all be like me, lost their memories.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Then why didn't Sanshu kill all of you?

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What about the medical data?

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't know.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You're so naive.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It was Sanshu who took a new strategy and had a big devil's head.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But Sanshu wasn't that kind of person.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He was just a young man who was in a good shape.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Besides, there was still Chen Wen Jin in the archaeological team.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He couldn't have killed her.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It must be your memory that caused the problem.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm sure that your naiveness did it.

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Your guess is right.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You're such a fool.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You didn't even try to take a mask off without any air.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
If you were to bump into a fool, you'd be hanged.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Are you okay?

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There's still air in such deep sea.

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's really deep enough.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm fine.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why is there only this little thing left?

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Xie Lian Huan.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Xie Lian Huan.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I wonder how you feel?

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm fine.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm fine.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm fine.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm fine.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm fine.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm fine.

101
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
怎麼了?三哥,你看,你快看

102
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
這應該就是牟主人的關果了吧

103
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,600
也不知道裡面葬的是誰

104
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,200
這只是一個人有罷了

105
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,400
謝連環,瞧瞧你那膽

106
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,200
人有?

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
哥,問我嚇壞了

108
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,200
但是,這人有造型也太奇怪了吧

109
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,200
好像,受星慘叫了一樣

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
三哥,這是個鐵關啊

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
這個洞是深到關餐裡頭的吧

112
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,200
這是個少子關,什麼關?

113
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,600
生鐵封關,關身帶孔,這就是個少子關

114
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,600
也就是說裡面有什麼了不得的東西

115
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,600
甚至可能不是棕子,就是腰

116
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,200
所以才要從外面,鐵水交關,把它封死

117
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
就留這麼個孔洞

118
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,800
讓高手伸手進去,拿裡面的寶貝

119
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,200
萬一,守備關餐裡的東西咬住了

120
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,200
只能從外面,砍斷手臂

121
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,800
故事倒是挺好聽的,但是這根本不可能嘛

122
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,800
老祖宗傳下來的,一定有他的道理

123
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,200
三哥,你就不好奇,這裡頭有什麼東西嗎?

124
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,200
咱們回去,拿了黑鋁梯子和火豬,明兒再來

125
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,200
這關餐又不會跑,急什麼

126
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,200
你看看就好啊,別亂摸

127
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
我去那邊看看

128
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,600
別亂摸

129
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
怎麼辦啊,這是

130
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
怎麼回事,這是

131
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,600
三哥,我剛剛就認識一個火豬的靜止

132
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,600
想照個亮,沒想到就這樣了

133
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
你才年有病啊,你

134
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,600
你說哪兒學的這招,倒閉透光,還在那兒學得似不像

135
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,600
屍體在乾燥的情況下,別說是屍體身上的衣服了

136
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,600
屍體本身都被找的,你才年能不能找點腦子

137
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,600
三哥,你別罵我了,咱們趕緊想辦法,滅活

138
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,600
你呀,都被你害死了

139
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
還在那兒幹嘛,水啊

140
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
水,對對,水

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
找著,三哥,你別著急,水在這兒呢

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
來,來,倒進去

143
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
你太娘的,下豆不帶水,帶酒,你瘋子嗎你

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
水,哪兒他們有水啊

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
水,哪兒他們有水啊

146
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,000
拿過來,一會兒找你算賬,

147
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
孫子

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
這怎麼辦啊

149
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
你太娘的是真有病啊

150
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
滅了,滅了

151
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
滅了

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
少子管理鬼吹哨,大凶之物

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
你剛剛燒了人家一把,又尿了人家一拋

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
這粮子算是結下了

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
三哥,你別嚇唬我了

156
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
什麼妖啊縱子,都是嚇唬人的

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
這只不過是個造型別著點的棺材而已

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
說不定這牧主人身前是個藝術家

159
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
故意弄成這個樣子的

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
算了,燒也燒了,尿也尿了

161
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
半天沒動靜,這應該是個死官

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
算你命大啊

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
三哥,你不嫌餓行啊

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
嚇唬還要乾淨,回家做你的大少爺去

165
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
摸到什麼了?

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
元華,是牙鞋頭的玉餅

167
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
這把燒不壞

168
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
真的

169
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
給你拿出來啊

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
用力,拿呀

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
用力,拿啊

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
用力,拿啊

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
用力,拿啊

174
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
用力,拿啊

175
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
用力,拿啊

176
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
走,是寄官

177
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
別動我心裏玩

178
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
心裏玩你別動

179
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
我去看看,哪兒都別動

180
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
在這兒老是待著

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
三哥,你快點回來啦

182
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
三哥,你還在這兒?

183
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
別動我心裏玩

184
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
別動我心裏玩

185
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
別動我心裏玩

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
真是個死人

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
三哥,你真的在這兒?

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
招式水,什麼不乾淨的髒東西

189
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
回頭見著他,一盆黑溝血

190
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
潑上去,把那髒東西逼出來

191
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
就沒事

192
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
不可能,哪有這種東西啊

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
那保不齊

194
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
你就沒發現你平時

195
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
三叔有學女人書頭的習慣

196
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
去,胡說八道

197
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
這什麼習慣呀

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
秀神這樣還能動

199
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
蓮環

200
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
謝蓮環

201
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
蓮環

202
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
蓮環

203
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
蓮環

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
蓮環

205
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
蓮環

206
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
蓮環

207
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,520
Yay!

208
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,500
Yいた!

209
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,640
Russia!

210
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,100
European!

211
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,420
internationally!

212
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,480
China!

213
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Until you kill me!

214
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,520
I want to be your father!

215
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,500
No!

216
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,900
Let the splendid Studies of the Great Lлnds

217
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,760
You troublemaker!

218
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,480
Dajie...

219
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,900
Oh, Sun Zeyi!

220
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,900
Ye, ye, ye!

221
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,900
Yeah!

222
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,900
Oh.

223
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,900
Oh.

224
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,900
Oh.

225
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
Oh.

226
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,900
Oh.

227
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Oh.

228
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,900
Oh.

229
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:34,900
Oh.

230
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Oh.

231
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,900
Oh.

232
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:45,900
Oh.

233
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,900
Oh.

234
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,900
Oh.

235
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,900
Oh.

236
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,900
Oh.

237
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,900
I can't keep up with the rest of the oxygen.

238
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,900
But I'm better than you.

239
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,900
Maybe I can survive.

240
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,900
As long as I'm out,

241
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
I'll send someone to save you.

242
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,900
If not,

243
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,900
I'll stay in the sea for fish.

244
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,900
What about you?

245
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,900
I'm not going to go out.

246
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,900
I'm not going to go out.

247
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
I'm going to go out.

248
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,900
I'm sure I'll get a target.

249
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,900
Wait for me to come back.

250
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,900
Forget it.

251
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,900
I know that in your heart,

252
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,900
I might be a devil.

253
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,900
But he's not that complicated.

254
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,900
He's just a little bit more arrogant.

255
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,900
He doesn't even look for a target when he's young.

256
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,900
Let me tell you something.

257
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,900
When I was young,

258
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,900
I wanted to take him out for fun.

259
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,900
But he wanted to take him away.

260
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,900
He wanted to leave again,

261
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,900
and he was afraid of me.

262
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
But he tied me up.

263
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,900
I was so lucky.

264
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
You know what happened?

265
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,900
My grandpa chased after him.

266
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
He chased after five crabs.

267
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,900
But I don't know when he got up.

268
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,900
He became more stable.

269
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,900
He didn't have much time at home.

270
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,900
He had less chance to communicate with them.

271
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
But I always think

272
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,900
that my uncle is still my uncle when he was young.

273
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,900
He hasn't changed at all.

274
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,900
Don't worry.

275
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,900
When I find my uncle,

276
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,900
I will ask him in person.

277
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,900
I will give you an answer.

278
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,900
Have you been well?

279
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,900
Have you been well?

280
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,900
You're still well?

281
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,900
I've been well since the beginning.

282
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,900
Did you get hurt?

283
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,900
You've got a cold.

284
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,900
Don't be silent. Don't get cold.

285
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,900
You should have changed.

286
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,900
Let's go.

287
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,900
Wait for me.

288
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
Come on.

289
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,900
Wait.

290
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,900
Wait.

291
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,900
Wait.

292
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,900
Wait.

293
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,900
It's getting worse.

294
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,900
You didn't take a bath for days, did you?

295
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,900
What?

296
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,900
I'm telling you.

297
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,900
You just got into a fight.

298
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
You should go to those places.

299
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
Let me see.

300
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,900
Let me see.

301
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,900
What's going on?

302
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,900
What's going on?

303
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,900
What's going on?

304
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,900
What's going on?

305
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,900
What?

306
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,900
Fatty, you're so serious.

307
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,900
I was just kidding.

308
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,900
You've lost your hair.

309
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,900
What?

310
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,900
You've got white hair.

311
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,900
You've got some hair on your hair.

312
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
What white hair?

313
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,900
What hair?

314
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,900
What's going on?

315
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,900
Sorry.

316
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,900
I'm sorry.

317
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,900
I'm sorry.

318
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
I was in the middle of it.

319
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,900
I've had a cold.

320
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,900
I've had a cold.

321
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
But I'm fine now.

322
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
I'm thinking about the reason.

323
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,900
What are you doing?

324
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
What's going on?

325
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,900
Hurry up and get me out of here.

326
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,900
I'm so sorry.

327
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,900
You just got me out of here.

328
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,900
Hurry up.

329
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,900
I heard someone got hit by this sword.

330
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,900
He killed himself.

331
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
You're so stupid.

332
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,900
Think of a way.

333
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,900
What's going on?

334
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,900
Hurry up and get me out of here.

335
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,900
Look.

336
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,900
Fatty, you're not kidding.

337
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,900
I'm telling you the truth.

338
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,900
I have a plan.

339
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,900
I'll just use some tricks.

340
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
You're so smart.

341
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,900
You're so smart.

342
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,900
You're so smart.

343
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,900
But...

344
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,900
You're so smart.

345
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,900
You just got the black and white

346
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,900
and you're so smart.

347
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,900
Go get me out of here.

348
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,900
What's the rush?

349
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,900
I'm so stupid.

350
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,900
I'm just kidding.

351
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,900
What's the trick?

352
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,900
Why don't you get me out of here?

353
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,900
Wait a minute.

354
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,900
You don't know what brand it is.

355
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,900
I'll buy some online.

356
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,900
Okay.

357
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,900
I'll buy some online.

358
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,900
I'm so angry.

359
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,900
I'm so angry.

360
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,900
My time is up.

361
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,900
How old are you?

362
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,900
Let's go.

363
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,900
How old?

364
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,900
I'm 16 years old.

365
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,900
I'm Theatre Master.

366
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,900
To strengthen the human body.

367
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,900
To prevent the white blood.

368
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,900
To break the body.

369
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,900
To strengthen the human body.

370
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,900
To break the body.

371
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
To protect the country.

372
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,900
To strengthen the human body.

373
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
To break the body.

374
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,900
To strengthen the human body.

375
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,900
To prevent the white blood.

376
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,900
Go.

377
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
Go.

378
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,900
Go.

379
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,900
Go.

380
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
Go.

381
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,900
Go.

382
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,900
Go.

383
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,900
Go.

384
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,900
Go.

385
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,900
Why is it so bitter?

386
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,900
It has a fragrance.

387
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,900
Don't talk.

388
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,900
Go.

389
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
Go.

390
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,900
Who are you?

391
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,900
Please hold me.

392
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,900
Go.

393
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,900
Go.

394
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
I told you not to do anything.

395
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,900
Didn't you see anything?

396
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,900
I saw something.

397
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,900
I only saw a black shadow.

398
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,900
It was too fast.

399
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,900
I didn't see what it was.

400
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,900
Don't worry.

401
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,900
What are you talking about?

402
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,900
It's a woman.

403
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,900
She has hair.

404
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,900
She wants to kiss me.

405
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,900
She wants to kiss me.

406
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,900
She's so cute.

407
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,900
She even wants to make me a dream.

408
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,900
No way.

409
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,900
Look.

410
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,900
So much water.

411
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,900
You're sweating.

412
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,900
You can't eat so much sweat.

413
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,900
Don't be so harsh.

414
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,900
If you have something,

415
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,900
I'll go there.

416
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,900
I have to see it.

417
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,900
No.

418
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,900
It's a woman.

419
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,900
There's no fire.

420
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,900
It's a fire.

421
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
There's...

422
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,900
Fatty.

423
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,900
Fatty.

424
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
Fatty.

425
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,900
Get up.

426
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,900
Fatty, are you okay?

427
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,900
Get up.

428
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,900
Are you okay?

429
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,900
Don't sit.

430
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,900
I'm fine.

431
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
I'm fine.

432
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,900
I'll get up.

433
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,900
I'll get up.

434
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
You're okay, right?

435
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,900
Don't sit.

436
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,900
Not sitting down.

437
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
You're fine.

438
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,900
I'll sit down.

439
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,900
I'll get up.

440
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,900
Are you okay?

441
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,900
Don't beat me.

442
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,900
Don't beat me.

443
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900
What's wrong?

444
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,900
I almost got a cramp.

445
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,900
You're lucky.

446
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,900
Otherwise, I'd be in trouble.

447
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,900
What trouble?

448
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,900
I almost got a cramp.

449
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,900
Get out!

450
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,900
What is that?

451
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,900
It's a goldfish.

452
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,900
Goldfish?

453
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,900
It's not a common thing to say.

454
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,900
It's a good thing.

455
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,900
What kind of life is that?

456
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,900
It looks like a goldfish.

457
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,900
It's a poisonous water-scented female.

458
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,900
Once you get in touch, you'll be in trouble.

459
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,900
Luckily, we're in the mood.

460
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,900
I'm in the mood!

461
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,900
I almost got a cramp.

462
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
You think I'm a rat?

463
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,900
Forget it.

464
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,900
Whether it's a goldfish or a sea monkey,

465
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,900
I think it's the owner's idea.

466
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,900
They might be very common.

467
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,900
They should stay in the woods and be the guards.

468
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,900
He...

469
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,900
Just sit down.

470
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,900
Don't stay here.

471
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,900
I feel like I'm back.

472
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,900
Wait.

473
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,900
Before the goldfish came,

474
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,900
there was a sound.

475
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,900
It's gone now.

476
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,900
Maybe it's the sound of the goldfish.

477
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,900
No way.

478
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,900
The goldfish won't make a sound.

479
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,900
Besides, it's a hair-head.

480
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,900
It doesn't need to be gone.

481
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,900
Don't mention the hair-head.

482
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,900
Really.

483
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,900
I think you should mention the hair-head.

484
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,900
Now, there's a hair-head in the throat.

485
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,900
You think it's the crab-head?

486
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,900
What's this for?

487
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,900
It's not good.

488
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,900
It's a doll.

489
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,900
It's a weird doll.

490
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,900
It's not a doll.

491
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,900
It's the current position.

492
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,900
The current position is the sea water.

493
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,900
Once it's gone, the sea water will come in.

494
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,900
It can change its direction at any time.

495
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,900
It's like the top of the mountain.

496
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,900
It wants to go out from the base.

497
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,900
It wants to do the same.

498
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,900
It wants to go out from the base.

499
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,900
It wants to go out from the base.

500
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,900
It's a very strange place.

501
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,900
It's a very strange place.

502
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,900
You think it's the sea water?

503
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,900
It wants to go out from the base.

504
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,900
It's really a hero's fault.

505
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,900
But we are definitely better than him.

506
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,900
He can go out alone.

507
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,900
We have no problem with the three of us.

508
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,900
But he's out of the game.

509
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,900
We can't go out of the game.

510
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,900
Right?

511
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,900
I still don't believe it.

512
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,900
It's my uncle who killed him.

513
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,900
You are so stubborn today.

514
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,900
Uncle.

515
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,900
Uncle.

516
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,900
Uncle.

517
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,900
It's gone.

518
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,900
Uncle.

519
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,900
You found the exit?

520
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,900
Come here.

521
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,900
Wu Xie.

522
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,900
Wu Xie.

523
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,900
Wu Xie.

524
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,900
Wu Xie.

525
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,900
Wu Xie.

526
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,900
Wu Xie.

527
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,900
Wu Xie.

528
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,900
The game is over.

529
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,900
The game is over.

530
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,900
The game is over.

531
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,900
The game is over.

532
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,900
The game is over.

533
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,900
The game is over.

534
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,900
The game is over.

535
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,900
The game is over.

536
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,900
The game is over.

537
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,900
The game is over.

538
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,900
The game is over.

539
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,900
The game is over.

540
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,900
The game is over.

541
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,900
The game is over.

542
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,900
The game is over.

543
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,900
The game is over.

544
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,900
The game is over.

545
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,900
The game is over.

546
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,900
The game is over.

547
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,900
The game is over.

548
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,900
The game is over.

549
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,900
The game is over.

550
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
The game is over.

551
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,900
The game is over.

552
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,900
The game is over.

553
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,900
The game is over.

554
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,900
The game is over.

555
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
The game is over.

556
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,900
The game is over.

557
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,900
The game is over.

558
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,900
The game is over.

559
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,900
The game is over.

560
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,900
The game is over.

561
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,900
The game is over.

562
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,900
The game is over.

563
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,900
The game is over.

564
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,900
The game is over.

565
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,900
The game is over.

566
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,900
The game is over.

567
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,900
The game is over.

568
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,900
The game is over.

569
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,900
The game is over.

570
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,900
The game is over.

571
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,900
The game is over.

572
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,900
The game is over.

573
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,900
The game is over.

574
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,900
The game is over.

575
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,900
the game is over.

576
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,900
The game is over.

577
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,900
The game is over.

578
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,900
The game is over.

579
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,900
The game is over.

580
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,380
I have completed

581
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,720
the game.

582
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,120
If it wasn't for me, would you have been so smooth?

583
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,280
Enough.

584
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,840
It's better to have a good match.

585
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,080
I can't.

586
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,800
I can't. He can't.

587
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,400
Do you know what it is?

588
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,000
It's called teamwork and teamwork spirit.

589
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,560
You can't do that.

590
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,120
Could it be...

591
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,640
That's the kind of dance that has the same kind of sky-high-heels?

592
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,160
Fatty, are you still going to stop?

593
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,320
Do you feel the change?

594
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,880
I'm carrying all the snow on my head.

595
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,120
Drink control.

596
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,760
When he comes I'm going to boil his water.

597
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,720
I must localize it so that I can go.

598
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,280
Can't you finish the top three until it's over?

599
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,920
I'll be there Idi.

600
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,000
It might hurt.

601
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,800
It's so beautiful, isn't it?

602
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,960
In a word, it's so beautiful that you can compete with an aunt.

603
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,160
Fatty, come and take a look.

604
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,960
What's so funny about the model?

605
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,760
I'll buy you some from online.

606
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,680
Some kind of plane, a truck, a tank.

607
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,080
Foreigners should have it.

608
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,560
Can it be the same?

609
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,160
Could it be that the Cloud Sky Palace really exists?

610
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,840
Xiao Ge, what are you looking for?

611
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,360
Cut from the web

612
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,240
I think someone is staring at us.

613
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,720
Her de*), a group of animals.

614
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,760
They're here to take care of the other bitches.

615
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,360
They are disturbing the other guys,

616
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,760
they're asking for revenge.

617
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,000
Have you taken a break?

618
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,840
You were here earlier,

619
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,840
that's how they called you.

620
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:07,140
l want to write a book that tells yousighs

621
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,740
Later when I rest, next time, I'll come!

622
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,140
Do you know how to read?

623
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,140
Can you read more books?

624
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,140
Wang Zanghai never went out.

625
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,140
He's teaching in the school.

626
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,140
He's a great scholar.

627
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,140
He's a scholar.

628
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,140
That's not Wang Zanghai.

629
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,140
He's a flying bird.

630
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,140
He's a monk who has a good sense of craftsmanship.

631
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,140
Not so much.

632
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,140
There are many craftsmanship in history.

633
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,140
They're all made by humans.

634
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,140
They're like the Aids.

635
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,140
They're made of some techniques and medicine

636
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,140
that make the body weak.

637
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,140
Even the body is like a stone.

638
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,140
They're almost as small as a stone.

639
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,140
Wang Zanghai is so self-pity.

640
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,140
He's so self-pity.

641
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,140
He wants to learn the magic of Aids

642
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,140
and make the air out of it.

643
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,140
Humans are born with a body.

644
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,140
It's just because they're afraid of death.

645
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,140
They want to live forever.

646
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,140
Is Wang Zanghai like that?

647
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,140
Master...

648
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,140
You told me all about it.

649
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,140
And you said

650
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,140
you're full of jealousy.

651
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,280
The imperial stick knows

652
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,140
the delicate tricks of our master.

653
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,140
Why did you keep asking me

654
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,140
for hurt ls presumably thank you?

655
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,140
She's from Tiengong.

656
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,140
From who did she get hurt?

657
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,160
It's Dr. Zheng,

658
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,120
the teacher of our book.

659
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,140
We need your word.

660
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:01,140
I always think that a person who has created the Cloud Sky Palace

661
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,140
wouldn't dare to hide himself in this sea top.

662
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,140
Why are you so weak?

663
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,140
He doesn't have a face and doesn't write the words of Wang Dang Hai.

664
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,140
We can guess who he is a few hundred years ago.

665
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,140
The Cloud Sky Palace

666
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,140
Sir, Wu Xian Sir arrived in the main chamber

667
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,140
and saw the mock-up of the Sky Palace.

668
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:01,140
It's worthy to be a descendant of all families.

669
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:05,140
Wu Xian looks like an ordinary person with a little bit of the intelligence.

670
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,140
There are a lot of strange things in the tombers of the ocean.

671
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,140
Jin Po and Sim Monkey, but he seems to have a manager.

672
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,140
He's helped by an expert.

673
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,140
If the experts then they help, that means he's capable.

674
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,140
They don't take him as a fool.

675
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:26,140
Well, with that in mind, I think we can go a step further.

676
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:30,140
Sir, are you sure that Wu San Xing will care for Wu Xian?

677
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,140
He's laughing.

678
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,140
But ambitious. Someone who won't stop for anyone.

679
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,140
Chinese people are most particular about their inheritance.

680
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,140
There are three brothers in Wu family.

681
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:49,140
Only each one is married with kids.

682
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,140
Neither of San Xing and Er Bai did.

683
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,140
Wu Xian is very important for the family.

684
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,140
I don't believe San Xing will let him take risks easily.

685
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:05,140
Once we let him in, San Xing will stay put

686
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,140
and everything will start to go alright for him.

687
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,140
And he will cooperate with us then?

688
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:17,140
Although if he should leave Wu Xian to die,

689
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,140
he will earn my respect.

690
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,140
Sir, I didn't find any copperfish.

691
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,140
I'm not surprised with the wisdom of the ones at high.

692
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,140
He wouldn't put all the things together.

693
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,140
But he built too many tombs. We cannot know which one.

694
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,140
They are the two copperfishes I in.

695
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,140
I got an idea. Don't worry.

696
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:42,140
We have collected enough information about the terms of the ocean.

697
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,140
Anything else would be excessive. Your mission is Wu Xian.

698
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,140
Yes.

699
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,140
Wu Xian!

700
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:07,140
Leopold, what is this painting?

701
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,140
It's Chang'an Mountain.

702
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,140
You can recognize it by the way it is painted.

703
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,140
Chang'an Mountain has a few special features.

704
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,140
But you can recognize the people who read it.

705
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:22,140
Look, the clothes that the people in the suit wear are a bit strange.

706
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,140
They can't see which dynasty they are from.

707
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,140
They are from the minority.

708
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,140
Now, they can't see which dynasty they belong to.

709
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,140
Ming dynasty?

710
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,140
Wang Zanghai is a Ming dynasty.

711
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,140
What's wrong?

712
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,140
He can build another dynasty?

713
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,140
He can. He is an old man.

714
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,140
You are so rude.

715
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,140
You are so rude.

716
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,140
You are so rude.

717
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,140
You are so rude.

718
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,140
Yes, you are right.

719
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,140
Fatty, you didn't see it.

720
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,140
The women are the ones who are given the Tibetan.

721
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,140
Really?

722
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,140
What is this custom?

723
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,140
I don't know what it is.

724
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:08,140
Do you think the brothers in the Tibetan are all dead?

725
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,140
So cruel.

726
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,140
It's even more cruel than the Yangtze River.

727
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:22,140
Look, the information of the painters is quite rich.

728
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,140
With these clues,

729
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:26,140
if you go to Chang'an Mountain to find the people who are familiar with the terrain,

730
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,140
you can find the exact location of the heaven.

731
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,140
But the heaven is buried under the snow mountain for several hundred years.

732
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,140
And the action is very soft.

733
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,140
It will cause a snow storm.

734
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,140
So, it is almost impossible to dig out the heaven.

735
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,140
It is difficult to dig out the heaven.

736
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:47,140
It is not a serious and serious work.

737
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,140
You?

738
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,140
Comrade Xiao, don't underestimate us.

739
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,140
We also dig out the heaven.

740
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:58,140
We also contribute to the business of the heaven.

741
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,140
We are doing this to protect the cultural relics.

742
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,140
We are doing this to protect the cultural relics.

743
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,140
Fatty, the tomb is not a cave.

744
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,140
It is a new place with a unique and unique history.

745
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,140
The Chinese archaeological research has developed a miracle.

746
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,140
You are right.

747
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,140
Don't go up the mountain.

748
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,140
You said you don't want to see it yourself.

749
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,140
I think so.

750
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,140
It's good.

751
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,140
We can go out together after we find a way out.

752
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,140
No.

753
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,140
I don't think so.

754
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,140
If I meet someone who is not polite,

755
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,140
I will be in a good place like this.

756
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,140
If you don't want to go,

757
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,140
you will have no chance.

758
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:38,140
I have to be patient now.

759
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,140
I haven't found the police yet.

760
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,140
10-gallon, go on the road and pretend to be a small chicken coop.

761
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,140
No.

762
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:39,140
Look, the road is so yellow.

763
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,140
We are protecting the world.

764
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:46,140
We are leading the next battle.

765
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,140
The habit of retreat is only a challenge.

766
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,140
Don't be afraid of the changes in your heart.

767
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,140
The feeling is so bright.

768
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:59,140
The song is a life-threatening fairy tale.

769
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,140
We let life be ordinary.

770
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,140
We find the new horizon together.

771
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,140
We will fly with our hands.

772
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,140
We will fight together.

773
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,140
The wind is blowing in the wind.

774
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,140
We will hold our hands tightly.

775
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,140
We will live our life naturally.

776
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:25,140
We will live our life naturally.

777
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:33,140
We will live our life naturally.

778
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:39,140
We will live our life naturally.

779
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:44,140
We will live our life naturally.

780
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:49,140
We will live our life naturally.

781
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,140
We let life be ordinary.

782
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,140
We find the new horizon together.

783
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,140
We will fly with our hands.

784
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,140
We will fight together.

785
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,140
The wind is blowing in the wind.

786
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,140
We will hold our hands tightly.

787
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,140
We will live our life naturally.

788
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:16,140
We will live our life naturally.

789
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:23,140
We will live our life naturally.

790
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,140
Thank you for watching.
