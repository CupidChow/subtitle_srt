00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,040
You are so cunning.

3
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,880
The three-star pair of the bronze tree is four meters long.

4
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,680
And it's made of a single branch.

5
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,360
You have to make a hundred meters of bronze tree

6
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,560
not only for the bronze tree,

7
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,040
but also for the whole structure.

8
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,520
How is that possible?

9
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,160
I'm telling the truth.

10
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,680
If you don't believe me, I can't do it.

11
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,480
Mr. Fang,

12
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
just listen to the story.

13
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,600
No.

14
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,320
Well,

15
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,160
what did you dig out at last?

16
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,040
I dug it out.

17
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,120
I found some jade pieces,

18
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,840
some old sandstone,

19
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,280
and this spirit.

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,440
After I went out,

21
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,880
my cousin disappeared.

22
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,640
When I took these things

23
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,200
and sold them to my hometown,

24
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,280
the police stopped me.

25
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,720
After that,

26
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,520
I went to the prison for two years.

27
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,080
I just came out.

28
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,840
I had a lot of white sandstone.

29
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,680
Luckily, I had a spirit.

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,800
Now,

31
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,840
I just want him to be reborn.

32
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,800
You want to be reborn?

33
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,920
You want to see me?

34
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,680
But the story is over?

35
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,320
Is it over?

36
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,920
Is it over?

37
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,160
Open your eyes.

38
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,440
I talk to you.

39
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,840
It's smooth.

40
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,080
But it's not smooth.

41
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,600
It is.

42
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,720
Please forgive me,

43
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,080
for your mistake.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No problem.

45
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,980
What are they doing?

46
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,760
It's cut.

47
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,300
You are very confident about what you're going to do.

48
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,240
Come on.

49
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,400
Cheer up!

50
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,400
Get up!

51
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,900
Slow down!

52
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,120
Stop it!

53
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,660
Sorry, my daughter...

54
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,100
I've decided to kill you.

55
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,100
I'm sure you'll be able to do something good.

56
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,100
Don't forget me.

57
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,100
Okay, then.

58
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,100
Take care.

59
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,100
Take care.

60
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,100
Please sit down.

61
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,100
Please sit down.

62
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,100
This old horse is a great man.

63
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,100
He's a great man,

64
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,100
but he's also a good man.

65
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,100
Otherwise, I'll make him fat.

66
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,100
I'll make him fat.

67
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,100
I'll make him fat.

68
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,100
Otherwise, I'll make him fat.

69
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,100
I'll make him fat.

70
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,100
He's a great man.

71
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100
Thank me for helping him.

72
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,100
With this money,

73
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
he'll be able to live a happy life.

74
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,100
He also told me

75
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
that the bronze tree is used to make human blood.

76
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,100
And that bell is not strong enough.

77
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,100
He'll be a monster with it.

78
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Listen to me.

79
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,100
I don't know if the bronze tree he said is real.

80
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,100
I want to see it.

81
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,100
Maybe we'll have this opportunity soon.

82
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
I heard that the buyer is on a leave.

83
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,100
So I'm going to take a leave.

84
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,100
I'll pay the price.

85
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
I'll make it up.

86
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,100
I'll make it up.

87
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
I think that guy

88
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,100
doesn't look like Yan Xi.

89
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Fatty,

90
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,100
look at the bronze bell.

91
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,100
There are seven stars in the western sea.

92
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,100
There are all of them.

93
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
There are more of them now.

94
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
Such a rare thing.

95
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,100
It's impossible to remember it.

96
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,100
And the bronze tree

97
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
is 100 meters high.

98
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,100
How big is it?

99
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,100
I don't know.

100
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,100
But you said that the bronze tree

101
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,100
must be a bull.

102
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,100
In the Bronze Age,

103
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,100
there are all kinds of human power and power.

104
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
Even if it's a bull,

105
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
it can't be made.

106
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,100
It's impossible to make it.

107
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,100
If it's really that big,

108
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,100
it can't be remembered in history.

109
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,100
No.

110
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,100
You're so stupid.

111
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,100
Don't be so silly.

112
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Go to sleep.

113
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,100
You didn't drink much, did you?

114
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,100
What are you looking for?

115
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,100
Why are you so shy?

116
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
Let me show him the house.

117
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
Let me tell you.

118
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,100
He was a merchant in ancient times.

119
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,100
But now he's a master of science.

120
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
You're a master of science.

121
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Is it reliable?

122
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,100
He's a master of science.

123
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,100
He has a master's degree in many universities.

124
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,100
Especially for the minority.

125
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
He's very good at it.

126
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,100
By the way,

127
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
I showed him the photo you sent me.

128
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,100
He was very worried.

129
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,100
Let's go.

130
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
Don't bother me.

131
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
You should have answered the question.

132
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,100
I'm Mr. Qi.

133
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
You've been reading for three hours.

134
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,100
What did you see?

135
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
I've read the book.

136
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
Thank God.

137
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
I'm not a good person.

138
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,100
I'm a good person.

139
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
I'm a good person.

140
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
I'm a good person.

141
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
I'm a good person.

142
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Thank God.

143
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,100
I've been studying the history of ancient people.

144
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,100
I've been studying the history of ancient people.

145
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,100
I've been studying the history of ancient people.

146
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
I've seen this thing for the first time.

147
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
Where did you get it?

148
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,100
Where did you get it?

149
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
This is the little thing that we found in the warehouse.

150
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
I don't know what it is.

151
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
I don't know what it is.

152
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Your family

153
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,100
has a good thing.

154
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Mr. Qi.

155
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Is there any explanation for this bell?

156
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,100
The bell of the same material

157
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,100
is made of material.

158
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,100
And its wind and rain.

159
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,100
You can see

160
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,100
that this is a high-end thing.

161
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,100
It's not a gun.

162
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,100
My guess is that it's

163
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,100
something from the West.

164
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
It should appear

165
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
between our flash and the north.

166
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
There is a missing ancient country.

167
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,100
The country of the dead.

168
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,100
The country of the dead?

169
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
Yes, the country of the dead.

170
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
The history of the country is a short time.

171
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
It appeared in the first building

172
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
of our original building.

173
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
It was very prosperous in the past.

174
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
But in the middle of the West

175
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
it suddenly disappeared.

176
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Although it disappeared,

177
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,100
we found its shadow

178
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
in some other classic.

179
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
Shanghai Jin.

180
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,100
There is such a description in Shanghai Jin.

181
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
There is a country

182
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,100
called the outside snake country.

183
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
The people of this country

184
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
call the human hand

185
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
as the spirit.

186
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
They call this pattern

187
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
on various objects.

188
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,100
So, the outside snake

189
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
is probably the snake country.

190
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Speaking of this snake country,

191
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
I can tell you

192
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,100
that I have studied its history.

193
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,100
Where did the snake country come from?

194
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Now, I have to study

195
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
the background of this snake country

196
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,100
which is separated from the Huaxu Valley.

197
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,100
It is the first and the last

198
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
of the Mu Xishu society.

199
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Huaxu Valley has

200
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
a legend of the human face snake.

201
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
The snake country

202
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
is probably separated from the Huaxu Valley.

203
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Qi Lang,

204
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,100
how much knowledge

205
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,100
do you have

206
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,100
from this ancient history?

207
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
Young man,

208
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
our history in China

209
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
has been divided

210
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,100
into three parts.

211
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
We will know

212
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
what will happen in the future.

213
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
What happened today

214
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,100
is known today.

215
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,100
But what happened in ancient times

216
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,100
especially the historical

217
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
which I mentioned

218
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
is not the same as the historical one.

219
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
Do you understand?

220
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,100
So, it can only be

221
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,100
the investigation and the evidence.

222
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,100
And it can never reach 100%.

223
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
This is the history.

224
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Beautiful.

225
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,100
Qi Lang,

226
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,100
today,

227
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,100
what you said to me

228
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,100
really helped me a lot.

229
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
But besides,

230
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
it also made you

231
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,100
desolate your country.

232
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,100
It is great that

233
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,100
you worked for

234
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
Bogd.

235
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,100
And because

236
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,100
I was a during your GOD

237
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
until today.

238
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,100
Thanks to

239
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,100
writing translations

240
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,100
for the great致hhh

241
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,100
and dongze for даity,

242
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
I am a poet

243
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,980
This person has been in the

244
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,100
Qingling region for many years

245
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,100
and has been tested on a ancient tomb.

246
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Look, can you see it?

247
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,100
Look carefully, this is the ancient tomb of the empire.

248
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,100
He took some pictures.

249
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,100
This is the painting in the tomb.

250
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,100
It records the scene of the empire's assassination.

251
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,100
Later, the news came out that

252
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,100
many experts followed him to the Qingling region

253
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,100
to find this ancient tomb.

254
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,100
But this tomb disappeared and was not found.

255
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
But this ancient tomb

256
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,100
from the god who told me about it

257
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,100
and this person I have judged on him.

258
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,100
I think he was right.

259
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,100
Why did this tomb disappear?

260
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,100
I couldn't find it.

261
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,100
I can't find it.

262
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,100
It's not reliable.

263
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,100
Don't you think there are things in these books?

264
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,100
If you didn't listen to Mr. Qi's explanation,

265
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,100
how do you know which book to look for?

266
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,100
I can find it.

267
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Wu Xie, what are you going to do next?

268
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,100
I want to read the books that Professor Qi gave me first.

269
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,100
To understand the result.

270
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,100
And then, personally, I will go to the Qingling region.

271
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
I will go to the underground.

272
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,100
I'm not going.

273
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,100
I'm not going.

274
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,100
There is only a big pit.

275
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,100
Mr. Qi said that if it was true,

276
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
it would be crazy.

277
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
If so many people went,

278
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
they would have found nothing.

279
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,100
Such a big tomb.

280
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,100
This is a miracle that a human's air-conditioner

281
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,100
is in the water.

282
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Don't you want to go there?

283
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,100
The miracle I want to see is

284
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,100
the ticket to my house.

285
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
Don't be so sad.

286
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Be happy.

287
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
You can't eat my pot at night.

288
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,100
No.

289
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,100
By the way,

290
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
look at the doll on your hand.

291
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
It's the one that Yu'er gave to me.

292
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,100
Isn't it special for you?

293
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,100
It seems to be more handsome than you.

294
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
You are so big.

295
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Okay, be happy.

296
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
Order anything you want.

297
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
I want to eat the fresh meat,

298
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,100
the red beans, the fried liver, the pork belly.

299
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,100
Okay.

300
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,100
Okay?

301
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
There is nothing like that.

302
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
Just a big pit.

303
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Do you have a seed?

304
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
I'll feed you with a seed.

305
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,100
Hey,

306
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
is this kid going to ride a bullпапGR Inspired?

307
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,100
A yup,

308
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,100
he was still training

309
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,120
that knight from the c uniformly session

310
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:43,400
and he almost compute significant

311
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,100
ское possessiveness in allِ

312
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,100
pinh!

313
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
I'm a local.

314
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,500
The two of you just ran in front of us.

315
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,700
It's a good thing.

316
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,900
You didn't get a ticket.

317
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,900
I can't see it.

318
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,900
You've done this job

319
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,100
without a ticket, right?

320
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,100
No, no, no.

321
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
You think too much.

322
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,500
We're all first-person.

323
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
We don't do dirty work.

324
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,300
Hurry up. Let's go.

325
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,900
This way, please.

326
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,500
Where's the chicken?

327
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,700
Wang Zhe.

328
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Xiaoxie is a big guy.

329
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,100
He's like a toy to him.

330
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,700
He's a flower.

331
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,900
Xiaoxie is in the back.

332
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,300
I'm the one who's giving him the noodles.

333
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,100
Hurry up.

334
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,100
The food is cold.

335
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,900
Hurry up.

336
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,700
What's the rush?

337
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,900
I can't run.

338
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Knock builder 1

339
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,900
It's imagineable.

340
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,500
I believe we are in the wrong place.

341
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,300
You know who we are inけui?

342
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,300
We've been banished.

343
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,500
What is bans Marion?

344
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
We are here for travel.

345
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,100
What kind of special exhibition do you recommend?

346
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,100
The local food is good.

347
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,100
It's good to eat.

348
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,100
Really?

349
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,100
Remember to buy some food later.

350
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,100
Here, let me have a taste.

351
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,100
You're welcome.

352
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,100
Thank you.

353
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,100
Thank you.

354
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,100
Thank you.

355
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Don't look.

356
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,100
Eat it.

357
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,100
It's cold.

358
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,100
I'll have a bite.

359
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,100
It's cold.

360
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,100
It's okay.

361
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,100
Two bare-faced people.

362
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,100
They don't know anything.

363
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
No need to be so polite.

364
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Thank you, lady.

365
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,100
There were some people who were in trouble.

366
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,100
They were talking nonsense.

367
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,100
The person who just said that we were in the study

368
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,100
said that we were not ordinary people.

369
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,100
The smell of soil must have been from the ground.

370
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,100
I was just talking about the study.

371
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,100
Then I came to the place.

372
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,100
I just came back from the bathroom.

373
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,100
I also met them.

374
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,100
It's a little strange.

375
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,100
Let me tell you.

376
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,100
The study is different from the one I've never studied.

377
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
It can be smelled in the same way.

378
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,100
It's more like a pair of old bubbles.

379
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,100
Will they go to the same place with us?

380
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Don't think about it.

381
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,100
There are many students in the ancient times.

382
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,100
Plus, we didn't study in the same way.

383
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,100
We only studied in the big pit.

384
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,100
I told you to hit it.

385
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,100
I'll buy the lottery ticket when I get back.

386
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,100
Okay.

387
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,100
You'll buy it when you hit it.

388
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,100
Fatty, you're right.

389
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,100
I saw the sunset.

390
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,100
Now I just want to use the sunset.

391
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,100
I don't know if it's useful.

392
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
Look at you.

393
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,100
You look like a rabbit.

394
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,100
You're a rabbit.

395
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,100
You're a rabbit.

396
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,100
You're a rabbit.

397
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,100
You're a rabbit.

398
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,100
You're a rabbit.

399
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
You're a rabbit.

400
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,100
You're a rabbit.

401
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,100
The car was lucky.

402
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,100
Drink some water.

403
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,100
Thank you.

404
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,100
I'll get you some medicine later.

405
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,100
Thank you.

406
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,100
Thank you.

407
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,100
It's too hard to ride a mountain.

408
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
5 seconds for a small and 10 for a big one.

409
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,100
I can do this in a car.

410
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,100
Look at you.

411
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,100
Fang Qian.

412
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100
Coming.

413
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Zhu Su, any place?

414
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,100
Yes, let's go.

415
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,100
Please come in.

416
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,100
Let's go.

417
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
What?

418
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,100
What a coincidence!

419
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,100
We meet again!

420
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,100
Who said it's not?

421
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,100
You must be here to hunt a monkey.

422
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,100
Hunt a monkey?

423
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
I misunderstood.

424
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,100
I misunderstood.

425
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100
I thought you were here to play.

426
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,100
What's wrong?

427
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,100
You should go to the bathroom.

428
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,100
It's a security environment.

429
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,100
Hurry up.

430
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
Don't tell anyone.

431
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,100
I'm coming.

432
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,100
Why do you meet these two guys?

433
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,100
It seems that I've been hunting animals for the first time.

434
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,100
You don't want to eat?

435
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,100
It's nothing.

436
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,100
It's not a goal.

437
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,100
At least it's like this.

438
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,100
Otherwise, the monkey wouldn't know

439
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,100
if you disappeared.

440
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100
Fine, fine, fine.

441
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,100
Let's go.

442
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,100
I'll go.

443
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,100
Who is it?

444
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,100
Look at the key.

445
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,100
Hello.

446
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,100
The sand is wet.

447
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,100
The villagers are easy to wet their skin.

448
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,100
I came to give you a bottle of this.

449
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
It's not a sin.

450
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,100
I know it's good.

451
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,100
I won't disturb you then.

452
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,100
Do you think they followed us?

453
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,100
Look at the key.

454
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,100
They are not simple.

455
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,100
It must not be a box.

456
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,100
Since ancient times,

457
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
the 800 Li Qin Chuan

458
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,100
is a famous cultural古蹟 and ruins.

459
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
Especially in the north.

460
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,100
There are many underground tombs.

461
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,100
Other ruins are deep.

462
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,100
It's even more difficult to climb the mountain.

463
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,100
So,

464
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,100
the ancient times

465
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,100
are all places where the treasured people were buried.

466
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,100
It's so long.

467
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,100
Tell me honestly.

468
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,100
Have you ever been a singer?

469
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,100
I...

470
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,100
Since I met you,

471
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,100
I've been a singer

472
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,100
and I've been a singer.

473
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,100
I've been a singer.

474
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,100
I've been a singer.

475
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,100
Okay.

476
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,100
You're talking about the eyes.

477
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,100
Really.

478
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,100
Although we're not the same target,

479
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,100
we're more of a human.

480
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,100
And the old man behind your eyes

481
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,100
is quite handsome.

482
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Maybe he has a few lives on his hands.

483
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,100
No.

484
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,100
You go to rest first.

485
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,100
I'll talk to them.

486
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,100
Be careful.

487
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,100
We've been singers.

488
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,100
It's okay.

489
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
Did I give you anything to eat?

490
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,100
No, thanks.

491
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,100
I'll go to sleep.

492
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Take care.

493
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
Here, have some water.

494
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,100
I don't know

495
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,100
if you can taste the food.

496
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,100
Anyway,

497
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,100
we're all in charge of the food.

498
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,100
Madam.

499
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
Yes.

500
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
What special dishes do we have?

501
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
We have long-tailed dishes.

502
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,100
But the chicken and pork

503
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,100
are all homemade.

504
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,100
The dishes are homemade.

505
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,100
The mushrooms and wild vegetables

506
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,100
are all from my husband.

507
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,100
He's from the mountains.

508
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,100
He's a natural and natural.

509
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,100
Okay.

510
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,100
You start to be a team.

511
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,100
I'll make a lot of dishes.

512
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,100
I'll make a lot of dishes.

513
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Then your friend won't eat.

514
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
He just got off the bus.

515
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,100
He's finally asleep.

516
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
Okay.

517
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,100
Madam.

518
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,100
Do you have a guide?

519
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,100
What guide?

520
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,100
I want to go to the mountains

521
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
and make a survey in the Minstrel Village.

522
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,100
Yes.

523
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,100
Then you have to find a local to take you there.

524
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,100
This is the most high mountain in the city.

525
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,100
It's over 1,000 meters high.

526
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,100
Your car can't get in.

527
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,100
You have to turn your feet.

528
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,100
If you can turn around in this area,

529
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,100
if you can get out of the mountain,

530
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,100
there will be many people who can't get out.

531
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,100
Then you have to introduce me to a good guide.

532
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,100
You have to rely on the guide.

533
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,100
Okay.

534
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
I'll go ask you

535
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
if anyone wants to take this job.

536
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,100
Okay.

537
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,100
Thank you, madam.

538
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
Sit down.

539
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,100
I'll go to Zhangluo.

540
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,100
Okay.

541
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,100
Are you going to the Minstrel Village?

542
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,100
Me?

543
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,100
We are here to get a monkey.

544
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,100
Just kidding.

545
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,100
We are here to do business.

546
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,100
We are here to make a special product.

547
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
He Dao.

548
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,100
Cheng,

549
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,100
you have contributed to the local economy.

550
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,100
Is it easy to make a special product?

551
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,100
It's a hard money to make a special product.

552
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
It's not as good as you.

553
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
The research is about

554
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
the minority of the ethnic groups.

555
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,100
It's a big deal.

556
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
It's a big deal.

557
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,100
Right?

558
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,100
We are doing research.

559
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,100
The local research report is about

560
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,100
the number of people who invest in it.

561
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,100
It's about Tukele.

562
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,100
Drink it.

563
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,100
Drink it.

564
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,100
Fatty.

565
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,100
Fatty.

566
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
Fatty.

567
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,100
Fatty.

568
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,100
Fatty.

569
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,100
Why are you hiding here?

570
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,100
Are you going to the cinema?

571
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,100
Are you going to the doctor?

572
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,100
They are gone.

573
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,100
Cheng.

574
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,100
We should go.

575
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,100
Take a bath.

576
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,100
We don't need this.

577
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,100
The forest has a tree.

578
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,100
Brawn House

579
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,100
Why do you walk so early?

580
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,100
You can't wait.

581
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,260
No,

582
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,260
we have changed the topic.

583
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,220
The whole procedure is good.

584
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,460
So it's good

585
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,320
to have fun here.

586
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,020
But it's hard to be good.

587
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,120
Take some dried grain.

588
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,160
Take it.

589
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
Eat listened grain and communityFOM.

590
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,100
Please give health care to staff members.

591
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,100
Ok.

592
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
Thank you.

593
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
Take care.

594
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,100
Thank you.

595
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,100
Let's go.

596
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,100
wiggle wiggle

597
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,100
Everybody laughs

598
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,720
Break

599
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,520
glue

600
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,740
What they all say

601
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,560
Have you heard our jokes so ready for the new year?

602
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,760
We go now.

603
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,940
These guys can run.

604
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,940
I'm so tired of wearing clothes.

605
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,540
I can't even take a fire.

606
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,340
I need to eat something cold.

607
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,340
You should be careful.

608
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,140
How long will it take to walk?

609
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,540
I'm almost out of breath.

610
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,340
You know how to eat and drink.

611
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,740
You're fat.

612
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,340
You're so young.

613
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,940
You can't even lift your legs.

614
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,540
You see, Mr. Wang and Mr. Li

615
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,740
are good at raising their children.

616
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,140
They're not like you.

617
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,140
I've been a little bit shy.

618
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,140
But, Mr. Tai, don't worry.

619
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,940
As long as we're done walking,

620
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,340
I'll learn to be healthy.

621
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,740
I'm a little bit shy.

622
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,540
I can walk for two days.

623
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,940
I have no time to walk.

624
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,740
If you can't take it,

625
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,540
go down the mountain with me.

626
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,740
Don't lift your legs.

627
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,340
Don't, don't, don't.

628
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,540
Don't say that, Mr. Tai.

629
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,940
I'm just a rich man.

630
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,740
The bosses are eating my soup.

631
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,940
Maybe this soup

632
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,500
will make my life

633
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,140
more comfortable.

634
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,940
Don't worry.

635
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,940
We've made it.

636
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,740
As long as you make it,

637
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,540
we'll do whatever we want.

638
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,740
This time,

639
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,140
we'll do everything

640
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,540
we can do in our lifetime.

641
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,740
In the future,

642
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,340
the big world of flowers in Hong Kong

643
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,340
will be the place

644
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,140
where we'll spend a lot of money.

645
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,540
Don't talk too much.

646
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,940
Is this all in there?

647
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,940
You're talking nonsense.

648
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,740
You're too much.

649
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,340
Since we're working together,

650
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,340
we need to trust each other.

651
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,740
To be honest,

652
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,340
as long as we go to the place we're going to,

653
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,740
you won't want to dig

654
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,340
the tomb of Qin Shi Huang.

655
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,740
I don't believe you.

656
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,540
If you don't have any chance,

657
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,540
tell me.

658
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,940
Where did you get the information?

659
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,140
Let me have a look.

660
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,940
Yes, tell me.

661
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,340
Look at you two.

662
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,940
What's so good about this?

663
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,740
Boss Li, I've known you for so long.

664
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,940
Why don't you tell us?

665
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,340
Yes, tell us.

666
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,340
Anyway, you're staying here.

667
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,140
Just pretend to be a good person.

668
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:55,940
Tell us.

669
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,140
Tell us.

670
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,140
Since you all want to know,

671
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,940
I can tell you.

672
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,340
I wouldn't tell anyone

673
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,940
about this.

674
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,540
But I'm a person.

675
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,740
I'm telling you,

676
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,540
you can't tell anyone.

677
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,140
Do you have any idea

678
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,140
that you can find the place

679
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,940
where we're going to?

680
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,740
How can you be so mysterious?

681
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,340
Actually, I don't know the secret.

682
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,540
This has something to do with my ancestors.

683
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,740
In our ancestral tomb,

684
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,140
there's this thing.

685
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,740
It's said that when we were in Beihui,

686
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,540
the war was going on.

687
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,140
We didn't know how many times we were going to fight.

688
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,540
The emperor of Shang Tuo

689
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,940
was always in the middle of the war.

690
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,540
He was already dead.

691
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,740
Then the people would be even more indignant.

692
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,140
The people of Chenglian were basically dead.

693
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,740
My ancestors were only six years old.

694
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,340
They were going to go out to the Yangtze River

695
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,740
to maintain their family.

696
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,340
What a coincidence!

697
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,940
Peace?!

698
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,540
What's happening?!

699
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,940
She joined right away.

700
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,340
When they attack the village?

701
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,740
That's true.

702
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,540
She's going to be angry in the Williamson region.

703
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,440
The place is so beautiful.

704
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,340
Such a valley.

705
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,540
She's brilliant and likewise a star.

706
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,740
She's training the airship very badly.

707
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:43,360
or

708
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:49,780
RIGHT歌

709
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:03,260
ís

710
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,880
K dis

711
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,480
Get out of here.

712
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,720
Please...

713
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,700
lm asynchronously requested for you.

714
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,260
ivol.

715
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,780
Can they capture Synantsu?

716
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,780
I'm not sure if it's because of the smell of sugar.

717
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,780
It's so strange.

718
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,780
They say that Pengzu is 800 years old.

719
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,780
I don't know if he's sick in the past 800 years.

720
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,780
Qianzhen, do you think I can live to 18 years old

721
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,780
if I eat such bitter medicine every day?

722
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,780
The fifth place is the Martial Soul.

723
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,780
The fifth place is the Martial Soul.

724
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,780
He's only 39 years old.

725
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,780
The fifth place is the Eagle-Colored.

726
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,780
He's 44 years old.

727
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,780
He's not as good as the others.

728
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,780
Qianzhi, you...

729
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,780
I'm willing to protect you with my life.

730
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,780
Qianzhi,

731
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,780
you can't talk.

732
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,780
You're not good at acting.

733
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,780
You should do something that should be done.

734
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,780
As long as you can stand by,

735
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,780
even if you're a great horse,

736
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,780
you won't be disliked.

737
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,780
Moreover,

738
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,780
he still needs your mother-in-law.

739
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,780
He needs you to help him find more treasures.

740
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,780
In this way, you can protect your family

741
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,780
and your tribe.

742
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,780
Everything I've done is for you.

743
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,780
The Great Si Ma is a powerful horse.

744
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,780
He needs a young and ignorant little emperor.

745
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,780
What if the new emperor comes to power

746
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,780
and doesn't know how to jump out

747
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,780
and opposes me?

748
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,780
Isn't the Great Si Ma too embarrassed?

749
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,780
I'll kill you, you thief.

750
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,780
My sick body

751
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,780
can't live to the fullest.

752
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,780
If I die soon,

753
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,780
I'll have to suffer for a few more years.

754
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,780
These are the tombstones you found these years.

755
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,780
I didn't find any tombstones.

756
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,780
After the tombstone is put in the tomb,

757
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,780
it will be re-inserted.

758
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,780
Until the emperor needs them to dig again.

759
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,780
These are the tombstones

760
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,780
that I've already dug.

761
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,780
These are still not dug.

762
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,780
There are still so many.

763
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,780
You mean

764
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,780
to take out the tombstones

765
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,780
and exchange them for gold and silver.

766
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,780
Then you can use them to buy a horse

767
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,780
and then you can fight with the Great Si Ma.

768
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,780
Qian Zhi, do you know

769
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,780
that I'm not that scared anymore?

770
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,780
What's the use of power?

771
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,780
Think about it.

772
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,780
Qin, Huang, Han, Wu, Yi, Tong,

773
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,780
all have the power to fight without victory.

774
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,780
It's the same.

775
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,780
Can't you let yourself be old?

776
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,780
And if I

777
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,780
fight for power

778
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,780
in such a short life,

779
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,780
what do you mean?

780
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,780
You should take back everything you got.

781
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,780
I didn't find any tombstones.

782
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,780
I found a large amount of documents

783
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,780
in the tombstones.

784
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,780
I found some clues about longevity.

785
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,780
What if...

786
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,780
No!

787
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,780
No!

788
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,780
No!

789
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,780
Go!

790
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,780
Go!

791
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,780
I was born in the great Si Ma.

792
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,780
I was born in a faraway land.

793
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,780
I didn't find any tombstones.

794
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,780
I've been fighting for a long time.

795
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,780
I was too young.

796
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,780
I didn't know

797
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,780
which side won and which side lost.

798
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,780
I waited until everyone was taken away.

799
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,780
Then he escaped from the grass.

800
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,780
He was a corpse

801
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,780
in this land.

802
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,780
But he had no choice.

803
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,780
He had to go through

804
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,780
this deserted wilderness

805
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,780
on his way home.

806
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,780
He had to use his head to go down.

807
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,780
沈,

808
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,780
沈...

809
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,820
Go away!

810
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,500
Go away!

811
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,980
We are not ordinary people

812
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:54,780
We found new flat with the sun and the clouds

813
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,180
The sky is dark, the sky is dark

814
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,980
The world is crazy, the sky is dark

815
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,980
The world is crazy, the sky is dark

816
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,980
The sky is dark, the sky is dark

817
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:12,980
I'm not afraid, I'm just ordinary

818
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:19,980
I'm not afraid, I'm just ordinary
