Episode 1

2
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Lao Qi, do you know about this place?

3
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I know a lot.

4
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But I heard that there is a snake-mei-tong fish here.

5
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No wonder there is a house-level wood-layer.

6
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It was because of the lack of smoke,

7
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
that they wanted to protect the snake-mei-tong fish.

8
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's why they arranged a new life-size room in the third floor.

9
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In order to find those who are not old enough to live,

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
they should know that the longevity tree is fake.

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Then, Mr. Zhang is the first person to know about this.

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Lao Qi, how much do you know about Mr. Zhang?

13
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Not much.

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But I heard a rumor about his death.

15
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Mr. Zhang didn't believe that Mr. Zhang would really destroy the longevity tree's secret,

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
but he wanted to protect their brother and sister.

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, he thought of a way to make both of them die.

18
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Mr. Zhang, I'm sorry.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Uncle.

48
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,240
It wasn't me.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Qing нельзя backup.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Qingcommun is my sister.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I believes her.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But she's a married man after all.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
She's a woman.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
She's very sensitive.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What if she mulherbs you?

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,400
He meant you.

57
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,240
Follow me.

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The game is very exciting.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The game is very exciting.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The game is very exciting.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The game is very exciting.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The game is very exciting.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The game is very exciting.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The game is very exciting.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The game is very exciting.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The game is very exciting.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The game is very exciting.

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The game is very exciting.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The game is very exciting.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The game is very exciting.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The game is very exciting.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The game is very exciting.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The game is very exciting.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The game is very exciting.

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The game is very exciting.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The game is very exciting.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The game is very exciting.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The game is very exciting.

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The game is very exciting.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The game is very exciting.

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The game is very exciting.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The game is very exciting.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The game is very exciting.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The game is very exciting.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The game is very exciting.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The game is very exciting.

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But this is a very interesting time.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is very exciting.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But with the9l-9l decryption

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,960
and pre-personnel

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
it is very frustrating that

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the sales is at a very high price

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,500
but in that price

94
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,000
you study hard and develop a new wealth of money.

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,620
So this is really if youunya

96
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,000
so this is really if you really want a competitive gold

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
it is really if you really want a competitive gold

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,600
What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?

99
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,200
No, you're still the same as before.

100
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,760
You hide something in your heart.

101
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,480
You never tell me.

102
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,480
We've been married for so long.

103
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,400
But I feel like I'm an outsider.

104
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,280
You're helping my brother find the number of longevity.

105
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,160
Didn't you say you didn't?

106
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,880
I believe you.

107
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,720
You don't believe me.

108
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,200
You came to find him with me.

109
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,080
Buxue.

110
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,920
You know what he wants.

111
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,520
He can't get what he wants.

112
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,960
Why must you be his partner?

113
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,960
I told you.

114
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,800
Don't you remember?

115
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,640
He's my brother.

116
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,720
After my parents died, I was left with only one family.

117
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,200
And then it was you.

118
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,240
He asked me to marry you.

119
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,520
And I did.

120
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,000
Because I knew he wouldn't harm me.

121
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,000
What did he ask you to do?

122
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,560
Even if it was wrong or wrong,

123
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,040
you wouldn't do it.

124
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,760
You want to do it, right?

125
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Yes.

126
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
I don't want to harm my brother.

127
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,800
But I'm willing to marry you.

128
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,680
But Buxue.

129
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,560
Why did you marry me?

130
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,800
You didn't do it for power.

131
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,680
He's loyal to you.

132
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,800
I couldn't understand his trust.

133
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,480
He told me everything.

134
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,800
He won't harm me or you.

135
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,040
He thinks we're family.

136
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,280
He wants us to be together forever.

137
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,400
He's wrong.

138
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,080
Qingming.

139
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,240
I found out.

140
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,240
I don't know you and my brother at all.

141
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,200
It's...

142
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,360
I was surprised.

143
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,280
I didn't know how Dany was.

144
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,680
Maybe he's the lucky one.

145
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,280
But...

146
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,920
He let me quit my job.

147
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,680
I'm soubby.

148
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,880
I can't.

149
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,800
But what if I winning?

150
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
You?

151
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,080
You're talking nonsense.

152
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,360
It's just a concept of a high-ranking spirit.

153
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
No.

154
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
Do you know

155
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,520
what is a human heart?

156
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,560
Do you know what love is?

157
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
You don't know.

158
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,760
Because I never felt your love for me,

159
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,560
and you love me now.

160
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,360
You took away my love for you.

161
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,560
Don't you think you're cruel?

162
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
Here.

163
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,480
A thousand years ago,

164
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,840
someone found the Book of Eternal Life.

165
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
The prince

166
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,880
was a noble and noble spirit.

167
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,080
He was not even 18 years old.

168
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,560
He was just a young man.

169
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,440
But he gave up.

170
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,280
Do you know why?

171
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,920
Because he's a coward and a coward.

172
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
Wrong!

173
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,600
A connection between love and human heart

174
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,640
is not based on time.

175
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Qingping,

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,200
I'm sorry for telling you.

177
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,240
You chose me.

178
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,360
I didn't give you happiness.

179
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,960
Maybe it's because I'm a coward.

180
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Because...

181
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,320
Because I really don't want to

182
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,440
fight against someone I respect the most.

183
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,000
I saw my brother walking on a path of injustice.

184
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,360
I can't let him continue to walk.

185
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
What do you want?

186
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,800
I'm sending you back to your brother.

187
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,240
Tell him I've destroyed everything here.

188
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,880
You'll forget me.

189
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,480
We're meant to be.

190
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,080
I can only pray that you'll live a happy life.

191
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
What do you mean?

192
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,080
What do you want?

193
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,680
When you're gone,

194
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,680
I'll blow this wood up.

195
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
I'll never let you worry about him again.

196
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
No.

197
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
No.

198
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
No.

199
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
No, no.

200
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,880
You've blown this wood up.

201
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,480
You've blown it up.

202
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,480
You're going to destroy my brother.

203
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,880
You're going to kill him.

204
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,680
No. No. No.

205
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
You can't do this.

206
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,680
Qingping.

207
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Qingping.

208
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
Wake up.

209
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,080
I'm begging you, okay?

210
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,680
I don't want you to blow this wood up.

211
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,880
I won't let you destroy my brother.

212
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,280
I won't.

213
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Qingping.

214
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Qingping.

215
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,880
No.

216
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,880
Please, even if I beg you,

217
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,480
give me back what you've been given.

218
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,280
I don't want you to destroy my brother.

219
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,880
Do you want to see me die?

220
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,480
Is it that important to me in your heart?

221
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,480
Give me back what you've been given.

222
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,480
Okay.

223
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
Qingping.

224
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
I'll give it to you.

225
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Put your gun down.

226
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
Give it to me.

227
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
I'll give it to you.

228
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
I'll give it to you.

229
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
Look.

230
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,480
This is what you and your brother have been looking for.

231
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:40,320
Z

232
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,240
You went for life...

233
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,200
but how did you fall down on your hand?

234
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,560
When I say I'll stay alive,

235
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,480
will you let me die?

236
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,100
Will you let me die?

237
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,600
What will you do if I die?

238
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,920
If you let me die,

239
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,340
will you let me die?

240
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,340
Tell me, how will I save you?

241
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,560
No way.

242
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,940
Do you have any help?

243
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,600
Master,

244
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,540
remember,

245
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,940
don't start anymore.

246
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,940
Is there anyone?

247
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,940
Is there anyone? Help her!

248
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,940
Mother, tell me what to do!

249
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,940
Brother!

250
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,940
Brother, I must save you!

251
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,940
I must!

252
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,940
I must!

253
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,940
I must save you!

254
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,940
Help her!

255
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,940
Shun Su!

256
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,940
Wait!

257
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,940
Don't come over!

258
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,940
Don't come over!

259
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,940
Don't come over!

260
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,940
Now...

261
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,940
Now...

262
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,940
Now someone believes in us.

263
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,940
Shizu!

264
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,940
What are you doing?

265
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,940
Are you so stubborn?

266
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,940
Don't come over!

267
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,940
Cheng!

268
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,940
Don't come over!

269
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,940
Cheng!

270
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,940
Qing Le is going to find Brother now.

271
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,940
Brother will be here soon.

272
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,940
When Brother comes to see me,

273
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,940
there will be a mechanism out there.

274
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,940
When they come,

275
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,940
you will close this mechanism.

276
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,940
Do you understand?

277
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,940
Do you understand?

278
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,940
I won't leave you here.

279
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,940
Qing Ping?

280
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,940
Brother!

281
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,940
Qing Ping?

282
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,940
Brother!

283
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,940
I can't! I can't!

284
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,940
I can't! I can't!

285
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,940
Go!

286
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,940
I must stay here!

287
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,940
I must stay here!

288
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,940
I will do all these real things today.

289
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,940
I will let Qing Ping and Brother out.

290
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,940
I will tell everyone in this world.

291
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,940
The so-called long-life magic is a magic.

292
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,940
If I can't do this,

293
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,940
what is the purpose of my death?

294
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,940
What is it?

295
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,940
The H�h rejected all figuring and bending costumes on the way

296
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,940
couldn't be certain soon enough.

297
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,940
If you can keep them,

298
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,940
I will fly more if no need marvelous intent.

299
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,940
You will pay the same price as I pay if the whole thingジ're wrong.

300
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,940
Take care of yourself!

301
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,940
Fucking con표ids!

302
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,860
This is your last mission.

303
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,180
You must finish it.

304
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,140
Brother, help him!

305
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,500
I'm done.

306
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,940
Go!

307
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,740
Brother!

308
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,900
Brother, help him!

309
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,460
Brother!

310
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,460
They...

311
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,540
No!

312
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,860
No!

313
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,380
Da Shan, you can't go there.

314
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,380
You'll die if you go there.

315
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,140
Don't you understand?

316
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,140
This is the factory.

317
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,340
Do you see it?

318
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,660
Do you understand?

319
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,620
Why don't you save him?

320
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,380
Don't.

321
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,900
modulus

322
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,820
You're simply

323
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,940
a ghost.

324
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,060
The animal is now comfortable here.

325
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,420
It has noenta an Iron门.

326
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,060
Don't be mad.

327
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,940
Don't be mad.

328
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,180
It's not a game.

329
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,660
Go away!

330
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,700
Go away!

331
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,680
job in lu muscular

332
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,480
diligent

333
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:43,020
Me

334
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,700
16

335
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:54,220
Seven

336
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:59,620
We can't die!

337
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,740
It's therend of time forever,

338
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,300
and now which is the end?

339
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:01,440
Since theret

340
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,460
after the alliance were completed,

341
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,560
go here to suicide

342
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,700
That's your grandfather's notebook

343
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,900
about that man who who is the sadistic

344
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,300
you know it?

345
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,540
me.

346
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:15,920
The secret

347
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,760
then A Diders brother

348
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,440
do know who's that who's got something on me?

349
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,440
They were killed by Pan Zi.

350
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,440
Pan Zi?

351
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,440
Pan Zi is here.

352
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
Has Uncle Cang come?

353
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
What do you know?

354
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
Don't ask me why.

355
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
I never ask you.

356
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
Where is Uncle Cang?

357
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Guess who is hiding in the coffin?

358
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
Open it and you'll know.

359
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,440
Why do you like to guess?

360
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
Come on, let's do it.

361
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,440
One, two, three, go!

362
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
Go!

363
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
Go!

364
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
General Yapa.

365
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
You know him?

366
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
He's not my brother.

367
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
What's your name?

368
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,440
I'm Yapa.

369
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,440
What do you know?

370
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
I'm Yapa.

371
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,440
Do you know me?

372
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
Yes.

373
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,440
Who are you?

374
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
I'm Yapa.

375
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440

376
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440

Are you from Yapa?

381
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,440
I'm from Yapa.

382
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,440
I'm from Yapa.

383
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,440
How is it?

384
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,440
I'm Yapa.

385
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
What is your name?

386
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,440
I'm Yapa.

387
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
I'm Yapa.

388
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
And you are from Yapa.

389
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,440
I'm Yapa.

390
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
General.

391
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
You know him?

392
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,440
Isn't he the man in the video of Qin Ling?

393
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,440
I saw him with Xiao Xiao.

394
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
Secret.

395
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,440
If you can see it, you know I'm trying to make a comparison.

396
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,440
But where is the snake and the snake?

397
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,440
Or there are no other clues?

398
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
Tian Zhen.

399
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
It's Commander Zhang.

400
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,440
He came here.

401
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,440
He must be like us.

402
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,440
He came to this city through that coffin.

403
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,440
So Commander Zhang also saw the insidious mark here?

404
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,440
He not only saw the insidious mark,

405
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
but also...

406
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,440
He must have found the secret of Changsheng tree.

407
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,440
Maybe the price of Changsheng tree will make them die.

408
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
He can't let this happen.

409
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
So he didn't tell anyone.

410
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
No wonder he came here.

411
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
He is just a guard.

412
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,440
Then we can't explain where the snake and the snake are.

413
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,440
No one will hurt a corpse who has a corpse.

414
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,440
So the snake and the snake are...

415
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,440
on Commander Zhang's body.

416
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
We should be careful.

417
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,440
The one who found the snake and the snake are like Commander Zhang.

418
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,440
He mentioned this many times in the last season.

419
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,440
He doesn't understand Commander Zhang's way.

420
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,440
So Commander Zhang is relying on himself

421
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,440
to keep this secret for so many years.

422
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,440
What are you doing?

423
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
What did I do?

424
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,440
I'm just trying to find out.

425
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,440
What did you do?

426
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,440
What did I do?

427
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,440
You...

428
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,440
I didn't do anything. What's wrong?

429
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,440
Watch out!

430
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
What are you doing?

431
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
He's trying to catch the enemy.

432
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,440
Brother! Are you okay?

433
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
Brother!

434
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,440
Stop!

435
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,440
Stop!

436
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,440
Stop!

437
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,440
You want this, right?

438
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
I'll give it to you!

439
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,440
Take it!

440
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
Zhu!

441
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,440
Zhu!

442
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,440
Run!

443
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
Little Hua! Run!

444
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
Run!

445
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,440
Go!

446
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,440
Go!

447
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,440
You want to die? Run!

448
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,440
Go!

449
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,440
Run!

450
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
Run!

451
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:49,440
The End

452
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,440
What should we do now?

453
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,440
What can we do?

454
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,440
We can't shoot the gun.

455
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,440
We can't kill him.

456
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
We can't fight the enemy

457
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,440
with the anti-aircraft gun.

458
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,440
We can't go back.

459
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,440
The End

460
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
The End

461
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
The enemy is coming again.

462
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,440
Fatty, what did you say?

463
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
I said, you're a bastard.

464
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,440
Be careful. Don't shoot the enemy.

465
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Old Qin, you're not a soldier.

466
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,440
This big brother owes me a life.

467
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,440
Wait!

468
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Did you see it?

469
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
We have to put the jade sword on it

470
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
so we can close the gate.

471
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,440
I'll get the jade sword.

472
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,440
I'll get it.

473
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,440
Go!

474
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,440
Everyone, be careful!

475
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
What's this? A little help?

476
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,440
Fine. I'll die with you today.

477
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,440
How many more bullets?

478
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,440
Three more.

479
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,440
Tell me the time. Go!

480
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,440
The End

481
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,440
What are you doing?

482
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
Don't shoot the enemy.

483
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
The End

484
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,440
Xiaohua!

485
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,440
Brother, I've never asked you before.

486
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,440
Are you Xiaohua's man?

487
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,440
Yes.

488
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,440
Why didn't he tell you?

489
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Be careful!

490
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
Don't worry, brother.

491
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,440
I'm here to play your game.

492
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,440
The End

493
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,440
Uncle San, why are you here?

494
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,440
Uncle San, tell me.

495
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
Why are you here?

496
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,440
Uncle San, what happened?

497
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
What happened?

498
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
Tell me!

499
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
Nothing happened.

500
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
Go away, kid.

501
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
Your friend is waiting for you.

502
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,440
Uncle San,

503
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
Uncle San,

504
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
Uncle San!

505
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
Why don't you tell me the truth?

506
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
I'm a bandit, Uncle San.

507
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
I'm a bandit!

508
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,440
Listen, kid,

509
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
if you don't go,

510
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,440
your friend will be dead.

511
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
The End

512
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
The End

513
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,440
Give me some strength!

514
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,440
The End

515
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,440
The End

516
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,440
Xiaohua!

517
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,440
The End

518
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,440
The End

519
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,440
Xiaohua! Xiaohua!

520
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,440
How are you?

521
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,440
I'm fine.

522
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,440
Fatty!

523
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,440
These guys are too strong.

524
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,440
Huo Qicheng,

525
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,440
let's have a fight.

526
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,440
We can't hold on any longer.

527
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,440
Go!

528
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,440
The End

529
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,440
How did the gate open?

530
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,440
The gate can only be opened from outside.

531
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,440
Who locked the door?

532
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,440
The body is gone.

533
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,440
The End

534
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,440
Have a good cooperation.

535
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,440
The End

536
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,440
The End

537
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,440
The End

538
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,440
The End

539
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,440
The End

540
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,440
The End
