1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The End

2
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Episode 1

3
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Luo Youping.

4
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The location of this hole is weird, isn't it?

5
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And there's no gap between the hole and the tunnel.

6
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's not used for balance.

7
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Why does Wang Zahai make such a hole?

8
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think there are two possibilities for a wild archaeologist to be a fat man.

9
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Tell me.

10
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Respect.

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Please start your performance.

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The first possibility is that the director has hidden a treasure inside.

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He doesn't want to let outsiders find out, so he made a mirror.

14
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He's lying.

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He's really here to make a treasure?

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It should be more mysterious, right?

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's too easy to put it behind a mirror.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The second possibility is that the mirror is a very important tool in the water.

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Maybe there's some way.

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Water?

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Water means that if you open the door in a room, it means that you're going to go out or come in.

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
If you put something in the room, then there's only a ghost.

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Go, go, go.

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You're not going to bring it?

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Where's the ghost?

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't make a mess with your hand.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Why is there no water?

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I might have to go in again.

29
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No, you were here to do something.

30
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I can't let you go again.

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
For you, this might just be a surprise.

32
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But for me, it's a huge miracle.

33
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Is this miracle really that important to you?

34
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
More important than your life?

35
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It seems that it's very important to finish a sentence.

36
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay, Meryopin, if you really want to go in, then I'll go with you.

37
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The air is so deep, it doesn't matter.

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You saved me just now.

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
If this secret room is really that important to you, then I, Sanye, will go back to the end.

40
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No, calm down.

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I think we should go up first.

42
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We've prepared all the food for this oxygen.

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let's do it again.

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
With this experience, we'll eat the beans.

45
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Hurry up and join the Aom Shimp Entertainment Center 94466.

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Come.

47
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Are you going to talk about the little thing?

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Meryopin, we were here together at the Sea of ​​Mood.

49
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't want you to be in any accident.

50
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh.

51
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What have you put on your shoulder?

52
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It took me so long to put on it.

53
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Hurry away.

54
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hurry!

55
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What have you done?

56
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Wait!

57
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Who is this?

58
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Run!

59
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You're so clumsy.

60
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Don't shout.

61
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He doesn't look right.

62
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Are you stupid?

63
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:45,160
I was confused when I was in the

64
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
police station.

65
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We don't even know if he is pretending.

66
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let's gather the weapons and tie him up.

67
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Then we'll send him to the police station.

68
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You're so stupid.

69
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're so stupid.

70
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We don't have Xu Hezhen in the police station.

71
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He's the one who came.

72
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We were tricked by him.

73
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm here to find my uncle.

74
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You...

75
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
He's so stupid.

76
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He's so stupid.

77
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He's so stupid.

78
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We don't know.

79
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Brother, it's so hard here.

80
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I think we should go out.

81
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Wait.

82
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You have to hide.

83
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
He's hiding here.

84
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What are you doing?

85
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Enough. Stop looking.

86
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
There's something.

87
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Stop looking.

88
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You're dead.

89
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What is that?

90
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's a red tree.

91
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's a golden tree.

92
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You can't move it.

93
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We'll see.

94
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What if there's something?

95
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
We can't move it.

96
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We'll be a police officer.

97
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We've been here for a long time.

98
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We're not afraid of anything.

99
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Right?

100
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm not afraid.

101
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm just worried about Brother.

102
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Follow me.

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Don't fall.

104
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Follow me.

105
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Don't fall.

106
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Come back.

107
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What?

108
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What?

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What?

110
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What?

111
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What?

112
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Comrade,

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
how much is this mountain fox tree?

114
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm not talking about you.

115
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
16 yuan.

116
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's not 16.1 grams.

117
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Who's that?

118
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Are you sure?

119
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm so worried about what's going on.

120
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Why are they so different?

121
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Am I wrong?

122
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Or are they wrong?

123
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
They're not good at luck.

124
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What about the bell?

125
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The bell is worth the money.

126
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's a bit cultural.

127
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The bell belongs to the golden tree.

128
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's cold in the valley.

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's also a secret treasure.

130
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Look at the pattern.

131
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It was made before the Ming Dynasty.

132
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's still not damaged.

133
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Do you know what it means?

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's worth more than the spring.

135
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't move.

136
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You protect the culture, too.

137
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Do you remember where we saw this bell?

138
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The bell is already in the air.

139
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It looks like a golden bell.

140
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I've only seen one bell.

141
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's on the side of the palace.

142
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Day of pearl

143
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Showwo

144
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,320
Don't panic, don't panic!

145
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,760
Hold on.

146
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,080
Hold on.

147
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,560
Get down!

148
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,200
Get down!

149
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,200
Where did this bastard come from?

150
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,780
Let me be more honest.

151
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,000
Maybe he is drunk.

152
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,240
Yet he is still alive!

153
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,920
Sorry.

154
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,320
No, I was nicely stood by.

155
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,660
Either he didn't hear us or not.

156
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,660
He might have entered the frozen stomach through this tube

157
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,660
and then ate his meat.

158
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,660
Such a system of life,

159
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,660
they thought it out.

160
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,660
Hey, look at me.

161
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,660
Nothing to be afraid of.

162
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,660
These leaders and the person who died in the world,

163
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,660
later, Third Uncle told me that the year of the bell was over.

164
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,660
He didn't say anything specific.

165
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,660
But at that time, a bell almost took several lives.

166
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,660
But there are dozens of them.

167
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,660
What if they think about it?

168
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,660
Don't be nervous.

169
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,660
The bell is different from the one in the middle.

170
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,660
If the wind blows, it will think about it long ago.

171
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,660
You said that Lu Wanggong appeared.

172
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,660
Isn't it too coincidental that he also appeared here?

173
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,660
I deliberately took the island by accident.

174
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,660
When someone saw the wind,

175
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,660
he saw something good and threw himself in the bag.

176
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,660
I don't think so.

177
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,660
The ordinary leaders would leave their mark

178
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,660
in the entire wood after the island was destroyed.

179
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Then the others would be surprised.

180
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,660
Little brother,

181
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,660
did you find any mark in this wood?

182
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,660
No.

183
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,660
It's not a bell.

184
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660
It can dig out good treasures from the ground.

185
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,660
It can't dig a tree,

186
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,660
so it can't dig good things and throw itself in the bag.

187
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,660
I guess he is working in the construction site near Lu Wanggong

188
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,660
to dig out these treasures

189
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,660
and move them here to be used as a home decoration.

190
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,660
It doesn't smell good.

191
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,660
Yes.

192
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,660
When Little Brother was moving through the island,

193
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,660
he smelled good.

194
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,660
But this bell has no smell.

195
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,660
And we have been here for so long,

196
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,660
and there is no reaction.

197
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,660
It means that there is no smell in this.

198
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,660
It's a good smell.

199
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,660
No way.

200
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,660
We have fought with him for so many times.

201
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,660
We have even burned it.

202
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,660
We haven't even smelled it.

203
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,660
And

204
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,660
where are the archaeologists

205
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,660
who were with Little Brother?

206
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,660
Only Li Li hid its smell

207
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,660
in the cracks.

208
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,520
And

209
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,660
it can not be bought on a market or bank

210
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,660
because it髲's actually visible now in sight.

211
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,660
No.

212
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,660
I have Cant ten years since I found this!

213
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,660
What?

214
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,660
ost drip by comes with my nose pick!

215
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,660
450!

216
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,260
If you were a little boy, you'd be about the same age as him.

217
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,460
Little fellow, you shouldn't call him Little Brother.

218
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,060
You should call him Master of the Meno.

219
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,460
What's wrong? I can't even give you a title.

220
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,860
Fine. There's no problem.

221
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,060
Except for this tree, what else?

222
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:48,600
G辛에서 Elmo

223
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,060
Yes, it looks like a thin layer of cloth.

224
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,060
It's quite thick.

225
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,060
How strong are you?

226
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,060
This wood is under the sea.

227
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,060
To fight against water pressure,

228
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
the top of the rock must be curved.

229
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,060
The middle is high and the bottom is low.

230
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,060
We need to find the smallest point of the strength.

231
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,060
Let me find it for you.

232
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,060
Now it seems that this wood

233
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,060
seems to have used the method of low-ranging the ground.

234
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,060
It has made a flat top.

235
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,060
It's very solid and solid.

236
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,060
But this is good for our Blue River.

237
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,060
It can be anywhere.

238
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,060
You're talking nonsense.

239
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,060
I'm better than you.

240
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,060
I'm just a little worried about the construction.

241
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,060
I'm just a little worried about the construction.

242
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,060
If we make a hole in the top,

243
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,060
will the sea water come in?

244
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,060
Will we be drowned?

245
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,060
So we must be sure

246
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,060
to move when the water is released.

247
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,060
Otherwise, the entire rock system will be damaged.

248
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,060
Maybe the entire point of the rock

249
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,060
will be flooded by the sea water.

250
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,060
We must be suppressed by the smoke.

251
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,060
We'll be dead for sure.

252
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,060
You can say that.

253
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,060
If Ning is still sober,

254
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,060
he won't leave his path for himself.

255
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,060
Maybe Yang Qiping

256
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,060
is hiding somewhere safe.

257
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,060
It's easy.

258
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,060
I'll just make him wake up.

259
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,060
All right.

260
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,060
Let's try our best to deal with those pillars.

261
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,060
Let's see how to climb up.

262
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,060
So slippery.

263
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,060
So rough.

264
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,060
I'm not a tiger.

265
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,060
I'm just a flower.

266
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,060
How can I climb up?

267
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,060
If you do that,

268
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,060
I'll make you fall down

269
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,060
and you'll get cold feet.

270
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,060
Let's go.

271
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,060
Let's go up.

272
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,060
Let's go up.

273
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,060
Let's go up.

274
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,060
Let's go up.

275
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,060
Let's go up.

276
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,060
Let's go up.

277
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,060
Fatty, be careful.

278
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,060
Come on.

279
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,060
Fatty, are you all right?

280
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,060
I'm fine.

281
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,060
I'm fine.

282
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,060
Team player is on the top half of the stage.

283
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,060
By Team player,

284
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,060
you climb up!

285
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,060
I have told you that

286
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,060
you can't climb up just like that.

287
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,060
You should climb onto it.

288
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,060
We should put you behind bars!

289
00:21:49,060 --> 00:22:09,620
Damn it! Don't act Wieg

290
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:17,780
These squogs are so clumsy!

291
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,780
You're so lucky, you don't have to climb yourself.

292
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,780
It's quite high.

293
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,780
Come on, technical consultant. What's up?

294
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,780
Let me see.

295
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,780
It's a new one.

296
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,780
It seems that the Wang Zang Hai is not too perverted.

297
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,780
Get up.

298
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,780
It's a steel gun.

299
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,780
The gun is full of steel.

300
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,780
It's like a steel gun.

301
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,780
You can't even open it with a hammer.

302
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,780
I don't believe it. Get up.

303
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,780
I don't believe it.

304
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,780
If it looks like this,

305
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,780
there are at least two of these.

306
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,780
The gun is in the right position.

307
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,780
It's impossible to open it without a hammer.

308
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,780
It's all my fault.

309
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,780
The gun is full of steel.

310
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,780
The stone will be old.

311
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,780
I didn't expect it to be so powerful.

312
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,780
As long as it's not too powerful,

313
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,780
as long as it's powerful,

314
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,780
it can be used to make a real deal.

315
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,780
How about we slowly make a deal?

316
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,780
It's impossible.

317
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,780
It's so thick,

318
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,780
it can be used to make a monkey.

319
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,780
I calculated it just now.

320
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,780
It only takes 30 minutes to get to the place.

321
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,780
If we miss this trip,

322
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,780
we can't leave.

323
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,780
And it's going to be a storm.

324
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,780
I'm telling you,

325
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,780
we can't go out now.

326
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,780
We have to wait for a week.

327
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,780
It's only seven days.

328
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,780
We'll starve to death.

329
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,780
The monkey is ugly and ugly.

330
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,780
I won't eat it anyway.

331
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,780
I'll eat it.

332
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,780
Go back.

333
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,780
Maybe we'll go back

334
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,780
and take the oxygen bottle.

335
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,780
We'll come back.

336
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,780
It's impossible.

337
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,780
Unless there's a miracle,

338
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,780
we can't find the door

339
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,780
of the Qin's Monk's house

340
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,780
in such a short time.

341
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,780
Besides, there's still the Jin's wife.

342
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,780
Brother,

343
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,780
I want to apologize to you.

344
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,780
I said that

345
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,780
your memory was fake.

346
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,780
I'm talking about you.

347
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,780
I'm afraid that you'll have

348
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,780
bad memories.

349
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,780
But I only thought about you

350
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,780
and didn't think about you.

351
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,780
I'm sorry.

352
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,780
Now that we're back,

353
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,780
it's been less than 30 minutes.

354
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,780
I found this on a broken boat.

355
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,780
You've been to the sea.

356
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,780
Everyone was missing.

357
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,780
But you're still alive.

358
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,780
You can think of a way.

359
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,780
Forget it.

360
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,780
I can't think of anything.

361
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,780
Don't make me feel bad.

362
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,780
We're saved.

363
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,780
He must have found

364
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,780
a way to break the iron wall.

365
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,780
Although Brother Xiao didn't go back,

366
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,780
he didn't know how to get out.

367
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,780
But he should have gone back.

368
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,780
There might be a mechanism

369
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,780
in this body

370
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,780
to make sure that the explosion

371
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,780
can be triggered.

372
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,780
It should be the idea of the mastermind.

373
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,780
If the後 person

374
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,780
thinks that the body is not strong,

375
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,780
the explosion will be triggered at any time.

376
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,780
The heart is very strong.

377
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,780
It can be triggered by itself.

378
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,780
But I think

379
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,780
this body

380
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,780
shouldn't be the sea.

381
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,780
Then you're saying that

382
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,780
the body is not strong.

383
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,780
It shouldn't be the sea.

384
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,780
Then you're saying that

385
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:22,660
the

386
00:28:39,780 --> 00:29:01,780
body is strong.

387
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,780
What are you thinking?

388
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,780
That's the most impotent you've ever had.

389
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,780
Some people

390
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,780
born in Vanya

391
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,700
could have never

392
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,780
given water to this god.

393
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,780
Wei fan,

394
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,500
ut you i'll be wife

395
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,780
until he hears you acting.

396
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,780
Be Precisely.

397
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,780
Party is really important to me.

398
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,780
Everything is ok.

399
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,780
But

400
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,780
when you don't want

401
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,780
But there's nothing to hang around here.

402
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,780
It's for this pillar.

403
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,780
It's not like that.

404
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,780
Help me cover it.

405
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,780
Come on.

406
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,780
Wait a minute.

407
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,780
What did I catch?

408
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,780
Why is there a chair?

409
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,780
It seems that we didn't find this chair when we moved.

410
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,780
How can it grow out of nowhere?

411
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,780
I heard that dried silk grows in the branches and in the hair.

412
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,780
I heard that it can grow in the mouth.

413
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,780
It's so annoying.

414
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,780
Enough.

415
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,780
Don't waste my time.

416
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,780
You can analyze it again.

417
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,780
In a few years, you can't analyze us.

418
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,780
Hurry up.

419
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,780
This dried silk is enough for the iron and ginger.

420
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,780
Let's go.

421
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,780
Wait a minute.

422
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,780
Come on.

423
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,780
That way.

424
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,780
You follow me.

425
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,780
Come on, senior.

426
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,780
No matter who you are,

427
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,780
you may have a close relationship with the girl who grew up with five grandmothers.

428
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,780
Anyway, you all have more things.

429
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,780
But you have returned to the West.

430
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,780
It's useless to be so grumpy.

431
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,780
Of course, we tied you up as a package.

432
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,780
It's also a form of destruction.

433
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,780
You have a lot of people.

434
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,780
Don't be so nosy with us.

435
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,780
Just pretend to be a real man.

436
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,780
Or...

437
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,780
Well, okay.

438
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,780
No evidence.

439
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,780
No evidence.

440
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,780
No evidence.

441
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,780
You can do it, comrade.

442
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,780
Comrade.

443
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,780
You...

444
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,780
You are so mean.

445
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,780
You can't call me now.

446
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,780
You...

447
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,780
You...

448
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,780
Wait for me.

449
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,780
akan

450
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,780
Little brother,

451
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,780
It is 20 minutes so far.

452
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,780
But it takes time to pack your stuff.

453
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,580
So you need to use the flying blade to fire it.

454
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,540
So you can do it after 10 minutes.

455
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,500
Xiao Tengzhi, tell me.

456
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,020
How much confidence do you have?

457
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,620
I don't know.

458
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,820
Wait and see.

459
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,780
Then you say I'm more nervous.

460
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,500
If you don't fire it,

461
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,740
you have to keep it a secret.

462
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,340
It makes me feel a little bit sad.

463
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,420
Yes, I have to keep it a secret.

464
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,340
Even if you say so,

465
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,500
you can look at the oxygen tank and see if it's still there.

466
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,380
It's not working.

467
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,340
There's a C-sign.

468
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,540
Just wait here

469
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,980
to see if anyone can save us.

470
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,180
Wait until the year of the monkey.

471
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,340
The Demon Gold is in the hands of the world.

472
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,260
Do you think

473
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,660
people from the Ani company

474
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,420
will let him go like this?

475
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,300
Is he that important?

476
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,100
I tell you, the foreign company is the most black.

477
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,860
The top risk is already great.

478
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,540
They even ask for help from the resources.

479
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,540
What a waste.

480
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,700
Xiao Teng, another 5 minutes.

481
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,580
You can do it.

482
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,820
Where's the bodyguard?

483
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,860
Ham ...

484
00:33:43,820 --> 00:34:06,320
Invite concluding or there are less than 1 mine

485
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,320
I'm not holding back.

486
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,320
But you'll only die.

487
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,320
Once the corpse disappears,

488
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,320
it will be exploded at any time.

489
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,320
At that time, everyone will die.

490
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,320
What about you?

491
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320
Can you still come back alive?

492
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,320
I don't have time.

493
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:58,320
Huenting?

494
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,320
Everyone?

495
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,320
Fatty!

496
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,320
He hasn't come up with us.

497
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,520
Did you see that?

498
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,080
He killed his wife.

499
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,920
He killed her.

500
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,000
No.

501
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,200
We can't do anything to him.

502
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,160
It's okay.

503
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,040
He is his brother.

504
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,000
You don't have to care about him.

505
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,520
Mother.

506
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,640
Mother.

507
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,920
Fatty, look at me.

508
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,120
I have to go back.

509
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,120
Where are you going?

510
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,840
I'm going to save brother.

511
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,040
You really treat yourself as a superman.

512
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,320
The ice-cream is broken.

513
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,200
There is no sign of the tiger.

514
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,240
He is not a great man.

515
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,000
I have to save him.

516
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,800
We will come together.

517
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,240
We will go back together.

518
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,200
Why didn't you wear the snow-covered shoes?

519
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,200
Wait for me here.

520
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,600
I will be back soon.

521
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,240
Brother. Brother. Brother.

522
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,720
Who am I? Who am I?

523
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,440
Fatty, you saved me.

524
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,440
Don't be angry.

525
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,760
Where is brother?

526
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,920
I'm going to save brother.

527
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:46,920
Brother.

528
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,840
I'll take you.

529
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,360
If you want to die,

530
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,080
find a place for yourself and die.

531
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,920
Don't let me go to the police station.

532
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,160
Are you sick?

533
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,120
We have to go back together.

534
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,160
You.

535
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,240
Come back.

536
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,240
You.

537
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,120
You.

538
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,240
You.

539
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,240
You.

540
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,160
You.

541
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,320
You.

542
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,400
He is scared.

543
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,560
You are scared.

544
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,200
You are back.

545
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,360
What will you do if you die?

546
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,000
I tell you.

547
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,000
Come here.

548
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,160
Look at me.

549
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,080
I tell you.

550
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,080
Fatty is dead.

551
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,760
He has a life.

552
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,200
People have to die.

553
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,240
Even if you want to live, you have to die.

554
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,640
You shouldn't die.

555
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,760
Just like Xiao Yuan.

556
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,360
He can kill even if he can't.

557
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,760
He can use your help.

558
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,760
He can live with a god.

559
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,360
How can he die in a dream?

560
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,920
He is alive.

561
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,800
