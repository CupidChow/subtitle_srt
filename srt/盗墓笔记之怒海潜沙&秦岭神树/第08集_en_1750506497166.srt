1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:20,640
It is obvious that the

2
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,420
word is morning

3
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,540
сдел Maßic

4
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,940
People must die.

5
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,940
Small people must die.

6
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,740
They shouldn't die.

7
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,540
Just like Xiao Yuan,

8
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,340
the three uncles are younger than you.

9
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,540
They are more like gods than you.

10
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,740
How could he die in a dream?

11
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,340
He's alive, you know?

12
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,340
He's alive!

13
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,140
Xiao Gao.

14
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,140
Shui Chi?

15
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,140
Yes, sugarcoal.

16
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,940
Whenever he's in the world,

17
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,340
his lives are tumbling,

18
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,540
just like to是啊 his own mother

19
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,420
I am afraid,

20
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,140
he'll die like a nun.

21
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,860
Who are you to arrest me?

22
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,220
Who is your guy?

23
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:33,980
This personally

24
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,500
Hello

25
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,860
Where's An Ning?

26
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,200
She's full of pain

27
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,600
She was sold out

28
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,780
Let's save her

29
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,900
Get back here

30
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,540
I went to a very dangerous place.

31
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,060
This woman has a island imp patchwole.

32
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,100
Let me ask you…

33
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
What was happening?

34
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,260
The driver would carry her back up the pothole.

35
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,260
Look at him.

36
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,260
Look at him.

37
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,260
He ran away without a trace.

38
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,260
Look at him.

39
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,260
He used his eyes to look at you.

40
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,260
He threw you down.

41
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,260
I told you, Wei Wei.

42
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,260
You're so stupid.

43
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,260
You're so stupid.

44
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,260
You don't even know how to die.

45
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,260
Aya!

46
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,260
Aya!

47
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:23,260
The End

48
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,260
You're still here?

49
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,260
Don't let me see you again!

50
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,260
The End

51
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,260
The End

52
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,260
The End

53
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,260
The End

54
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,260
You're staying here all night?

55
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,260
Let me see.

56
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,260
Let me see.

57
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,260
You're not a good man.

58
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,260
You're not doing well.

59
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,260
You're not doing well.

60
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,260
You're still here.

61
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,260
You're so stupid.

62
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,260
You're better than anyone.

63
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,260
You said it.

64
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,260
Now you're here again.

65
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,260
He must be here long ago.

66
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,260
Miao Miao, come out.

67
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,260
I can't see you.

68
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,260
Come out.

69
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,260
Okay.

70
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,260
I just want to surprise you.

71
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,260
Maybe one day, you'll have to go to the hotel after dinner.

72
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,260
And the cow will push you out of bed.

73
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,260
And then you'll be hit by a skin.

74
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,260
Go.

75
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,260
I'm telling you.

76
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,260
Don't catch him.

77
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,260
I really catch him.

78
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,260
I have to beat him up.

79
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,260
Yes.

80
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,260
Do it.

81
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,260
Before that, I'll go to the snow.

82
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,260
Go.

83
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,260
Go.

84
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,260
Go.

85
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,260
Help.

86
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,260
I see you.

87
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
I see you.

88
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,260
There's someone here.

89
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,260
We're here.

90
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,260
Come back.

91
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,260
I see you.

92
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,260
We're here.

93
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,260
We're here.

94
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,260
We're here.

95
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,260
Help.

96
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,260
Are you here?

97
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,260
Found it?

98
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,260
Found it?

99
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,260
Yes.

100
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,760
Guard!

101
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,180
This bastardJust join them

102
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,220
This was an introspection

103
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Where is he?

104
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,120
Uh-huh

105
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,440
Caucasus

106
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,040
Hmm?

107
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,600
P màdown

108
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,280
Hmm?

109
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,340
Yeah

110
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,980
There you go

111
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,120
It opens

112
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,960
What does that mean?

113
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,920
I can't finish my sentence

114
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,000
Is it something that I don't want to skip anyway?

115
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,200
Oh really, I need my tongue

116
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,960
But I have to

117
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,260
I've seen you off, don't hide away

118
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,100
Zhu Longcong will be something big

119
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,080
igualr, you're rectangular!

120
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,840
Let me subscribe to one of my channels.

121
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,720
It's a good thing we have to go to the hospital.

122
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,080
I'll take care of it.

123
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,240
I'll be back.

124
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,520
I'll be back.

125
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
See you.

126
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,600
See you.

127
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,720
See you.

128
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Bye.

129
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Bye.

130
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Bye.

131
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
See you.

132
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
Bye.

133
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Bye.

134
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Bye.

135
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Bye.

136
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Bye.

137
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Bye.

138
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
Bye.

139
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Bye.

140
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Bye.

141
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Bye.

142
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Bye.

143
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
Bye.

144
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Bye.

145
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Bye.

146
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Bye.

147
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Bye.

148
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,520
But, it's possible that the sea is also a sea island.

149
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,720
It's impossible to be a sea island.

150
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,840
If it's a sea island,

151
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,640
it's impossible to leave these materials.

152
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,560
So, the ghost is gone.

153
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,480
Nonsense.

154
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,560
The ghost is looking for the earthquake.

155
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,480
How can a ghost come here?

156
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,360
I can't help you.

157
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:59,880
I'm

158
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:08,880
The air pressure is 910% and the center is 17-degree above.

159
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,880
The air pressure will move from 15 to 20 km per hour to the northwest.

160
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Please take the boat to the port.

161
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Do you know how to drive?

162
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
No.

163
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Pull the rope.

164
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Can you do it?

165
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
I've never heard you say you can drive.

166
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Go and get the horse.

167
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
I'm not scaring you.

168
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
There are hidden places around here.

169
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,880
I'm afraid that my uncle is on the first boat in Shizhahai.

170
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Don't worry. Go get the horse.

171
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
You can't drive with the horse.

172
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
Go get the horse.

173
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Go get the horse.

174
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
Go get the horse.

175
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
The first boat in Shizhahai is the first boat in Shizhahai.

176
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:25,880
The first boat in Shizhahai is the first boat in Shizhahai.

177
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
The people are so fat.

178
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
They are out of the boat.

179
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,880
I'm out of the boat.

180
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
You're so full of yourself.

181
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
I'm not a good person.

182
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,880
This is mine.

183
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Uncle is a good person.

184
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
Yes.

185
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
Fatty, you're the best.

186
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Yes.

187
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,880
Look at me.

188
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,880
This is Ye Mingzhu.

189
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
When did you get it?

190
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,880
I'll let you know that Fatty is not a good man.

191
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Let's trade yourselves.

192
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,880
From now on, I'll go.

193
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
Go on!

194
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
baptize

195
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,880
We know that you are not the perfect cook.

196
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,480
You should be a bother,

197
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,880
καμês

198
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,680
Mm!

199
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,560
Babe.

200
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,320
You're not Ye Ming Zhu at all!

201
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,240
Don't even think of 18C.

202
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,600
Just think about it.

203
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,760
Isn't this計事?

204
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,240
No way!

205
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,520
Are you innocent?

206
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,000
Thank God...

207
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,440
But how much money does Meng Anghai have?

208
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,040
How much of Japanese can he cash in the body?

209
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,640
Can it be enough for the whole country

210
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,880
But.

211
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,500
What is that?

212
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,160
Youee!

213
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,040
Let's get started.

214
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,860
Are there men?

215
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,660
They're with moon.

216
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,340

217
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,280
These aren't, they'reetta

00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,060
They're..

219
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,900
There are only places.

220
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,600
No.

221
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,060
How much is that thing?

222
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,780
Just.

223
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,780
ASure meal, enough for us.

224
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,540
I've used this one ready-made.

225
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,380
Also encourage the eggs.

226
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,080
What?

227
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:57,980
Look!

228
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,280
Let me go!

229
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,600
I thought we were Orion.

230
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,500
It turned out that nobody's

231
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,180
but we?

232
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,060
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,180
It's so dark

234
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,660
Get up quickly

235
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,740

236
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,320

00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,580
She's something else

241
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,740
despite what you're showing

242
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,700
I just wanted to know

243
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,080

If you don't take a bath, it will ruin your body.

248
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,380
Is it that serious?

249
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,420
What do you think?

250
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,140
I'm so weak. I'm used to it.

251
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,660
You need to take a bath.

252
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,860
You need to disinfect after you take a bath.

253
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,140
I'll take care of your wound.

254

Get up.

257
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,500
I'm going to get a bath.

258
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,500
Get out of my way.

259
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,620
Over there.

260
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,060
Where are you going to take a bath?

261
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,980
Go ahead.I know how long it will take for you to go.

262
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,780
When you feel afraid, you give them morningen and eveningen.

263
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,660
ved

264
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,040
In the morning of 1806,

265
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,240

00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,940
Taking my life.

270
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,560
Even after last years.

271
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,180
You can't even die with that stupid fate.

272
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,260
Are you really so stubborn?

273
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,980
If you were like this, I would have fallen down.

274
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,700
Have you ever loved me?

275
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,020
An Ning, I've never loved you.

276
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,140
Go die.

277
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,940
You...

278
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,060
No, you must die.

279
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,220
You must die.

280
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,940
You must die.

281
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,140
You must die.

282
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,180
Music Star

283
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,200
Ye Lin Zhen, What time is it?

284
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,540
What time is it?

285
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,540
It's 1.30 pm.

286
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,480
You may be there as it is.

287
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,760
Fong Zi Twin, I need your help.

288
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,400
Don't talk nonsense.

289
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,200
I'm calling you here to talk, I'm having my hair combed.

290
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
You've already found the reason.

291
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
You're still a man.

292
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Stop mentioning it.

293
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,200
What did you do to me?

294
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Don't talk about it. I don't believe it.

295
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
I'll go.

296
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Let me see.

297
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Look.

298
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
What's going on?

299
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
What's going on?

300
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Fatty, you're so serious.

301
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
I'm not scaring you.

302
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
You've lost your hair.

303
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Or your hair is white.

304
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
You've grown some hair.

305
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
What hair? What hair? What kind of hair?

306
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
Hurry up and get me out of here.

307
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
I'm so itchy.

308
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Hurry up and get me out of here.

309
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
I heard someone got this sword.

310
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
He killed himself.

311
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
I can't let you talk nonsense.

312
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Hurry up and get me out of here.

313
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
What's going on? Hurry up and get me out of here.

314
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Look.

315
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Enough, Fatty.

316
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
I'm not scaring you.

317
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Tell me the truth.

318
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
I have a plan to deal with this.

319
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
I'll just use some hand-to-hand.

320
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
You're so serious.

321
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
He killed me.

322
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
He's so itchy.

323
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,200
He's using some hand-to-hand?

324
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
You're just a scumbag.

325
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
You're a scumbag.

326
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Go get me out of here.

327
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,200
When I was in the 7th Star of the Dragon Palace,

328
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,200
I didn't want to eat the Qilin Festival.

329
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,200
But I felt my blood was changing.

330
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
After the High-Dimension Power,

331
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
I was getting better.

332
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Maybe it's because of my blood pressure.

333
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
But seeing you're so sick,

334
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
I wanted to try my blood.

335
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Can I help you?

336
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
I don't want to say anything.

337
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
You're still this.

338
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Fatty,

339
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,200
you and Xiao Ge have saved my life.

340
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
In my heart,

341
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
you're all my good friends.

342
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
My good friends forever.

343
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
No, no, no.

344
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
I can't listen to you anymore.

345
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
I'm so busy.

346
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Do you believe that

347
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,200
I'll use your blood to save my life?

348
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Na You Ping,

349
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
what's wrong with you?

350
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Are you really not going to work?

351
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
I'm not going to work.

352
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
I'm going to work.

353
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,200
I'm going to work.

354
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
I'm going to work.

355
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
I'm going to work.

356
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
I'm going to work.

357
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
I'm going to work.

358
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
I'm going to work.

359
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
I'm going to work.

360
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
I'm going to work.

361
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
I'm going to work.

362
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
I'm going to work.

363
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
I'm going to work.

364
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,200
I'm going to work.

365
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
I'm going to work.

366
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Let's go.

367
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Let's go.

368
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,200
Let's go.

369
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,200
I have two tickets and one is yours.

370
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
I bought one of them with the boat.

371
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
I don't want anyone to know about the boat.

372
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,200
All right, don't worry about it.

373
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
Okay.

374
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,520
What do you think of Wu Xie?

375
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,160
Since you have spent a lot of time together.

376
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,800
He's a good person.

377
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
A nice guy?

378
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,080
He...

379
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,120
He's very kind.

380
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,240
He will save others.

381
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,480
Even if he's in danger himself.

382
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,760
That's foolish.

383
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,960
I don't want you to be like him.

384
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Remember.

385
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,880
You're always the most important person here.

386
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,680
You have to protect yourself.

387
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,480
Before anyone else.

388
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Sir.

389
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
I don't think he's foolish.

390
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,120
He has a sense of righteousness.

391
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
And he's smart.

392
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,240
His kindness.

393
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,320
It's very persistent.

394
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
Okay.

395
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,440
So, what else do we have about...

396
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
our kind and the righteous boy?

397
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,960
A burning curiosity.

398
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Oh, yes.

399
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,160
He's fascinated by his family's history.

400
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,840
Though his family hid many things from him.

401
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320
However...

402
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,120
The more they hide, the more he wants to learn.

403
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,360
He's very confident about his investigations.

404
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,440
But with the decryption, he doesn't trust anyone.

405
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Including his uncle.

406
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
You're right, Deng.

407
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,080
You're getting better and better.

408
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
I'm proud of you.

409
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,360
Sir, my biggest wish is to help you.

410
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
Since the day I've adopted you.

411
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,080
I knew that one day you will shine like the coolen and diamond

412
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,160
on the crown of the Queen of England.

413
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Dazenling and brilliant.

414
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,360
Oh, it's hot.

415
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
You're fat.

416
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,840
Where did you get it?

417
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
I got it from the boss.

418
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's good.

419
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,560
You don't need to light a fire.

420
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,640
You can just heat it up.

421
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,280
Chinese people are so great at eating.

422
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,360
The wisdom of thousands of years is so valuable.

423
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,960
This kind of food can be invented.

424
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,760
Hot and delicious.

425
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
Listen.

426
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,520
If An Ning doesn't kill us.

427
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,400
Can we get to this point?

428
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
There's no restaurant nearby.

429
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,080
I don't understand what An Ning is up to.

430
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,400
Are you done with him?

431
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,520
You've been in a mess.

432
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,880
You've hurt him.

433
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,680
What's the problem?

434
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,360
Tell me.

435
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
Is it good?

436
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,160
It has nothing to do with me.

437
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
It's not even the beginning.

438
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
It's delicious.

439
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,560
Fatty, I'm serious.

440
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,800
I suspect that

441
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,880
Uncle San is missing in the sea.

442
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,640
An Ning lied to us.

443
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
What did you say?

444
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Look.

445
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,120
You know the situation at my house.

446
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,800
My grandpa is an old man.

447
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,880
My uncle and I are on the same side.

448
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,200
But they all think I'm the only one in the family.

449
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,800
They never let me take care of this.

450
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Besides,

451
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,600
even if I want to find someone to help,

452
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,040
it's impossible to find me.

453
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,480
My uncle is the same.

454
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,760
Your uncle is also a thief.

455
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
No.

456
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
He's a businessman.

457
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,400
But he's very smart and powerful.

458
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,120
My uncle is so smart.

459
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,280
He's so weak.

460
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,480
If you say so,

461
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,560
he's not here to see you.

462
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Yes.

463
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,800
At first, I was a little suspicious.

464
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,280
But I was still cheated by him.

465
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,240
Then why did he do that?

466
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,480
Why did An Ning lie to you?

467
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,640
To make you come here?

468
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,640
To accompany him to the grave?

469
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,200
To get some bamboo shoots and kill you?

470
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,160
It's not a conspiracy.

471
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,480
It's a hate for love.

472
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,200
Tian Zhen, you didn't tell him...

473
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,040
No.

474
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,400
I thought my uncle's name was not there.

475
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,240
Why? You're still in a hurry.

476
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,640
Why are you in a hurry?

477
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,640
You're a thief.

478
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,240
Come on.

479
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,640
An Ning, listen to me.

480
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,040
We have planted the seed of doubt in Wu Xu's mind.

481
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,480
And with his character,

482
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,600
he will keep investigating the relationship between Wu

483
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,480
and the tomb in the ocean.

484
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,720
Sir, I will come to the bay soon.

485
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
Don't worry.

486
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,160
I've been waiting for decades.

487
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,200
I don't mind waiting for a few more years.

488
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,080
And the whereabouts of Wu Sanxin, are there no news?

489
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,160
Sir, Wu Sanxin has been too careful.

490
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,520
It's been difficult to track him.

491
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,480
Twenty days ago, he went to Hainen.

492
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,680
And rented a boat.

493
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,440
I thought he went to the tomb,

494
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,000
but I didn't find anything new in the chamber.

495
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,360
It looks like we were the only ones ever visited,

496
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,120
since the archaeology team.

497
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,240
Wu Sanxin is a very bold.

498
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,360
He didn't go to the tomb of the ocean.

499
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,040
There's only one explanation that he has found out.

500
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,200
What was there?

501
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,240
So, it's not attractive to him anymore.

502
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,840
But we have the copperfish,

503
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,520
took out by Xie Lianhuan.

504
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Not many relics were left.

505
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,600
To us, to Wu Sanxin.

506
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,480
The value of the copperfish surpass all.

507
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,040
Yes.

508
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,320
So what does he has?

509
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,920
What are you doing here?

510
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,400
Wait a minute.

511
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,680
What's this?

512
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,920
The seabed. You've changed it.

513
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,560
It's okay. It's a secret passage.

514
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,680
What's this? A route map?

515
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
We didn't walk the whole seabed.

516
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,720
So we can only use the search to draw.

517
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
It's very detailed.

518
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
Look.

519
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,120
At the top and the bottom of the house,

520
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,840
it should be the place where Wang Zanghai put the stone.

521
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,080
Like the Jinpoh and the monkey.

522
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,000
They came from this place.

523
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,000
You mean he took the monster as a pet?

524
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,080
Yes.

525
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,440
There are many Honggong aristocrats.

526
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,400
They used to make their own animals.

527
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,880
Then they moved the pets to the tomb to accompany them.

528
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,080
There are many things like this in the forest.

529
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,240
Oh...

530
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,520
Well...

531
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,080
I've been looking for Wang Zanghai for a long time.

532
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,080
I haven't found anything.

533
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,080
I know he's not as good as me.

534
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,080
But there are many people on the Internet

535
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,080
saying that the door of the door is designed by Wang Zanghai.

536
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
Look at this.

537
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,080
Is it a copper cloud?

538
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,080
Red envelope?

539
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
Don't care about the red envelope.

540
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,080
It's just a type of APP.

541
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,080
It says that the faster you guess, the bigger the envelope.

542
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,080
Look at it.

543
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,080
Do you see Wang Zanghai's information?

544
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,080
This is where we found Ning.

545
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,080
You...

546
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,080
Yes.

547
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,080
This is where the young man

548
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,080
and his team members were meeting.

549
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,080
You said that the young man was quite a good guy.

550
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,080
I've seen Huang and Shuaili.

551
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
They were pretending to be young men.

552
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,080
But I've never seen him like this.

553
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
He was so old.

554
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,080
But I saw him with his 20-year-old son.

555
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,080
Who believes him?

556
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
If the young man's body

557
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,080
fell into the trap and disappeared,

558
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,080
and was related to the sea,

559
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,080
would the other team members

560
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,080
be the same?

561
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
No.

562
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,080
Why didn't my uncle have any influence?

563
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
He's getting older.

564
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
He's almost dead.

565
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,080
Maybe it's related to the secret passage.

566
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Maybe uncle didn't go in.

567
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
No way.

568
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,080
Have you forgotten?

569
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,080
They went in after they saw uncle.

570
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,080
But the young man didn't see you.

571
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
He was in the other team.

572
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,080
He's already been in the police.

573
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,080
He was in the police.

574
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
What's wrong?

575
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
There's someone in there!

576
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,080
What?

577
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,080
What's going on?

578
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080
There's someone in there!

579
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,080
Who is it?

580
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Come out!

581
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,080
It's Wu Sanxing.

582
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,080
I see his face!

583
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,080
Are you sure it's Sanxing?

584
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
Do you see it clearly?

585
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,080
I only see his face.

586
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,080
Oh, right.

587
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,880
It seems that only a woman named Huo Ling saw my uncle.

588
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:58,880
No.

589
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,880
It was the one named Huo Ling who said he saw my uncle.

590
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,280
But he didn't see your uncle at all.

591
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,880
It's possible that he didn't see anyone.

592
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,280
Then why did he lie?

593
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,880
It makes no sense. He didn't lie.

594
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,280
Unless he saw the monkey, he didn't think you were a monkey.

595
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,480
It's not possible.

596
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,080
If he saw the monkey, he must have been attacked.

597
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,480
Then why did he look so scared?

598
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,480
No.

599
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,080
I remember.

600
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,480
When I was with Chen Wen Jin,

601
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,480
I saw someone in the stone monkey's face with a hair in front of a stone.

602
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,880
I couldn't see who it was.

603
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,080
Only Huo Ling went there.

604
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,280
He was shocked.

605
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,680
Only Huo Ling called my uncle.

606
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,280
You mean that person is not your uncle.

607
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,880
Think about it.

608
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,680
A person like my uncle is not a small brother.

609
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,280
As soon as Chen Wen Jin appeared,

610
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,080
my uncle would find them.

611
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,880
He would not even put his hair in front of them to find Yan Ji.

612
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,880
It's a lot of things in the tombstone.

613
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,080
It's not a surprise.

614
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,880
The test team is interesting.

615
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,880
Your uncle Xie Liang Huan was born in the old wine house.

616
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,880
Who else?

617
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,880
Huo Ling is awesome.

618
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,080
If Huo Ling is also a member of the old wine house,

619
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
then it's him.

620
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,680
Is it the test team or the guide team?

621
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,080
If Huo Ling is really Huo's family,

622
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,280
he will definitely know my uncle and Xie Liang Huan.

623
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,480
But his identity is not yet confirmed.

624
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,680
But what I want to know the most is that

625
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,480
he said he saw my uncle was really a fake.

626
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,080
Enough. You can rest.

627
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
You can rest.

628
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
The thing about the eyes is still confusing.

629
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,880
It's just a matter of a decade ago.

630
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,480
I tell you, the test team thing,

631
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,080
you still let Xiao Ge worry.

632
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,480
I just want to know now

633
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
if this Cloud Sky Palace really exists.

634
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,280
If Wang Dang Hai is not to make himself happy,

635
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,080
then those who are on the painting are all true.

636
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,280
Cloud Sky Palace is also real.

637
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,080
Even if you don't know who is buried inside,

638
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,080
who is it?

639
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,680
It must be the royal family.

640
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
Whether it is rich or poor,

641
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,680
how can I ask Wang Dang Hai to make his own tomb?

642
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,480
That's not necessarily true.

643
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,480
You forgot what we saw at that time.

644
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,080
Their clothes are not made of cotton.

645
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,480
They look like a few-way masks.

646
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,480
Tian Zhen, don't make the people's situation worse,

647
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,480
it's not possible to have money if there are few people.

648
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,480
The key is whether you can guess

649
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,480
which position he is in Changbai Mountain.

650
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,080
Xun Bao?

651
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,480
I tell you, you are so decisive.

652
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,480
You don't come to Beijing to be a member of the Chaoyang people.

653
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
It's a pity.

654
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
I know the clue.

655
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,280
It's just a little bit.

656
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,680
How can I know?

657
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,680
Even if you know, you won't tell me.

658
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
You are here.

659
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,480
Did you take the ID card?

660
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,480
I'm back in Beijing.

661
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,880
You said Xiao Ge's ID card,

662
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,880
the date of his birth,

663
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,280
it's easy to see the case, he can live in it.

664
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,480
He can make a plane.

665
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,880
Xiao Ge, does he have an ID card?

666
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,480
Maybe he has a great idea.

667
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,080
Next time I want to see him,

668
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,280
I really have to ask him.

669
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
Don't worry, he can see it.

670
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,480
Okay, I'm here.

671
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,880
There are no bad exercises in the world.

672
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,680
But at least we can eat happily in the exercises.

673
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,880
Don't forget the food and the meat.

674
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,280
Don't worry, I'm thinking.

675
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,280
Okay.

676
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,480
Bye-bye.

677
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,080
The Curse of 멤�sk

678
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,880
Mr. Vlogger?

679
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
Pan Zi?

680
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,880
San Yan, do it yourself. I'll go get you some water.

681
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,880
Pan Zi, I have a computer in my 30th grade.

682
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,880
You can find it yourself. It's right here.

683
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,880
Stop! Stop!

684
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,880
I tell you what, do you want to piss me off?

685
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
I don't care. I just need your help.

686
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,880
I'll tell you what, I'll give you a beating now.

687
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,880
I dare not.

688
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,880
You hit me.

689
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,880
I dare not. I dare not.

690
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,880
I ask you, do you remember?

691
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,880
Do you want to give me a beating?

692
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,880
Do you want to kiss me?

693
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,880
Do you want to kiss me?

694
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

695
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,880
I still want to go to the country.

696
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,880
You still want to, right?

697
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
I tell you, you can't run away from the river.

698
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,880
Episode 6

699
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,880
Pan Zi, this notebook is not from my 30th grade.

700
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,880
It's from his notebook.

701
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,880
I don't know.

702
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,880
Drink some water.

703
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,360
Doctor Sanzhi...

704
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,960
Where is teddy bear?

705
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,380
It's on its way overseas.

706
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,320
Since when?

707
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,260
It was 2 months ago.

708
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,800
It went alone.

709
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:10,960
Right.

710
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,840
San, did you have an issue?

711
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,480
A few days ago,

712
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,700
I said there was aいan accident at Hainan.

713
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,760
I called the shop's owner.

714
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,760
I wanted to give you a call, but I didn't know your phone number.

715
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,600
You don't have to tell them.

716
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,960
But there's one thing.

717
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,080
You must be in a difficult situation.

718
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,120
Can you still contact Uncle San now?

719
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,440
Pan Zi, if you say so,

720
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,800
you don't only need to contact Uncle San,

721
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,920
you don't even know where he went.

722
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,600
Does he really know where he went?

723
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
Then Uncle San is missing.

724
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
Okay.

725
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,080
Uncle San is asking you the same thing.

726
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,280
Did he mention that there's a sea-底-墓 in the West Desert?

727
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,080
I don't know.

728
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,760
Chen Chuan Wang Zenghai, archaeologist.

729
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,600
Then...

730
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,240
Where's Ning?

731
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,760
I heard about this.

732
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,800
You know he has a company.

733
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,000
Uncle San said Ning's boss is Qiu Dekou.

734
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,480
He's with the old and the old shareholders.

735
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,880
Qiu Dekou?

736
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I need to know the whereabouts of Wu Sanxing.

737
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,240
And keep an eye on Wu Sanzhi.
