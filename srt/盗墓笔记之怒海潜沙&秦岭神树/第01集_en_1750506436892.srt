What's your dream?

29
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,180
I'm just dreaming.

30
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,980
You're a bad guy.

31
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,740
Really?

32
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,180
Okay, I won't bother you anymore.

33
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,940
I'm going to bed.

34
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,220

I don't have money in my pocket.

41
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,920
I have no money.

42
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,880
So my pocket is yours.

43
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,240
Then don't have it now.

44
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,240
You can't print,

45
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,240
try this now,

46
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,600
then you pay on pay.

47
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,240
Okay.

48
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,840
Balance with the skirmishers.

49
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,360
Or do you take your money?

50
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,600
But to get the money from the skirmishers,

51
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,000
you have to pay with the skirmishers.

52
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,360
Then,

53
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,960
get your other half of it.

54
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,520
Because this mass-package is not included.

55
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,520
You can't fight Xie Jiang!

You!

66
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
It's been a long time.

67
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Come with me.

68
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,360
Let's go.

69
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,920
It's your national email.

70
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
You said my uncle was missing.

71
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,120
Is it true?

72
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,640
You don't know it's true.

73
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,560
I called his shop's fire engine.

74
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,880
They don't know where my uncle is.

75
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,960
But my uncle is an old man.

76
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,560
I don't believe you're going to say he's missing.

77
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
Your uncle has a cooperation with our company.

78
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,880
Your company?

79
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,680
The International Ocean and Natural Development Company

80
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
uses the limited amount of information

81
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,480
and materials to break down some of the shipments.

82
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,720
We'll take the materials from the shipments.

83
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,080
I know what you mean.

84
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,880
Ten wooden ships.

85
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,800
The materials from the shipments are a number of Tianwen.

86
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,680
Many foreign media have known the law.

87
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,880
But what does it have to do with my uncle?

88
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,880
This time, your uncle is the one who asked us to cooperate.

89
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,920
You said my uncle was the one who asked you to cooperate

90
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,600
to sell the materials from the shipments?

91
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,200
It's a protection of the Ocean and Natural Development Company.

92
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,120
We have legal procedures.

93
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,120
My uncle asked you to cooperate.

94
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,440
You agreed.

95
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,760
When we met last time, you didn't talk so well.

96
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,880
Your uncle and our boss are very good friends.

97
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,320
And he provides a very convincing offer.

98
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,160
So our board will agree

99
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,960
to give him some limited equipment and personnel

100
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,440
in the form of a single-layer service

101
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,640
to the Ocean and Natural Development Company near the North.

102
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,280
The situation was very smooth at the beginning.

103
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,800
It was until 5 a.m.

104
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,800
that their ship suddenly disappeared on WeChat.

105
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,560
Until now, there's no sign of it.

106
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,000
I've explained enough.

107
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
Time is limited. Get on the ship.

108
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
My uncle is very experienced.

109
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,960
Unless your ship is in a mess,

110
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,640
he can't receive WeChat signal.

111
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,480
It's impossible.

112
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,400
Our equipment is the most advanced.

113
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,000
You know my uncle is in trouble.

114
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,600
Why are you wasting your time here?

115
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,960
Hurry up and find the people from the Ocean and Natural Development Company.

116
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,520
That's what your uncle said.

117
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,720
If you find trouble,

118
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,160
we'll come to you first.

119
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
It's impossible.

120
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,440
My uncle has been in the island for so many years.

121
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,120
He never asked for my help.

122
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't want to force you.

123
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Go back.

124
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
Time is limited.

125
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,760
We'll have to enter the seal in half a month.

126
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,520
It'll be more difficult to get on the ocean.

127
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,000
You still haven't changed at all.

128
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,680
You're in a hurry.

129
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,080
Look at these equipment.

130
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,880
And this box.

131
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,800
Your uncle took one.

132
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,160
Look at the equipment you used.

133
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,160
The first time in a long time.

134
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
You're in a hurry.

135
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
You're in a hurry.

136
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
You're in a hurry.

137
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,640
You're in a hurry.

138
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
You're in a hurry.

139
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
You're in a hurry.

140
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You're in a hurry.

141
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
You're in a hurry.

142
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
You're in a hurry.

143
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
You're in a hurry.

144
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
You're in a hurry.

145
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
You're in a hurry.

146
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
You're in a hurry.

147
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
You're in a hurry.

148
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
You're in a hurry.

149
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
You're in a hurry.

150
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
You're in a hurry.

151
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,320
You're in a hurry.

152
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
You're in a hurry.

153
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
You're in a hurry.

154
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
You're in a hurry.

155
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
You're in a hurry.

156
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,920
You're in a hurry.

157
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
You're in a hurry.

158
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,800
Your씨,

159
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,520
why did you give her a red!

160
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,400
Repeat again.

161
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,360
Alive is reported as his grandfather's wife.

162
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,120
I just envy you.

163
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,680
Have you save it?

164
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,680
I haven't.

165
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,400
Please pass me that.

166
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,800
Good blessings!

167
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,040
You can live forever!

168
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,960
Good luck!

169
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,960
You're so nice.

170
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
Come on, sit down.

171
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
What did Anning tell you?

172
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,960
She said that I should ask if I should go to the sea.

173
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,960
I can't go there.

174
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
I have to go to the sea.

175
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Sea?

176
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
But Anning told me that it's a ship.

177
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,960
Yes, it's a ship.

178
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,960
It's also a sea.

179
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,960
There was a famous poet named Shen in the Ming dynasty.

180
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,960
His father was called Shen.

181
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
Shen?

182
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Shen San?

183
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
Yes.

184
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,960
You mean Shen is his son?

185
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,960
He lives in the water.

186
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
But he lives in the lake.

187
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,960
He's not from the sea.

188
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,960
No matter who it is,

189
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,960
I'm telling you, if you have the strength to be the king of the sea,

190
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,960
there must be a fat man's escort here.

191
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
Sea-like wood?

192
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,960
No wonder San Shu is here.

193
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Oh, right. Where is the third-year man?

194
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Anning said that

195
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,960
when San Shu was with them,

196
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
he disappeared.

197
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
You know what?

198
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,960
I thought I was just spending money on the trip.

199
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
But I heard that San Shu was here.

200
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,960
I thought that he must be a tourist.

201
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,960
The fat man came to the fortune this time.

202
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
He's going to be released, you know?

203
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,960
Fatty, when did you think of being a tourist?

204
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,960
I'm telling you, I'm here to find San Shu.

205
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,960
And you can't sell your belongings in the boat.

206
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
I'm not a tourist.

207
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,960
I'm happy to see you, madam.

208
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
It's not easy to meet you.

209
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
You should have come up and asked me.

210
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
You're so annoying.

211
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,960
I don't know what you're talking about.

212
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
It's true.

213
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,960
It's fake.

214
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
Look at this.

215
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,960
Don't you see that pretty girl with lots of white flowers?

216
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,960
It's the pig's brain grass that's eaten by the summer.

217
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Half of it is hidden.

218
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,960
It's a bit of a trick.

219
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,960
You're so smart that you can't even talk to it.

220
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Pig's brain grass is also a trick.

221
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
It's like you, with high fat, high fat, high fat.

222
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,960
It's not in the market.

223
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,960
Hurry up and put it on.

224
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Look, it's still on the air.

225
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Who's listening, who's blocking?

226
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,960
Let's go.

227
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Don't look. Let's go.

228
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Nian.

229
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Aren't you going to Ye relies on the boat to invite me?

230
00:16:47,960 --> 00:17:10,120
Hi, Friend,

231
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,960
What's happening in the сотрудignon?

232
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,020
Really?

233
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,440
I'm sorry..

234
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,680
So you have changed suddenly?

235
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,040
It seems the boss is worried about this little freak.

236
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Your actions have attracted the attention of the border guards.

237
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
You have to act in a wrong way.

238
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
You can only go to save my uncle, right?

239
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,040
These are all small things to me.

240
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,040
Finding your uncle is a big deal.

241
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Finding my uncle is really important.

242
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,040
But this is a matter of principle.

243
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,040
The problem of the fate.

244
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,040
First, find your uncle and other good words.

245
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
Right?

246
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Your equipment.

247
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
This boat...

248
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
Zhang Gu Wen.

249
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
Zhang Gu Wen.

250
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Let me introduce you.

251
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
No way.

252
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
Why not?

253
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
My boat...

254
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,040
It's not a boat.

255
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
It's a place without a boat.

256
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,040
The boat is too small.

257
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
When the wind blows,

258
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
it's possible to turn it over.

259
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
No, no, no.

260
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
In Italy,

261
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
it's not a good idea.

262
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
I'll try to hit you with a stinky mouth.

263
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,040
I'll bite your mouth.

264
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
Zhang Gu Wen.

265
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
Let me introduce you to him.

266
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
This is...

267
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Nice to meet you.

268
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
My name is Zhang.

269
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
My name is Zhang.

270
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
My name is Zhang.

271
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Hello, I'm Wu Xin.

272
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,040
My son is Mr. Fatty.

273
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
Zhang Gu Wen is the first-gen expert in the sea.

274
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
I'm lucky to be an expert.

275
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,040
I've published a few articles

276
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
on the bridge.

277
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
I've just got some small achievements.

278
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
It's not worth mentioning.

279
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
You're exaggerating.

280
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
It's too modest.

281
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Where? Where?

282
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Are you all here?

283
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
Look.

284
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Such a valuable monument.

285
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,040
It's so beautiful.

286
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Mr. Wu is so young and handsome.

287
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Unlike us,

288
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,040
we can't do anything

289
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,040
in the whole year.

290
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
It's a change of day.

291
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,040
It's a change of day.

292
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
It's okay.

293
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Follow me.

294
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Pull the rope.

295
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Take the stuff in.

296
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
It's too big.

297
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
It's too big.

298
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
We need to find a shelter.

299
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
I said it's not okay.

300
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
Can we find a shelter?

301
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
We can't.

302
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
It's not a shelter.

303
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
We can't make it in time.

304
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
Hurry up.

305
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
I said it's not okay.

306
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Shut up.

307
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,040
It's so cool.

308
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Cool.

309
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Everyone, get back here.

310
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
Get back here.

311
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Get her.

312
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Stop.

313
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
I'll help you.

314
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
What are you doing?

315
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Get up.

316
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Be careful.

317
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Wu Wei Ling,

318
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
get back here.

319
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
Get her.

320
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Hurry up.

321
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
Hurry up.

322
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Get her.

323
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Get her.

324
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
Hurry up.

325
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Hurry up.

326
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
What's going on?

327
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,040
He said he'd get her.

328
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,040
He's really dead.

329
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,040
Get Wu Jian Dian out of here.

330
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Yes.

331
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
Get Wu Jian Dian out of here.

332
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
If you have any trouble,

333
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,040
send him to the hospital.

334
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,040
Okay.

335
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,040
Hurry up.

336
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
You want to say it?

337
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,040
Get her.

338
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,040
Don't make trouble here.

339
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
Get them.

340
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Let's go.

341
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
Let's go.

342
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
Get her.

343
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
Hurry up.

344
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Get her.

345
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
Hurry up.

346
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Hurry up.

347
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Get her.

348
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Get her.

349
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Get her out of here.

350
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
What's going on?

351
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Hurry up.

352
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Let her go.

353
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Let her go.

354
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,840
Fatty!

355
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,440
Thank you!

356
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:56,600
Hurry up!

357
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,440
Send him back!

358
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,640
What's that sound?

359
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,640
Let me see.

360
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,440
Be careful!

361
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:17,840
Hurry up!

362
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,440
What's that?

363
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
What's that?

364
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,440
What's that?

365
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,440
What's that?

366
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,240
What's that?

367
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,640
What's that?

368
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,840
There's a ship ahead.

369
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,240
They're going to take a look.

370
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,640
Be careful!

371
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,640
What's that?

372
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,840
It's a ship!

373
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,840
It's a ship!

374
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
Hurry up!

375
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,240
What's going on?

376
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
What's going on?

377
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,240
Hurry up!

378
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,240
Hurry up!

379
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,240
The ship can't see us!

380
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,240
No matter what happens,

381
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,240
we can't go back!

382
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,640
Even if something happens,

383
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,440
you'll have to know!

384
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,040
Impossible!

385
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,640
There's no way

386
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
that this world would be like this!

387
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
The ship is here!

388
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
What's that sound?

389
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:55,240
There's a way forward.

390
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,840
Come on, An Ning.

391
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,840
What's going on?

392
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
What's going on?

393
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Don't move.

394
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,840
Xiao Dongzhi, get up!

395
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
An Ning!

396
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,840
An Ning!

397
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
Let me go!

398
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,840
Don't go!

399
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,840
Let me go!

400
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,840
Let me go!

401
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
Xiao Dongzhi is dead!

402
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,840
Xiao Dongzhi is back!

403
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
Let me go!

404
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Xiao Dongzhi, get up!

405
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
Don't go there!

406
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
Stay there!

407
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,840
We must save him!

408
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
No!

409
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,840
We're here together.

410
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
We can't go back together.

411
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,840
Everything is in danger!

412
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
If you do this,

413
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,840
the whole village will be killed!

414
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,840
Let go of me!

415
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
Look at them!

416
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,840
Don't let them kill the whole village!

417
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,840
I'll save them!

418
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,840
Hold the safety!

419
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,840
Don't let them kill the whole village!

420
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,840
An Ning!

421
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,840
An Ning, are you okay?

422
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,840
Xiao Dongzhi is gone.

423
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
I'm fine.

424
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,840
This thing is too dangerous.

425
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840
I lost my strength when I was caught.

426
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
What is this thing?

427
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
Come on.

428
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Look at the thickness of the iron.

429
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
This thing has been in the sea for over ten years.

430
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840
Maybe it's because of this storm.

431
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
It's still making it up from the sea.

432
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840
How is that possible?

433
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,840
If it was in the sea,

434
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
it would have been buried by the sea.

435
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,840
Even if it was a car, it wouldn't be able to fall.

436
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,840
Look, this thing has a natural slope.

437
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
It didn't break the barrier.

438
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
So, in the current situation,

439
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
it's impossible to get up.

440
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,840
It's impossible to get up.

441
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
It's impossible to get up.

442
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
It's impossible to get up.

443
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
It's impossible to get up.

444
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,840
So, after the storm,

445
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
there's no ship.

446
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
It's always floating in the sea.

447
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
Why did you save me?

448
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,840
Why did you save me?

449
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,840
Aniang!

450
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
Aniang, what are you doing?

451
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Aniang!

452
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Don't move!

453
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
Aniang!

454
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
Aniang!

455
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,840
Aniang!

456
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,840
Aniang!

457
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,840
Aniang!

458
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Aniang!

459
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,840
Aniang!

460
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
The monkey!

461
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
The monkey!

462
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Watch out!

463
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
Watch out!

464
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,840
Watch out!

465
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
Go!

466
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
Okay.

467
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

468
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

469
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

470
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,840
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

471
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

472
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

473
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

474
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

475
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

476
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

477
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,840
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

478
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

479
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

480
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

481
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
The first game of the season is the first game of the season.

482
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,840
We are going now.

483
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,840
I can't see it.

484
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
I'll go up and have a look.

485
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,840
Fatty! I'm here!

486
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,840
Fatty!

487
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
We're here!

488
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,840
Come here!

489
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,840
Come here!

490
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,840
Zhang Tuzi, we're saved!

491
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,840
Fatty!

492
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,840
I'm here!

493
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,840
Give me the knife.

494
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Don't worry. It's okay.

495
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,840
What's this?

496
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,840
This is the face mask.

497
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Just put the cap on it.

498
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
It's okay. Let her rest.

499
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
It's okay.

500
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
It's okay.

501
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,840
It's okay.

502
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,840
It's okay. The head is hard.

503
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
But it's a bit uncomfortable to see you now.

504
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
It's okay.

505
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,840
Have a good rest.

506
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,840
Don't make a mess.

507
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,120
If I didn't watch them, they would have lost their oil.

508
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,280
I'm here. They want to run away.

509
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,880
Besides, they only wanted some money.

510
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,840
They didn't want to be a monkey or a monkey.

511
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,960
Who wouldn't run away?

512
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,200
Yes, they don't want to see the baby.

513
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,120
They didn't disappear.

514
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,560
Why did that rabbit come?

515
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,160
That rabbit is really suspicious.

516
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,440
And Aning.

517
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,080
He's hiding too much from us.

518
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,640
If it wasn't for the rabbit...

519
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,280
Forget it.

520
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,200
Take a rest. I'm watching you.

521
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm too excited.

522
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I can't sleep.

523
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,320
Okay, I'll go to sleep.

524
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,800
I'll wake you up in two hours.

525
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,520
Mira.

526
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,800
Wankare- forever,

527
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,840
Anna- 힘들o-

528
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,240
An-an run.

529
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,280
Ooooo…

530
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,720
While the rabbits is lazing,

531
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,440
An-an runs to a shelter.

532
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
I'm going to see that on the因為 floor,

533
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Come on.

534
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
Come on.

535
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,720
Are you okay?

536
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
I'm fine.

537
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,720
Uncle San wants to go out for business.

538
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
Stay at home.

539
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,720
I'll bring you something delicious.

540
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,720
Come on.

541
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
Grandpa told you to take me out for fun.

542
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,720
You're not listening.

543
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,720
Don't tell Grandpa about it.

544
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,720
Uncle San went out to find your aunt Wenjing.

545
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
It's a big deal.

546
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,720
If you delay it,

547
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
you'll have no other choice.

548
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,720
Listen to me.

549
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,720
Uncle San told you to go out for business.

550
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
Stay at home.

551
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
I'll take you out for fun.

552
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
Come on.

553
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
Come on.

554
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,720
Come on.

555
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,720
Come on.

556
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
Come on.

557
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,720
Come on.

558
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
Come on.

559
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,720
Come on.

560
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,720
Come on.

561
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,720
Come on.

562
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,720
Come on.

563
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
Come on.

564
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,720
Wenjing, you'll be your uncle in the future.

565
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,720
You'll have many younger brothers and sisters with you.

566
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,720
Wenjing, you'll be my family in the future.

567
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Yes.

568
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,720
Zhang Qilin.

569
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
Isn't that my brother's name?

570
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,720
It's really him.

571
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
It's impossible.

572
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
You're awake.

573
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,720
How do you feel?

574
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
You saved my life.

575
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,720
No.

576
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,720
It's Zhang Tu.

577
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,720
Zhang Gun saved us.

578
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,720
Him?

579
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,720
I didn't know that.

580
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,720
Zhang Gun's skills are so good.

581
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,720
He's such a talented guy.

582
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Where did you get it from?

583
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,720
I don't know.

584
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,720
It was from the company.

585
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,720
I only know that he is a professional in the sea.

586
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
He's a great man.

587
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,720
He's a great man.

588
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,720
He's a great man.

589
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
Okay.

590
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,720
Since that,

591
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,720
it's time for you to tell me the truth.

592
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,720
What?

593
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,720
You found me this time.

594
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,720
What did you do?

595
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,720
Your uncle's boat is missing.

596
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,720
But there's a clue.

597
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,720
Three hours before the boat was missing,

598
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
he found the missing location of the bottom of the sea.

599
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,720
He's preparing to get into the boat.

600
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,720
We think

601
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
the boat might be taken by the sea.

602
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,720
If at that time,

603
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,720
your uncle had entered the bottom of the sea,

604
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,720
he might have been free.

605
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,720
But his situation won't be good.

606
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,720
The distance to the sea is lost.

607
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,720
We can't come back.

608
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,720
Yang Jiping won't let him stay there for so long.

609
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,720
In fact,

610
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
your uncle said

611
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,720
that there's a certain amount of air in the bottom of the sea.

612
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,720
It can be breathable.

613
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
He knows very well

614
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,720
about the situation in this wood.

615
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,720
He must have known it before.

616
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Of course.

617
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,720
All I said

618
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,720
is just our speculation.

619
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,720
We can't exclude other surprises.

620
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
If all this

621
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,720
is your uncle's plan,

622
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,720
he wants to take our responsibility.

623
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,720
That's impossible.

624
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,720
You know better than us

625
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,720
what kind of person your uncle is.

626
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,720
It's not his first time.

627
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,720
Nonsense.

628
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,720
How can you treat Xie Lianhuan like this?

629
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,720
How can you treat Xie family like this?

630
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,720
You bastard!
