00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,280
Second World

2
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,600
Episode 22

3
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,400
By the way,

4
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,320
the backyeah is for found border medicine.

5
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,480
Why need it at a pharmacy?

6
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,980
Is it a reconnaissance ...

7
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,320
Commander andchy are war på wiretons.

8
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,820
Isn't thishwail

9
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,860
a famous 一 twzh Taken Painting?

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The Seven Stars of Dragon Palace?

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The Seven Stars of Dragon Palace

12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
is the dream of the war period.

13
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Both of these woods

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
have never been in the same world.

15
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What's the connection

16
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
between them?

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Brother, you came here.

18
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What's on it?

19
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Some officials

20
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
are checking the city.

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What is the city?

22
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's obviously the government office.

23
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What's the reason?

24
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Is this wood

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
a famous one

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
or a war hero?

27
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's not good.

28
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Why are you going?

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm going to the city.

30
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Where are you going?

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Go.

32
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's not fair.

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Fatso, are you okay?

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's not fair.

35
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Just take care of him.

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Leave me alone.

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you okay, brother?

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm fine.

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't like my wife.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't like uncle.

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm a good wife.

42
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What's wrong with your hand?

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Nothing.

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I just have a cold.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What?

46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That little boy is a cold?

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
A cold?

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The world says that cold is like a jade.

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I thought it was just a form.

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I didn't expect it to be this kind of thing.

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Some people say it can trigger the monster of the Great Khan.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Some people say that the body is in the wild and has been staying for a long time.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So it's called a cold.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I can see once that it's really open.

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes, it's not like that.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why didn't we give him a gun just now?

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
2466, come.

58
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm fine.

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm fine.

60
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm fine.

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Are you all right?

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm fine.

63
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The words on this poem

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
describe the scene of the chief of the tomb

65
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
built by the engineer.

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Look.

67
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The Talisman is from the Ming Dynasty.

68
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's a shining sand and a shining embroiderer.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It means that the chief of the tomb

70
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
might be a noble from the palace.

71
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Or he is a very well-known

72
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
architect at that time.

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And he is very skilled in the wind and the magic of the moon.

74
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Because of this,

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
he is able to build a sea tomb.

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Only this kind of person

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
can play so much in his own tomb.

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Brother Cigar,

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
you have been a guide for us before.

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Now you have the information of the chief of the tomb.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You are a good friend of Wusi Feng.

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I can't take you away.

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If I can take you away,

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I will be a great fan.

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That would be even better.

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't be so bad.

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The chief of the tomb said that

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
the Ming Dynasty is

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
the first in the Ming Dynasty.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
There are not many people who can throw stones.

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Besides, such a big sea tomb

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
must be well-known for its identity.

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
There are only one person

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
who needs to be considered by so many people.

95
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Wang Zanghai.

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Who is the man of the Ming Dynasty?

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He not only built the entire Ming Dynasty.

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
At that time,

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
many big cities were

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
the hands of Wang Zanghai.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
At that time, as long as he said something,

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
the whole city could disappear completely.

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
By the way,

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
when I was in the escape room,

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I saw a book about the seal.

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The contents of the book

107
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
were so close that I could say that

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I was afraid of the sky.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Then you are afraid of the sky?

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Can you be Wang Zanghai's second?

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
To him, it is the sky.

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But to me, it is the sky.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The legend of Shen Wan San.

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The water tomb at the bottom of the Silver Gang in Zhouzhou.

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He designed it.

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If he wanted to design such a place for himself,

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
it would be so complicated.

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Are you blind?

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Do you have any evidence?

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm bold and bold.

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
If this tomb is really from Wang Zanghai,

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
it is definitely a secret.

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I tell you, this tomb

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
must not only have been visited by the third uncle and the archaeological team.

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Look at this cave.

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There must be other people who came.

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
This cave is indeed very long.

128
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Since we can see through this pool,

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I guess this pool is just an exit.

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Maybe the person who moved it

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
could not tell the specific location of the main tomb.

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So it's like a few possible directions.

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
There is one of them in the pool.

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This one is also one of them.

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I didn't find any differences in the cave.

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's obvious that it's the end of the road.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There are so many bricks in the cave.

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's so convenient to use bricks to hide a few holes.

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It should be because you came out too late.

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You didn't pay attention.

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Why don't you think about it?

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This hole is connected to the pool.

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's a very long cave.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's very long.

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's very long.

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's very long.

147
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's very long.

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's very long.

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's very long.

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's one of the tunnels that connects the pool

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and the submarine itself.

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
How come it is in m drinkable condition?

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There are beards שהואvoins on the wall of the house.

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
tens of echoing slice of visual 돌아lar.

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Anyone should denominator나�잠arna

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
in this well, threatening them for the interrogation?

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,400
We could see it but not

158
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,000
because it's so good here.

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Must be very good.

160
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Did Nastia have company?

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Hurry up.

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Don't rush.

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Here.

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I've had a poison for you.

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You can drink it.

166
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't drink it.

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So?

168
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What kind of black chicken is this?

169
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Send me one when you get back.

170
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Take it.

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
If you can go out, I'll give you one hundred.

172
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Good.

173
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Do you think the Hanba is swimming?

174
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's not a sea lion, is it?

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Come here.

176
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Come.

177
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's time to change the head.

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You always pick ו on me,

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
not for you to stand.

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What's that?

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Come here.

182
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It seems to be a butterfly.

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
These are the big holes.

184
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
See?

185
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
There's a stone cup.

186
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Okay.

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's quite poisonous.

188
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The fat man and the blue-haired man

189
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
are hunting with the same method.

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
They are hunting birds every day.

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Stop it.

192
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Can you see what's written on the cup?

193
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's simple.

194
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Fatty, wait for the weapon to shoot.

195
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Then we'll wait until when we can go.

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's okay. Come with me.

197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:25,400
The

198
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,000
The

199
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The

200
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The

202
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The

203
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The

204
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The

205
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The

206
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The

207
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The

208
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The

209
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Makes sense.

210
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,000
It should be 20 or 30 years ago.

211
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,400
Is it your uncle?

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
No way.

213
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,800
My uncle didn't speak English better than you.

214
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,600
It should be a test for the team.

215
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
No matter who it is,

216
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,400
what he did down there,

217
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,200
is there any drug?

218
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,000
Fatty,

219
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,600
when will you stop your troubles?

220
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,400
People are shameless,

221
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,200
they can't deal with it.

222
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
The fat man likes to be the shareholder.

223
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,200
What should we do?

224
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,200
There's no way.

225
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,200
I'm worried about the water.

226
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,400
Maybe he'll take it again.

227
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Let's go upstairs.

228
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
The service is much faster than running.

229
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,400
You're so educated.

230
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,600
Listen,

231
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,200
when the speed of the water is at a certain point,

232
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,800
it will cause a lot of shock.

233
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
If the water is clouded,

234
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
even if the water is good,

235
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,800
you can't run.

236
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,000
Look at you.

237
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,000
It's not your fault that you're not scared.

238
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,400
He's just a kid.

239
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,400
He's really determined to

240
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,000
sleep in the night.

241
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,000
He's just practicing.

242
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
You're getting older.

243
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,600
We're here to find Uncle San.

244
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
He's not here to look for treasure.

245
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,000
And he's still here.

246
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
I can't ignore him.

247
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,200
We must avoid danger.

248
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,800
How can we know that

249
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,400
the fat man is in the army?

250
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,800
That's the

251
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,800
Yes, yes, yes.

252
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,200
But the treasure is not a advantage.

253
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,800
This place is not a good place.

254
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,400
Brother,

255
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
what do you find?

256
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,000
Brother.

257
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Why don't you cross the border now?

258
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,800
Brother,

259
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,800
slow down, brother.

260
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,400
Brother.

261
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Where are you going, brother?

262
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
You're going to the front today.

263
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,000
You're scared again.

264
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,000
Be careful.

265
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,800
Be careful.

266
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The water is under the water.

267
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,800
Don't step in.

268
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You're going to fall.

269
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,400
You'll be shot.

270
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Just talk to me.

271
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,400
Where's the man?

272
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,400
Okay, go over there.

273
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,200
Is it deep?

274
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,000
Be careful.

275
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,200
It's okay.

276
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:50,600
Go.

277
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,400
Go.

278
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,400
would

279
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,400
Thank god,

280
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,560
Master, what do you need?

281
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,640
We've been friends since the morning?

282
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,900
We've been friends since the morning.

283
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,500
Have we met?

284
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,240
Yes, but we have to go first!

285
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,040
Now.

286
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,200
As you thought,

287
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,640
your difficulties are a shame.

288
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,280
I understand how you cooled me off.

289
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,600
And what's that woman doing?

290
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,320
Why did you come help the Major?

291
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,640
Work hard.

292
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,600
Well.

293
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,240
Thank you for all your support.

294
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,640
Don't forget to like and subscribe to the channel.

295
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,320
Thank you.

296
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
I think these words are more like words of the past.

297
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Different people will have different opinions.

298
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Maybe the sky and the door are just a metaphor.

299
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,240
But in this poem, it must be hidden in the melody.

300
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,240
There is a door in the light.

301
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,240
You and her are not far away.

302
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
Of course, you can't see the door.

303
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
Just stay away from the light.

304
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Later

305
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
Comrade, come here.

306
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Look at this one.

307
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Is it true that someone has really been through the ten aisles

308
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
Have you ever been to the Sky Palace?

309
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Fatty, look around.

310
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:38,080
Do you have any clues about the other

311
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,080
The third uncle said he didn't bring the water device when he left.

312
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,080
Is the third uncle really going to the Sky Palace?

313
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,080
Where is he now?

314
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,080
You say this is a bit of a mess.

315
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,080
You came down here in vain.

316
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,080
Fatty, I'm worried that the guards will come up later.

317
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,080
Let's go up first.

318
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,080
This place is too far from the mountain.

319
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,080
It's too dangerous.

320
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
Don't scare yourself.

321
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,080
What's that sound?

322
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,080
Is there something in the water?

323
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,080
Is it a monkey again?

324
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,080
Just let me see.

325
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,080
I think we should go up.

326
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
Okay.

327
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,080
You're not going to look for it?

328
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,080
No, I'm not going to look for it.

329
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
No, no, no.

330
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,080
Little brother, go back.

331
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,080
Why is he gone again?

332
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
Little brother!

333
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,080
He's gone, gone.

334
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
He's gone.

335
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
He's sick.

336
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,080
Little brother!

337
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
It's too big.

338
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
What kind of a lie is this?

339
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
Little brother!

340
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
Little brother!

341
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,080
Little brother!

342
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Little brother!

343
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,080
Little brother!

344
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
Little brother!

345
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,080
Little brother!

346
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,080
We meet again.

347
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
What are you doing?

348
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
You're over-reacting.

349
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,080
Little brother!

350
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,080
Little brother!

351
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,080
What's wrong with you?

352
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
I remember.

353
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
I've been here before.

354
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,080
I remember.

355
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,080
I've been here before.

356
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,080
I've been here before.

357
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
I remember.

358
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,080
Valentine

359
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,080
Wenzhen, look at this.

360
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,080
Xu Jia,

361
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,080
my report about the ongoing transfer has been installed?

362
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,080
I'm writing a report

363
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,080
on a circulatory or a paper document.

364
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,080
Why don't you work with us?

365
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,080
The report over there is quite weird.

366
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
This's your signature.

367
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,080
You can't come by alone.

368
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,080
Let's go. Let me think about it.

369
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
Holy shit!

370
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,800
San is still sleeping.

371
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,520
Don't wake him up.

372
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
I'm sorry.

373
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,960
Come here and see.

374
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,800
There's a machine under this.

375
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,400
What did you find?

376
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:56,960
What's wrong?

377
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Let me see.

378
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
I know this.

379
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,040
This is the signal of the Mingyao.

380
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,520
It's the magnetic field of this magnet.

381
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,880
No.

382
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,000
The signal of the Mingyao is not like this.

383
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,120
It could be the signal of the Mingyao.

384
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,880
Zhou Yuan,

385
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,480
I think we should write more.

386
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,560
Otherwise, I'm really worried about your level.

387
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,760
You don't even know the common word

388
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,920
of the signal of the Mingyao.

389
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,080
There's only one word.

390
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,400
It's very raw.

391
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,720
It's impossible.

392
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,840
I haven't read it clearly.

393
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,600
What are you talking about?

394
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,080
You can't read it alone.

395
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,880
Let's study it together.

396
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,560
Let's go.

397
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:28,920
Don't fall.

398
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,920
What are you doing?

399
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,440
Let me study it.

400
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,240
Let me see.

401
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,240
Okay.

402
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,360
I think you are both a pair of two-legged.

403
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,040
You can't fool me.

404
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,640
Give it to me.

405
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,200
Let go.

406
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,080
Let go.

407
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,240
Xiao Zhang,

408
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,240
look at this.

409
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,240
What is this?

410
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,320
Can you not cover me?

411
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,640
Look carefully before answering.

412
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,360
What is this?

413
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,960
We used to see stages

414
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,680
on the base of the離.

415
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,320
Some more.

416
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,400
We thought they were made of fixedumsy

417
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,960
and then, we found there're some more too.

418
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,480
It seems like they have

419
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,080
some kind of strategy.

420
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,920
So we thought

421
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,960
they use ranks

422
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,160
a little better.

423
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,120
And

424
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,080
the words on ceased shape

425
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,160
are so boring.

426
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,120
Look, looking跟你.

427
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,280
Love for it.

428
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,680
Love for it.

429
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,340
Your it.

430
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:52,920
That's so brilliant.

431
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,440
Your it.

432
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,120
My brother bit you with a knife.

433
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,120
What does this border mean?

434
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
I really don't understand.

435
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,120
How did he come up with this?

436
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,120
That yellow one?

437
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
Look at this.

438
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
Look at this form of the bottle.

439
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
It's different from what we saw before.

440
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,120
There must be some special meaning.

441
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120
What do you think?

442
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,120
Look.

443
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,120
Xiao Zhang, are you trying to make a list of numbers?

444
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
It's true.

445
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,120
There are more and less of these patterns.

446
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,120
But they are numbers.

447
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,120
The number of the words is still in the form of a border.

448
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
It's so rare.

449
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
Maybe it's a coincidence.

450
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Maybe it's another meaning.

451
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
It's a form of a border.

452
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
Yes.

453
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,120
How else can I explain it?

454
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,120
What does this form of border mean?

455
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,120
Is this the Palace Hall in the sky?

456
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,120
What does this mean?

457
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,120
Is it a form of a border?

458
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,120
It's impossible to build a Palace Hall in the sky.

459
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,120
Could it be a myth?

460
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Look.

461
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
There's a Taoist.

462
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,120
Is this Taoist a Lu Dongbin?

463
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,120
This is the story of the God of Heaven.

464
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
No way.

465
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
No way.

466
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Look at these people's clothes.

467
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
It should be the clothes of the famous chef.

468
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,120
And this process of building a palace hall is also a popular process.

469
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,120
It's impossible that the ancient people have the ability to build a Palace Hall in the sky.

470
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,120
They are not too much.

471
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,120
It's a bit ridiculous.

472
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:32,120
The legend says Zhu Yuanzhang once wanted to build a palace hall with only one of the ancient legends.

473
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,120
And he handed this task to Wang Zanghai.

474
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,120
Then Wang Zanghai really built it.

475
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,120
It's impossible.

476
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,120
It's said that he used a huge sum of money and spent a lot of money.

477
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,120
In the end, he really built a beautiful palace in the sky.

478
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,120
Now he's pretending to be the one who wanted to marry Zhu Yuanzhang.

479
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Zhu Yuanzhang wanted to build a palace hall.

480
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
He wanted to build a palace hall.

481
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,120
If I were Zhu Yuanzhang, I would be mad.

482
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,120
I would have to be like Ming Dynasty's Yuan Chonghuan, the city's master.

483
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,120
I would have to be like Ming Dynasty's Yuan Chonghuan, the city's master.

484
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,120
I would have to be like Ming Dynasty's Yuan Chonghuan, the city's master.

485
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,120
It's a legend.

486
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
It's a good thing.

487
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
Brother.

488
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,120
What happened later?

489
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,120
I think there are more clues.

490
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
It should be in the back of the palace.

491
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
So we should keep exploring.

492
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
No.

493
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,120
We only have the experience of the Xia Meng in Wusan.

494
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,120
But now it's his rest.

495
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,120
Without his leadership, we can't fight with him.

496
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
Then call him up.

497
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,120
He took care of us for a long time on this road.

498
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,120
Shouldn't he have more sleep?

499
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,120
Zhang Qiling.

500
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,120
Don't worry.

501
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
I can take care of myself.

502
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,120
How can you take care of yourself?

503
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Do you have the experience of Xia Meng?

504
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Even if you don't think about it yourself,

505
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
you should consider the safety of everyone.

506
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
I will.

507
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
I will be back soon.

508
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
You are not allowed to go.

509
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,120
There is no one in the middle.

510
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
If anything happens to you,

511
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
how can I explain to the leader?

512
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
Thank you.

513
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,120
Thank you.

514
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
Miss Kun, wait.

515
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
Where are you going?

516
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,120
What are you waiting for?

517
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,120
We are going too.

518
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
Miss Kun, my report says that

519
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
Qingfasi's Wen clan is doing research.

520
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
I am here to study the Wen clan.

521
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
The assassination of the Wen clan

522
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
has caused a lot of changes in the ancient tomb.

523
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,120
So, everyone, I am sorry.

524
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,120
I am sorry.

525
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
I am sorry, too.

526
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
We are a whole.

527
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,120
We can't do it alone.

528
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
Yes, you are right.

529
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Since you want to go,

530
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
let's go together.

531
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,120
Let's go.

532
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
Let's go.

533
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
Wenjing,

534
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
do you want to wake him up?

535
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
Forget it.

536
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,120
His temper is a rock.

537
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,120
If he wakes him up now,

538
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,120
he will definitely have a conflict with Xiao Zhang.

539
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
Let him sleep here for a while.

540
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Let's go back now.

541
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,120
Okay, I am leaving.

542
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
Be careful.

543
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,120
Be careful.

544
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,120
Why are activists трottering,

545
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
they don't have clear commentaries.

546
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
Nobody knows about this.

547
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,120
It is above our caffeine.

548
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,120
But why do they know about the幹嘛 activities?

549
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,400
It can be そら

550
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,120
because it is the power to work together.

551
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,120
When they are works together,

552
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,120
the reason is not how they can work together.

553
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,120
I shouldn't have doubted against it.

554
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,640
What is the reason for this?

555
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,120
We have just discussed this with you.

556
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,440
Stop it!

557
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,160
You guys are a few years older than Zhang.

558
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,320
Why are you still so young?

559
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,440
Don't be afraid.

560
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,240
Go, go, go.

561
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,800
Don't scare yourself.

562
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,560
I'll show you the way.

563
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,720
Zhou Yun, don't run away.

564
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,920
It's my fault!

565
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,320
What are you doing?

566
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,360
There's no fault in this world.

567
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,200
This fog

568
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,400
contains some precious things.

569
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,800
Under the light,

570
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,200
there will be some shadows.

571
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,400
But this is a normal scientific phenomenon.

572
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,760
Don't scare yourself.

573
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,320
Is this the monster you said?

574
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,000
I didn't click.

575
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,600
This is βutiful.

576
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:48,060
It destroys the past

577
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,060
somezung

578
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,180
Warning!

579
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,820
Human...

580
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,540
Ça zhora, все.

581
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,540
Don't waste time here.

582
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,540
Go back.

583
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,540
Okay.

584
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,540
Let's go.

585
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,540
Be careful.

586
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,540
Wait a minute.

587
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,540
Zhizhang hasn't come yet.

588
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,540
He's just in the middle of the field.

589
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,540
I'll call him.

590
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,540
Zhizhang, hurry up.

591
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,540
Zhang Qilin.

592
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,540
Zhang Qilin.

593
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,540
Let's go together.

594
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,540
Zhizhang,

595
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,540
Zhizhang,

596
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,540
Zhizhang,

597
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,540
Zhang Qilin.

598
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,540
Zhang Qilin.

599
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,540
What's wrong?

600
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,540
He's going to kill us.

601
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,540
What's that?

602
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,540
Zhang,

603
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,540
what are you doing there?

604
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,540
Come here.

605
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,540
Zhang is too close to that thing.

606
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,540
If anything happens,

607
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,540
he might be pushed back.

608
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
What should we do?

609
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,540
Now,

610
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,540
we can only keep it.

611
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,540
Then we'll stay here.

612
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,540
You want to escape?

613
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,540
No.

614
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,540
But

615
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,540
he'll kill us.

616
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,540
Don't panic.

617
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,540
I remember that place.

618
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,540
It's like a sea of ​​horses.

619
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,540
Look at that height.

620
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,540
Is there something

621
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,540
standing on it?

622
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,540
I remember

623
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,540
that's a monkey.

624
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,540
What's on it?

625
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,540
Could it be

626
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,540
the monster

627
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,540
behind us

628
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,540
when we came?

629
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,540
No.

630
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,540
Could it be

631
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,540
the pine tree

632
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,540
I mentioned?

633
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,540
Don't.

634
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
Don't.

635
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,540
Don't panic.

636
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,540
Only the ancient tomb is on the sea.

637
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
Hundreds of years of people

638
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,540
have been in trouble.

639
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,540
It's scattered

640
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,540
from the sea.

641
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,540
From the sea,

642
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,540
it's a sea of ​​horses.

643
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,540
If it's really

644
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,540
buried on the sea,

645
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,540
it's heartless.

646
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,540
The sea of ​​horses

647
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,540
are full of oxygen.

648
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,540
There are dragons and dragons.

649
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,540
The planet is in the shape of a dragon.

650
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,540
There's no pine tree

651
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,540
in this kind of water.

652
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,540
Since it's not a pine tree,

653
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,540
it's not a human.

654
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,540
As long as it's alive,

655
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,540
we're not afraid of it.

656
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,540
Could it be

657
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,540
the pine tree?

658
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,540
He woke up and found

659
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,540
we were not there.

660
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,540
He came to scare us.

661
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,540
You know him best.

662
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,540
Isn't he this personality?

663
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,540
This is so annoying.

664
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,540
I'm scared to death.

665
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,540
The pine tree.

666
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,540
Don't play with it.

667
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,540
The female comrades are all scared to death.

668
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,540
Could it be the pine tree?

669
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,540
Be careful.

670
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,540
Wait here.

671
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,540
I'll go and call Zhang.

672
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,540
Fox!

673
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,540
Zhang, what are you doing?

674
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,540
Wu San Xing?

675
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,540
What are you doing?

676
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,540
What's wrong?

677
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540
Zhang Qilin.

678
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,540
Stop the time.

679
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,540
Don't let him go.

680
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,540
Where's San Xing?

681
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,540
Where did he go?

682
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,540
What's going on?

683
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,540
This car

684
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,540
is a huge machine.

685
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,540
Behind the door,

686
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,540
another wall is behind the door.

687
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,540
A wall?

688
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,540
A car-truck?

689
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,540
It's a car-truck restaurant.

690
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,540
According to my experience,

691
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,540
this machine

692
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,540
must have been made

693
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,540
by the simplest source.

694
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,540
Why?

695
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,540
The so-called

696
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,540
small-scale machine

697
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,540
is made of wood,

698
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,540
no matter how good it is.

699
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,540
After hundreds of years,

700
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,540
thousands of years of years,

701
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,540
it will all be

702
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,540
a certain service.

703
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,540
So,

704
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,540
the most reliable way to trap the thieves

705
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,540
is to use this

706
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,540
the simplest

707
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,540
anti-aircraft layer.

708
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,540
That's right.

709
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,540
Once you dig it,

710
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,540
the sand in a few tons

711
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,540
will fall off.

712
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,540
The earthenware is not

713
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,540
dead,

714
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,540
but it's also dead.

715
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,540
But I'm telling you,

716
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,540
if you have the strength,

717
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,540
you have to go down

718
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,540
like me.

719
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,540
I can set the location

720
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,540
of the root of the sand

721
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,540
and go from the roof

722
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,540
to the main room

723
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,540
with a 12-layer roof.

724
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,540
Do you believe it?

725
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,540
Of course.

726
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,540
It's not worth mentioning.

727
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,540
All right?

728
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,540
I think

729
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,540
Wang Zanghai

730
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
should have used

731
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,540
the power of the sea water.

732
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,540
To operate this machine.

733
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,540
As long as the water is not dry,

734
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,540
these machines

735
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,540
can operate all the time.

736
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,540
You should know

737
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,540
that the magic of the world

738
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,540
is mostly

739
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,540
used by humans

740
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,540
to fight against nature.

741
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,540
But Wang Zanghai

742
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,540
is the opposite.

743
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,540
He is a great man

744
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,540
who is powerful

745
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
and has the power.

746
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,540
He is really a great man.

747
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,540
I think

748
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,540
you smart people

749
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,540
are too noisy.

750
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,540
You can easily get into trouble.

751
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,540
You know?

752
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,540
Mr. Yabuzang,

753
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,540
did you

754
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,540
find the door

755
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,540
that Uncle San said?

756
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,540
In fact,

757
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,540
I found eight doors.

758
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,540
Eight?

759
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,540
The gate of the gate?

760
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,540
The gate of the gate?

761
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,540
I'm afraid of this thing.

762
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,540
I don't know

763
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,540
if you know what you mean.

764
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,540
The gate of the gate?

765
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,540
I know it a little bit.

766
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,540
It's said that

767
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,540
the gate of the gate is very early.

768
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,540
It almost looks like

769
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,540
the history of my country

770
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,540
has been written in the same way.

771
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,540
The first one

772
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,540
is the old grandfather,

773
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,540
the emperor,

774
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,540
who used the gate of the gate.

775
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,540
It's been five thousand years.

776
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,540
The gate of the gate

777
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,540
has a total of 4,320 rooms.

778
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,540
When the emperor was in his hands,

779
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,540
he only saw 1,080 rooms.

780
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
When he arrived in Zhangliang,

781
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,540
it was 72 rooms.

782
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,540
Now he only

783
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,540
got 42 rooms

784
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,540
in my uncle's hands.

785
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,540
It's hard to get this.

786
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,540
There are only 18 rooms

787
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,540
in the world.

788
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,540
My uncle

789
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,540
found it from a dream.

790
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,540
Who invented

791
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,540
the gate of the gate?

792
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,540
The emperor's first one.

793
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,540
And then he got

794
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,540
more than 1,000 rooms.

795
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,540
There is also a boat and a belt.

796
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,540
If you say

797
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,540
the emperor's first thing,

798
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,540
it's not accurate, right?

799
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,540
To put it simply,

800
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,540
the gate of the gate is

801
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,540
the military law and the law of the art.

802
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,540
It's also called

803
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,540
the Eighth Formation

804
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,540
which is the first to be destroyed,

805
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,540
the capital is the capital,

806
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,540
the gate is the gate.

807
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,540
The gate is the life,

808
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,540
the gate is the death.

809
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,540
The gate is the death.

810
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,540
The gate is the right side

811
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,540
of the gate,

812
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,540
the gate is the right side of the gate.

813
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,540
The teacher is in the classroom.

814
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,540
You tell me

815
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,540
which gate can enter.

816
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,540
Which gate can't enter.

817
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,540
This one?

818
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,540
I don't know.

819
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,540
Because these walls

820
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,540
are always rotating.

821
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,540
Besides, these eight gates

822
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,540
are always moving.

823
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,540
It's not clear which gate is the life

824
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,540
and which is the death.

825
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,540
If the gate is entered,

826
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,540
it's dangerous.

827
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,540
Which gate did you enter at that time?

828
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,540
Why did you say that

829
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,540
the three-star prison gate is open?

830
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,540
Shall we go up and take a look?

831
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,540
Didn't Xiao Zhang say that

832
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,540
there are mechanisms in these gates?

833
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,540
If it's entered,

834
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,540
it's dead.

835
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,540
Anyway, it must be the door of the life.

836
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,540
As long as we find that door,

837
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,540
it's fine.

838
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,540
How do you know

839
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,540
it must be the door of the life?

840
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,540
Maybe it's now...

841
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,540
It's now...

842
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,540
Sister Wenjing,

843
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,540
I'm just saying.

844
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,540
Don't be angry.

845
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,540
I found it.

846
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,540
I found it.

847
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,540
Come and take a look.

848
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,540
What?

849
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,540
What?

850
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,540
You don't look like me.

851
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,540
Did you see it?

852
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,540
Did you see it?

853
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,540
You're standing too high.

854
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,540
Lower it.

855
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,540
Don't move.

856
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,540
I didn't ask you to hide your face.

857
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,540
Touch your feet with your hands.

858
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,540
That's it.

859
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,540
We thought the three-star prison gate was open.

860
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,540
Actually, it's higher than the height.

861
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,540
This is the reason.

862
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,540
There is also a mechanism like a magnet.

863
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,540
So this mark will move.

864
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,540
The position it is facing should be the door.

865
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,540
Take the flashlight and I'll quickly pack up the suit.

866
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,540
Where are you going?

867
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,540
To find the door.

868
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,540
What are you going to do with the door?

869
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,540
Isn't it possible to find the door and get out of the hiding place?

870
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,540
Then this is a bloody door.

871
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,540
But there is a cloud-like sky palace inside.

872
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,540
What's wrong, Sister Wenjing?

873
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,540
Nothing.

874
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,540
Everyone be more careful.

875
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,540
Okay.

876
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,540
What is that?

877
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,540
Oh my god.

878
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,540
This is the仙境.

879
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,540
There is such a beautiful place.

880
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,540
There is such a beautiful place in our house!

881
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,140
It's so incredible!

882
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:56,640
Yes.

883
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,640
This is the whole Golden Forest.

884
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
It's so beautiful!

885
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,440
Look!

886
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,940
Look! This is the Night Pearl!

887
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,140
It's so beautiful!
