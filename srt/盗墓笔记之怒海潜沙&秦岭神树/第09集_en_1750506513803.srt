1
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,840
Now the world needs you and now the world needs me

2
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:47,800
for all the world needs you

3
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,640
and if all is possible

4
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,260
human beings will stand by the holy head

5
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,260
I'm afraid of the stars in my heart.

6
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,260
I've been searching for the stories of the nightfall

7
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,260
that disappeared in the history of Chen'ai.

8
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,260
It's a great pleasure.

9
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,260
However, the facts are not as simple as I thought.

10
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,260
What are you doing? Go away!

11
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,260
What I've encountered in these ancient tombs

12
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,260
is a completely different story

13
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,260
from the stories of the ancient people's cunning and cunning.

14
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,260
I've found that in my life,

15
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,260
there are too many mysteries

16
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,260
that are related to these tombs.

17
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,260
When I was young,

18
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,260
Yangyang, don't move.

19
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,260
No one can predict the future.

20
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,260
I think that every time I see the truth,

21
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,260
I think that the reason is to persist.

22
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,260
Wu Xie,

23
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,260
I've found the old photo.

24
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,260
I'll take it back.

25
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,260
You gave me this photo.

26
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,260
From the internet,

27
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,260
there is only one result.

28
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,260
However, according to the IP address,

29
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,260
I can confirm that the person who posted it was in Beijing.

30
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,260
Who are these people in this photo?

31
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,260
This is a test team of decades ago.

32
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,260
I've been inside for three days.

33
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,260
But I've never seen such a detailed list of people.

34
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,260
Besides this list,

35
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
is there anything else that can be found?

36
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,260
I can try.

37
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,260
Look at it yourself.

38
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,260
At the station,

39
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,260
The Seventh Floor of the Sea? Can we find the exact location of this person?

40
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,260
The Seventh Floor of the Sea? Can we find the exact location of this person?

41
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,260
The Seventh Floor of the Sea? Can we find the exact location of this person?

42
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,260
The Seventh Floor of the Sea? Can we find the exact location of this person?

43
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,260
The Seventh Floor of the Sea? Can we find the exact location of this person?

44
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,260
The Seventh Floor of the Sea? Can we find the exact location of this person?

45
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,260
The Seventh Floor of the Sea? Can we find the exact location of this person?

46
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,260
The Seventh Floor of the Sea? This name

47
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,260
is not only used by him on the Internet.

48
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,260
Recently, it appeared in the company system of Terescom.

49
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:46,260
I translated this website. It seems to be a company with a computer science and technology.

50
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,260
They are always in Hangzhou.

51
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,260
Terescom.

52
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,260
The company with a computer science and technology

53
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,260
is still in the company.

54
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,260
What are you thinking about?

55
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,260
You are looking for a high-end computer company and you are still in the Seventh Floor?

56
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,260
The search engine has provided a clue that has been ignored by us.

57
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,260
What clue?

58
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,260
On July 20, I found the entrance of the Seventh Floor of the Sea.

59
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,260
After that, the Seventh Floor was left alone and was in the South.

60
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,260
There are still nine people left in the list.

61
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,260
But there are only eight people left in the list on July 24.

62
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,260
There is one missing.

63
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,260
Yes.

64
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,260
If he didn't go to the Seventh Floor,

65
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,260
then he wouldn't be in the South.

66
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,260
But why didn't he go to the Seventh Floor?

67
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,260
I will take the blame.

68
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,260
He might know that the Seventh Floor is dangerous.

69
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,260
So he left the Seventh Floor alone.

70
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,260
So you think that there is a problem with the people on the Seventh Floor, right?

71
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,260
If there is a problem, we will know.

72
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,260
Yes.

73
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,260
Fatty.

74
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,260
Fatty.

75
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,260
I have a question.

76
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,260
What question?

77
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,260
Why am I wearing this?

78
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,260
You are just pretending to be a bodyguard.

79
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,260
Remember, you are a big boss of a company.

80
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,260
I am a boss. I am a family member.

81
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,260
What is this?

82
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,260
I don't usually wear this kind of clothes.

83
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,260
I am wasting money.

84
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,260
What else can I do?

85
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,260
Remember, being an actor is the most important thing.

86
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,260
You are a actor.

87
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,260
All of us are actors.

88
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,260
I am so tired of acting.

89
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,260
I am dying.

90
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,260
Is it that important to be in the Seventh Floor?

91
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,260
Shouldn't we put the center of gravity on the sea and the sky?

92
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,260
You are right.

93
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,260
That is so ridiculous.

94
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,260
We can't go through the waves of peace.

95
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,260
What is that person called?

96
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,260
A smoker, right?

97
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,260
Hello.

98
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
Hello.

99
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,260
We are here to see President Xiao.

100
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,260
President Xiao is having a meeting.

101
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,260
Do you have an appointment?

102
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,260
I called President Xiao's secretary yesterday.

103
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,260
We are here to talk about cooperation.

104
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,260
You are really a fish.

105
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,260
Of course not.

106
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,260
Let's talk about it later.

107
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,260
So hot.

108
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,260
President, are you up to anything?

109
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,260
What will happen now?

110
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,260
I have to go to the CPC English Association.

111
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,260
And your name, correct?

112
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,260
If you don't stop talking about it,

113
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,260
I will kill you.

114
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
You want us to go back to the audience?

115
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,260
Forget it.

116
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,260
Go.

117
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,760
Sit.

118
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
President Xiao, Hello

119
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,560
It's...

120
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,760
Our channel is not a garbage and isn't offered by human Дм ordinarily

121
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,860
It's from our boss, Director Wang

122
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,580
I'm the founder and our composer

123
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,260
Sit

124
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,260
First of all, I'd like to thank President Xiao

125
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,260
for giving me this opportunity to introduce my company.

126
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,260
Our next company is the first company

127
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,260
to develop the smart machine in China.

128
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,260
In fact, the smart machine

129
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,260
has already been developed by foreigners.

130
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,260
This must be the most promising

131
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,260
industry at the moment.

132
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,260
The high-tech information company wants to

133
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,260
move forward in the industry.

134
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,260
That's the best option.

135
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,260
Let me show you my idea.

136
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,260
As long as you give me your big data,

137
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,260
I can immediately give you a model.

138
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,260
The artificial intelligence machine

139
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,260
will definitely use your company

140
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,260
to make people believe in you.

141
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,260
I think you two should stop wasting your time

142
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,260
on me.

143
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,260
Maybe you have some misunderstandings

144
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,260
about my company.

145
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,260
I hope that in the future,

146
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,260
you can find the right partner

147
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,260
to fulfill your dream soon.

148
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,260
I have a meeting this afternoon.

149
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,260
I won't be here for a long time.

150
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,260
President Xiao,

151
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,260
I may not be able to express my opinion

152
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,260
clearly, but I know that the best

153
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,260
is the cloud data output.

154
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,260
Let me give you an example.

155
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,260
Just like the sea island,

156
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,260
once you have the opportunity to get the data,

157
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,260
you can send it to your big data

158
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,260
through the data storage in the cloud data storage.

159
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,260
If it is more and more,

160
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,260
I don't know what your real purpose is.

161
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,260
I have only one thing to say.

162
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,260
I can't provide anything you want.

163
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,260
We can't work together.

164
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,260
Send it to the big data storage.

165
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,260
Please.

166
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,260
You are not selling the cloud data here.

167
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,260
You don't have any information.

168
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,260
Why are you mentioning the sea island 701?

169
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,260
I did it on purpose.

170
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,260
I just want to see the information.

171
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,260
What is the reaction after hearing this name?

172
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,260
Why?

173
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,260
I have seen the pictures.

174
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,260
Look carefully.

175
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,260
The list mentioned in the sea island 701.

176
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,260
Chen Wenjing, Huo Lian, Li Sidi, Zhang Qilian.

177
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,260
Xiao Da?

178
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,260
Does Xiao Huo have anything to do with Xiao Da?

179
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,260
I don't know if he does,

180
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,260
but he must have something to do with sea island 701.

181
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,260
After hearing this name,

182
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,260
his reaction is clear.

183
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,260
Hello.

184
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,260
Why are you here?

185
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,260
I remember you.

186
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,260
You came here last time, right?

187
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,260
Yes.

188
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,260
I have a impression.

189
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,260
I dropped it.

190
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,260
Don't break it.

191
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,260
Time is running out.

192
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,260
Please let me have a look at the computer.

193
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,260
Please let me have a look at the computer.

194
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,260
Be careful.

195
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,260
What?

196
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,260
I came here today to meet you,

197
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,260
Mr. Xiao.

198
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,260
In the past,

199
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,260
our staff was Xiao Xie.

200
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
What happened?

201
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
A black shell is in my computer.

202
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,260
You are sea island 701?

203
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,260
I can't.

204
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,260
What are you doing?

205
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,260
President Xiao, I really have no enemies on you.

206
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:41,440
Please tell me the truth about the

207
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
truth.

208
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,440
I promise I won't bother you again.

209
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,440
But I won't leave even if I die today.

210
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,440
Because I lost my uncle before one month.

211
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,440
The only one who knows the truth is you.

212
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Only you.

213
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Your uncle?

214
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
My uncle is Wu San Xing.

215
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Sir, you can't go in.

216
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
President Xiao, sorry.

217
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
I didn't stop you.

218
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
One month ago,

219
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
I was told that someone used me

220
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,440
and went to the ADIM.

221
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
I went to the ADIM personally

222
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,440
and didn't find him.

223
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
If you're telling the truth,

224
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
I mean understanding and sympathy.

225
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
But I'm sorry.

226
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
I know what's going on.

227
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,440
It's useless to you.

228
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
As long as you give me the data of your cloud,

229
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
and help me,

230
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
I'll analyze it myself.

231
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,440
I've had nothing to do with what happened that year.

232
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
I didn't participate in any of the events.

233
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,440
Please understand me.

234
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
I don't want to be disturbed

235
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,440
by any of the events.

236
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Okay.

237
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
I'll finish the job this morning.

238
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
I'll go to the ADIM.

239
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Stop it.

240
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
I think he doesn't want to tell us

241
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
the reason for the accident.

242
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
What's the reason?

243
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
He's just a doctor.

244
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
What's the reason?

245
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
He doesn't want to affect his family

246
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,440
because of this.

247
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,440
No matter what I say,

248
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
you're still a kid.

249
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
You're dead.

250
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
This is not the end.

251
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Go back to Beijing.

252
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Go back?

253
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
You're going back to Beijing?

254
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
I just arrived here this morning.

255
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
I'll go back.

256
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
You can go back to Beijing.

257
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Stay here.

258
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
I'll pack the food.

259
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
I'll go find Ji Xiu Zhang.

260
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
No.

261
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
I...

262
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
I'm going to the ADIM.

263
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
I'll go to the ADIM.

264
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
I'll go to the ADIM.

265
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
I'll go to the ADIM.

266
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,440
I'll go to the ADIM.

267
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
I'll go to the ADIM.

268
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
I'll go to the ADIM.

269
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,440
I'll go to the ADIM.

270
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
I'll go to the ADIM.

271
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
I'll go to the ADIM.

272
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
I'll go to the ADIM.

273
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
I'll go to the ADIM.

274
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
I'll go to the ADIM.

275
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
I'll go to the ADIM.

276
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
I'll go to the ADIM.

277
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
I'll go to the ADIM.

278
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
Reinhard,

279
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
What?

280
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Hello, hello.

281
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Hello.

282
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
Dr. Li.

283
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
Right.

284
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Do you know that you let my mom cure it?

285
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
Now, she's got the nerve.

286
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
She's so healthy and grateful to you.

287
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
Probably yes.

288
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,840
I'm so grateful to you.

289
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,880
I should.

290
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,720
Why did I come here today

291
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,360
to see Mr. Xiao Yu?

292
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,400
Mr. Xiao's wife.

293
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,480
Is she his mother?

294
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,400
Is he his mother?

295
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,240
His mother is in the lake.

296
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,120
She's in the sun.

297
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,120
Mr. Xiao is here, too.

298
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,200
Yes, his mother.

299
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,760
Okay, okay.

300
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,120
How can I go to the lake?

301
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,040
Do you want some water?

302
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
I'll get it for you.

303
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,960
This is a pond.

304
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,800
I can't drink it for a few days.

305
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
I'm so thirsty.

306
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,120
Mrs. Xiao Yu.

307
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,600
Are you Xiao Yu's mother?

308
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,800
I'm...

309
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,800
I'm...

310
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,200
You're not my name?

311
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,600
My name is Wang.

312
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,800
Wang?

313
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,600
You're Wang's son, right?

314
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Yes, yes.

315
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,800
I know your father.

316
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm Wang's son.

317
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,200
I'm Wang's son.

318
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,800
Yes, yes.

319
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,000
I know your father.

320
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,800
Yes, yes.

321
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,600
Your father is Wang.

322
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Wang.

323
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,400
Wang, Wang, Wang.

324
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,000
Wang.

325
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Dad.

326
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,400
Dad.

327
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,000
Dad.

328
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,800
Si.

329
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,600
Okay, okay.

330
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,800
To be honest,

331
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,400
I'm getting more and more

332
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,600
into this kind of physical and mental disorder.

333
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,400
We don't have a better way to do it.

334
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,600
You take the time to accompany him.

335
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Go out and walk.

336
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Try not to cause any sensitive problems.

337
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,600
Okay, I got it.

338
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,600
Mr. Xiao.

339
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Why are you here?

340
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,800
Where's my mom?

341
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,200
Your friend came to see her.

342
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
She's talking to her.

343
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,400
What friend?

344
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Mr. Xiao.

345
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
You're doing this together?

346
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,400
Yes, he's not just a company

347
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,600
with information about the Pugong Eagle.

348
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,800
And we're also doing a test.

349
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Do you know what's going on?

350
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,600
The underwater tomb, the Seaside Island, the 701?

351
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,600
The underwater tomb?

352
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,400
Mom.

353
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,000
Mom.

354
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,800
Who told you to go to the valley?

355
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Tell us.

356
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,400
Mom.

357
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Who told you to go to the valley?

358
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,600
I don't know who told you to go to the valley.

359
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,200
Mom, it's okay.

360
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,800
Xiao Yu's attitude is more determined than I thought.

361
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,200
And everything about the valley

362
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,200
is important to the management of the secret body.

363
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,000
All the troubles

364
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,200
are all gathered in the Seaside and the Seaside.

365
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,600
What kind of power

366
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,000
can make so many people go to the valley?

367
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,000
The three Seaside and the Seaside

368
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,400
are in the Luang Palace,

369
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,600
the Seaside and Seaside.

370
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,000
Where's the other one?

371
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,200
Is it the Cloud Sky Palace?

372
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,400
These three graves

373
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,000
are the Seaside and the Seaside.

374
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
The other one

375
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,200
is the Cloud Sky Palace

376
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,000
which can be used as a memorial service.

377
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What's the connection between these three graves?

378
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,800
Where's the suit?

379
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,800
It's off.

380
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
It's off.

381
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,800
What's wrong with this?

382
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,800
What's so strange?

383
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
What's that?

384
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,400
What do you want?

385
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,600
After being touched,

386
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,800
I didn't give up.

387
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
I didn't give up.

388
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,000
After being touched,

389
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I went to the hospital.

390
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,600
After being touched, I gave up.

391
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,200
I was a child.

392
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
I was a child.

393
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,000
I envy you.

394
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,800
You have a mother.

395
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,200
I didn't have a wife.

396
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
I didn't have a family.

397
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,600
Mr. Xiao. Mr. Xiao.

398
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
I'm sorry.

399
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
returned.

400
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,000
OMG.

401
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,300
You guys look like each other.

402
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,400
They

403
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,400
went to the relative to find the relative.

404
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
You?

405
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,400
Mr. Zhao.

406
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
What's the situation?

407
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Xiao Yu is cold blooded.

408
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
He's too strong to protect himself.

409
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
But he's not willing to do that.

410
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,800
If a family gets into a fight,

411
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,800
then no one will be able to handle it.

412
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Is he Xiao Da?

413
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Yes.

414
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
And I'm telling you,

415
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Xiao Da is the only one who hasn't been to the bottom of the sea.

416
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
He's the one who's been to the bottom of the sea.

417
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
The archaeological team member.

418
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,800
My father and Wu San Xing, Chen Wen Jin and the others,

419
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
went to the Xisha Islands together.

420
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,800
On the day of the sunset, he sent a message to the team.

421
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,800
The archaeological team's teammates left him alone on the sea.

422
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,800
When he woke up, it's been three days.

423
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
Did he do it himself?

424
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,800
He didn't dare to do it.

425
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,800
I went to investigate the unit of the archaeological team.

426
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
I couldn't find anything.

427
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Where did he go?

428
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,800
He went back to Beijing alone.

429
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,800
My father had to go to the Xisha Islands at least three times a year.

430
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,800
He's been going on for two to three years.

431
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Until he found someone.

432
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
My uncle found him?

433
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
Yes.

434
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Xiao Da was happy.

435
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
He's always been your uncle's fan.

436
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Did my uncle mention anything else?

437
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Did he mention anything else?

438
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
He wanted to...

439
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:16,800
He wanted to ask Xiao Da about Xiao Da's whereabouts.

440
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,800
My father has been following Wu San Xing's way.

441
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Wu San Xing couldn't explain it.

442
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
He didn't ask.

443
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
My father asked Wu San Xing.

444
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,800
What happened in the bottom of the sea?

445
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
What did Wu San Xing say?

446
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,800
He said that no matter if they were dead or alive,

447
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,800
they would be dead or alive.

448
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,800
But I think he really wanted to find someone.

449
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Not these people.

450
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,800
Fatty, there's a MP3 here.

451
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,800
This is Xiao Yi Lu.

452
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,800
Your uncle and Xiao Da fought with Lu.

453
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
Why didn't you go?

454
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,800
What are we looking for?

455
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,800
We're looking for a team of the anti-tank teams.

456
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,800
But they've already died half of China.

457
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,800
If I can get out of the bottom of the sea, they'll be...

458
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
It's different.

459
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Even the West Union is dead.

460
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
How could they be alive?

461
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
They must be alive.

462
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
They have a key.

463
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
The secret is not always sealed.

464
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
There's always a day when we need to see the light.

465
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
We're in this situation.

466
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,800
We can't forget our real purpose.

467
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Do you understand what I mean?

468
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
Fatty.

469
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Who drew this?

470
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
I don't know. Xiao Yi didn't say anything.

471
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Can I ask him?

472
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
It's all here.

473
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
You can just ask him.

474
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,800
If you don't find him, you can ask him.

475
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,800
I don't think it's good to see him.

476
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,800
Boss Xiao, it's late at night.

477
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,800
I'm sorry to bother you.

478
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
There's something else in here.

479
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Can you tell me who drew it?

480
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Please watch out.

481
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,800
It's late.

482
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
I don't know what it is.

483
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,800
This was the reason

484
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
for my father's справ finan 1954's peace assembly.

485
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,800
I don't know why my father got lost.

486
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,040
Hello.

487
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,240
Is Chinese Yives here?

488
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,540
They have been here.

489
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
The photo that the enemy left us was sent to you.

490
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
It was the same as the old photo you sent.

491
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
No.

492
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,800
I was sure that this photo had no signature on it.

493
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
I'm sure.

494
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
I've checked it.

495
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
It wasn't the photo you gave me.

496
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Also,

497
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,800
there was a snake-mei-tong on this photo.

498
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
The snake-mei-tong is on his hand.

499
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Besides, the enemy wants to see you.

500
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
I've checked it.

501
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
He's wearing a mask.

502
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
Do you want to see him?

503
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,800
Yes.

504
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
What do you need to do?

505
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
Put him on the boat.

506
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Don't let him run away.

507
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Got it.

508
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,800
The wind is blowing.

509
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
Why did you bring me here?

510
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,800
You want to see me?

511
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
Just take it as a reason.

512
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Spring is not good.

513
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
You don't want to kiss me?

514
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
I said,

515
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
go now.

516
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
I'm not going.

517
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
I'll wait for you here.

518
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Don't regret it.

519
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
I'll wait for you.

520
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Don't regret it.

521
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
You're looking for me?

522
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
Someone wants to see you.

523
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Have a seat.

524
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Okay.

525
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
I'll wait for you here.

526
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
What do you want?

527
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
What's up, Wu?

528
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
Do you want a song?

529
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
I'm sorry, ladies.

530
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,800
I lost the game

531
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
because of the real-life adventure.

532
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
My friends

533
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
asked me to come here.

534
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
Please drink this bottle of wine.

535
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
Come on.

536
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Come on.

537
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
What's up?

538
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
Who's the winner?

539
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Do you know who's the winner?

540
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
You're also the winner of the game.

541
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
You go first.

542
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
You go first.

543
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
You go first.

544
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Okay.

545
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Come on.

546
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
Okay.

547
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
I have one of the same kind of fish.

548
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
I need to find two more.

549
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
How do you know there are three?

550
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
I'm going to find one.

551
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
What are you going to find?

552
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
This is the third question.

553
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
I'm going to find the third one.

554
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
I'm going to find the third one.

555
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
I'm going to find the third one.

556
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Is this the third question?

557
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
I'm not asking you.

558
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
Are you still my friend?

559
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
I'm too anxious.

560
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,800
Because the same kind of fish is important to me.

561
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Since you're also investigating the same kind of fish,

562
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
you should have seen that photo.

563
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
The Western Sands Valley team.

564
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
You should know

565
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
that my uncle Xie Lian Huan

566
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
is also in that photo.

567
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Which one is your uncle?

568
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,800
This one.

569
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
This one?

570
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Are you sure this is my uncle?

571
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
This photo is low-speed.

572
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
You admit it wrong and you don't have enough time to maintain it.

573
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
Besides, as far as I know,

574
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,800
when they were young, they really looked alike.

575
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Even if someone said they were twins, they also had a personality.

576
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
And don't forget,

577
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
Xie Wu and I are related by marriage.

578
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
They were originally brothers.

579
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
So they look alike.

580
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
What's so strange about them?

581
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
They look alike.

582
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
I know.

583
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
My lord,

584
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
I'm here to talk to you.

585
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Uncle,

586
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
you're back.

587
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
What have you been up to?

588
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
Yu Chen.

589
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
He's your uncle Wu Jia.

590
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,800
They look alike.

591
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,040
He's very Sociological.

592
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,080
So, I realized that they were in a group.

593
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,480
Four people decided not to see any other of them

594
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,800
even my Complex was corrupted from the mission.

595
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,960
So I didn't have enoughふふ.

596
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Look.

597
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
Sorry.

598
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
What's your money?

599
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,800
You haven't told me how you came up with three of the same fish.

600
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,800
And you also know that the relationship between the fish and the archaeologist is not the same.

601
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,800
Are you investigating the archaeology too?

602
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,800
I went to the Western Desert to see the archaeologist before it was too late.

603
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Wu Xie, you shouldn't have come in here.

604
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Listen to me.

605
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,800
Keep it.

606
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
As long as I haven't found the clue,

607
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,800
I'll keep investigating this matter.

608
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Before I came here, I was worried about something.

609
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
So I put the same fish in my house.

610
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,800
When I come back to Hangzhou, I'll send it to you.

611
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
Why give it to me?

612
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
There are three of the same fish.

613
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
If you can use two,

614
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,800
maybe I'll help you find another one.

615
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,800
I'm not interested in the secret behind the same fish.

616
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
The reason I found the clue is because

617
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,800
I'm not interested in the secret behind the same fish.

618
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,800
I'm not interested in the secret behind the same fish.

619
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,800
I'm not interested in the secret behind the same fish.

620
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,800
I'm not interested in the secret behind the same fish.

621
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,800
I'm not interested in the secret behind the same fish.

622
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,800
I'm not interested in the secret behind the same fish.

623
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,800
I'm not interested in the secret behind the same fish.

624
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,800
I'm not interested in the secret behind the same fish.

625
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,800
I'm not interested in the secret behind the same fish.

626
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,800
It's because I'm very likely to find out the reason why I was born.

627
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,800
Xiaohua,

628
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,800
it seems that we are doing the same thing.

629
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
So,

630
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
if you have any clues,

631
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,800
remember to tell me.

632
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
Okay.

633
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
You finished?

634
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
Do you want me to send you back?

635
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
No need.

636
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:52,800
I have a friendもう

637
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
What's going on?

638
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
What's going on?

639
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
What's going on?

640
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
What's going on?

641
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
Is it him?

642
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
You didn't tell me that.

643
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,800
If something happens, what will you do?

644
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
It's not like a flower.

645
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
Or you won't know how to die.

646
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,800
I didn't expect it to be a flower.

647
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
He scared me.

648
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
A flower is so mysterious.

649
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
It's so beautiful.

650
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
It's crazy.

651
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
So,

652
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,800
he was investigating the truth about the sea.

653
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,800
His purpose is to find out

654
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,800
the cause of Xie Lian Huan's death.

655
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,800
Then tell him the word.

656
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
This is what I'm most worried about.

657
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Once he knows about the suicide,

658
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,800
he will think that it was me who killed Xie Lian Huan.

659
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
You also think it was me?

660
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
No.

661
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,800
You don't dare to do it.

662
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
So,

663
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
I must find out the truth.

664
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
Tell Xiaohua.

665
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,800
I can't let Xie Lian Huan die.

666
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,800
Right?

667
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
Turn left.

668
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Enough.

669
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,800
I'm a good person.

670
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
I'm not a good person.

671
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
Xiaohua is a fool.

672
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
She doesn't know Xiaohua.

673
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
It's impossible.

674
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
She is so fat.

675
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
She must be so tired.

676
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,800
I just feel sorry for Xiaohua.

677
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,800
You are so important.

678
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
Drink something.

679
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Don't forget anything.

680
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Besides,

681
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,800
you can find out the cause of Xie Lian Huan's death.

682
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,800
You helped Xiaohua.

683
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
What do you think?

684
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Do you have a good relationship?

685
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,800
We played together when we were young.

686
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,800
I was a good person when I was a kid.

687
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
I was married and had a good relationship.

688
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,800
But now I don't know anyone.

689
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
Fatty,

690
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,800
get ready to go abroad.

691
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,800
Where are you going?

692
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,800
I found a way to help Xiaohua.

693
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
O implemented

694
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,800
Xiaohua

695
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,800
odzi

696
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,800
Western

697
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Bronze

698
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
gerne

699
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,800
Economy

700
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,800
I'm wondering the news striking is not new?

701
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,300
We need to go abroad already.

702
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,300
I don't know if you are crazy or I am.

703
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,300
Maybe we are all crazy.

704
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,300
This is not a romantic night.

705
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,300
People usually don't know this.

706
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,300
I tell you, this is abroad.

707
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,300
You don't know.

708
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,300
Just like this.

709
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,300
This place is not in our country.

710
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,300
It's abroad, right?

711
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,300
It's safe when you come back.

712
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,300
It's so dangerous.

713
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,300
Let's find someone to talk to.

714
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,300
And let him stay in our country.

715
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,300
It's safer when we are in our country.

716
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,300
You are right.

717
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,300
Of course.

718
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,300
Can we go?

719
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,300
Where should we go?

720
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,300
We can't go.

721
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,300
How?

722
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,300
Hurry up.

723
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,300
This is your car.

724
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,300
Don't you know my car?

725
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,300
Let's bet.

726
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,300
Let's bet on the first one.

727
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,300
What?

728
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,300
Let's bet.

729
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,300
We will say it later.

730
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,300
But first,

731
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,300
we will record it first.

732
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,300
Then send it to Weibo.

733
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,300
Don't deny it.

734
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
Ready, go!

735
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,300
Hello, I am Wu Xie.

736
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,300
I bet with Wang Pongzi.

737
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,300
I will go to the Hengdeli Museum first.

738
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,300
I will go there first.

739
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,300
I will make a video.

740
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,300
See?

741
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,300
Fatty is here.

742
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,300
What's wrong, Fatty?

743
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,300
You are not well.

744
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,300
I am fine.

745
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,300
What do you say?

746
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,300
I am fine.

747
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,300
What do you say?

748
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,300
I am fine.

749
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,300
What's wrong?

750
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,300
I haven't decided yet.

751
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,300
What's wrong?

752
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,300
What's wrong?

753
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,300
The museum is not big.

754
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,300
Well,

755
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,300
you owe me a wish.

756
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,300
When will I make a decision?

757
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,300
When will I return it?

758
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,300
How can you?

759
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,300
You are a real man.

760
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,300
Of course.

761
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,300
I can't take it.
