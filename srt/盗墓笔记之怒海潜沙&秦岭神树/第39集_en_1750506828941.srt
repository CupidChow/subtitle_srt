00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,920
Everybody, follow me!

2
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,080
Right now, in the mountains,

3
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:15,220

Belona

00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,980
An unemployment

7
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,260
for Krept

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:59,260

比 sense more profitably, pay more.

10
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:04,720
While you are already a victim of the same experiment of cutting trunks

11
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,840
Try to get out of the way

12
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,440
wendان and kill each other

13
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,220
and kill each other

14
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,120
Do not be afraid

15
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,640
Alright

16
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,300
Slight

17
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,600
Fatty, do you remember that mural?

18
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,560
It's this mountain.

19
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,400
The terrain is arranged by only a mountain as it was seen in theively constructed works of Seville武.

20
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,640
Eurygenia

21
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,800
How can we get there?

22
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,340
This is the Three shaky mountains,

23
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,160
there is only a part of the mountain

24
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:58,960
that are scattered

25
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,260
in the autumn waters in our region

26
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,060
within the Plateaus,

27
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,460
here, we can easily get there.

28
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,520
And the road that reaches up the mountain

29
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,140
is all steep difficulty,

30
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,100
there is a ten-meter τιςhehe with a brass chair

31
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,700
게t Pixh lugar

32
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,820
between the mountains while all of them are appealing.

33
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,580
雖 to fewer people here,

34
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,180
but at least there areauer.

35
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,540
Don't say there is no running near.

36
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,560
We had to take the patrol bike.

37
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,620
We were prepared to cross the river

38
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,020
with culinary experts.

39
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,180
But now, the first Hui river

40
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,680
is at different width.

41
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,240
This is the first enemy's provisional storyline.

42
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,460
If he goes blind, our keselmaした convo from the outside world is lost.

43
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,340
Stop sure you want to kill all of them.

44
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,720
We have penetrated its positions wait until I finish calling.

45
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,840
Okay, let's see whether we can kill him

46
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,340
What's that mountain?

47
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,640
It's from a mountain.

48
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,940
It's by our country.

49
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,760
It's belong to the three MINUS oceans,

50
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,580
and the multi-chamless mountains,

51
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,960
together with five parties.

52
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,660
Then…

53
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,520
From here,

54
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,480
can we go to that mountain?

55
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,300
We can.

56
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,920
It's only a day long trip,

57
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,300
and not bad.

58
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,460
It's a bit far from the city.

59
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,700
It's just a bit difficult to walk.

60
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,380
All right.

61
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,500
Then go there.

62
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,100
What's wrong, sir?

63
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,220
It's been so long since we've been there.

64
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,100
We haven't been able to see anything for so long.

65
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,660
Look at this.

66
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,100
The mountains are so clear.

67
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,900
There are three palaces in the middle of the year.

68
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,660
This is a rare three-headed dragon.

69
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,700
From the water of the Great Wind,

70
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,340
this is the so-called group dragon.

71
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,620
These three mountains are all dragons.

72
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,020
They are very suitable for hiding treasures.

73
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,900
But the ancient mark of the East and the West

74
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,300
is on the cliff of the mountain in the middle.

75
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,180
The two small dragons on both sides

76
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,180
should be hiding the great treasure of the royal family and the city.

77
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,100
Three-headed dragon?

78
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,460
Is there such a treasure, Tianzhen?

79
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,820
Yes.

80
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,580
For example, in 1987,

81
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,340
the three-headed dragon was created by the three countries.

82
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,660
It's the three mountains that have a relationship with each other.

83
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,260
They are divided into three mountains on the same mountain.

84
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,060
The two treasures on both sides

85
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,300
are divided into half a meter long and half a meter long.

86
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,820
They are the main thing in the middle.

87
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,020
Unfortunately, when they were discovered,

88
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,220
the dragon was burnt.

89
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,380
The archaeologists don't know if these dragons

90
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,380
are real or they are a symbolic set.

91
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,500
What else can we say?

92
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,540
The three-headed dragon has a very unique personality.

93
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,940
The dragon's head must be connected.

94
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,820
Otherwise, the three dragons are not in a good shape.

95
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,340
Without a direction, the dragon will be in a mess.

96
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,740
The people buried here will also kill each other in the descendants.

97
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,380
So, if there is a real treasure,

98
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,060
then there must be a secret passage

99
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,980
that leads to the main thing.

100
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,900
So,

101
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,060
we can go straight from the bottom of the ground to the three-headed mountain.

102
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,500
We don't need to go from the bottom of Shaoqiang to Yanpi.

103
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,420
The first treasure is the

104
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,620
the treasure of the three-headed dragon.

105
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,140
The treasure of the three-headed dragon is the

106
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,020
treasure of the three-headed dragon.

107
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,020
The treasure of the three-headed dragon is the

108
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,900
treasure of the three-headed dragon.

109
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,140
The treasure of the three-headed dragon is the

110
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,300
treasure of the three-headed dragon.

111
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,260
The treasure of the three-headed dragon is the

112
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,380
treasure of the three-headed dragon.

113
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,900
The treasure of the three-headed dragon is the

114
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,020
treasure of the three-headed dragon.

115
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,260
The treasure of the three-headed dragon is the

116
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,380
treasure of the three-headed dragon.

117
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,180
The treasure of flowerors is the

118
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:58,860
treasure ofren...

119
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,020
That's entire world!

120
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,340
Now you can see

121
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,780
the scenery of the next few Mayans.

122
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,780
Is all the good,

123
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,020
Uncle, this environment is much better.

124
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,820
At least there is no such huge ice cover in the hunting scene.

125
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,300
It's useless to worry that the feet suddenly break.

126
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,900
It's not good to go there.

127
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,900
The mountains here are not good for the connection.

128
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:29,020
There will often be ice rocks, ice caps, old holes, and giant ice islands.

129
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,700
In short, it is easy to lose the way when you walk.

130
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,140
Otherwise, there is a big hole under this snow layer.

131
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,540
Can you two learn to write? Can you close your mouth?

132
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,100
This push can't be pushed.

133
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,900
How can I push forward?

134
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,220
Is there any news about the heart of this person?

135
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,900
Heart of this person?

136
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,460
You want the heart of this person, right?

137
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:01,420
The one in front of us is the world's largest treasure.

138
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,740
That treasure!

139
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:09,100
Let's go with that treasure to see if it's enough for this person.

140
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,380
Fatty, be quiet.

141
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,900
Be careful of the snow.

142
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,940
It's okay.

143
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,340
For this treasure, let's go!

144
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,180
Let's go.

145
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,340
Let's go.

146
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:48,360
Call DNK Gan Orchestra

147
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,700
Son, eat something to rest a bit.

148
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,760
I've gone.

149
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:19,100
To be honest, your dad is a

150
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,040
guy with the Benim Accordp exile chain

151
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,660
in the area.

152
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,980
Should you advise him for him to pull over and

153
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,860
let's see if he can do anything about it.

154
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,040
еф butts are talking about the

155
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,460
greetings.

156
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,460
Most of the people went to the forest to see the animals.

157
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,460
How could they build such a huge park with so many people?

158
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,460
Chou Xiao Zi, you came here to talk, right?

159
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,460
If you don't even have a way to retreat,

160
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,460
you can still be the grandson of that old dog.

161
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,460
Actually, I have a plan.

162
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,460
But it's not right.

163
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,460
I want to hear your opinion on the four-story palace.

164
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,460
I'm guessing that the Cloud Sky Palace might have existed long ago.

165
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,460
It wasn't built by the East Xia State.

166
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,460
Maybe it's the place of the Great Valiant King who thought it over

167
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,460
and took it as his own place.

168
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,460
But the problem is coming again.

169
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,460
Who built this Cloud Sky Palace?

170
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,460
Why are you so anxious?

171
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,460
You'll know when you get there.

172
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,460
Oh, right.

173
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,460
I remember my uncle told me that

174
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,460
you have a snake-like tongue.

175
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,460
It's a very important key.

176
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,460
How did you get it?

177
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,460
Could it be that the place

178
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,460
has something to do with Cloud Sky Palace?

179
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,460
There's nothing to say about it.

180
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:55,460
Back then, I found a stone tower in the Western Oath of the West.

181
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,460
I accidentally found a stone tower.

182
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,460
But the stone tower has nothing but secret diamonds and diamonds.

183
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,460
There's one thing that's worth it.

184
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,460
It's the eight-spirited river.

185
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,460
The eight-spirited river is full of snake-like coins.

186
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,460
Is this process going well?

187
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,460
What do you mean?

188
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,460
I mean, there's a place where you can hide important treasure.

189
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,460
Isn't there a mechanism?

190
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,460
The stone tower...

191
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,460
The stone tower is a very important place.

192
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,460
It's a very important place.

193
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,460
It's a very important place.

194
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,460
Is it closed?

195
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,460
The stone tower is in the valley.

196
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,460
It's very difficult to go down.

197
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,460
It's a natural barrier.

198
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,460
Master Si,

199
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,460
it's convenient for you to find the whole process of the snake-like copper fish.

200
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,460
Please give me more details.

201
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,460
Is there any clue to this map?

202
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,460
You ignored it.

203
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,460
You can't see my old man, can you?

204
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,460
I dare not.

205
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,460
How dare I?

206
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,460
You're bold and bold.

207
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,460
You're like a family.

208
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,460
He didn't say.

209
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,460
He might have avoided this topic.

210
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,460
But it seems that he doesn't know the details.

211
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,460
He doesn't want to lie to me.

212
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,460
Maybe when we reach the destination,

213
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,460
these secrets will be solved naturally.

214
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,460
This road ...

215
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,460
Where is the treasure?

216
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,460
Yup.

217
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,460
I'm going to hurry up.

218
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,460
How do you get there?

219
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,460
I don't think you must get!

220
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,460
Master Si,

221
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,460
you lost your car!

222
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,460
You're also a daughter!

223
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,060
Here, have some hot water.

224
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,060
Thank you.

225
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,740
I can't sleep.

226
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,300
I'll treat you to this meal.

227
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,620
Go back and rest.

228
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,220
It's okay. I can handle it.

229
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,060
I heard that you used to be a soldier.

230
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,740
How long have you been a soldier?

231
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,580
Seven years.

232
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,180
But I've been in the army for four years.

233
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,140
What did you do before you became a soldier?

234
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,140
I was a doctor.

235
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,140
I was a hunter.

236
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,140
Just like my father.

237
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,140
I've been running with him since I was a kid.

238
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,140
I was familiar with it.

239
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,140
Later, I became a soldier here.

240
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,140
My comrades were called Alang Cai.

241
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,140
Alang Cai?

242
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,140
He's Xue Shan's son.

243
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,140
Wu Xie.

244
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,140
Actually, my father was a group of tourists.

245
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,140
And the route you took was the same.

246
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,140
But they didn't come back.

247
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,140
I remember clearly that the tourists were in the winter.

248
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,140
They were not allowed to go up the mountain.

249
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,140
So when I saw you, I decided to take you here.

250
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,140
Maybe this idea is very childish.

251
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,140
I think that if I follow you,

252
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,140
I'll know what happened to my father.

253
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,140
So, you're compared to us.

254
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,140
You're more anxious to go up the mountain.

255
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,140
You'll never understand.

256
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,140
You know that your father is always in the mountain.

257
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,140
But you'll never see his feelings.

258
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,140
Actually, I can understand.

259
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,140
It's more important than anything to be a family.

260
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,140
I'm not a family.

261
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,140
I'm a family.

262
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,140
I'm a family.

263
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,140
I'm a family.

264
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,140
I'm a family.

265
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,140
I'm a family.

266
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,140
I'm a family.

267
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,140
I'm a family.

268
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,140
I'm a family.

269
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,140
I'm a family.

270
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,140
I'm a family.

271
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,140
I'm a family.

272
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,140
I'm a family.

273
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,140
I'm a family.

274
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,140
I'm a family.

275
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,140
I'm a family.

276
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,140
I'm a family.

277
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,140
I'm a family.

278
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,140
I'm a family.

279
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,140
I'm a family.

280
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,140
I'm a family.

281
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,140
I'm a family.

282
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,140
I'm a family.

283
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,140
I'm a family.

284
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,140
I'm a family.

285
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,140
I'm a family.

286
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,140
I'm a family.

287
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,140
I'm a family.

288
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,140
I'm a family.

289
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,140
Take one

290
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,140
Take one

291
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,140
Take one

292
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,140
Take one

293
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,140
Take one

294
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,140
Take one

295
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,140
Take one

296
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,140
Take one

297
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,140
Take one

298
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,140
Sorry

299
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,140
Take one

300
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,140
Take two

301
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,140
Take one

302
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,140
Take one

303
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,140
From Xiaofeng's perspective,

304
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,140
the two mountains of Xianmen are like a tiger and a dragon.

305
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,140
They are like a bull and a elephant.

306
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,140
If not for the border,

307
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,140
it would be a place of war.

308
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,140
It must be the place of the great emperor

309
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,140
who was the king of the world.

310
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,140
It's a special place.

311
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,140
It's a long-term place.

312
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,140
There must be treasure here.

313
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,140
Let's go.

314
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,140
Let's go.

315
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,140
Let's go, Xiao Fei.

316
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,140
Let's go.

317
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,140
These are for embers.

318
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,140
The small army is a little civilization.

319
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,140
For the GreatCollection,

320
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,140
it's a greatYear of exiled gu wardrobe.

321
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,140
It's a place with its sacredches.

322
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,140
Protect all the inhabitants of the country with战備.

323
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,140
And I've blumed it to the aceite Go.

324
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,140
How dare they put謝謝於我的時候

325
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,140
greatleighbot of 18th-year nerd if I'm not mistaken.

326
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,940
All of them produce rigorous harmony because of their security

327
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,380
My grandiose not afraid of death

328
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,180
So beautiful

329
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,740
No wonder someone said

330
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,020
in the Penglai version

331
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,800
failure is the 45th

332
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,420
We go first is too long

333
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,460
Stop lying and let me see the perfect leg

334
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,300
Press another ball

335
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,940
Chen Zeyi, are you okay?

336
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:22,940
Why are you still here? Are you on the wrong way?

337
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,940
I remember there is a Hong Kong man in this room. Why can't I find him?

338
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,940
You really are on the wrong way?

339
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:41,940
No way. I know. The snow hasn't stopped for the past two days.

340
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,940
The Hong Kong man should be buried underneath. He is right under our feet.

341
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,940
What should we do now? We can't go back or die here.

342
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,940
There is another hope. I remember there should be a hot spring nearby.

343
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,940
If we can find it, we can still take a rest. The hot spring is higher than this.

344
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,940
We can't find it.

345
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,940
What if we can't find the hot spring?

346
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,940
We can only pray for the health of the mountain.

347
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,940
Come on. Put your ropes on. One by one. Don't drop them.

348
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,940
Brother!

349
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,940
Are you calling me?

350
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,940
I thought you were gone again.

351
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,940
Don't worry. Even if the situation is the worst, I will keep your life.

352
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:54,940
Snake! Snake! Snake! BUREkayNTEAV pumpkin!

353
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,940
Don't open the rope.

354
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,940
Go in the direction of each person.

355
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,940
Come back when you reach the limit.

356
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,940
Come on, big hand.

357
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,940
Come on.

358
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,940
Put the rope on the tree.

359
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,940
Go.

360
00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:03,940
What's going on?

361
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,940
It must be a cliff.

362
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,940
Don't fall.

363
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:34,940
Don't fall.

364
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,940
Don't fall.

365
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,940
Don't fall.

366
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:47,940
Don't fall.

367
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,940
Don't fall.

368
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:46,940
Don't fall.

369
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,940
Who are you?

370
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,940
Why do you come here?

371
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,940
It's me.

372
00:34:51,940 --> 00:35:00,940
Shut up.

373
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,940
Uncle San.

374
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,940
Uncle San.

375
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,940
Why are you here?

376
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,940
You're tired.

377
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,940
Come here.

378
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,940
Come here.

379
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,940
Uncle San.

380
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,940
I...

381
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,940
Uncle San.

382
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,940
I can't go back.

383
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,940
I... I can't go back.

384
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,940
Come here.

385
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,940
Come here.

386
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,940
Come here.

387
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,940
Come here.

388
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,940
Come here.

389
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,940
Uncle San.

390
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,940
I remember.

391
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,940
I was under the low temperature.

392
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,940
I was not only in a coma.

393
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,940
I was also in a illusion.

394
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,940
You're a fool.

395
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,940
You're the murderer.

396
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,940
No.

397
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,940
You're not my uncle.

398
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,940
In fact, in the situation where I was in a coma,

399
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:40,940
my uncle couldn't wear a pair of water-dressers in the snowy mountains.

400
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,940
You're a fool.

401
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,940
Why can't you come here?

402
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,940
No.

403
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,940
It's impossible.

404
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,940
No.

405
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,940
It's impossible.

406
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,940
You can't be my uncle.

407
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,940
What's wrong?

408
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,940
Why are you here?

409
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,940
You're Xie Lian Huan?

410
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,940
No.

411
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,940
It's impossible.

412
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,940
How can you be Xie Lian Huan?

413
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,940
Wu San Xing owes me his life.

414
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,940
No.

415
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,940
When are you going to pay back?

416
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,940
Impossible.

417
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,940
Impossible.

418
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,940
No.

419
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,940
What's going on?

420
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,940
What's going on?

421
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,940
It's...

422
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,940
What's going on?

423
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,940
Are you all right?

424
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,940
Wang Pongzi fell down.

425
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,940
Everyone's safe.

426
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,940
Look.

427
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,940
What the hell is that thing?

428
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,940
It's...

429
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,940
a piece of paper.

430
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,940
It's a piece of paper.

431
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,940
The box is empty.

432
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,940
It's a piece of paper.

433
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,940
What's that?

434
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,940
I'll go down and have a look.

435
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,340
What's that?

436
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,540
It's the black stone.

437
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,540
Isn't that a dragon?

438
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,940
Why are there so many feet and so ugly?

439
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,140
It's much harder than the dragon's nose.

440
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,140
Is it a bad thing to throw it here?

441
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,540
Don't say that.

442
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,140
This is a hundred-foot dragon, not a dragon.

443
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,940
The dragon-tongue in the East and the West are all like this.

444
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,740
In the early days of China,

445
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,340
the ancient dragon of China was in a form of a dragon.

446
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,140
Some dragons had a pig nose.

447
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,140
It's so strange to have a dragon's nose.

448
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,540
The change in the dragon's eyes is very slow.

449
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,540
At the beginning, the dragon was not in a good shape.

450
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,340
You can find a pig's head and press it on the snake's body.

451
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,740
Then you can call it a dragon.

452
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,340
At that time, every tribe had their dragon's head.

453
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,540
The shape is also the same with the tribe's eyes.

454
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,940
After that, the Chinese culture spread.

455
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,940
The Chinese culture merged.

456
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,740
The image of the Chinese dragon

457
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,940
began to mix with the dragon in the tribes of different ethnic groups.

458
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,340
In the end, it became the look of the dragon we saw.

459
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,740
Then this East and West period is pretty early.

460
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,940
Then how Yunви 잘 can be arranged,

461
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,740
you should tell me about East and West.

462
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,140
Oh, East and West...

463
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,740
Oh, I forgot to remind you.

464
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,440
You can also horseshoeimb with your eyes,

465
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,740
let's keep our snowy peak!

466
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,340
Have a rest at night!

467
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,340
Abs loads on the track

468
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,860
high beam

469
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,160
What's going on?

470
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,680
Miss We can't go again

471
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,300
It's so dangerous to stay in this kind of an amenous valley

472
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,500
Don't be afraid, it's worked. It's really dangerous

473
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,140
You know what, there's a wave from a heavy heap

474
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,140
There are bubbles below.

475
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,140
When the explosion is over,

476
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,140
the explosion will be a minor one.

477
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,140
If the explosion is not in the snow,

478
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,140
or the explosion is caused by a chain reaction,

479
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,140
we will be in a hurry

480
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,140
and the explosion will be gone in a few seconds.

481
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,140
How long do we need to catch up with them?

482
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,140
If we don't have a rest tonight,

483
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,140
we will be able to catch up.

484
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,140
But this is a big deal.

485
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,140
They will have to rest for a day.

486
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,140
We will stay for a day.

487
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,140
Since it's dangerous,

488
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,140
let's just rest for a night.

489
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,140
Don't worry.

490
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,140
We will definitely see them.

491
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,140
Zha Ying, rest.

492
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,140
Okay.

493
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,140
We need to rest for Zha Ying.

494
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,140
Yes, sir.

495
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,140
Yes, sir.

496
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,140
What's the status?

497
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,140
Sir, we are on the highway.

498
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,140
Jing Yang insists to navigate.

499
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,140
Clearing his only one who knows the place.

500
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,140
Follow him.

501
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,140
The priority is finding Wu Xie.

502
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,140
It's possible that he got a black stone.

503
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,140
And if he moves to the magnetic field,

504
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,140
disturbance,

505
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,140
you will get lost without him.

506
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,140
Yes, sir.

507
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,140
The End
