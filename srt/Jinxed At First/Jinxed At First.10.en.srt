00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,710
(Episode 10)

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,800
Seul-bi,

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,220
hang in there. Hang in there.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,610
(Superstar Loan)

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,610
You're here, ma'am.

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,040
Come with me.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,110
We're busy. Why are you still ordering us around?

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,050
Please come in.

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,420
-Just come right in. -Come in.

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,180
-Come in. Please come in. -Please come in.

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,920
-What is this place? -Just come right in. Please come in.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,960
What are we looking at?

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,620
-Sir. -Please come in.

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,110
Is everyone here?

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,740
Here. From today onwards, he will be the representative of Superstar Loan, Chief Wang...

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,760
(Letter of appointment)
Here. From today onwards, he will be the representative of Superstar Loan, Chief Wang...

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,210
Here. From today onwards, he will be the representative of Superstar Loan, Chief Wang...

18
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,030
No, it's Mr. Wang Yun-ho.

19
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,340
Applause!

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,770
Okay.

21
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,540
Since I'm in charge of Superstar Loan,

22
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,080
I only have one favor to ask.

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,620
-Favor? What favor? -Shh!

24
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,250
Although we're doing private loans and financing business,

25
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,600
we have to be humble.

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,110
We can't lose to the banking and financial institutions when dealing with clients.

27
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,980
Come, let's applaud!

28
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,350
Let's applaud!

29
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,620
-Hey, stop it! -You're so noisy!

30
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,300
Hey, you're so noisy! Why do you keep hitting it?

31
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,259
Of course there's a reason.

32
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,690
Is everyone here?

33
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,000
Listen to me carefully.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,440
This time, the executives planned to put our Seodong Market under construction and

35
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,520
make some trouble.

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,080
But it was solved by our Soo-kwang instantly!

37
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,060
Applause!

38
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,150
Of course. Our brother-in-law is the best!

39
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,330
It's great to have such a talent in the market.

40
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,789
That's right, thank you!

41
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:56,740
Our Soo-kwang looks so radiant today.

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,850
I don't deserve your compliments.

43
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,190
Why not?

44
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,480
Boss Park.

45
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,730
You always used to talk about Soo-kwang.

46
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,360
He solved such a big problem.

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,490
We were almost fooled.

48
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,020
That's right.

49
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,200
Leave that to Soo-kwang.

50
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,570
Seul-bi was right.

51
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,490
Yes?

52
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,220
Why are you mentioning Seul-bi now?

53
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,370
You're a mood killer devil.

54
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,200
Why don't you know how to observe the situation?

55
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,700
Well...

56
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,450
Anyway,

57
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,850
to commemorate Soo-kwang for saving our market,

58
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,130
I'll treat you all dinner at Bang's Chicken tonight!

59
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,310
You've to come later, okay?

60
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,720
All right. You're dismissed.

61
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,130
What are you talking about?

62
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,460
You have no sense at all. Goodness.

63
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,990
Goodness.

64
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,980
Soo-kwang!

65
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,880
Thank you for today.

66
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,530
Why are you always so handsome?

67
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,410
Hey, hey!

68
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,590
Hurry back and get ready. We have a group dinner tonight.

69
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,530
-You're here to work. Why are you dressed like this?. -I know.

70
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,370
-Go. Go inside! -Soo-kwang, I'll make you the best fried chicken.

71
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,420
Go inside!

72
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,280
Hyun Taen,

73
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,660
you'll come later, right?

74
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,330
Myeong-seong, no...

75
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:06,970
Soo-kwang!

76
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,450
Yes?

77
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,270
Why is it so busy in the morning?

78
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,260
Is there a celebration?

79
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,950
Is the inauguration ceremony done?

80
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,120
Congratulations.

81
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,500
It's all thanks to Seul-bi.

82
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,370
Hey, if you're loyal to Seul-bi, it's only a matter of time before your good days come.

83
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,660
Got it, Boss.

84
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,590
Later on, I'll find a chance to approach the big shot.

85
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,800
We have to find out if he'll hurt Seul-bi.

86
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,950
Be careful.

87
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,329
Okay. Bye.

88
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:34,420
Bye.

89
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,200
Chairman,

90
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,110
the court called. They request you to come to court on the day of the trial.

91
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,210
Why did the court come to me?

92
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,370
Min-joon, he...

93
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,870
used the reason of you receiving mental health treatments

94
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,840
and applied for the appointed guardian.

95
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,470
(Appointed guardian. A system where the court appoints a guardian for elderlies with illnesses or aging elderlies to protect their properties and to manage their daily activities.)

96
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,340
Appointed guardian?
(Appointed guardian. A system where the court appoints a guardian for elderlies with illnesses or aging elderlies to protect their properties and to manage their daily activities.)

97
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,110
But nothing has been set.
(Appointed guardian. A system where the court appoints a guardian for elderlies with illnesses or aging elderlies to protect their properties and to manage their daily activities.)

98
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,830
But nothing has been set.

99
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,990
Chairman.

100
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,650
You really went crazy because of that girl.

101
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,560
You want to drag your father down?

102
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,640
You're not in your right mind.

103
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,930
You need to focus on your treatment.

104
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,070
Silence the media and make sure no news are released.

105
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,750
Don't let the shareholders sway.

106
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,580
Yes, Chairman.

107
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:16,900
Min-joon.

108
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,360
Have you ever thought about how things will go?

109
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,100
Your father is in shock.

110
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,780
I'm afraid if this continues, his health will get worse.

111
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,390
We have to make this clear.

112
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,140
If some rumors spread,

113
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,620
the shareholders will sway.

114
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,930
What are you thinking?

115
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,340
Do you want to snatch the management rights away from your father?

116
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,210
Yes.

117
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,159
That's what I want.

118
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,400
What mess will that girl do next?

119
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,650
Just like what you did to my father?

120
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,230
Do you think this situation

121
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,290
was caused by Seul-bi?

122
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,060
Then who caused it?

123
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,150
When did you start manipulating Min-joon?

124
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,620
Manipulating?

125
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,410
Until now, you still don't know us well.

126
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,110
We're just mirrors of your hearts.

127
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,130
Desire, hope,

128
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,250
ugliness, and even kindness.

129
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,940
We are mirrors that reflect all of your inner world.

130
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,310
You've always been like this.

131
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,430
I really want to give it a try.

132
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,570
Your so-called manipulation.

133
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,570
You already have someone in your heart.

134
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,560
If you want to manipulate my son,

135
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,610
you'll have a taste of hell sooner or later!

136
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,540
Since you left here,

137
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,730
I couldn't fall asleep.

138
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,990
For some reason,

139
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,200
I'll think of the past that was 20 years ago.

140
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:40,880
I don't know what happened 20 years ago,

141
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,520
but it wasn't my fault.

142
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,000
That's right.

143
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,350
That's right. That's right.

144
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,370
About that...

145
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,770
Yes... yes.

146
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:00,610
What will happen to us from now on?

147
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,820
Let me...

148
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,090
prophesy for you.

149
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,960
No.

150
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,710
No.

151
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,860
Now I finally understand

152
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,409
how useless it was.

153
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,530
If 20 years ago...

154
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,820
If I had figured it out back then...

155
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,700
You knew all along.

156
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,920
Even if you knew the future,

157
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,440
you won't want to change.

158
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,180
Applying for the appointed guardian?

159
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,200
It's not like Sam-jung has Alzheimer's disease.

160
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,630
Goodness.

161
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,960
Okay.

162
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,250
Okay. I got it.

163
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,280
This is a disgrace to our Seon family.

164
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,820
It's not like we're going to let the whole country know that psychiatric hospital is our family's tradition.

165
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,630
Do I have to hear this from a judge across the river?

166
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,540
Did Min-joon apply for the appointed guardian

167
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,470
to kick uncle out?

168
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,410
Remember how Sam-jung treated my father back then?

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,510
Now his son is treating him the same.

170
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,940
But he should have been in a better situation.

171
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,400
Wow, he doesn't seem like it. Seon Min-joon,

172
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,010
you're pretty cruel.

173
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:12,950
So cool.

174
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,930
Cool.

175
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,570
So?

176
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,720
Are you also going to give it a try?

177
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,750
Well,

178
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,370
don't get Alzheimer's.

179
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,360
Okay?

180
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,460
Brat.

181
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,330
Geumhwa will face some troubles.

182
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,830
Sam-jung's crisis

183
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,010
is an opportunity for me.

184
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,800
Here!

185
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,880
Soo-kwang is now the lucky guy of our Seodong Market.

186
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,140
That's right.

187
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,140
When the rack in my shop fell off,

188
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,420
I thought the symbol of bad luck, Go Myeong-seong was back again.

189
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,310
But...

190
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,750
he's not!

191
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,440
-He's not! -Right.

192
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,810
Aunt Smile! Aunt Smile!

193
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,860
I heard your husband got a job.

194
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,630
That's great! Congratulations!

195
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,570
It's just a small company.

196
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,840
Oh, also...

197
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,710
Young-woo might have siblings.

198
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,380
What's going on? What's going on?

199
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,440
Goodness.

200
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,930
From now on, are we going to get lucky?

201
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,120
That's because we have a lucky guy.

202
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,900
Come, hold on. Fill it up.

203
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,680
From now on, you will become Seodong Market's lucky guy.

204
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,370
What's wrong with her suddenly?

205
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,970
I'll make you a lucky guy.

206
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,830
Let's toast to our Seodong Market's luck.

207
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,220
Cheers!

208
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,980
Drink slowly. Slowly.

209
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,260
Ms. Bang,

210
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,740
why do you only care about Jung?

211
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,430
Why are you spreading rumors again?

212
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,840
I'll take care of you.

213
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,080
You don't see me as a man at all, do you?

214
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,920
Take care of me.

215
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,760
(I)

216
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,130
(I)

217
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,920
(Love)

218
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,790
(You)

219
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,770
(You)

220
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,210
(You)

221
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,720
Found it.
(You)

222
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,040
Mom!

223
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,840
I found it.

224
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,150
Really?

225
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,770
Yes.

226
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,820
Did you find all of them?

227
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,570
Where are they?

228
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,430
Here?

229
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:49,940
(You)

230
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,140
Wow, you're so good at finding.
(You)

231
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,580
Wow, you're so good at finding.

232
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,270
Mom.

233
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,040
Did you write this?

234
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,990
Well...

235
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,200
I don't know who wrote it.

236
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,080
Maybe they were madly in love.

237
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,770
Love who?

238
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,380
I love Soo-kwang.

239
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,960
What about you?

240
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,020
In the future, when you have someone you love, what are you going to do?

241
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,540
I only love you, mom.

242
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,930
Goodness.

243
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,520
But there's always the future.

244
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,250
What if there is someone in the future?

245
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,420
Soo-kwang,

246
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,200
if you have someone you love,

247
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,180
you must protect her.

248
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,240
I will.

249
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,930
(I)

250
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,200
(Love)

251
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,680
What are you doing?

252
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,440
It's a secret.

253
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,450
-What? -It's a secret.

254
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:02,870
Soo-kwang,

255
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,940
if you have someone you love,

256
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,490
you must protect her.

257
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,400
Where should I start?

258
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,010
This story started from my mother's

259
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,570
mother's mother.

260
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,290
We were always unknown to the world.

261
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,110
We were a generation of witches who brought

262
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,610
good luck and blocked bad luck for the king.

263
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,910
We passed our powers to our daughters

264
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,920
and our granddaughters.

265
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:21,030
When all of us were born, each of us would hold a blue sapphire in our hand.

266
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,110
Although things have changed,

267
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,440
what we have to do hasn't changed.

268
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,220
Those who covet our power

269
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,120
locked us up in the secret place again.

270
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,550
I...

271
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,150
always wanted to run away.

272
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,230
He was my first love

273
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,560
and also my last.

274
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,550
A lover was just my wishful thinking.

275
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,580
To him, I was just...

276
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,390
a poor

277
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
child of God.

278
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,609
Although the gems in our hands

279
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:17,690
can't be broken by any weapon

280
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,829
or be melted by any means,

281
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,400
he helped me to break it.

282
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:38,100
Then I lost my ability to prophesy.

283
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,140
That's how I became a mortal.

284
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,980
Since it can't be broken,

285
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,610
how did he do it?

286
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,690
And I...

287
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,640
What should I do?

288
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,280
You have to find a way yourself.

289
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,280
By myself?

290
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,340
Remember this.

291
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,340
Seul-bi's body is full of bad luck.

292
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,660
If she can't become a mortal soon,

293
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,540
she might become a demoness.

294
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,600
Even so, do you still have the confidence to love her?

295
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,280
Even if she turns into a demoness and curses you.

296
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,870
Wow, it's so pretty.

297
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,210
I asked them to leave the last door.

298
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,790
You can decide the password.

299
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,420
Thank you, Min-joon.

300
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,380
Go out and have a look.

301
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,860
It's so beautiful.

302
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,250
Thank you, Min-joon.

303
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,620
Seul-bi.

304
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,080
Come back.

305
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,230
Don't prophesy the future anymore.

306
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,140
Come with me.

307
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,520
Here, this is yours.

308
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,470
Seul-bi.

309
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,880
I'll make you a mortal.

310
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,630
I'll find a way, so...

311
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,530
No.

312
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,970
It's too late, Soo-kwang.

313
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,970
I don't want to be a mortal anymore.

314
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,130
I don't want to bother you either.

315
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:50,160
I just want to continue and enjoy my power. So, leave.

316
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,430
Seul-bi.

317
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,960
What are you doing?

318
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,660
Seul-bi said she doesn't want to go back. Leave.

319
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,240
As you said,

320
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,220
you might be the only person I can rely on outside.

321
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,080
That's why I was so obsessed with you.

322
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,690
When we meet again,

323
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,480
let's hang out as friends.

324
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,890
I don't know what happened. The stock price of Geumhwa Group

325
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:59,470
crashed on the shareholders, right?

326
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:08,360
The directors must be heartbroken. You lost a lot, right?

327
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,710
Chairman, why did you want to see us?

328
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,110
No, the son is trying to kick his father out.

329
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,680
Goodness.

330
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:28,670
If the court really accepted Min-joon's appointed guardian application,

331
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,610
it can cause the management rights to fall into his hands.

332
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,200
How could that young man lead such a big Geumhwa Group?

333
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,470
That's why all the directors should help me

334
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,810
for the sake of Geumhwa Group.

335
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,970
But 20 years ago, you left Geumhwa Group...

336
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,480
What do you mean I left?

337
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,160
Geumhwa was founded by my father.

338
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,870
But that kid...

339
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,890
No, if Geumhwa is in Min-joon's hands,

340
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:11,290
my father's painstakingly founded company will collapse.

341
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,820
As the eldest son,

342
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,860
I can't just look away.

343
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,130
So I hope

344
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,550
you as members of Geumhwa for over 30 years will

345
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:26,810
make wise decisions for Geumhwa.

346
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,310
Thank you.

347
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,440
Goodbye.

348
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,810
If those old foxes turn their backs and become my people,

349
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,480
how much will our friendly shares be?

350
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,450
We'll get 30% of Geumhwa Group's shares.

351
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,270
Chairman, you're amazing.

352
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,230
I've always worked so hard to make money and

353
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,110
to entertain those ants. Finally, I've gotten my shares.

354
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:09,950
I need to wear Geumhwa's crown, right?

355
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,530
Oh, Soo-kwang, you're back.

356
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,880
Mr. Jung, you've been taking care of the store alone. You must be tired.

357
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,860
You said you were going to see Seul-bi.

358
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,240
Yes. It's...

359
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,040
Hyun Taen.

360
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,550
Oh, Soo-kwang, you're here too.

361
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,620
I made some leek pancakes. Have them for supper.

362
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,900
Mom, what are you wearing at this hour?

363
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,090
Are you going on a date?

364
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,260
What's wrong with you?

365
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,200
I always wear this at home.

366
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,090
Come on.

367
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,770
Thank you.

368
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:06,560
By the way, Mr. Jung, are you staying here permanently?

369
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,600
Yes. Once Soo-kwang knew that I was renting with someone, he pitied me and agreed for me to stay temporary.

370
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,910
I see. Soo-kwang said that?

371
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,380
Soo-kwang, isn't that a lady's ring?

372
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,550
I heard if a lady's ring fits the man's pinky finger perfectly,

373
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,960
then they are a perfect match.

374
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,760
-Oh, Soo-kwang! -Mom.

375
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,750
You said you'd make me some leek pancakes. But you're here.

376
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,530
I'm hungry.

377
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,690
I left them in the kitchen. Eat that.

378
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,200
Oh, it's beer.

379
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,380
-Give it to me. -Hey.

380
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,150
Give it to me. Are you crazy? How can a high schooler drink beer?

381
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,150
Just one can.

382
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,480
No. Go down and do your homework.

383
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,990
I think that's Seul-bi's ring.

384
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,670
Eun-jung, go downstairs.

385
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,520
Mom.

386
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,240
That ring looks like Seul-bi's, right?

387
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,920
I'm so sad. I'm so sad.

388
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,880
Why are you yelling at other people's place?

389
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,780
Because I'm sad.

390
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,050
I'm sad because of you too!

391
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:41,780
Soo-kwang, this is your book and your dream.

392
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,590
So I have to protect them.

393
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:50,710
No, Seul-bi. These are not important.

394
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,540
To me, you're the most important.

395
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,440
Min-joon, you're my son.

396
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,370
Even if you don't do anything, Geumhwa will soon be yours.

397
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,480
Why are you in such a hurry?

398
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,700
Because of Seul-bi?

399
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,570
Dad, I don't trust you.

400
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,650
There's a crack in Geumhwa's strong walls.

401
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,050
The enemy is on the move.

402
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,870
Is it uncle?

403
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,340
He turned the shareholders to his side.

404
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,450
How much?

405
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,760
Up to now, they have

406
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,110
over 30% of shares.

407
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,960
We can defend that.

408
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,950
More shareholders will turn towards them.

409
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:37,930
You want to kick me out, but this happened.

410
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,970
Withdraw the application for the appointed guardian.

411
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:51,490
You're too young. You can't officially take over Geumhwa yet.

412
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,120
You told me to show you my true abilities, right?

413
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,240
Min-joon.

414
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,200
What does Geumhwa mean to you?

415
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,290
The castle you built when you abandoned my mother.

416
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,210
It's a huge tower built on my mother's sacrifice.

417
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,810
So I won't let it be taken away by anyone.

418
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,290
I won't withdraw the application for the appointed guardian.

419
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,990
I'll stop uncle.

420
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:34,140
Chairman, I'll talk to Min-joon again.

421
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,300
Isn't that an amulet to prevent nightmares?

422
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,510
I remember father looked for it before.

423
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,560
Although we don't need it now.

424
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,860
Let's start with this.

425
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,800
Throw it away.

426
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,430
Did something happen?

427
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:20,640
Yes, it's something that happens often.

428
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,310
Do you need my help?

429
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:28,140
No. I didn't come to you for this.

430
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,530
Then...

431
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,450
Seul-bi.

432
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,680
Yes?

433
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,180
I don't want to be your ordinary friend.

434
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,970
I want to be your boyfriend.

435
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,460
(Eunseong Capital)

436
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,250
My dear brother came.
(Eunseong Capital)

437
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,210
My dear brother came.

438
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,460
It’s the first time since Eunseong Capital was founded, right?

439
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,480
Since you've challenged me,

440
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,970
I must see you on person, right?

441
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,130
What challenge?

442
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,780
Sam-jung,

443
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,990
how's your position as the Chairman of Geumhwa Group?

444
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,080
I locked dad up in a mental hospital,

445
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,490
kicked you out, and took the position.

446
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,550
You're not ashamed.

447
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,960
Fine. You made so much effort to take that position,

448
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,590
but you are forced to retire by your son.

449
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:43,500
You must feel hurt and angry.

450
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:50,490
That's why I want to avenge your son and help you to vent your anger.

451
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,710
Brother, are you venting your grudge in the past

452
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,340
on your young nephew?

453
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,740
In the past?

454
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,960
It was supposed to be mine but you took it.

455
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,040
I was anxious and desperate. I've been longing it for 20 years.

456
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,630
It may be the past for you,

457
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,400
but it's unforgettable for me.

458
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,950
Then let me say it again to make it more unforgettable for you.

459
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:19,640
If you had inherited Geumhwa 20 years ago,

460
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,060
it wouldn't be the current Geumhwa Group,

461
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,720
but Eunseong Capital.

462
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,260
If you can't understand and still want to vent your grudges.

463
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,890
Try it.

464
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,860
Okay, I'll try.

465
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:38,770
Give it to him.

466
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,950
What is it?

467
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,070
Three kilograms of natural wild ginseng.

468
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,160
It's good for recovery. Please take it, Chairman.

469
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,530
Wild ginseng?

470
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,810
It's good.

471
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,860
Uncle, you're here.

472
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
Hi, Dong-sik.

473
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,070
I heard that you've been working hard lately.

474
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,950
I'm so relieved.

475
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,260
It's time for me to take care of things.

476
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,820
Okay, see you.

477
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,860
Okay.

478
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,460
Dad, uncle's grace is different from you.

479
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,160
What did you say?

480
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,470
Get out!

481
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,400
Go out and eat wild ginseng, brat!

482
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,710
Dad, do you have emotional disorder?

483
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,210
You should do a psychiatric test.

484
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,420
Darn it.

485
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,650
Darn it!

486
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,690
What is Secretary Jung doing?

487
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,510
Bring him here right now!

488
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,600
(Lucky Fish Shop)

489
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,880
Hello.

490
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:25,350
Mr. Jung, what's wrong?

491
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:29,260
What? Soo-kwang, go inside.

492
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,580
What?

493
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,800
I need to go.

494
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,940
What happened?

495
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,370
Secretary Jung.

496
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:17,030
You had been in prison for 20 years.

497
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,250
It seems that you are not afriad of anything now.

498
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,470
No, Chairman.

499
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:24,670
Seul-bi went back to Geumhwa Hotel.

500
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,670
Listen carefully.

501
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:35,730
Bring your daughter to me tomorrow,

502
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:38,570
otherwise, I'm going to dig out your eyeballs,

503
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:42,390
so you can never see your daughter again.

504
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,070
Thank you.

505
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,160
Yes, sir.

506
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,260
After all the shareholders are gathered, we'll call you.

507
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,590
Okay.

508
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:09,250
Who is she? She doesn't seem to be your fiancée.

509
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,840
She's the chairman's niece. She just came back from abroad.

510
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,770
Really?

511
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,480
What’s up?

512
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:37,770
Min-joon, can I go out for a while?

513
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,950
Where are you going?

514
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:42,260
Don't ask. I want to go out alone.

515
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,430
Okay, I'll call a bodyguard for you.

516
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,920
No, I want to go alone.

517
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,580
Call me if anything happens.

518
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,090
(Director Seon Min-joon)

519
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,950
(Cho Jang-geun)

520
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,700
Hey, Jang-geun.

521
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,440
Aren't you busy?

522
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,620
I'm busy.

523
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,200
How can a doctor not be busy?

524
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,440
Then why are you here?

525
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,940
Do you know how many times my mother came to me

526
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,980
and urged me to contact you during my work?

527
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,980
I'm sorry.

528
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,490
My mom said you are weird.

529
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:45,340
Why don't you prepare for the wedding? In fact, you always hang around with your cousin.

530
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,280
She's not your cousin. But I can't say it.

531
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,640
-I'll explain it to her. -It's none of my business.

532
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:58,210
My mom told me that she booked Jang Kyung's favorite restaurant for tomorrow.

533
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,220
She asked me to invite you.

534
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,760
Did you get the address and time I sent you?

535
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,620
I told you everything. I'm done.

536
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,280
Jang-geun.

537
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,230
Bye.

538
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,870
Min-joon, you know that Jang-geun's hospital accounts for

539
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,130
3% of the shares of Geumhwa Group, right?

540
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,810
I bought this for you.

541
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,630
Mr. Jung, I'm not your daughter.

542
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,590
You're right.

543
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,080
I'm ashamed to show up in front of you

544
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,910
and to say I'm your dad.

545
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,120
You should be ashamed of something else.

546
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,680
If I were your daughter,

547
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,690
would you sell me?

548
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,620
What do you mean?

549
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,200
Don't you want to sell me for money?

550
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,240
No. No. I never thought so.

551
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,170
Come with me now.

552
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,160
Where?

553
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,480
Look how sad my brother-in-law is.

554
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,370
I feel so sad.

555
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:40,170
Goodness. His broad shoulders droop now.

556
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,420
He saw his girlfriend who was going to get married

557
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,960
appeared in the market holding another man's arm.

558
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,250
Of course he's sad.

559
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,220
Soo-kwang.

560
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,490
Help me with the questionnaire, okay?

561
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,670
What is this?

562
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,690
The last renovation project failed.

563
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,560
So, should we change another construction company

564
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,040
or transform it to an online shopping project?

565
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,330
It is to survey everyone's opinions.

566
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,060
I see.

567
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,690
Did Mr. Jung go out?

568
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,710
Yes.

569
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:13,050
No, we'll send it again.

570
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,200
What? Why? Why?

571
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,960
Do you have to leave this to brother-in-law now?

572
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,890
No, to Soo-kwang?

573
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,570
Why?

574
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,780
You know he has lovesickness.

575
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,920
Lovesickness?

576
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,300
He was fine a few days ago.

577
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,070
Well, lovesickness doesn't appear right away.

578
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,320
As time goes by,

579
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,960
it grows crazy like bean sprouts

580
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,050
from the bottom of the heart.

581
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,390
How do you know that?

582
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,270
You said I was your first love.

583
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,980
Soo-kwang!

584
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,180
Isn't the weather nice today?

585
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:54,450
So tonight in the yard, let's...

586
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,230
Hello?

587
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,200
Manager, let me explain.

588
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:07,240
How about we have some fried chicken and beer?

589
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,040
Eun-jung.

590
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,840
Yes?

591
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,070
Take care of the shop for me.

592
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:11,960
Okay.

593
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,110
Don't worry, Soo-kwang!

594
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:19,860
He asked me to take care of the shop.

595
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,470
(Superstar Loan)

596
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,710
Have some coffee.

597
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,720
Goodness.

598
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,800
Is there any problem?

599
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,510
The office is a little small,

600
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,500
but it's okay.

601
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,480
Thank you. I'll drink it well.

602
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,080
-Okay. -Thanks.

603
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,130
Chief Wang.

604
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,680
-Chief Wang. -Soo-kwang.

605
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,460
Last time at the Chinese restaurant...

606
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,400
Chinese restaurant?

607
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,940
Well...

608
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,740
Do you know who was the man with Seon Dong-sik

609
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,260
in the Chinese restaurant last time?

610
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,050
Oh, that is Eunseong Capital's chairman's man.

611
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,960
He is the secretary, Mr. Yeom.

612
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,560
Chairman Seon Il-jung's secretary.

613
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,650
Hey, where are you going?

614
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:12,980
(Eunseong Capital)
Hey, where are you going?

615
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,500
(Eunseong Capital)

616
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:29,970
I finally meet the prophet.

617
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,940
This won't do, right?

618
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,460
Sit down.

619
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,240
What are you doing? Sit down.

620
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,140
Mr. Yeom.

621
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:59,820
Give what Secretary Jung prepared to him.

622
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,460
Give that to me.

623
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,530
What?

624
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:05,120
I'll tell you your future using my abilities.

625
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,990
Of course you should give me the money.

626
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,490
Your daughter is so smart.

627
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,920
Let's go, Seul-bi.

628
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:22,550
-Chairman, I don't think... -You bastard...

629
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,470
I don't need money.

630
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:34,080
I don't want to get involved with the Seon family anymore.

631
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,040
Do you feel guilty suddenly?

632
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,350
You wanted to sell her mother 20 years ago.

633
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,390
Chairman!

634
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,340
Didn't your mom tell you about this?

635
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:49,160
He tried to sell your mom 20 years ago.

636
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,620
Well, Seul-bi...

637
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:55,310
I did have that idea for a short time,

638
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,270
but I didn't betray her.

639
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,090
It's true, Seul-bi.

640
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:03,470
You want to be a good father in front of your daughter.

641
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,420
That's why I spent 20 years in prison, Seul-bi.

642
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,050
I've always regretted it. I mean it, Seul-bi.

643
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,150
I know.

644
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,750
So I'm going to make money for you.

645
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:16,260
What?

646
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:21,000
Dad, you really brought the witch?

647
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,770
Hello.

648
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,520
You also provide door-to-door service?

649
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,720
Chairman, I'll tell the future according to your request.

650
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,240
But I have one condition.

651
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,220
One condition?

652
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,350
Don't torture my dad anymore.

653
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:42,660
Dad?

654
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,780
What a loving pair of father and daughter.

655
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,560
Fine.

656
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,440
Just do as I say.

657
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,800
Why would I torture your dad?

658
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,950
No. No. No. Seul-bi, don't.

659
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:25,930
You need to do it to others, not me.

660
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,670
Who is it?

661
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,980
I'll arrange a meeting with a noble guest soon.

662
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,850
Come by then.

663
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:35,580
I'll give you enough money.

664
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,590
Okay.

665
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,670
Call me then.

666
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,010
Let's go, Seul-bi.

667
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,520
Do you have something to say to me today?

668
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:53,630
It's for the fortune-telling.

669
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,700
Let's go.

670
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:04,680
Dad, who are you going to introduce her to?

671
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:09,270
Someone who can get me Geumhwa back.

672
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:10,500
Who is that?

673
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,270
You don't need to know.

674
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,780
Gosh.

675
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:25,430
Things are not going well.

676
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:26,910
What's wrong, dad?

677
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,860
Because you fired him.

678
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,190
He's threatening me right now.

679
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,050
Who?

680
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,280
Mr. Choi from Superstar Loan?

681
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,490
How dare he threaten you?

682
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:42,070
Go find out as I ordered.

683
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:52,100
(Eunseong Capital)

684
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,760
Mr. Jung, they won't torture you anymore.

685
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,410
I'm sorry, Seul-bi.

686
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,300
-Dad... -Mr. Jung.

687
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,090
You're not my dad.

688
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,640
I just said that because

689
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,290
it's better to let Chairman Seon think that way.

690
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:17,760
Soo-kwang.

691
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,600
What are you doing?

692
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,290
Did you bring Seul-bi to meet Chairman Seon Il-jung?

693
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,150
What did you do when you met him?

694
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,110
Well...

695
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,910
He used to hire a gang to find Seul-bi.

696
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:33,310
Why did you bring Seul-bi to meet someone like that?

697
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,840
Soo-kwang, I'm fine.

698
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:40,280
-Is everything okay? -Yes.

699
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,950
Let's go eat at the market.

700
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,440
Soo-kwang.

701
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,750
You asked me to take care of the shop, and you went to see her?

702
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,340
You went too far!

703
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:07,340
Eun-jung.

704
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,590
Well...

705
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,850
I'll clean up the shop. You guys go eat first.

706
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:14,860
Let's do it together.

707
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,280
No, Seul-bi is hungry.

708
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,210
Go ahead.

709
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:35,270
What brings you here?

710
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,840
-Mr. Yeom. -Yes?

711
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:45,270
I have a question.

712
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,310
Why did Mr. Choi threaten my dad?

713
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:53,790
Mr. Yeom.

714
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,170
Well...

715
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:01,840
I think it's because of the Gong Soo-kwang's case two years ago.

716
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,030
Gong Soo-kwang's case?

717
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:05,940
Yes.

718
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,160
What does that have to do with my dad?

719
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:13,450
Say it!

720
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:18,710
Goodbye.

721
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:21,060
Gosh, it's so busy.

722
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,730
It’s delicious.

723
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:29,060
Ms. Bang, you must make a lot of money.

724
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,830
It’s all thanks to you.

725
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:31,670
Have more.

726
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:34,070
It's on me today.

727
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,310
You make so much money.

728
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:37,480
So please fix the roof of the attic for us.

729
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,760
The ceiling leaks when it rains.

730
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,410
Oh, my. Really?

731
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:46,410
I told you more than 20 times. It leaks when it rains.

732
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:49,690
I'll do anything Seul-bi asks.

733
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:52,730
If there's anything in the future, just ask me for help.

734
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,400
Isn't that Seul-bi? Seul-bi.

735
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:01,420
Long time no see.

736
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,390
I'm so happy to see you.

737
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:08,900
-Ms. Bang, give us some beer. -Okay.

738
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,920
Beer. Beer.

739
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,300
Seul-bi, I missed you so much.

740
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,330
Gosh, you look so pale.

741
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:17,310
She must have lovesickness.

742
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:20,080
Oh, my. They have lovesickness at the same time?

743
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,260
What?

744
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,580
I heard a crush is a cure for lovesickness.

745
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:27,710
By the way, did you dump that guy?

746
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:30,090
What are you doing?

747
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,460
You're the chairman.

748
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,240
You know nothing.

749
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,810
Why are you always scolding me?

750
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:39,380
Lovesickness?

751
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:42,980
Why am I so healthy?

752
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:45,110
I have lovesickness in my heart,

753
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:46,950
but you can't see it.

754
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:48,350
Eun-jung.

755
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:50,030
I like healthy women.

756
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,010
You can't be a stalker as a policeman.

757
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,780
He is not a stalker.

758
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,730
The chicken here are the best these days.

759
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:57,320
Chicken King.

760
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:59,350
Take it and go.

761
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:01,800
All right, the people's supporters are leaving.

762
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,610
Salute!

763
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:04,620
Salute! Salute!

764
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:05,850
Fighting.

765
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:07,010
Eun-jung.

766
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:09,270
Mr. Kim is a good man.

767
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,410
It's nice to be with a civil servant.

768
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:11,610
That's right.

769
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,750
-We will come back after cleaning up. -Okay.

770
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:14,890
-Okay. -Don't go.

771
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:16,850
-Come quickly. -Okay.

772
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,840
-Sister. -Yes?

773
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,720
I have a favor to ask.

774
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,930
I'll do anything

775
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:25,310
you ask.

776
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,720
What's going on?

777
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,420
I'm so sad that you two are so close.

778
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:39,800
I have a favor to ask Mr. Hong and Mr. Park.

779
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,710
-What? -Me?

780
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,620
What is it? Tell me.

781
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,390
Okay, okay.

782
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:57,570
I understand.

783
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,880
Seul-bi!

784
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,130
Chief Wang.

785
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:03,700
Let's go.

786
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,080
Okay, let's go.

787
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,520
Okay. We are leaving, Seul-bi.

788
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,590
Don't worry about what you asked.

789
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:09,780
Don't worry.

790
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,500
What about the beer?

791
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,210
Mr. Wang will finish it all.

792
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:16,690
Have a seat.

793
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,720
Enjoy.

794
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:20,670
Where are you going?

795
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:22,210
Bye.

796
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:23,130
What is this?

797
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:24,550
Chief Wang.

798
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:25,340
What?

799
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,940
I have a favor to ask.

800
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,600
Sure, go ahead.

801
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,030
It's so delicious.

802
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,670
What is it?

803
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,510
You came to eat fried chicken, but asked for people's help.

804
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:56,950
You don't have to know it.

805
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:58,890
Eat up.

806
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,060
Don't blame Mr. Jung.

807
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,350
He's suffering too.

808
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,450
Okay.

809
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,300
I won't blame him.

810
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:21,920
Seul-bi.

811
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,340
Thank you for always protecting me.

812
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:31,710
What are you talking about?

813
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,910
Thank you for saying you like me.

814
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,280
Thank you for being my lucky goddess.

815
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,430
That's why I want to do this for you.

816
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,740
You think of me as a friend...

817
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:55,700
No, I'm just someone you know.

818
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:01,960
But I like you.

819
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,500
Why are you saying this while we are eating?

820
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,280
I'm sorry.

821
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,090
I'm afraid I won't have a chance if I don't tell you now.

822
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:17,680
I gave the ring back to you. Why are you saying this?

823
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,160
I'll keep it well.

824
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:32,570
Did you meet her?

825
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,480
The one who came to see Gong Soo-kwang?

826
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:36,970
Yes.

827
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,770
This is the person you wrote to, right?

828
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:44,820
(Seoul Folk Culture Museum, Eun Ok-jin)
This is the person you wrote to, right?

829
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,430
(Seoul Folk Culture Museum, Eun Ok-jin)

830
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,300
What did she say?

831
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,070
Welcome.

832
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,260
Seul-bi.

833
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:00,440
Min-joon.

834
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,800
Did you run out just to come here?

835
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:07,850
Let's go, Seul-bi.

836
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:10,650
Did you follow me?

837
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:12,460
You didn't come back, so I came to you.

838
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:15,040
Take her away.

839
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:15,970
Let's go.

840
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:20,780
Hey, Seon Min-joon. What are you doing?

841
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,680
Is this how you treat Seul-bi?

842
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:26,920
It's okay, Soo-kwang.

843
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:30,270
I was going to go back.

844
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,090
I'm leaving.

845
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,150
Can we have a talk?

846
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,450
What should I do?

847
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,740
What should I do to make up for what happened two years ago?

848
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,400
Tell me what to do, Soo-kwang.

849
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,820
Are you going to keep Seul-bi there?

850
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,120
You two broke up.

851
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,480
I still like Seul-bi.

852
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,340
She still likes me.

853
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,660
Then why did she come back to me?

854
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,670
Do you think she went back to you?

855
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,750
She was born and raised there.

856
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:31,050
Her mother's there.

857
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:38,380
Do you think she went back to you?

858
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,330
Soo-kwang.

859
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,690
What do you want? I'll promise whatever you want me to do.

860
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:49,190
I can kneel down and apologize to you.

861
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:51,940
But...

862
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,660
I can't give up Seul-bi.

863
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:01,100
I can't give up Seul-bi either.

864
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,320
Then... let Seul-bi decide.

865
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:10,520
Don't hold her hand.

866
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,640
That's Seul-bi's choice too.

867
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,260
I'm leaving.

868
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:20,260
Seul-bi will be in danger if she sees the future too much.

869
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:24,620
So...

870
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:29,660
don't hold Seul-bi's hand.

871
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,820
You have to do it to others, not me.

872
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:58,930
Who is it?

873
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:01,460
I'll arrange a meeting with a noble guest soon.

874
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,000
Come by then.

875
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:09,800
Mr. Jung, you haven't had dinner yet.

876
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:15,470
No, I can't digest my lunch.

877
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:18,330
I don't feel well here.

878
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:20,880
You should take medicine instead of drinking.

879
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:23,110
Wait.

880
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,330
You can eat it like this.

881
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:35,390
Thank you, Soo-kwang.

882
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,060
I feel better now.

883
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:52,110
Mr. Jung,

884
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:57,150
why did you bring Seul-bi to meet Chairman Seon Il-jung?

885
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,720
What happened there?

886
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,590
What did Chairman Seon say to Seul-bi?

887
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:05,530
What?

888
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,400
No, nothing happened.

889
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,300
Don't ever do that again, Mr. Jung.

890
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,480
What do you want?

891
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,830
How are you, Soo-kwang?

892
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:40,390
What do you want?

893
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:46,760
I didn't know you were meeting Min-joon.

894
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:53,380
You regret not stopping him?

895
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,340
Yes.

896
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,140
I should have stopped him completely.

897
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,750
I regret it.

898
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:02,010
Is that how you think?

899
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,560
Don't you feel guilty about what happened two years ago?

900
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,220
The accident that happened to you two years ago.

901
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,620
Chairman did not do it.

902
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:14,590
You want me to believe that?

903
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:18,980
You won't believe it, but it's true.

904
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,520
Then who did it?

905
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,150
Who did it?

906
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:29,150
Chairman wants to see you.

907
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:31,190
Will I know the answer after I meet him?

908
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:35,300
Then there's no reason for us to meet.

909
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:49,740
Goodness.

910
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:52,080
What are you carrying? It's so heavy.

911
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,390
You brought everything.

912
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:57,100
It's a shame.

913
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,210
Isn't it?
(Note: In honorifics.)

914
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:01,080
I can't throw them away.

915
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,520
These are important things.

916
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,020
Boss asked me to keep them safe.

917
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:07,660
How important can it be?

918
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,430
I have a favor to ask.

919
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:26,260
Give the toys your secretary brought to Soo-kwang.

920
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,420
Please.

921
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:03,370
(Preview of the next episode.)

922
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:04,220
Hey, Soo-kwang.

923
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:04,790
What is this?

924
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:06,760
She asked me to give you

925
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,570
the toys that my secretary brought.

926
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:10,470
Seul-bi?

927
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:13,900
It's not too late. Get out of here, okay?

928
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,560
Mom, I...

929
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:18,060
I will find a way to make us happy.

930
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:19,930
I didn't ask Seul-bi to stay there.

931
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:21,410
What do you mean?

932
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:24,490
Seul-bi wants to stay there.

933
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,690
What happened?

934
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:26,940
You're here.

935
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:29,110
Yes, Chairman.
