00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,520
(Episode 14)

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,110
How old are you, you brat?

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,090
You don't even have a driver's license.

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,180
Do I have to serve you?

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,120
Then I'll just get my driver's license.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,030
Seriously.

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,760
By the way,

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,780
where are we?

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,230
He even asked us to go first.

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,630
I don't know. Let's go and have a look first.

11
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,900
Didn't he say we'll see it once we're there?

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,590
I don't think it's possible for him to go here.

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,330
According to my boss's preference,

14
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,050
it's more likely for him to drink at some club in the center of Seoul.

15
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,250
You brat.

16
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,040
Soo-kwang told us to go.

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,970
Okay. Okay.

18
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,950
How did Soo-kwang find out?

19
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,410
Even we can't find him.

20
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,740
What is this? We can drink at the hotel.

21
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,760
I got paid.

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,740
When I was in college,

23
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,900
every time I got paid,

24
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,720
I always treat you to a meal.

25
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,120
-Sir. -Yes?

26
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,770
-Please bring me the most expensive snack here. -Okay.

27
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,380
Gosh.

28
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,730
This is more like Seon Min-joon.

29
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,250
I feel like I've gone crazy lately.

30
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,440
I'm not ready yet. I'm confused.

31
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,600
You'll overcome it.

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,020
That's why the chairman trusts you

33
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,020
and gave it to you.

34
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,970
My dad trusts me?

35
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,789
He has never approved of me.

36
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:36,280
Worrying about you and not trusting you are different.

37
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,440
It's not that the chairman doesn't trust you.

38
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,570
He's just worried.

39
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,090
The last thing I did to my dad

40
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,700
was yelled and got angry at him.

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,940
Then, I ran away.

42
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,780
Next time, come here

43
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,660
when you want to run away.

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,470
I'll treat you to the most expensive snacks.

45
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,410
Alright. Thank you, Soo-kwang.

46
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,040
Thank your sister.

47
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,479
Seul-bi asked me to take care of you.

48
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,200
Do you know how much she cares about you?

49
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,450
I feel guilty towards Seul-bi.

50
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,020
I didn't become her reliable pillar,

51
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,440
but I always showed her how pathetic I am.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,510
As her brother...

53
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,900
Here's your snack.

54
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,600
Okay, thank you.

55
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,579
Eat up.

56
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:40,470
Be a reliable brother.

57
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,250
Eat up.

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,829
Here.

59
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,390
Isn't it super delicious because I fed it to you?

60
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,640
What is this?

61
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,630
Don't you remember?

62
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,370
Didn't you use this to threaten Seon Il-jung?

63
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,090
What?

64
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,900
Who is it?

65
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,620
Gong Soo-kwang,

66
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,870
the one who got first place this time to enter Geumhwa Group.

67
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,240
Make sure you deal with it well.

68
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,550
Mr. Gong, have some too.

69
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,079
The dumplings here are delicious.

70
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,240
How about I share them with you?

71
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,730
No.

72
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,650
I don't want to be involved in illegal acts.

73
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,130
Isn't that him?

74
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,880
But... how is he alive?

75
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,570
Didn't you kill him two years ago?

76
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,350
Why would I kill him?

77
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,530
He's my son.

78
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,290
Your son?

79
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,440
Didn't your son die a few years ago?

80
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,890
Yes, that son died.

81
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,769
Please... spare me.

82
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:19,760
If I let you go,

83
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,700
you'll harm my son again, wouldn't you?

84
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,820
So I told you to cover it up. But what else do you want?

85
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,130
Why must you do that?

86
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,050
Please... spare me.

87
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,940
I promised my son

88
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,390
I will punish

89
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,680
whoever bullies him.

90
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,030
Wait! Wait!

91
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,409
Calm down. Calm down.

92
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:43,580
Uncle, we're Soo-kwang's friends.

93
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,710
Yes, Gong Soo-kwang sent us here.

94
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,050
We're on your side.

95
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,090
Hello, Soo-kwang. We're here.

96
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,120
Uncle Go, it's me.

97
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,470
Soo-kwang.

98
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,730
Pack your things.

99
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,300
You'll be in danger if you stay there.

100
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,890
Chairman Seon is looking for you.

101
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,330
He wants to cover up what happened two years ago.

102
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,200
I have the boat ticket ready.

103
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,060
You can leave right away.

104
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,880
Right away.

105
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,370
Uncle, calm down. Calm down.

106
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,340
What will you do when you catch

107
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,010
Superstar Loan's Director Choi?

108
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,659
I would tell the police about what happened two years ago.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,510
I've decided to cover it up, Seul-bi.

110
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,909
You don't have to do that for me, Soo-kwang.

111
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,050
Although I lost my mom because of that,

112
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,260
I don't want to make it public

113
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,280
and make you suffer.

114
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,990
I just need to save Uncle Go.

115
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,690
Then leave it to Director Wang.

116
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,790
Please take care of my brother.

117
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,380
Min-joon, let's go.

118
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,010
Let's go home. We drank a lot.

119
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,510
Soo-kwang, come here.

120
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,080
Drink this. There's still some left.

121
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,120
Forget it. Come here.

122
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,110
You're heavy.

123
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,620
There's still soju left.

124
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,250
-Sir, bill, please. -Still a bit left.

125
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,600
Get dressed.

126
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,910
Goodbye.

127
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,860
Be careful.

128
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,640
Hello, Seul-bi.

129
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,590
There's nothing to worry here.

130
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,380
Once you catch Director Choi,

131
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,510
call Seon Dong-sik.

132
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,909
What? Who?

133
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:56,040
Hand Director Choi over to Seon Dong-sik.

134
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,320
And...

135
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,260
keep this from Soo-kwang.

136
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,830
Okay.

137
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,930
What's wrong, boss?

138
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,540
Thank you for saving me.

139
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,220
I'll forgive you

140
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,410
for snatching my position.

141
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,740
We used to be so close.

142
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,290
Yeah.

143
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,540
If I pay him now,

144
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,450
he'll threaten me again for money.

145
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,510
Find Director Choi and kill him.

146
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,220
Bury what happened

147
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,440
two years ago with him.

148
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,150
Yes, Chairman. Leave it to me.

149
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,330
Do you understand what's going on now?

150
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,050
Seon Il-jung, that bastard.

151
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:00,250
So you're going to kill me too?

152
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,470
If that's the case,

153
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,580
why would I save you just now?

154
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,590
Do you remember this?

155
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,830
You've collected a lot of Eunseong Capital's information.

156
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,620
You have Seon Il-jung's illegal information

157
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,170
and Seon Dong-sik's illegal information.

158
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,490
I think

159
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,670
you should threaten Seon Dong-sik

160
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,720
rather than Seon Il-jung.

161
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,140
That way, you may get some money.

162
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,549
Thank you.

163
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,730
Do you have money?

164
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,470
Did you bring your wallet?

165
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,650
What?

166
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,440
I didn't bring my wallet.

167
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,100
Darn it. What's wrong with you?

168
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,550
Where am I again?

169
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,950
Mr. Seon.

170
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't think my dad wants to give you money.

171
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,330
It's also time for me to stop these money transactions with the chairman.

172
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,400
Then why do you think you were caught and brought here?

173
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,700
Caught?

174
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,680
I got caught on purpose

175
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,300
because I missed you.

176
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,060
We've been together for a long time.

177
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,180
There were mergers and acquisitions and manipulations of stock prices.

178
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,000
As long as you don't mess with my job,

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,340
I will never bite my owner.

180
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,220
Meow!

181
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,350
That's not the correct answer.

182
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,110
Hey, what's the correct answer?

183
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,630
Darn it.

184
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,600
Bite your owner.

185
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,870
Tell the police about the abetting murder case

186
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,070
that happened two years ago.

187
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,710
Your father, Chairman Seon Il-jung, abetted the murder.

188
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,160
You know that, right?

189
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,690
You're his biological son, right?

190
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,430
Seriously.

191
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,730
If you turn yourself in and stay in prison for a few years,

192
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,900
I'll prepare a better job for you.

193
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,930
Are you thinking, "This guy is crazy?"

194
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,570
Right?

195
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,440
Yes, I'm crazy.

196
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,250
So if you refuse me here,

197
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,870
you can imagine what will happen, right?

198
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,670
Turn yourself in.

199
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,420
Tell the truth about

200
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,120
everything that my dad

201
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,260
has done.

202
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,230
Okay?

203
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,660
Let go!

204
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,220
Let go!

205
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,100
I came willingly.

206
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,740
I'll talk inside.

207
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,680
(With the people. Trustworthy police officers.)
I'll talk inside.

208
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,290
(With the people. Trustworthy police officers.)

209
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,000
I can't believe you guys.
(With the people. Trustworthy police officers.)

210
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,570
(With the people. Trustworthy police officers.)

211
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,710
It's really Seul-bi.

212
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,400
How far can Seul-bi see?

213
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,720
So she knew Seon Dong-sik would pull his father down.

214
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,800
What will happen now?

215
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,670
What?

216
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,800
It's so comfortable. Oh, good.

217
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,680
The weather is nice.

218
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,740
It's cold, you brat. Close the window.

219
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,350
Seon Il-jung.

220
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,080
You are now under arrest for abetting murder.

221
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,040
What is this?

222
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,340
Abetting murder?

223
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,440
Dad, are you...

224
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,810
You have the right to remain silent.

225
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,300
You can hire a lawyer.

226
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,190
What you say from now on may be used against you in court.

227
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,290
What are you doing?

228
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,280
I'm a patient who's hospitalized here. A patient.

229
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,920
-Chairman. -Take him out.

230
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,810
-Dong-sik. -Dad.

231
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,630
-Wait. -Dad!

232
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,420
Dong-sik, call Mr. Kim and your uncle!

233
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,200
-Dong-sik! -Dad!

234
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,120
-Dong-sik, it shouldn't be like this! -Dad!

235
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,880
Dong-sik!

236
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,390
Chairman!

237
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,180
Dad. Dad. Dad.

238
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,170
I'll take good care of Eunseong from now on.

239
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,270
Don't be a burden to your son.

240
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,420
Live the rest of your life comfortably in prison.

241
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,170
I never thought there'll a day where I can hold you hand freely.

242
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,100
Seul-bi.

243
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,910
How's the chairman?

244
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,700
Did something happen?

245
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,240
Mom.

246
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,530
Could the future I see

247
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,120
be wrong?

248
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,920
What did you see?

249
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,080
Can the future I see change?

250
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,200
I think it may.

251
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,300
That's how the chairman saved Min-joon.

252
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,480
Seul-bi!

253
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,070
Mom.

254
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,600
Some future...

255
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,020
If we act to avoid them,

256
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,340
that future will also try to lead us there.

257
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,210
So no matter what choices we make

258
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,320
or what price we pay,

259
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,780
if time passes,

260
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,650
we will still reach that future.

261
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,400
That means it's inevitable.

262
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,220
It's an unchangeable fate.

263
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,890
A fate that can't be changed.

264
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,330
Seul-bi.

265
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,340
Don't make dangerous choices.

266
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,070
No!

267
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,450
No! Soo-kwang!

268
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,050
Soo-kwang! No!

269
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,310
Did Uncle Go leave?

270
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,280
Thanks to you, I was able to protect Uncle Go.

271
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,450
Thank you.

272
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,090
That's great.

273
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,050
But why did you do that?

274
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,500
I mean Director Choi.

275
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,430
Why did you hand him over to Seon Dong-sik?

276
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,150
The police asked me about what happened two years ago.

277
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,490
They asked me why Chairman Seon wanted to kill me.

278
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,960
Does he have bad blood with me?

279
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,680
Although I said I don't know anything for the time being,

280
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,290
once the police start investigating,

281
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,390
you and this place will be discovered.

282
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,840
Do you still think I'm not honest in front of the people?

283
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,870
That's not what I meant, Seul-bi.

284
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,100
I'm just worried about you.

285
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,850
No matter how confident you are,

286
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,610
people will still look at you with harsh eyes.

287
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,410
I'm afraid those sharp gaze will hurt you.

288
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,800
I'm really worried.

289
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,670
Soo-kwang, the truth will come out eventually.

290
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,750
No matter how hard you try to hide me,

291
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,050
you'll need to reveal me to the world eventually.

292
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:06,240
I will stand in front of everyone

293
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,790
and become miserable.

294
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:13,890
Then you'll leave me.

295
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,380
This is the future I saw.

296
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,370
You're lying.

297
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,290
We're going to break up anyway.

298
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,230
Just leave me, Soo-kwang.

299
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,630
If I leave,

300
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,090
will you be happy?

301
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,980
If I leave,

302
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,400
will you be free?

303
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,130
I don't know what future you've seen,

304
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,410
but our future won't be miserable.

305
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,450
Do you know why?

306
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,320
You made me a lucky man.

307
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,570
So no matter what bad luck I encounter,

308
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,640
I will turn it into luck.

309
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,829
Don't go anywhere.

310
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,660
-I said I'm leaving. -Welcome.

311
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,490
-Oh, my. -Don't drink alone at home.

312
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,020
Let's drink here.

313
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,920
-Ms. Bang, three cups of 500cc. -Okay, three cups of 500cc!

314
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,290
Why is the frequency of meeting a police here

315
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,580
higher than in the police station?

316
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,090
This is great.

317
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,230
It's good for the security of Seodong Market.

318
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,420
I asked her to be a civil servant.

319
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,040
But she brought back a boyfriend who is a civil servant.

320
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,860
I don't get it either.

321
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,170
Eat more fried chicken.

322
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,290
Uncle Jung, my mom suffered a lot

323
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,400
because of my dad's drinking.

324
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,220
So please do it moderately.

325
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,140
Oh, they’re a family now.

326
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,850
Ms. Bang may be impatient,

327
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,870
but she’s really nice.

328
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,740
That's who I am.

329
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,860
Gosh, you're not shy at all.

330
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,050
What's there to be embarrassed about?

331
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,740
My mom remarried two years ago.

332
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,000
As long as they like each other,

333
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,220
they can just be together.

334
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,590
-Are you crazy? -I've never been married.

335
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,750
Gosh. He's not only younger than you,

336
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,230
but he also never married anyone before.

337
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,630
This is his first time.

338
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,680
You're so lucky.

339
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,310
Then I should be the witness.

340
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,900
Should I order a suit?

341
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,900
What's going on?

342
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,900
Who said I'm getting remarried?

343
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,380
My gosh.

344
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,490
What is this?

345
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,550
The conglomerate chairman was arrested for abetting murder.

346
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,110
-What? -What news?

347
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,150
No, look here.

348
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,370
Chairman Seon Il-jung of Eunseong Capital.

349
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,440
First-degree abetting murder.

350
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,600
Special additional punishment for the criminal...

351
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,660
-Let's drink. -What's the use of being rich?

352
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,330
Goodness.

353
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,120
Uncle Jung, Chairman Seon Il-jung case has been solved.

354
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,150
(Uncle Jung, Chairman Seon Il-jung's case has been solved. You just need to live happily with your new family.)
Uncle Jung, Chairman Seon Il-jung case has been solved.

355
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,100
You just need to
(Uncle Jung, Chairman Seon Il-jung's case has been solved. You just need to live happily with your new family.)

356
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,320
and live happily with your new family.

357
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,830
Here. Three cups of 500cc.

358
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,210
Hyun Taen.

359
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,060
Hyun Taen.

360
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,680
Let's have a drink.

361
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Stop watching the news.

362
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,090
-It's a dangerous world. Why are you looking at that? -That's right.

363
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,230
I heard that in 2100, humans will go extinct.

364
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,660
There you go again. That's too far.

365
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,820
That’s great.

366
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,800
By the way, Min-joon.

367
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,410
Come to my house when you have time.

368
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,620
My mom wants to treat her future son-in-law.

369
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,990
But you need to starve for two meals.

370
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,190
The food she prepared can only be eaten if you're really hungry.

371
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,070
Jang Kyung.

372
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,760
Why don't we get married soon?

373
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,770
Sure. My mom wants us to get married soon too.

374
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,130
I'm sorry. I've been very busy with the company.

375
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,970
I can't prepare the wedding with you.

376
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,120
Just do what you want.

377
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,020
Prepare well with your mom.

378
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,040
-Okay. Don't worry, Min-joon. -Okay.

379
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,090
Are you getting along with Jang-geun?

380
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,380
My brother?

381
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,640
He's not my brother.

382
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,340
He's a jerk.

383
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,110
Whenever he drinks, he'll say he doesn't want to be a doctor.

384
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,330
He even says why I can do whatever I want.

385
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,360
He'll call me and complain every time he drinks.

386
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,840
But when he calls me little sister now and then,

387
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,790
and when he takes care of me,

388
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,380
I also think that maybe this is family.

389
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,380
My little sister.

390
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,770
My little sister.

391
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,850
Let's go.

392
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,140
Uncle was arrested.

393
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:56,530
Didn't you do that to Soo-kwang two years ago?

394
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,610
Why did you do that?

395
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,640
You didn't say a word to me, your son.

396
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,040
Don't worry.

397
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,650
I'll do my best.

398
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,220
I'll take good care of Ms. Mi-soo

399
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,990
and my little sister.

400
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:24,020
So don't worry too much.

401
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,270
Please.

402
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,730
Please come back, Dad.

403
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,450
Seul-bi started writing these cards for you

404
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,780
since she was little.

405
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:01,320
Dad, what do you look like?

406
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,380
Do I look like you?

407
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,130
Dad.

408
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,200
I thought Santa would bring you back.

409
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,730
But he didn't.

410
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,770
Dad, where are you?

411
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:37,280
Come, hurry. Take me and Mom away from here.

412
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:51,700
It's Seul-bi's birthday today.

413
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,260
I'm fine, Mom.

414
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,800
I don't want it. This is a gift I want from dad.

415
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,230
Not the chairman, but dad.

416
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,320
Today is my birthday.

417
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,390
Why isn't dad coming?

418
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:33,910
(I'm sorry, my daughter Seul-bi. What I did to you may never be forgiven. But Seul-bi, I'm glad you're my daughter.)

419
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,370
I'm sorry, my daughter Seul-bi.
(I'm sorry, my daughter Seul-bi. What I did to you may never be forgiven. But Seul-bi, I'm glad you're my daughter.)

420
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,750
What I did to you

421
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,600
may never be forgiven.

422
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,000
But Seul-bi,

423
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,420
I'm glad you're my daughter.

424
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,500
Use this when you need it.

425
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,420
What is it?

426
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,120
This is a document from the chairman.

427
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:55,530
The chairman said the boss's service period for LS branch company of the logistic department is coming to an end.

428
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,350
You can take that position.

429
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,800
I've prepared the letter of appointment.

430
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,870
We'll announce it officially next Wednesday.

431
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:12,510
Let's wait for Min-joon to successfully inherit the management rights.

432
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,160
Then, we'll think about it.

433
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,480
(Seul-bi. Let's go shopping. You'll go with me, right?)

434
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,350
Let's go shopping. You'll go with me, right?
(Seul-bi. Let's go shopping. You'll go with me, right?)

435
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,890
Let's go shopping. You'll go with me, right?

436
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,260
-Hyun Taen, are you okay? -I'm fine.

437
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,670
Sit down. Sit down.

438
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,620
Did you catch a cold?

439
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,370
Gosh, your forehead is burning.

440
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,550
Oh, no. What should we do?

441
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,960
It's okay.

442
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,920
-Uncle Jung. -Oh, Soo-kwang.

443
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,620
Seul-bi is here too.

444
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,020
You didn't get in trouble because of Seon Il-jung's arrest, right?

445
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,980
Are you okay?

446
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,560
We're fine. Don't worry.

447
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,860
Because of the sinful adults,

448
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,400
you innocent people suffered.

449
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,710
What's wrong? Are you sick?

450
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,890
He has a fever. Go buy some medicine.

451
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,270
Okay, I'll get it right away.

452
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,380
-I'm fine. -I'll be right back.

453
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,140
You have a fever.

454
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,370
What should we do? Oh, my.

455
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,660
Seul-bi, we're not what you think.

456
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,660
We're nothing.

457
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,350
Oh, no. What should we do?

458
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,010
-Here's your medicine. -Okay, thank you.

459
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,430
Bye.

460
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,490
Don't skip your meals.

461
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,550
Three times a day. Each time three pills.

462
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,520
Don't make us worry.

463
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,600
I'm really grateful for you.

464
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,950
I thought my life was over,

465
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,090
but as Seul-bi said, it seems like I have a family now.

466
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,400
Oh, you're here, Hyun Taen.

467
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,220
Did you take your medicine?

468
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,420
Have some warm yuzu tea.

469
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,500
Oh, right. Seul-bi.

470
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,620
We're supposed to meet at my fried chicken restaurant tonight.

471
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,280
You have to come, okay?

472
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,720
-Today? -Yes.

473
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,690
What are you thinking about? You have to come, okay?

474
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,750
-Come together. -Okay.

475
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,160
Bye.

476
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,260
-Thank you for the yuzu tea. -It's nothing.

477
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,610
How about this one?

478
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:35,190
That design looks like you're attending a traditional singer's banquet.

479
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:37,960
Then...

480
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,790
How about this one?

481
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,540
This one is pretty.

482
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,720
But I think Mr. Park will wear that on a blind date.

483
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,220
It's a bit boring.

484
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,950
Seul-bi, I've been standing like this for 20 minutes, you know?

485
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,250
No, it's 12 minutes.

486
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,890
Mr. Hong, please pick one.

487
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,940
By the way, you guys only wear luxury products.

488
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,870
I wonder if you'll like my shop's tie.

489
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,720
-How about this one? -How about this one, Soo-kwang?

490
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,110
-It's too bright, right?. -It's an exciting color.

491
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,480
No. Gifts are always like that.

492
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,590
You choose an edgy style that you normally don't wear.

493
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,440
I can't take it anymore! I can't take it anymore!

494
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,120
Wrap them up.

495
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,740
Seul-bi, let's buy them all.

496
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,260
Then you will pay for all of this.

497
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,800
Okay.

498
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,690
We'll pay with this card.

499
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,060
I'm rich today.

500
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,950
-Soo-kwang and Seul-bi are here. -Mr. Park.

501
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,380
Mr. Park!

502
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,320
Soo-kwang, since you left the market,

503
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,720
Mr. Park asks me to do all the work.

504
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,280
Do you know how tired I am?

505
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:42,870
Gosh.

506
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,320
People might think

507
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,980
you're the one who do all the work at the Seodong Market Chamber of Commerce.

508
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,810
Didn't we agree to open an online delivery service?

509
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,220
I only told him to look for a delivery company. Look how fake he is.

510
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,570
Fake?

511
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,840
I do everything.

512
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,570
Mr. Park, don't use Mr. Hong too much, okay?

513
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,570
Anyway, Seul-bi.

514
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,670
Come to the fried chicken restaurant and eat today.

515
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,900
I invited everyone.

516
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,170
You must come.

517
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,130
Yes, you have to come later.

518
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:07,860
Today?

519
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,250
Yes.

520
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,130
Hello, this is Gong Soo-kwang from the secretary's office.

521
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,740
The planning department submitted a proposal last time.

522
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,710
It's the plan that supports traditional market's online delivery services.

523
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:21,290
Yes. There's a market that suits that project.

524
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,690
-Oh, my. -Okay.

525
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,790
I'll talk to you about the details later.

526
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,180
Thank you.

527
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:31,090
You're so cool.

528
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,890
I'm Gong Soo-kwang from the secretary's office.

529
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:33,670
Wow.

530
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:36,380
You're indeed a lucky man.

531
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:40,080
Even if you are not here, we're still lucky.

532
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,730
It's a golden sentence.

533
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,580
Is all this luck from Seul-bi?

534
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,400
It can't be wrong.

535
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,440
Oh, my.

536
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,800
I'm home.

537
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,080
You bought a lot.

538
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,000
Mom, look.

539
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,400
This.

540
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,560
What is this?

541
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,160
Soo-kwang bought this for you.

542
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,910
Wow, it's beautiful, mom.

543
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,670
Thank you.

544
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,110
It looks good on you.

545
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,260
And this...

546
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,300
It's a present for the chairman.

547
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,770
Look at this.

548
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,590
Seul-bi bought you a gift.

549
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,590
It'll look good on you.

550
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,090
This is for you.

551
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,090
I have one too?

552
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,190
Yes.

553
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:42,300
I've always wanted to give a gift to every family member.

554
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,160
Family?

555
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,150
Wait.

556
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:48,980
Look at this.

557
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,910
This dress,

558
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,640
this hat,

559
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,540
and this handbag.

560
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,430
I bought them with the card you gave me.

561
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,470
So these are

562
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,870
gifts that dad bought.

563
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,790
Then we're family now, right?

564
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,760
Dad, since you took the curse for me,

565
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,840
I'll do my best to do your part.

566
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,850
From now on, I will protect

567
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:33,160
Mi-soo and Seul-bi.

568
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,220
Don't worry about it.

569
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,760
And Soo-kwang.

570
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,920
My little sister...

571
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,130
I entrust her to you.

572
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,590
Don't worry.

573
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,550
I'm hungry.

574
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,530
Let's eat.

575
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,180
Have a seat, Secretary Cha.

576
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,790
-Let's eat together. -Let's eat.

577
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,050
-Have a seat. -Thank you.

578
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,989
Wow, it looks delicious.

579
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:15,650
(Eunseong Capital)

580
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,690
Director Choi must have been very honest.

581
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,590
He confessed everything.

582
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:36,460
Goodbye, Eunseong Capital.

583
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,500
By the way, it will not affect Superstar Loan, right?

584
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,750
Boss cleaned up all our history.

585
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,100
Now we got a clean record.

586
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,480
We can start over.

587
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,560
I need to report it to Seul-bi.

588
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,380
Hey, Seul-bi.

589
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,280
You're right. The arrest warrant for Seon Dong-sik is issued.

590
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,710
Will this work?

591
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,410
If Seon Dong-sik is arrested,

592
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,580
will Soo-kwang be safe?

593
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,120
No.

594
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,010
No.

595
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,410
It can be stopped.

596
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,320
If we didn't get the information in advance,

597
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,810
we could've been in big trouble, Mr. Seon.

598
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,220
Darn it!

599
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,910
What's the point in calling me to run away?

600
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,620
What are those bastards doing?

601
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,520
They even issued a warrant to arrest me.

602
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,780
It was my dad who committed fund fraud and embezzlement.

603
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,660
Chief Kim has stopped the district police.

604
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,240
But the prosecutors issued the arrest warrant anyway.

605
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,070
They said Director Choi had some information when he turned himself in.

606
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:00,020
It contains all your illegal acts.

607
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,120
My account is frozen.

608
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,960
I'm so scared.

609
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,140
If I didn't withdraw it,

610
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,780
the money would be gone, right?

611
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,370
Have you put away

612
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,480
all the cash you withdrew?

613
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,930
Yes. I'll find a place for you for this period of time.

614
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,420
Don’t you think something is wrong?

615
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,810
Director Choi was fired because of Seul-bi.

616
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:43,580
My dad went to Eun Ok-jin because of Seul-bi.

617
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:47,630
Director Wang became the leader of Superstar Loan because of Seul-bi.

618
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,450
Is Director Wang

619
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,650
close to the merchants in Seodong Market?

620
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,010
The market Seul-bi used to be in.

621
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:57,890
Yes.

622
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:00,540
Director Wang handed Director Choi to us.

623
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,260
He even asked him to turn himself in.

624
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,400
Now that I think about it, it's all related to that witch.

625
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,930
It's that witch.

626
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,560
She tricked me.

627
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,570
I can't let her go.

628
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,480
What are you going to do?

629
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,440
Mr. Yeom.

630
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,040
Yes.

631
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,420

Happy birthday to you.

(Shareholders' meeting of Geumhwa Group)

646
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,530
Unfortunately,
(Shareholders' meeting of Geumhwa Group)

647
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,040
(Shareholders' meeting of Geumhwa Group)

648
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,030
it is difficult for Chairman Seon Sam-jung
(Shareholders' meeting of Geumhwa Group)

649
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,950
to stick to the front line of business due to his illness.
(Shareholders' meeting of Geumhwa Group)

650
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,240
Therefore, Seoul Family Court

651
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,290
selected Director Seon Min-joon

652

as the appointed guardian of Chairman Seon Sam-jung, the quasi-interdicted person.

In this emergency board meeting,

654

we will vote

655
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,180
whether Director Seon Min-joon will be elected as the chairman.

00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,300
By the way,

667
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,240
Gong Soo-kwang told us to gather.

668
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,830
Why isn't he here yet?

669
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,240
That's right.

670
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,320
It's Seul-bi's birthday today.

671
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,180
How can he be so casual with it?

672
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,160
If he leaves Seul-bi alone like this,

673
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,090
I'll find him and teach him a lesson.

674
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,050
He's Secretary Gong of Geumhwa Group.

675
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,210
He's very busy.

676
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,240
But he can't do this.

677
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,450
-Hey, Seul-bi. Why don't you take this opportunity to satisfy our curiosity? -Okay.

678
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,370
So,

679
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,070
whose daughter are you?

680
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,450
Chairman Seon Sam-jung's?

681
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,470
Are you curious?

682
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,570
Yes.

683
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,720
After a while,

684
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,350
I'll invite you to my house.

685
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,310
Invite us?

686
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,260
To your house?

687
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,980
-All of us? -All of us?

688
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,780
Great.

689
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,470
It must be fun.

690
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,710
-What is this? -Is this true?

691
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,730
How could this be possible?

692
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:55,010
They locked them up?

693
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,030
Director.

694
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:02,090
("Witches were imprisoned in Geumhwa hotel for 20 years!" "Chairman Seon Sam-jung's secret garden." "Crime against humanity of imprisoning people for 20 years.")

695
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,890
-The stock price will plummet. -How could a human do this?
("Witches were imprisoned in Geumhwa hotel for 20 years!" "Chairman Seon Sam-jung's secret garden." "Crime against humanity of imprisoning people for 20 years.")

696
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,960
-The stock price will plummet. -How could a human do this?

697
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,490
Is this true?

698
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,760
What's going on?

699
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,030
Is this true, Director?

700
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,180
The board meeting today is forced to postpone until the next.

701
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,770
You need to explain.

702
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,240
How could you just leave?

703
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,750
The reporters are already at the lobby.

704
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,740
Seul-bi's safety is our priority.

705
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,750
Contact Soo-kwang

706
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,740
and confirm his location.

707
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,200
Then send bodyguards to the lobby

708
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,310
and protect him as much as possible.

709
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,580
And...

710
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,720
don't shake the shareholders.

711
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,490
Send out a warning to the media,

712
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:52,060
saying we will take legal measures against the spreading of false rumors.

713
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,680
Okay.

714
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,440
Mom.

715
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,740
Mom, do you see this?

716
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,590
It says that Seul-bi is a witch who

717
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,660
was imprisoned by Geumhwa Group for 20 years.

718
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:07,620
-Why is he talking nonsense? -What are you talking about?

719
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,670
-Let me see. -What is he talking about?

720
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,450
What?

721
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:12,370
It really is.

722
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,490
-What? -Really?

723
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,550
What?

724
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,920
-What? -What is it?

725
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,790
They must be wrong.

726
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,370
No, no.

727
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,690
Seul-bi!

728
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,480
Soo-kwang.

729
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,330
-Soo-kwang is here. -Soo-kwang.

730
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,580
Let's go. We need to go back.

731
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:33,040
Go home, Seul-bi.

732
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,360
Hurry!

733
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,670
-What? -Seul-bi.

734
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,840
-Seul-bi. -Seul-bi.

735
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,350
No way.

736
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,600
Seul-bi.

737
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,180
She was raised for 20 years.

738
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,310
Is Seul-bi really a witch?

739
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:51,680
-No. Isn't she the daughter of Geumhwa Group? -She's not from a rich family?

740
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,310
What's going on?

741
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:56,650
-No, Jung. -What's going on?

742
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,950
(Geumhwa Hotel)

743
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,600
It's that woman.

744
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,160
That woman.

745
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,970
That woman is the witch who was locked

746
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:14,930
in the secret room of this hotel for 20 years.

747
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,970
Because I couldn't keep her secret,

748
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,530
in the past two years,

749
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:20,830
I was forced to stay in a mental hospital.

750
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:25,950
Seon Sam-jung of Geumhwa Group is a shameless criminal.

751
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,050
Really? Have you really been locked up for 20 years?

752
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,870
I heard you can see the future as long as you touch someone's hand. Is that true?

753
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,430
Please take off your gloves.

754
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,740
Are you really a witch?

755
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,790
Say it.

756
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:36,620
Say that you are a witch raised by Seon Sam-jung.

757
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,690
Say that you are a tool to tell fortune for Geumhwa Group. Say it.

758
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:56,320
Please say something.

759
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,200
I'm sorry.

760
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,920
I'm sorry, Ms. Min.

761
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,720
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

762
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:38,370
Please say something.

763
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,950
What are you going to do now?

764
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:49,560
You witch.

765
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:54,900
Mom.

766
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,580
Ms. Min is here.

767
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,150
I need to see her.

768
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,560
It's not the time yet, Seul-bi.

769
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,970
I must have caused her a lot of pain.

770
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:12,380
Who is Ms. Min?

771
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,270
She's a nurse who took care of Seul-bi and me for 20 years.

772
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,130
Two years ago, I heard she was sent out

773
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:22,300
because she didn't take good care of Seul-bi.

774
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,870
What kind of legal problems will be involved?

775
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,640
We might be investigated for profit-seeking inducement, quasi-fraud,

776
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,840
imprisonment, violation of the Labor Standards Act, and others.

777
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,050
I've ordered the legal team

778
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:33,460
to come up with countermeasures.

779
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,940
Let's meet with Ms. Min first

780
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,060
to apologize and to make it up to her.

781
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,070
If we make it public,

782
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,460
Mi-soo and Seul-bi will suffer too.

783
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:49,010
Back then, there's no need to keep my existence a secret.

784
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,160
Am I right, brother?

785
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,290
I think before everything is settled down,

786
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:00,660
it's better for Mi-soo and Seul-bi to go to the villa with the chairman.

787
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,460
I won't hide.

788
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:07,460
I have no reason not to stand in front of the world.

789
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,170
Then let's face it.

790
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,890
Min-joon.

791
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:19,520
It has been hidden for decades.

792
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,790
Secrets are secrets for a reason.

793
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,200
It will shake the Geumhwa Group.

794
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,840
Seul-bi is right.

795
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,090
We can't hide it forever.

796
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:32,500
As my father's son,

797
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,930
I will take responsibility

798
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,920
on behalf of our family.

799
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,000
Let's face it.

800
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:48,920
Seul-bi.

801
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,690
She didn't even get to eat a cake on her birthday.

802
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:56,640
No. Why do you all look so pale

803
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,830
and keep staring at Seul-bi?

804
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:01,090
Whose fault is this?

805
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:02,240
It’s Eun-soo’s fault.

806
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,760
He made a fuss when he saw the news.

807
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,720
If you hadn't yelled,

808
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,430
this is the time for a birthday party.

809
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:07,490
Eat up.

810
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:12,330
No wonder Seul-bi was acting weird.

811
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,650
She was locked up for 20 years.

812
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:16,580
It's more than that.

813
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,880
What kind of bastards are the people from Geumhwa Group?

814
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,370
They locked her up for 20 years.

815
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:23,540
I can't stand it anymore.

816
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,490
-I'm going to beat them all. -Sister, calm down.

817
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:29,910
Sit down. Stop messing around.

818
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:31,330
Seriously.

819
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:35,500
Does Jung know about this?

820
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,040
Where is he?

821
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,110
What would Hyun Taen know?

822
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:41,380
You're right.

823
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,970
You, eat up and go study in the reading room.

824
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,420
Stop surfing the internet.

825
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:45,640
Goodness.

826
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,000
Seul-bi.

827
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,940
That's what happened.

828
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,730
The future I saw.

829
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,610
It's that woman.

830
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:09,970
This is just the beginning.

831
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:20,180
What?

832
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:24,790
I was going to throw you a party

833
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:27,010
at the market.

834
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:28,740
I didn't expect this to happen.

835
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,540
I didn't even get a cake.

836
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,850
Happy birthday, Seul-bi.

837
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,610
Thank you.

838
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,700
I was made public today.

839
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,600
Seul-bi.

840
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,830
Did you see today in your vision?

841
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,410
I hope tomorrow will never come.

842
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:08,270
I'm not afraid of tomorrow.

843
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,990
Do you know when I was the happiest in my life?

844
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,110
When?

845
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,640
Now.

846
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:19,440
The moment you're with me is the happiest.

847
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,600
Thinking that we'll be together tomorrow,

848
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,180
I feel so happy.

849
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,320
I told you.

850
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,410
No matter what misfortune I encounter,

851
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,150
I will turn it into luck.

852
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,410
So don't worry.

853
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:45,910
After all this has pass,

854
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:49,260
you'll have a bright future.

855
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,010
Min-joon.

856
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:18,050
You haven't changed your mind, have you?

857
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,950
My dad raised me in his way.

858
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:24,090
I should protect my family in my own way.

859
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,260
You're amazing, Seon Min-joon.

860
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,860
(Geumhwa Group's press conference to clarify the illegal imprisonment of witches.)
It was on the news a few days ago.

861
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,580
It was said that a mother and daughter have lived in the secret space of Geumhwa Group
(Geumhwa Group's press conference to clarify the illegal imprisonment of witches.)

862
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,830
It was said that a mother and daughter have lived in the secret space of Geumhwa Group

863
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:38,910
for 20 years.

864
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,070
It's true.

865
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,810
-Really? -Really?

866
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:45,520
Are you admitting that Geumhwa has illegally imprisoned them for 20 years?

867
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,890
Because of my father's wrong judgment,

868
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:49,930
we restricted their activities

869
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:51,760
for their safety.

870
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,550
I admit that.

871
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,710
According to the informant,

872
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:55,110
you locked them up

873
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:56,520
and ask them do fortune-telling.

874
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,690
We did ask for their business advice and help.

875
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:00,460
In that case,

876
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,160
it was rumored that Geumhwa Group could grow to its current scale

877
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,000
all thanks to the witches.

878
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,310
Is it true?

879
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:06,700
Geumhwa Group's growth...

880
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,890
is the result of all executives' hard work, including my father's

881
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:10,720
and other employees'.

882
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,320
Did you also know that the mother and daughter were imprisoned?

883
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,840
If it was imprisonment,

884
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,830
didn't Geumhwa realize that it was a serious crime?

885
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:21,720
Some media reports are exaggerating.

886
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,050
The imprisonment is not true.

887
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:27,060
How will Geumhwa take legal responsibility?

888
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,470
My father is currently under mental health treatment,

889
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,640
and he is a quasi-interdicted person.

890
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,420
I will be fully responsible for it as the appointed guardian.

891
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:44,350
I apologize for disturbing the people of the whole country

892
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:46,720
about this disgraceful incident.

893
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,590
She's here.

894
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,700
She's here.

895
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:59,910
Seul-bi, you don't have to be here.

896
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:00,990
Ms. Mi-soo.

897
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:02,820
It's okay, Soo-kwang.

898
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:21,730
We are the ones who have been living in Geumhwa Group's secret space for 20 years.

899
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:31,870
What kind of abuse have you been through?

900
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:33,320
You've been imprisoned for 20 years.

901
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,790
Is there anything wrong with your body and mind?

902
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:38,100
We were not imprisoned.

903
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,710
You said you were not imprisoned.

904
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:41,510
Are you saying you lived there voluntarily?

905
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:44,440
I chose to live in seclusion for personal reasons.

906
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,700
I was not imprisoned.

907
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,720
It's all my fault.

908
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,420
It has nothing to do with Seon Sam-jung and Geumhwa Group.

909
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,900
Especially Director Seon Min-joon.

910
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,740
When he knew that I chose to live in seclusion,

911
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,910
he made great efforts to let my daughter and I

912
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:01,080
live in the outside world.

913
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,600
Please stop blaming him.

914
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,560
I heard you two are fortune-tellers.

915
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,400
Are you witches?

916
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,230
Please answer. Are you witches?

917
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:15,730
Fortune-telling doesn't have any legal problems.

918
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,400
Please don't ask any private questions.

919
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,510
In that case...

920
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:23,100
Are you in an affair with Chairman Seon Sam-jung?

921
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:28,270
Please don't ask any private questions.

922
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:32,030
She's like my mother.

923
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,490
And this...

924
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,410
This is my little sister.

925
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:41,070
Are they half-siblings?

926
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:44,150
So you and this lady...

927
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:45,990
are half-siblings?

928
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:48,830
Yes.

929
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,580
Did he imprison you

930
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:55,230
and force you to be his wife?

931
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,690
That's not true.

932
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:59,600
I chose to stay in the secret space.

933
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,520
Then why did you lock your daughter up and raise her there?

934
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:06,390
I can go out freely.

935
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,780
You've never been to school,

936
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,660
and your information has not been registered in the family relationship registration.

937
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,660
Isn't that enough to prove that you were locked up?

938
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,220
Please answer.

939
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:20,190
-Please answer... -Please prove it...

940
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,180
Seul-bi!

941
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:46,150
Seul-bi!

942
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:49,890
Well...

943
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:53,400
Seul-bi works in our market.

944
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,570
-What market? -What market?

945
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:58,620
Wait. Wait. Wait.

946
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,330
It's Seodong Market in Seodong.

947
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:05,100
Seul-bi is the best businesswoman in our market.

948
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:05,750
That's right.

949
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:08,230
Our fried chicken restaurant is really popular.

950
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:09,640
Our fired chicken is really good.

951
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,550
Do you want to try it?

952
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:13,860
Mom, we need to show our name.

953
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,390
Bang’s Chicken.
(Bang’s Chicken)

954
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:17,890
Their shop is next to mine.

955
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:21,700
You have no idea how nice Seul-bi is to my child.

956
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,370
She's nice,

957
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:25,270
and she's good at doing business.

958
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:27,770
Seul-bi is perfect.

959
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:28,840
She's perfect.

960
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,190
Seul-bi is perfect.

961
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:31,680
Look over here.

962
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,980
Ta-da.

963
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:33,630
Isn't she pretty?

964
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:34,660
She has a good figure, right?

965
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,480
She almost became a model for my clothing store.

966
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,990
She can even be compared to a celebrity.

967
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:40,730
I have an urgent announcement.

968
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,530
My husband is Jung-tae.

969
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:45,610
But he almost became a big liar

970
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:48,010
for no reason.

971
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:50,010
Thanks to Seul-bi. He was stopped.

972
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,390
It's true.

973
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:57,440
And we were almost cheated by the executive who wanted to reform our market.

974
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,620
Seul-bi stopped him.

975
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,060
And...

976
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,440
She even helped me get a girlfriend.

977
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,520
She is the Cupid.

978
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,850
No. She brought sunshine to my life.

979
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:15,660
What are you doing?

980
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,430
Hey.

981
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:19,760
Seon Dong-sik was here.

982
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,980
Why is he doing here?

983
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,060
He's not only banned from leaving the country,

984
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,580
but also wanted.

985
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,300
I looked into the informant.

986
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,940
It was Seon Dong-sik who incited reporters to report it.

987
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,940
Those jerks.

988
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,480
Did he have a grudge with Seul-bi in his past life?

989
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,420
I feel like he wants to do something to Seul-bi.

990
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,770
I'm worried.

991
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:39,900
Can you help me find where he might go?

992
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,940
Okay, I'll ask my men to look for him.

993
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,320
Leave it to me.

994
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:52,050
(How a rich heir works.)

995
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:54,360
A rich heir sells fish.
(How a rich heir works.)

996
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,990
A plain and beautiful conglomerate.

997
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:00,450
They're really good at it.

998
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,900
There seems to be an inspection.

999
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,100
What?

1000
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,680
Please cooperate with us for a while.

1001
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:14,040
(Wanted List: Seon Dong-sik.)

1002
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,580
Let him go.

1003
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,560
Looks like Chief Kim did cover for us.

1004
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,530
He took all the bribes.

1005
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:37,360
He got the money by selling Geumhwa Group's shares.

1006
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,760
Darn it. What is this?

1007
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:43,820
What?

1008
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:45,810
(Eunseong Capital's false report on Geumhwa Group. Employees' explanation of Geumhwa Group's secret space: it's just a rest space for the chairman.)
It said I made a false report.

1009
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:46,000
These people...
(Eunseong Capital's false report on Geumhwa Group. Employees' explanation of Geumhwa Group's secret space: it's just a rest space for the chairman.)
It said I made a false report.

1010
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,340
These people...

1011
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,270
What's with this lady?

1012
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:22,090
She's the nurse who took care of the two witches after Ms. Min.

1013
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:24,300
I asked her to do an interview with the media.

1014
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,680
You promised to give me money.

1015
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:28,850
Money?

1016
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:32,010
You ladies still don't get it, do you?

1017
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:35,440
You said you'll pay if we do as you say.

1018
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,350
You also imprisoned those two witches at Geumhwa Hotel.

1019
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:42,150
You are the accomplices of Chairman Seon Sam-jung.

1020
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:43,400
What do you say?

1021
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,980
Do you want me to put you in jail tomorrow?

1022
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,280
Also,

1023
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:50,440
your interviews are long gone.

1024
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,370
The media are talking about how beautiful and hardworking the daughter of a conglomerate is.

1025
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:57,240
It's all nonsense.

1026
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,010
Can't you do a good interview?

1027
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,770
That's enough, Mr. Seon.

1028
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:04,910
It will do no good to us

1029
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:06,900
to ask for trouble.

1030
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:15,660
I told you to shut up!

1031
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:19,230
I'm sick of my dad's nagging.

1032
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:22,010
If anyone dares to lecture me,

1033
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,690
I will...

1034
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:26,730
I will kill them all.

1035
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,840
Do you understand?

1036
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,810
I'll kill them all.

1037
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,520
(How a rich heir works.)

1038
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:33,550
The public opinion is friendly to us.
(How a rich heir works.)

1039
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:36,000
(... Seul-bi was mentioned in the "Geumhwa Group's imprisonment of witches" which caused public anger in recent days, but her actual identity is the third generation of the rich that Geumhwa Group concealed from the public. She not only does not participate in her father's management, but also works in a particularly different way. What is striking is that Seul-bi is the daughter of the rich, but she spends ordinary and simple daily life with merchants in Seoul Seodong Market...)
The public opinion is friendly to us.

1040
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,120
Seul-bi has a positive image.

1041
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:42,500
I don't think people'll talk about the topic like imprisonment again.

1042
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:48,910
I didn't expect the people from Seodong Market would come to help.

1043
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,780
You called them, didn't you?

1044
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,880
Everyone loves Seul-bi.

1045
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,390
Did you get in touch with Ms. Min?

1046
00:59:58,390 --> 00:59:59,970
She disappeared.

1047
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:02,200
We couldn't find her contact information and address.

1048
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,080
She was locked up because of me.

1049
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,240
There's nothing I can do.

1050
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,360
It's not your fault, Seul-bi.

1051
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,330
I'll try to get in touch with her

1052
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:16,580
and make it up to her.

1053
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,530
Ms. Min... She must be with Seon Dong-sik now.

1054
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:22,900
The police are looking for Seon Dong-sik.

1055
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,100
They'll catch him soon.

1056
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:38,960
No!

1057
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,970
No, Soo-kwang!

1058
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,230
(In the next episode)

1059
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:24,840
I will dissolve Geumhwa Group.

1060
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,440
I think this is the way to

1061
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,790
break the curse that binds our family's men for generations.

1062
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:30,040
The rumor on the internet?

1063
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,080
I saw it too.

1064
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,570
Is she really a demoness?

1065
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:34,680
What are you talking about?

1066
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,980
I still have some power.

1067
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,770
So I will use this last bit of power

1068
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:40,740
on us.

1069
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:43,090
Mom!

1070
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:44,380
Don't you miss me?

1071
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,190
What do you want?

1072
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:49,030
You'll come to me.
