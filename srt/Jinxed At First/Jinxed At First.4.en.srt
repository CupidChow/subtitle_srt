1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:01,650
Why are you following me?

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,510
(Episode 4)
Why are you following me?

3
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,380
(Episode 4)

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,510
Don't do anything and just stay home.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,500
No.

6
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,680
Hello, Eun-joo.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,810
Hello, sister.

8
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,460
I'm that KRW 40,000 from last time.

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,670
By the way, you're really pretty.

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,020
Are you crazy?

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,570
You're totally falling for her.

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,770
Aren't you going to school?

13
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,770
I'll go.

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,040
Hey.

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,970
Oh, this is good！

16
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,170
I've known Myeong-seong for over a year.

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,740
Over the past year, I've overcome the torture from my mom

18
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,430
and the misfortune derived from talking to him.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,720
No, it's the test of love.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,170
-Watching him all the way... -This is really delicious!

21
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,920
What's this name?

22
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,039
It's on the bottle:

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,190
the rich and fragrant taste of life.

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,600
The elders said she's silly.

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,890
Is it true?

26
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:31,910
Anyway, what I want to say is...

27
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,930
- For Myeong-seong, you should stay away... -You...

28
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,080
You're such a good person.

29
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,039
What?

30
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,280
You just give me such delicious drink

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,830
without asking me for money.

32
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,640
Well,

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,930
it's just a can of coffee.

34
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,000
It's not just a can of coffee.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,910
This is coffee with rich and fragrant taste of life.

36
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,060
Hey.

37
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,160
Don't you mind staying by Myeong-seong side?

38
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,990
He's not Myeong-seong but Soo-kwang.

39
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,090
To me, it seems to be a nickname you call him.

40
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,270
Anyway,

41
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,190
once you get involved with him, bad luck will happen.

42
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,479
You'd better stay away from him.

43
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,910
By the way, why do you always chat up Soo-kwang?

44
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,020
It's because I like him.

45
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,630
But he likes me.

46
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,950
I... The day when I first met him...

47
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,560
Hey, where are you going? Shoot!

48
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,829
Well...

49
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,430
We have an empty room at home.

50
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,000
Are you looking for a place?

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
Are you mad?

52
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,470
Do you want to be killed by mom?

53
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,190
Yes, I'm looking for a place.

54
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,090
And...

55
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,180
-The day when I saw him for the second time... -Well...

56
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:51,450
I'd like a fried chicken with natural flavor. To go, please.

57
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,510
What?

58
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,080
What am I gonna do?

59
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,470
-What am I gonna do? -It's dangerous.

60
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,840
Step back first.

61
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,280
In such a dangerous situation, he should get the phone out so quickly.

62
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,410
I'm so charming indeed!

63
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,980
Someone else likes you.

64
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,040
He's nearby.

65
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,410
I'm done.

66
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,870
Eun-jung, where are you?

67
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,829
Shoot! I'm coming.

68
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,270
Where on earth did you go?

69
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,140
Mom.

70
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,290
I'm so sad.

71
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,440
Sad about what?

72
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,500
She said she is Myeong-seong's girlfriend.

73
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,230
She's neither his younger sister nor his older sister.

74
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,660
Goodness.

75
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,290
Everyone in the neighborhood knows it. How come you've got to know it until now?

76
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,870
I am so irritated.

77
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,230
You'll be fine after frying some chicken.

78
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,900
What do you mean?

79
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,790
When I'm angry,

80
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,280
if I can keep looking at the boiling oil,

81
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,750
I can calm down a little.

82
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,430
Every time you two make me feel uneasy, that's what I do.

83
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,860
You should just go and fry the chicken.

84
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,060
Miss, what are you doing?

85
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,510
To Lucky Fish Shop.

86
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,980
Well, do you think this is a taxi?

87
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,310
I have money.

88
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,460
Soo-kwang gave it to me. He gave me the money for lunch.

89
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,120
Here.

90
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,670
Good, it's in the same direction anyway.

91
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,270
Mom.

92
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,970
Why do you give her a ride?

93
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,120
So what?

94
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,540
Hey, look around at random

95
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,180
and see if you can get 10,000 won.

96
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,460
Besides, we're neighbors. We should at least say hello to each other.

97
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,650
Oh, hello.

98
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,340
Hello, aunt.

99
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,980
Mom, you're proddingt my soft spot on purpose?

100
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,040
I am just trying to get things straight and let you give up Myeong-seong..

101
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,670
If you don't want to be dirt-poor and powerless or live on that little bastard's looks,

102
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,540
then you shouldn't look for a man like that to spend life with.

103
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,770
-Mom. -Aunt.

104
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,380
Don't scold at Soo-kwang.

105
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,220
Goodness, you two are really capable of meddling.

106
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,580
What's wrong with this woman?

107
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,680
Does she have another man except Myeong-seong?

108
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,540
I'm afriad everyone in the Seodong Market knows about him.

109
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,790
What's going on?

110
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,630
Why it's only I who don't know the situation?

111
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,350
Min Joon.

112
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,380
Do you know all along that Soo-kwang is still alive?

113
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,270
Yes.

114
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,909
Is that why you escaped?

115
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,030
I won't go back.

116
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,990
I said once I would let you live in the outside world one day.

117
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,080
That's from the bottom of my heart.

118
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,050
I'll stay by Soo-kwang's side.

119
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,030
If my dad finds out you're here,

120
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,720
Soo-kwang'll be in danger.

121
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,610
That's not what you want, is it?

122
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,470
Don't worry.

123
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,980
I'll stop it.

124
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,100
So,

125
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,710
come back

126
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,590
after you take a break outside.

127
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,980
You'll come back, right?

128
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,860
Choose whatever you want.

129
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,580
Take your pick.

130
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,020
Go ahead.

131
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,210
Seul-bi.

132
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,630
Pick whatever you want.

133
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,390
You look embarrassed.

134
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,770
Hi, Seul-bi.

135
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,870
Hey.

136
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,050
I told you not to come.

137
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,560
No.

138
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,490
I'll go where I want to go.

139
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,680
Okay.

140
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,520
Do whatever you want.

141
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,010
I'll be back soon. Stay right where you are and don't cause trouble.

142
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,210
(Seodong Market)

143
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,620
Give me this, atka mackerel of the scorpaeniformes.
(Seodong Market)

144
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,430
Give me this, atka mackerel of the scorpaeniformes.

145
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,640
Okay.

146
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,420
Soo-kwang.

147
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,910
I want two atka makerel, seafish of the scorpaeniformes and the hexagrammidae

148
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay, two atka mackerels?

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,740
Okay.

150
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,950
Choose whatever you want.

151
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,980
Go ahead.

152
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,500
Pick whatever you want.

153
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,159
Miss.

154
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,930
-Two hairtails. -Okay.

155
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:40,870
Soo-kwang.

156
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,840
That brother wants two atka makerels, seafish of the scorpaeniformes and the hexagrammidae.

157
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,810
Why are you so careless?

158
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,390
Who is it?

159
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,940
Who took my guests away?

160
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,210
Hey, sad sack Go Myeong-seong.

161
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,460
How dare you take all my regular customers away?

162
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,150
Look, these are all my regular customers.

163
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,090
Who is this sister?

164
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,480
You brother, I've been so good to you. You can't do this.

165
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,440
Boss Park, why are you here?

166
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,590
Well, this is my building.

167
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,110
Shoot, what about you, Mr. Hong?

168
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,860
I'm her brother too.

169
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,050
Is there difference between shops for customers?

170
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,860
Can't we take her customers over here?

171
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,170
No, that doesn't make sense.

172
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,030
Really?

173
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,690
Madam, who are you to yell at Soo-kwang?

174
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,630
Who's S-Soo-kwang?

175
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,409
Go Myeong-seong...

176
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:37,440
Go Myeong-seong, you...

177
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,400
Are you Soo-kwang?

178
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,429
Well...

179
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,830
Who are you?

180
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,960
Why are you making me spin with confusion?

181
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,290
And who are you?

182
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,310
Are you his wife or someone else?

183
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,720
W-Wife.

184
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,420
Why, she's nobody.

185
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,020
-So sudden... -Wife is that...

186
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,660
One whom one calls his partner after marriage.

187
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,030
Oh, that's right.

188
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,620
I'm his wife.

189
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,750
What do you want?

190
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,780
Hey, when did we ever get married?

191
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,760
It's okay.

192
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,120
We'll get married later anyway.

193
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,290
Oh,

194
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,520
be quiet.

195
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,590
You can do whatever you want. It's your business.

196
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,980
But in Seodong Market, we have our commercial ethics.

197
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,700
I've been doing business there for five years.

198
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,970
One day, all of a sudden,

199
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,970
here came a fish shop within 50 meters of my shop.

200
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,620
And it took away my old customers.

201
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,120
That's cheating, isn't it?

202
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,180
Goodness.

203
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,440
Is there such a rule?

204
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,540
No.

205
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,160
The fisheries market in Seodong Market

206
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,530
is packed with fish shops. There's one every one meter.

207
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,070
There's no such rule.

208
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,420
Don't interfere with our business.

209
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,290
Go away.

210
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,020
It's you who should go away.

211
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,500
Where did you come out of blue, little one?

212
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,030
Why are you telling me what to do?

213
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,430
Who are you yelling at?

214
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,290
Soo-kwang.

215
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,810
I'am afraid I'll have a fight with this madam.

216
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,450
I'll protect Soo-kwang.

217
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,040
-Goodness. -Chairman.

218
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,590
Hey!

219
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,210
Get out of the way! Let me have a good fight!

220
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,450
Move!

221
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,870
Do you think you can beat me with just a fly paddle?

222
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,180
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

223
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,150
A cat.

224
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,880
Does your husband have a cat?

225
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,870
Who are you?

226
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,160
What are you doing?

227
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,310
Why are you staring at me like that?

228
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,470
Move.

229
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,460
If you dare to take away my regular customers again,

230
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,300
I won't be kind to you.

231
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,050
That stubborn madam left!

232
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,820
Good for you, Seul-bi.

233
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,060
I'll prepare the fish for you.

234
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,120
Hey, Jang Geun. We've not been in contact for a long time.

235
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,760
(The flu vaccine. Starting to get inoculated.)
Hey, Jang Geun. We've not been in contact for a long time.

236
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,470
Hey, Seon Min Joon.
(The flu vaccine. Starting to get inoculated.)

237
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,130
(The flu vaccine. Starting to get inoculated.)

238
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:20,910
Didn't you forget something?
(The flu vaccine. Starting to get inoculated.)

239
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,960
Didn't you forget something?

240
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
What is it?

241
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,130
Let me ask you, who is my sister?

242
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,620
Cho Jang Kyung is your fiancee, young man..

243
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,480
She just returned to our country recently.

244
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,580
But I heard you never called her.

245
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,530
Oh, right.

246
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,770
I've been busy with work in the company lately.

247
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,770
Listen carefully.

248
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,820
On Jang Kyung's birthday, if you don't give her a surprise,

249
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,690
your future mother-in-law who is my mom would hate you.

250
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,560
Do you understand?

251
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,090
Yes.

252
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,990
You know when Jang Kyung's birthday is, right?

253
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,430
Goodness.

254
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,570
It's tomorrow.

255
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,740
It's tomorrow, young man!

256
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,650
Don't do anything wrong.

257
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,760
Okay.

258
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,370
Jang Kyung has become much prettier.

259
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,410
Thank you for the compliment.

260
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,800
Young man, talking of the devil and he comes.

261
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,040
You came just in time.

262
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,450
Brother Min-joon.

263
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Oh, I heard you came back.

264
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,200
Chairman.

265
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,510
They've not seen each other for two years. That's how he greets his fiancee.

266
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,760
He was going to see you first.

267
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,520
He must've been startled by your sudden appearance.

268
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,510
Really?

269
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,990
Did I kick away the opportunity of him surprising me?

270
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,420
Tomorrow is your birthday.

271
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,230
You still remember my birthday?

272
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,560
You don't have other dates tomorrow, right?

273
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,880
Even if I do, I'll cancel it.

274
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,130
Did you miss me?

275
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,190
The engagement

276
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,970
can be considered none existent.

277
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,210
About Seul-bi,

278
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,790
how can I lie to Jang Kyung forever?

279
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,870
There's no need to lie. I'll never mention it.

280
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,430
How could you do that?

281
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,260
How can a living person be hidden forever?

282
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,660
That girl is your lucky charm.

283
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,410
You have to hide the lucky charm so no one can see it.

284
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,610
Seul-bi is a human. How can a human be a lucky charm?

285
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,960
How can she be imprisoned forever?

286
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,580
What you're doing now

287
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,920
is a crime.

288
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,320
This is a vicious crime.

289
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,440
You...

290
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,750
You've never seen a monster, have you?

291
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,350
The longer she stays outside,

292
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,010
the more likely she becomes a monster.

293
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,070
Enough.

294
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,840
Back then...

295
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,900
Why did you do that?

296
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,550
Why didn't you just kill me?

297
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,650
Please stop looking for Seul-bi.

298
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,810
Please let her go.

299
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,520
Please!

300
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,660
Stop looking for my Seul-bi.

301
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,390

We'll contact you soon.

337
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,910
Aunt, one more bottle of soju, please.

338
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,800
Okay.

339
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,480
Is my Mi-soo okay?

340
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,110
My daughter...

341
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,750
should have grown up!

342
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,490
Mi-soo.

343
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,040
Yes... Dad.

344
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,880
That... will come to find us.

345
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,530
Dad.

346
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,250
-That will... -Dad.

347
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,750
(That will) come to us.

348
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,580
Dad!

349
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,120
Dad!

350
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,890
Dad!

351
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,160
Dad, are you okay?

352
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,640
Where did you go?

353
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,850
It's a secret.

354
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,680
What secret?

355
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,100
Take your time and eat more.

356
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,380
I'm good at business, right?

357
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,560
Just don't cause trouble.

358
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,670
I'll make a lot of money for you.

359
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,740
Hey, but you're younger than me.

360
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,210
Why do you keep calling me Soo-kwang talking to me in a way like we're equals?

361
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,370
Then what should I call you?

362
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,320
A man who is older than me yet not my brother is...

363
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,260
Uncle.

364
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,180
Hey, do I look like an uncle?

365
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,150
Then...

366
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,970
Brother.

367
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,940
Soo-kwang is fine.

368
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,170
Good, Soo-kwang. It's good.

369
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,750
I know it!

370
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,410
Prince.

371
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,870
Don't call me by that.

372
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,880
-Prince. -Don't call me by that.

373
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,580
Prince.

374
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,800
I told you not to call me by that.

375
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,320
What's wrong, Prince?

376
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
-Stop it. -Prince.

377
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,260
-I don't want to hear it. -Why?

378
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,800
-Then I'll call you Princess. -Prince.

379
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,520
Sure, Prince.

Squid, mollusk of the cephalopod and decapodiformes

Very fresh.
(Lucky Fish Shop)

384
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,850
Buy some squid.
(Lucky Fish Shop)

385
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,030
-No. -Buy some squid.

386
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,830
Where are all the guests from yesterday?

387
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,310
Don't you know where they went?

388
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,340
-Hello. -Hello.

389
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,370
I heard they were all sent to the hospital.

390
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,280
-What? -What?

391
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,290
People who bought seafood here yesterday

392
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,520
were sent to the hospital because of food poisoning.

393
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,730
Being sent to the hospital? Who went to hospital?

394
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,510
I don't know.

395
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,020
Mrs. Smile told me.

396
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,050
It's all over the market.

397
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,540
That madam was lying.

398
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,700
She is really out of line.

399
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,840
I'm going to have her apologize

400
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,460
so that she can never lie again.

401
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,290
No. She is never the kind of person who will apologize.

402
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,880
She's hot-tempered and well-connected.

403
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,340
Fighting with her might have us got kicked out of here.

404
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,570
Myeong-seong's right.

405
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,530
Don't ever think about fighting with Mrs. Smile.

406
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,640
Her name is Mrs. Smile but I've never seen her smile.

407
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,150
Then why is she called Mrs. Smile?

408
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,500
She keep on a fighting state every single day.

409
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,540
By the way, Myeong-seong.

410
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,770
The fisheries center is short of delivery stuff today.

411
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,900
Are you coming?

412
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,920
Sure. Business isn't good today anyway.

413
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,890
Hold on.

414
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,420
Seul-bi.

415
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,770
I'll be right back. Stay where you are.

416
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,970
-Let's go. -Okay.

417
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,380
Darn it.

418
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,890
Jang Kyung.

419
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,160
I have something to tell you.

420
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,400
What is it?

421
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,050
-Let's forget about our engagement... -What are we going to do??

422
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,370
We haven't taken a photo yet.

423
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,400
We should've taken it before eating.

424
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,030
Brother Min-joon, you haven't eaten yet.

425
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,410
I'll take a photo of you.

426
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,320
What do you want to say?

427
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,350
Let's break off our engagement.

428
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,420
Okay.

429
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,080
You said okay?

430
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,420
To be honest, I did it out of my mom's wish two years ago.

431
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,000
But there's no such thing now.

432
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,770
We've never officially dated.

433
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,470
I'm sorry for saying this on your birthday.

434
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,140
Compared with the gifts, this is a real surprise!

435
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,920
The worst experience in my life.

436
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,920
No...

437
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,390
It must be the best experience.

438
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,530
-The best? -Yes.

439
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,620
It's the best experience.

440
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,510
It helps my work have more depth.

441
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,490
Work?

442
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,880
I'm writing a serial novel here these days.

443
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,650
It's a fantasy novel about a chaebol family shrouded in secrets.

444
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,910
You went to study abroad after dropping out of medical school.

445
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,320
Is this what you've been doing?

446
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:03,990
Yes.

447
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,990
I'm a popular writer.

448
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,560
So...

449
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,360
there's a condition to break off our engagement.

450
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,920
Let's keep it a secret for the moment.

451
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,300
And then you'll accept my interview.

452
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,180
Interview?

453
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,010
You're the prototype of this novel.

454
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:23,890
Hello?

455
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,400
It's not hard.

456
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,390
Your room, your clothes, people around you,

457
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,060
whom you meet and what you think.

458
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,820
Just stay open and tell me what you're thinking.

459
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,040
Jang Kyung, this is a little difficult.

460
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,870
Then we won't cancel the engagement.

461
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,960
You said you were sorry.

462
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,660
Today is my birthday.

463
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,240
Okay?

464
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,770
You'll agree, right?

465
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,450
Will you accept my interview or marry me?

466
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,060
Interview.

467
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,630
Yes! Thank you, brother Min-joon.

468
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,010
I have to write the serial today. See you tomorrow.

469
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,220
Thank you for the treat today.

470
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,170
Bye.

Soo-kwang.

473

Why are you here?

474
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,380
Did you come to ask me that?

475
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,860
No, I just happen to see you.

476
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,080
Have you been here before?

477
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,310
Yes, I did.

478
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,960
When? Last Wednesday?

479
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,080
Move.

(The flu vaccine. Starting to get inoculated.)

481
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,150
Oh, sister, what are you doing here?

482
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,720
What did Min Joon give you?

483
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,800
Let me see. Where is it?

484
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,520
Let me have a look at the high standard of the lady of the Jinhua Group.

485
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,850
Be quiet.

486
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:37,840
-Brother. -Uh.

487
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,710
Among your friends, isn't there a scholarship student from Jinhua Group?

488
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,160
He's the top student of the Department of Economics and Management at Korea University.

489
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,220
Well, is he Soo-kwang?

490
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,980
Yes, that's him.

491

Hey, he's dead.
(Emergency Medical Center)

494

Hey, he's dead.

495
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,020
He died while you were studying abroad.

496
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,830
Yes, I heard he died too.

497
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,800
But it was him.

498
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,000
I saw him talking to brother Min-joon very seriously.

499
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,550
Min-ioon, is Soo-kwang alive?

500

I just happened to see him.

501

Then why didn't he contact us?

502
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,000
Why?

503
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,320
What is he doing?

504
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,740
Where does he live?

505
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,780
Hey, Jang-geun.

506
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,740
I'm busy. I'll call you later.

507
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,030
What's up?

508
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,630
Nothing.

509
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,840
You've treated Jang Kyung well, right?

510
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,700
Yes.

511
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,480
Hey, Jang-geun.

512
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,540
Gong Soo-kwang?

513
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,270
What do you mean?

514
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,840
Okay, I'm busy right now. I'll call you later.

515
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,820
Is it this woman?

516
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,480
Who is she?

517
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,230
Why are Min-joon and uncle both busy looking for her?

518
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,280
I don't know.

519
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,010
You really don't know?

520
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,080
If you're trying to get more money from me by playing some tricks, you'll be dead.

521
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,260
I really don't know.

522
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,190
Our search team only got this photo.

523
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,350
No personal information. We're totally uninformed.

524
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,430
Is she really uncle's daughter hidden by him?

525
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,200
But I know someone who might know something about this woman.

526
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,500
Who is it?

527
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,140
This is...

528
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,320
(Holy Flame Hospital)
This is...

529
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:07,680
(Holy Flame Hospital)

530
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,640
It's been a long time.

531
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,090
Jinhua Group and Yinsheng Capital

532
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:19,240
have been taking good care of us. We're always grateful for it.

533
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,680
The hospital is a bit creepy.

534
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,770
Is it because it's a psychiatric hospital?

535
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,060
Director.

536
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,010
I'm here for something else.

537
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,560
This ward

538
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,430
is specially instructed by Chairman Seon Sam-jung.

539
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,950
Honey!

540
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,810
Honey! Honey!

541
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:01,990
(No. C-02)
Honey! Honey!

542
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:10,140
(No. C-02)

543
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,470
(No. C-02)

544
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,980
Hi.

545
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,140
Seon Dong-sik.

546
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,990
Seon Sam-jung's nephew.

547
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,980
I didn't expect you to come here.

548
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,990
That girl

549
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,250
is a lucky charm prepared by Seon Sam-jung for his son.

550
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,190
As long as he has her, his misfortune will disappear.

551
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,640
And his luck will come.

552
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,610
Everything Seon Sam-jung has

553
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,140
was achieved by that lucky charm.

554
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,920
Is that possible?

555
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:39,030
Seon Sam-jung has cherished the lucky charm so much.

556
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,640
If anyone dares to expose it,

557
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,940
they will disappear,

558
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,050
just like me.

559
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,370
I have read them all.

560
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,690
I have read them too. Damn.

561
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,220
No, Seul-bi. You can't take off your gloves.

562
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,690
-Put on your gloves. -Damn.

563
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,880
What's this?

564
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,090
What?

565
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:24,650
Ms. Min. You're locked up in a strange place.

566
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,970
There are white walls all around.

567
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,960
No, Seul-bi.

568
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,080
That's just your imagination.

569
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,940
Imagination.

570
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,739
Min-joon.

571
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:13,870
I called you.

572
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,860
What's up?

573
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,570
My father told me

574
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,040
to give this calming tea to your father.

575
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,230
Is he inside?

576
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,679
He's resting. He won't see anyone.

577
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,670
I see. I'll come another day.

578
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,670
By the way,

579
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,750
I heard about what happened to Soo-kwang.

580
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,199
Where does he live?

581
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,239
What is he doing?

582
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:43,460
I don't know either.

583
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,300
But...

584
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,980
Hasn't your father ever mentioned Soo-kwang

585
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:53,070
since then?

586
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,090
No.

587
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,880
Soo-kwang

588
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,310
has been in bad luck

589
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,470
after he met a girl here, right?

590
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,790
Yes.

591
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,190
He was supposed to be the chief secretary as soon as he joined the company,

592
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,310
but he got fired suddenly.

593
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,380
So?

594
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:12,700
What do you mean?

595
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,000
Min-joon.

596
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,930
I heard that Jinhua Group lost something important.

597
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,690
That's not true.

598
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,000
It's not a thing, but a girl?

599
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,330
If she is not important to you,

600
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,550
I can take her, right?

601
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,860
What are you doing?

602
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,160
Min-joon.

603
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,750
See you next time.

604
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,830
What happened?

605
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,370
Nothing.

606
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:22,720
Look carefully.

607
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:26,260
That's the girl the VIP is looking for.

608
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,940
There's a huge reward.

609
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,620
So hurry up. Go find her and bring her back to me.

610
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,240
Swimming crab, arthropod of Portunus, Decapoda.

611
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,770
Hairtail, seafish of Trichiuridae, Perciformes.

612
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,990
Atka makerel, seafish of Hexagrammidae, Scorpaeniformes.

613
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,170
Wow, you memorized it all?

614
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,200
You're amazing, Young-woo.

615
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,580
Young-woo, ask your mom to buy you fish.

616
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,040
-Mom. -Yes, my son.

617
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,400
What? Do you want something to eat?

618
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,270
Oh, my. Young-woo's mom.

619
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,650
Are you going to buy seafood there?

620
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:08,790
The boss of the Smile Aquatic said there are maggots in their seafood.

621
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,090
Maggot?

622
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,300
Maggot!

623
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,860
Maggot!

624
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,340
It is the larva of Diptera.

625
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,630
It's boneless and the boundary between head and feet is blurry.

626
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,350
The white, fat, and soft worm.

627
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,460
Wow, this isn't right.

628
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,210
Maggots are dirty.

629
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,480
Young-woo, there are no maggots.

630
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,770
They're going to fight.

631
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,450
Looks like they're going to have a big fight.

632
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,800
Young-woo, wait a moment. I'll be right back.

633
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,250
Oh, my low back.

634
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,380
Oh,my.

635
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,370
I've been standing for too long and my low back is killing me.

636
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,070
Honey! Kim Jung-tae!

637
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,780
Stop acting.

638
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,820
What are you doing with this money?

639
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,680
You took all the cards.

640
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,470
I don't have any cash when I talk business.

641
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,860
Shut up.

642
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,790
What cash?

643
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,020
Why do you need so much money?

644
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,530
Are you going to the kitten or the puppy again?

645
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,630
Do you know the latest trend?

646
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,940
It's very popular these days.

647
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,200
You don't know what's going on outside.

648
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,600
-This... -Enough.

649
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,380
Where are you going?

650
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,080
I should've hit him with rubber gloves.

651
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,620
One more bottle of soju, please.

652
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,830
What's wrong with you?

653
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:47,450
Stop drinking in the middle of the day.

654
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,140
If your mom finds out, she'll kick you out.

655
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:54,620
No matter how I look at the hot oil pan,

656
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,090
I can't calm down.

657
00:38:59,090 --> 00:38:59,960
What?

658
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,260
What are you doing?

659
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,200
Cat?

660
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,120
Madam.

661
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,220
What?

662
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,910
You liar!

663
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,270
We don't have any maggots.

664
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,410
Forget it if you don't.

665
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,520
Madam, are you going to keep doing this?

666
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,780
It's a foul to steal customers with lies.

667
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,820
Shut up!

668
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,800
You're the one who stole all my regular customers.

669
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,470
That's a fair competition.

670
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:47,910
In order to please the female peacock, a male peacock will compete fair and square.

671
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,560
That's why they have beautiful feathers.

672
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,220
In such a competitive environment, the harder they work,

673
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,460
the more beautiful they are.

674
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,060
What you did... It's very shameful.

675
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,500
What are you talking about?

676
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,550
What's wrong with peacock feathers?

677
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,380
You lied that we have maggots.

678
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,070
Apologize now.

679
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,790
No.

680
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:10,270
Did you say that to Myeong-seong's shop?

681
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,800
I can't stand this. Apologize.

682
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,240
Why is Eun-jung being like this?

683
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,080
If you're drunk, go home and sleep.

684
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,530
Apologize.

685
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,310
No!

686
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,120
Apologize!

687
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,830
No.

688
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:20,910
-Apologize. -I don't want to.

689
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,050
-Apologize now! -What are you doing? You little...

690
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,640
Cat?

691
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,020
Did your husband have a cat?

692
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,720
How did you know about the cat?

693
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:38,310
Did he tell you that he'd raise a cat?

694
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,710
Did he? That jerk.

695
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,230
Well...

696
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:49,310
Your girlfriend went to have a fight with Mrs. Smile.

697
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,010
-What? -They are fighting.

698
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:51,930
Over there.

699
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,600
I heard they had a fight at the fish shop.

700
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,880
I told her to stay here.

701
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,410
Where is Seul-bi?

702
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,970
My girlfriend.

703
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,590
Girlfriend?

704
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,880
How could you?

705
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,880
Why are you crying? Let's go.

706
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,380
Eun-jung, are you okay?

707
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,710
What's wrong with you?

708
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,460
We heard there was a fight. It seems nothing happened.

709
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,120
It's nothing. Boring.

710
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,700
You drank two bottles of soju in the middle of the day.

711
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,600
Seul-bi.

712
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,070
Soo-kwang.

713
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,680
The mister is gathering everyone to raise cats.

714
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,030
He'll be in big trouble.

715
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,370
Cat?

716
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:32,070
It's a round coin with a cat on it.

717
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,390
It's not real money. It's toy money.

718
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:38,010
The mister said he wanted to make a lot of money.

719
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,560
The money with a cat.

720
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,630
Are you talking about cat coins? The virtual coins.

721
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,190
Is your husband gathering everyone to invest in virtual coins?

722
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:51,480
He said that would make a lot of money.

723
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,020
He always takes money from the family.

724
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:58,460
He even asked Mr. Park and Mr. Hong.

725
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,500
They said they're going to do something together.

726
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,240
Where is your husband?

727
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,300
I know.

728
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,080
Let's go.

729
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,010
-Let's go. -Come on.

730
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:05,820
Let's go.

731
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,010
Where are we going?

732
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:10,900
Over there.

733
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,520
-Over there? -Okay.

734
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,820
Cat.

735
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:13,900
See?

736
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,300
(Cat coin)
See?

737
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,800
It looks different in color.

738
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,000
Isn't this a cat?

739
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,780
-It's a cat. -Yes.

740
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,970
But recently, there are a lot of people making money out of the virtual coins.

741
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,410
But there are a lot of people losing money.

742
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,790
Have you heard of Elon Musk?

743
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,370
What?

744
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,940
A famous American entrepreneur.

745
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,940
Do you know?

746
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,970
Elon Musk.

747
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:41,500
-Isn't he famous? -Yes.

748
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,140
Yes.

749
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,270
If he invests in it, it'll be a hit.

750
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,680
Really? Really?

751
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,540
Don't tell anyone. Everyone in the market doesn't know.

752
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,700
Do you want to raise a cat?

753
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,400
Sure.

754
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,400
-Write your name here. -Cat...

755
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,830
Stop!

756
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,380
What are you doing? We are talking here.

757
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:09,420
It is a crime to recruit investors through pyramid schemes.

758
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,250
That virtual currency company asks you to recruit investors, right?

759
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:17,050
It's illegal to sell virtual currency.

760
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,320
It's a crime of fraud to recruit new investors

761
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,190
asked by the company.

762
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,810
A pyramid scheme member

763
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,740
and the company will be punished.

764
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:28,440
-No, that... -Fraud?

765
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,130
Come on. Sit down.

766
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,400
I told you not to do it.

767
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,620
Why don't you believe me?

768
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,510
Alright.

769
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:39,580
No one has invested yet, right?

770
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,680
-No. -No, no.

771
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,180
We haven't invested yet.

772
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,240
If we stop here,

773
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,570
I'll let it go.

774
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,030
Stop it.

775
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,630
No, the cat...

776
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,080
What cat?

777
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,530
Oh, my.

778
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,710
I want to beat you up.

779
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:58,650
I'm leaving.

780
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:01,290
You hit me. You...

781
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,750
But we're going to investigate that company.

782
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,320
You're so mean.

783
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:14,250
I told you not to do it.

784
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,780
You should've helped out the shop.

785
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,250
Why are you messing around and doing useless things?

786
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,520
Why? Why?

787
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,010
Mister.

788
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,440
Take out the investment money.

789
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,830
Take all of it out!

790
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,720
Do you think it's easy to make money

791
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,650
by the virtual currency?

792
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:36,490
You scold me for not cutting sashimi in the shop.

793
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:39,760
I wanted to make money to make you happy.

794
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,950
Darn it.

795
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,730
I didn't mean that...

796
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:47,110
Did I ask you to win the lottery?

797
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,920
Or did I ask you to be rich overnight?

798
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,250
All I ask is that you come to the shop and roll up the shutters,

799
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,960
and say hello to customers.

800
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,730
I won't ask you to cut sashimi anymore.

801
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,500
Honey, your hands are beautiful...

802
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:01,210
I know it.

803
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:02,970
Let go.

804
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:07,070
You're embarrassing me in front of the investors.

805
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,540
No.

806
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,890
You guys...

807
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:11,750
Do you know investment or finance?

808
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,880
Learn about investment before meddling in other's affairs.

809
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,670
Let go.

810
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:18,680
Let's go eat.

811
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,110
Miss, thank you.

812
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,920
It's my treat

813
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,610
tonight.

814
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:32,160
No, it doesn't matter.

815
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:36,010
What's a treat?

816
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,320
Do you want to know?

817
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,070
Yes.

818
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,850
-Cheers. -Cheers.

819
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:43,470
-Bottoms up. -Bottoms up.

820
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,670
It feels so good.

821
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,640
It's bitter.

822
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,380
Hey, drink slowly.

823
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,710
You're blushing.

824
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,930
No.

825
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,300
Mrs. Smile said it's her treat.

826
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,220
So I have to accept it.

827
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,740
Seul-bi is right.

828
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,590
It's on me today.

829
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,750
Half of the regular and half of the sauce. Go get it.

830
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,590
-Eun-jung. -Yes?

831
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,480
Get half of the regular and half of the sauce.

832
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,040
And get some soju.

833
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,000
Mom, isn't it too cruel?

834
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,220
What's cruel about it?

835
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,770
Just don't take it to your heart.

836
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,830
And get some beer too.

837
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:25,920
I'm not good at it.

838
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,880
You're a good drinker.

839
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:37,280
You should smile more often.

840
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,410
Then your husband will smile to you more often.

841
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:42,160
You two can greet each other with a smile every day.

842
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,020
Like this?

843
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,580
Wow, it's pretty.

844
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,390
Stop it.

845
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,970
How did you meet each other?

846
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:54,980
It was fate.

847
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,150
My goodness.

848
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,860
Don't listen to her.

849
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:01,940
Am I right, my prince?

850
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,050
Gosh.

851
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,690
She called him a prince. So cheesy.

852
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:09,330
See how happy Myeong-seong is.

853
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,340
Miss.

854
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,470
Yes.

855
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:13,510
Myeong-seong.

856
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:15,500
No, brother-in-law.

857
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,600
What brother-in-law? We're not married.

858
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,730
What? You're going to get married.

859
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,040
Brother-in-law.

860
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,320
I'm really sorry about the fish shop.

861
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,880
I'm too ashamed to see you.

862
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,120
I'll tell all the markets merchants

863
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,490
that I lied before.

864
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:39,520
From now on,

865
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,890
let's have a friendly competition, like the peacocks.

866
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:44,540
Okay, like the peacocks.

867
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,220
Cheers.

868
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,620
Miss, brother-in-law.

869
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,220
If you need any help, come to me.

870
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,150
I'll help you.

871
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,380
Okay?

872
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,360
Yes.

873
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:55,530
(Fang's Chicken)
Yes.

874
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:57,880
Cheers!
(Fang's Chicken)

875
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,430
(Fang's Chicken)

876
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,280
-Cheers! -Cheers!
(Fang's Chicken)

877
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,000
Mrs. Smile and Go Myeong-seong didn't get along before.
(Fang's Chicken)

878
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,740
But now they become friends.
(Fang's Chicken)

879
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,200
But now they become friends.

880
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,460
That's unusual.

881
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:13,280
I heard Chief Wang covered Go Myeong-seong's high interest.

882
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,940
What's going on? What a bummer!

883
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,280
What a bummer! Let's go.

884
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,600
I won't play with them anymore.

885
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,990
The earth is spinning.

886
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,050
Soo-kwang.

887
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:30,660
Now I feel like I'm experiencing the heliocentric theory.

888
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:39,310
If those who believed in the geocentric theory were drunk,

889
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:42,580
they would immediately know that the earth is rotating.

890
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:45,460
Okay.

891
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:48,310
Stop experiencing the heliocentric theory. Look ahead. Please.

892
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,750
-Look ahead. -Right.

893
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,030
-Hey! Hey! Hey! -Oh, my!

894
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,110
Darn it.

895
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:53,810
Wine.

896
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:55,480
I can't.

897
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,440
You.

898
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,390
Come up.

899
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,370
Goodness.

900
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,450
Soo-kwang's back is so warm.

901
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:20,400
It's warm and spacious.

902
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,920
It's nice.

903
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:26,360
You are too heavy. Don't talk. So that I can focus on walking.

904
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:29,030
Soo-kwang.

905
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,470
What?

906
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:34,560
I'm so happy.

907
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,350
Okay.

908
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,950
Soo-kwang.

909
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:41,980
What?

910
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,430
It's weird.

911
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:46,600
What's weird?

912
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:53,100
What is this hot thing?

913
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,120
What is this hot thing?

914
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,940
It's gross.

915
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:27,330
Soo-kwang.

916
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:29,000
Do you need me to wash your clothes?

917
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,530
Forget it.

918
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,010
Hey!

919
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,850
Wash your hair and your face.

920
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:45,590
No, at least brush your teeth before you come out.

921
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,840
I can't stand her.

922
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:31,470
She didn't even change her clothes.

923
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:33,530
Did you wash or not?

924
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,090
Goodness.

925
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:37,840
You never listen.

926
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,480
Why did you run away?

927
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,370
What happened?

928
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,110
Hey, what's wrong?

929
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:02,270
Are you going to throw up?

930
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:03,760
Hey, wait.

931
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,800
Here, throw up here.

932
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,580
Do you want me to take you to Busan?

933
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,800
The owner of the fish shop is hooked.

934
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,510
Heart, calm down. Don't get excited.

935
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,010
Soo-kwang.

936
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,040
What's wrong?

937
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:21,790
It looks like I'm seriously ill.

938
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:22,810
What?

939
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:30,010
It's like a male kangaroo of the marsupials is bouncing around in my head.

940
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:35,710
And a giant floating jellyfish in my belly

941
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,420
is attacking me with its tentacles.

942
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,010
I can't see clearly like I'm floating on the waves.

943
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,040
I feel like I'm in the sea.

944
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,420
I can't diagnose because the symptoms are complicated.

945
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,780
But I think it's hangover.

946
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,870
Hangover?

947
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,190
Is it incurable?

948
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:57,790
Yes.

949
00:54:57,790 --> 00:54:59,210
You're in big trouble.

950
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:01,980
It's incurable. What should you do?

951
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,150
What should I do?

952
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:13,840
But I want to live happily with you.

953
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:18,830
Are you crying?

954
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:20,720
I was just kidding.

955
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,650
Kidding?

956
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,810
It's not incurable.

957
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:27,080
A hangover is a disease after you drink too much.

958
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,680
Will it go away soon?

959
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,540
Yes.

960
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,740
I made dried pollack soup.

961
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:33,150
Have some. You'll get better soon.

962
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,770
I feel better now.

963
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:46,790
Don't drink too much.

964
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,050
Well...

965
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,920
Do you remember yesterday?

966
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,710
Yes.

967
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,770
We drank soju ad beer with Mrs. Smile.

968
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:06,190
You carried me back.

969
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:08,230
And then?

970
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:09,990
And then?

971
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,370
I don't remember.

972
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:16,670
-You don't remember. -No.

973
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:18,480
By the way, did I fall asleep at home?

974
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,540
Don't drink anymore.

975
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,070
You're a bad drinker.

976
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:29,120
Soo-kwang, you're blushing.

977
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:30,910
Do you have a fever?

978
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,490
No, I don't have a fever.

979
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,200
Did I...

980
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,820
Yes, you...

981
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:45,880
I...

982
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,450
Do you remember what you did to me?

983
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:51,960
Did I throw up?

984
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,320
What?

985
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,860
I remember I vomited on your back.

986
00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:01,720
Yes, you threw up a lot.

987
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:05,890
I'm sorry.

988
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,480
(Lucky Fish Shop)

989
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:23,180
(Lucky Fish Shop)

990
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,300
Hello.

991
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,020
Soo-kwang, look.

992
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:41,250
It's a puppy, carnivora canine mammals.

993
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,820
It's so soft.

994
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:45,100
It's lost.

995
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,230
Oh, you can't take it back to the shop.

996
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:50,970
You can call the stray dog protection center to take it away.

997
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:52,260
No.

998
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:56,200
It's hard enough for me to take care of you.

999
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,950
Is my house a protection center for missing children?

1000
00:57:57,950 --> 00:57:59,800
I have to keep a lost puppy?

1001
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,760
I won't let you keep it.

1002
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,960
Then what are you going to do?

1003
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:09,060
Hey, how could you just...

1004
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,770
Kiss it.

1005
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:15,110
I didn't.

1006
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,780
Let's go.

1007
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:21,300
Goodness.

1008
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:23,850
Bye.

1009
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:29,750
Our lucky star Myeong-seong is here.

1010
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,560
Myeong-seong is here.

1011
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:34,890
His name is Soo-kwang, Soo-kwang.

1012
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:37,290
Why do you keep telling him to Soo-kwang?

1013
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:39,250
They all know me as Go Myeong-seong.

1014
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,450
Just call me Myeong-seong.

1015
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:42,280
But I like the name Soo-kwang.

1016
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,500
Soo-kwang, you're here.

1017
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,950
-Hello. -Hello.

1018
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:47,660
Hello.

1019
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,370
They are greeting me.

1020
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:05,370
The golden time to find a lost puppy is three hours.

1021
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,520
It will wander around the owner's house within 3 hours.

1022
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,810
That's why it's highly likely to be found.

1023
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:10,830
But three hours later, the puppy will walk out of the activity radius.

1024
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:13,180
The probability of finding it will decrease rapidly.

1025
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,190
13 hours and 30 minutes have passed.

1026
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,450
-24 hours... Young-woo.

1027
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:20,700
It's Jeff.

1028
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,750
So it's Young-woo's puppy.

1029
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:25,770
Where did you find it?

1030
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,260
On my way to the market.

1031
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,940
When did you start raising a dog?

1032
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,790
It's not like that.

1033
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:35,770
Young-woo's grandma sent it a few days ago. It's a gift for Young-woo.

1034
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:39,150
Dog hair was flying around in restaurants.

1035
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,660
But Young-woo always took it to the restaurant.

1036
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:44,490
We need to send the puppy back to my mom.

1037
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,320
But we can't do it.

1038
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,590
Why?

1039
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:49,890
We need to go to Busan.

1040
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:54,550
But we're delivering food to the construction site. We can't take a day off.

1041
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:56,760
We don't have anyone to send it back.

1042
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,870
Jeff wants to go home.

1043
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:03,140
I'll take it home after the shop closes.

1044
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:05,670
No. It wants to go back to grandma's home.

1045
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:08,720
If Jeff wants to go back, we should send it back.

1046
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,430
Jeff should live in the place it wants.

1047
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:16,390
Jeff, do you want to go back to Busan?

1048
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:18,160
I want to go to Busan too.

1049
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,590
Do you want me to take you to Busan?

1050
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:28,610
How about we take it to Busan?

1051
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,290
Really?

1052
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,770
We're sending Jeff back to Busan, right?

1053
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:37,830
Yes.

1054
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:47,680
Soo-kwang, look. I'm eating the wind.

1055
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,840
Hey, it's dangerous. Don't stick your head out.

1056
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,770
What are you doing? You are like a child.

1057
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:55,400
Wow. It's a cloud.

1058
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:59,530
Hey, is this something worth yelling about?

1059
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,580
Cloud.

1060
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:03,060
The bottom of the cloud is flat.

1061
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:07,190
The top is like a pile of cotton.

1062
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:10,520
When the sun shines, it will be white and dazzling.

1063
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:14,200
It's like beer foam.

1064
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,270
I want to drink.

1065
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:18,330
What did you say?

1066
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:19,210
Soo-kwang.

1067
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,680
When we get to Busan, let's drink soju and beer.

1068
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,180
Okay.

1069
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:30,150
A pile of beer.

1070
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,020
(In the next episode)

1071
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,180
He went to Busan?

1072
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,100
Why would he go there?

1073
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,200
What did you just say?

1074
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,820
I said we're looking for Seul-bi.

1075
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:14,160
I heard my dad disbanded the search team.

1076
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:14,990
Why so sudden?

1077
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:15,880
Let go of me!

1078
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,680
There's still a group of people looking for Seul-bi.

1079
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,880
What is this woman to make such a fuss?

1080
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:22,980
I'll make it up to you.

1081
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,120
Why?

1082
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,780
Did you do something to me?

1083
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:28,020
If you take her away from me,

1084
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:32,050
don't you know what I'll do?
