(Note: Chinese characters appeared in the videos, so from this episode on, Seon Il-jung's and Seon Sam-jung's names will be written as above.)

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,030
It's all my fault. Let her go please.
(Note: Chinese characters appeared in the videos, so from this episode on, Seon Il-jung's and Seon Sam-jung's names will be written as above.)

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,730
I'm so touched that I'm almost tearing up.
(Note: Chinese characters appeared in the videos, so from this episode on, Seon Il-jung's and Seon Sam-jung's names will be written as above.)

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,270
How tearful I am.
(Note: Chinese characters appeared in the videos, so from this episode on, Seon Il-jung's and Seon Sam-jung's names will be written as above.)

5
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,020
(Note: Chinese characters appeared in the videos, so from this episode on, Seon Il-jung's and Seon Sam-jung's names will be written as above.)

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,390
Soo-kwang.

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,860
Wait.

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,220
When I'm done saying, throw this out.

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,030
Throw it over there.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,590
Goodness.

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,860
Throw it over there.

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,150
Throw it now.

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,920
You could have just followed me.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,470
Why were you running around?

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,710
-OK. Let's go. -Let's go.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,200
Fire caused by the gas stove.

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,860
Mom.

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,070
-Bro. -Mom.

19
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:00,970
What's wrong?

20
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,100
My mom has to answer the phone now.

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,350
What's wrong with you, bro?

22
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,220
You won the lottery!

23
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,200
Lottery?

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,300
My home will be burnt out.

25
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,700
What's wrong?

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,220
I told you to change it into an induction cooker.

27
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,100
You have a stomachache. The IBS!

28
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,170
I... need to go to the restroom.

29
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,520
My home is on fire!

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,260
Go and have a look.

31
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:30,780
What's wrong?

32
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,670
The... restroom.

33
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,090
Soo-young, now! Throw it out!

34
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,170
What? OK. Throw it out!

35
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,650
Goodness.

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,150
Hey, who threw that brick? Wanna die?

37
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,430
Who are you, guys?

38
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,580
Tell me who threw the brick.

39
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,440
Hey, Piggy Gang!

40
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,790
-Hey piggies! -Get them!

41
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,130
You're here in time.

42
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,680
My home is on fire. I have to go back.

43
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,530
Darn it!

44
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,590
I won the lottery!

45
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,620
I can't hold it anymore. I need to go to the restroom.

46
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,740
I can't hold it anymore.

47
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,850
Excuse me, are you detectives?

48
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,829
Who are you?

49
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,850
Is he on your side?

50
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,090
No, I don't know them.

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,340
See? My hands are cursed.

52
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,650
You crazy jerk.

53
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,980
Hey, who threw the brick?

54
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,170
I don't know.

55
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,270
I did...

56
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,930
No, they were trying to catch me.

57
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,350
Good throw, Miss.

58
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,440
You bastards. You've committed enough crimes!

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,600
-Police officer! -Police officer!

60
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,650
Are you okay?

61
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,190
What?

62
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,340
In this case, you need to testify as a witness.

63
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,640
You don't have to go to the main office.

64
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,140
You just need to go to the local police station.

65
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,600
And go home once you finish the testimony.

66
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,640
(Episode 3)

67
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,140
So you met those bad guys on the street?
(Episode 3)

68
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,530
So you met those bad guys on the street?

69
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,000
You met them on the street,

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,130
and they were going to sell you out, right?

71
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,190
I see.

72
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,660
Then I'll write this in the witness statement.

73
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,490
Mr. Kim. Finish it so that they can leave soon.

74
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,090
Yes, come here please.

75
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,040
Why didn't you tell them about Chief Wang?

76
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,340
You were kidnapped by him.

77
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,800
Who's Chief Wang?

78
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,060
The person who suddenly came to help us.

79
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,510
Hey, you witch.

80
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,840
Don't forget what you just said.

81
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,630
What?

82
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,000
Because he is the one who will be good to you.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,220
What?

84
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,980
Where's Myeong-seong? Why isn't he back yet?

85
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,790
What's going on there?

86
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,620
Bvlgari’s suit, Vacheron Constantan's watch.

87
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,420
Louis Vuiddon's leather shoes.

88
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,020
He's so perfect.

89
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,750
I had those kind of clothes before.

90
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,730
Okay.

91
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,450
Before? When?

92
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,200
I used to do the counterfeits business. I know something about it.

93
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,390
The clothes he's wearing are all luxuries.

94
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,890
Even if I've never done that kind of business,

95
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,630
by looking at his rich and elegant face,

96
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,650
I can tell it, like everyone does.

97
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,640
So Seong-deok,

98
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,220
why doesn't that lady want a man who's rich,

99
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,500
but going for Go Myeong-seong instead?

100
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,250
No. Did she refuse that man to look for Go Myeong-seong?

101
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,920
You've known the answer, haven't you?

102
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,159
I'm sure this rich girl had an alliance with that rich man.

103
00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:01,480
But she finally chose to elope with a poor man.

104
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,090
She loves and elopes with a poor man?

105
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,420
Yes, I'll be right back.

106
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,210
He is so handsome!

107
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,580
Seul-bi.

108
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,900
What's your last name? Your family name.

109
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,750
Seul-bi.

110
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,670
Just Seul-bi.

111
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,650
But we can't find anything when we input Seul-bi.

112
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,040
There's no Seul-bi.

113
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,320
Why? I'm Seul-bi.

114
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,030
No, you don't have an ID.

115
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,659
And your fingerprints are not in the database.

116
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:45,890
Are you a foreigner?

117
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,680
She has been living abroad. She just came back to Korea recently.

118
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,300
She lost all her memories after an accident.

119
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,490
But you should have a passport, right?

120
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,210
Miss.

121
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,000
You don't even remember where you came from?

122
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,480
From a very far place.

123
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,890
Very far?

124
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,290
Is it America?

125
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,250
Canada?

126
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,750
Britain?

127
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,590
I need to know which country you're from

128
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,340
to contact the embassy.

129
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,700
Isn't there any way to find her family?

130
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,330
Normally, either her family comes to her,

131
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,710
or she regains her memory,

132
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,420
and says that she remembers everything.

133
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:39,290
Is there a protective facility for her to stay for a time?

134
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,750
Well, there is.

135
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,960
But there are too many homeless people in this district.

136
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,980
It's inappropriate to let a young lady live there.

137
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,080
How can you send her to a homeless protective agency?

138
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,880
Don't do that. You two seem to have a crush on each other.

139
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,700
Why don't you spend nights together?

140
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,470
Goodness.

141
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,890
Hey, take it out.

142
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,590
Why?

143
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,420
You brat.

144
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,530
What?

145
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,380
What are you doing?

146
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,800
You punk.

147
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,660
No!

148
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,830
Why should I pay them back?

149
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,990
We have to pay them back

150
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,320
to let that girl go.

151
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,980
Is she that important?

152
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,640
Why are you doing this to me for her?

153
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,110
Give it to me. Give it to me!

154
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,880
I told you I wouldn't do human trafficking.

155
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,470
Goodness.

156
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,360
Hey, Piggy. Well...

157
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:52,659
What?

158
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,010
Hey. You need to go into hiding recently.

159
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,560
Why should I?

160
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,760
Piggy and his gang were arrested by the police.

161
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,170
What?

162
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,760
Why? Why? Because of that girl?

163
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,150
Take the money and hide.

164
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,380
Throw away your phone.

165
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,220
Don't show up around here for a while.

166
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,200
What about you?

167
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,660
I need to find Hyeon-su.

168
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,080
The money, bro...

169
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,980
Just go home. Where are you going?

170
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,660
I promised Chief Wang.

171
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,820
But do you know the address?

172
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,590
I think it's around here.

173
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,429
Found it!

174
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,890
Soo-kwang, come here.

175
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,850
Hello.

176
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,860
Who are you?

177
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,230
Are you Hyeon-su?

178
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,380
Your father sent us here.

179
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,770
Soo-kwang, now! Throw it out!

180
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,070
Throw it out!

181
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,260
It's good now. Let's go.

182
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,210
Okay.

183
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,840
Dad.

184
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,550
Hyeon-su, why aren't you sleeping?

185
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,490
Go inside and sleep.

186
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,400
Did you get into a fight again?

187
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,480
No. I fell down and hit my face.

188
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,630
You hit the wall too last time, didn't you?

189
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,790
Yes, I did. Let's go in.

190
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,060
Dad, this is...

191
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,190
left by Seul-bi before her leaving.

192
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,280
What is it?

193
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,640
30,000 won.

194
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,200
She's fooling me.

195
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,780
She asked me to take this to see Beorn.

196
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,160
Beorn?

197
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,960
Yes.

198
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,590
She said we could go to the ice cream shop across Venus's headquarters tomorrow.

199
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,420
What nonsense was she talking about?

200
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,080
I'm glad she didn't get sold.

201
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,820
What?

202
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,100
What am I doing now?

203
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,180
Soo-kwang.

204
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,110
I won't go with strangers anymore.

205
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,310
I won't spend money or credit cards as well.

206
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,530
Hey, wake up.

207
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,110
Okay.

208
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,990
-In the alley today... -Yes.

209
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:18,240
Did you say "Wait" and "Throw it out" to me?

210
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,280
Well...

211
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,150
And how did you know there were detectives there?

212
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,120
Oh, that.

213
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,870
I heard the siren. Beep! Beep!

214
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,400
Didn't you hear it?

215
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,940
You didn't hear it? You must've been scared.

216
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,980
Is that so?

217
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,290
What about that?

218
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,710
When you grabbed the bad guy's hand, he suddenly said he had a stomachache.

219
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,970
And another man said he won the lottery, why?

220
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,030
Well...

221
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,850
I don't know. Maybe they're weird people.

222
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,690
I didn't do anything.

223
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,610
Hey, what's with these gloves? Why do you keep wearing them? Aren't you hot?

224
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,290
I have an ache here.

225
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,640
Oh. Wait here.

226
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,810
Okay. Okay.

227
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,760
Why are you smiling?

228
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,000
I also have a pain here. Blow it for me.

229
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,620
Don't be so dramatic. Lie down and sleep.

230
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,020
Where are you going?

231
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,230
You go to bed first.

232
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,690
What about you?

233
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,140
I'm going out for a while.

234
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,100
I'll go with you.

235
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,170
No.

236
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,770
Please don't go anywhere. Just stay here.

237
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,810
Please. Okay?

238
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,400
Okay, I won't go anywhere.

239
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,480
Just stay at your home.

240
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,940
Bye.

241
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,620
You ungrateful jerk.

242
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,160
Send the guest's child back to the guest room.

243
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,630
He attempted to kidnap the client's child.

244
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,830
Take him to the police station.

245
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,140
(Jinhua Hotel)

246
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,330
Good evening, Sir. Do you have a reservation?

247
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,330
No.

248
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,290
Is there a guest who lost her daughter in this hotel?

249
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,310
As far as I know, no one lost a kid.

250
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,540
Why don't you leave the child's name and yours.

251
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,580
I'll check and call you later.

252
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,640
She's not a kid.

253
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,200
You mobilized dozens of people, but couldn't find a girl who ran away!

254
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,930
We were frustrated too.

255
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,490
At least we need to know the information about the girl who escaped

256
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,920
before we can investigate on it.

257
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,210
Just give us a photo.

258
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,450
You don't even give us her phone number.

259
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,600
If you don't want to lose your job, find her before this week ends.

260
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,340
-Sir. -Yes?

261
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:17,550
That man asked me if there was a guest who lost her child.

262
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,450
Sir?

263
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,170
(Jinhua Hotel)

264
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,610
Hey! Get him!

265
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,220
Hey, go over there.

266
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,400
Sorry.

267
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,530
Soo-kwang.

268
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,760
Run!

269
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,820
Darn it!

270
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,090
-What's going on? -Check over there.

271
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:17,990
Director.

272
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,170
Did you see a man in a baseball cap?

273
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,490
The man with a baseball cap...

274
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,820
I think he's going that way.

275
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,110
Move!

276
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,240
Sorry.

277
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,090
Soo-kwang.

278
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,740
She brought Dr. Kang here to us.

279
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,650
She is capable.

280
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,280
Seul-bi did propose to go there, so that I could meet Dr. Kang.

281
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,750
But I'm the one who made Dr. Kang help us.

282
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,170
It's my ability.

283
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,900
Find the missing child first.

284
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,550
Is she missing?

285
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:22,270
No. She left because she felt depressed.

286
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,630
She'll come back if she feels some freedom.

287
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,140
That child...

288
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,770
can't be known to the world.

289
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,780
Dad.

290
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,390
Don't treat people as objects.

291
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,510
That's why you're always holding my mom in hand.

292
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,940
If you were holding onto her,

293
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,300
at least you should have been with her when my mom passed away.

294
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,660
Let's not talk about that.

295
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,900
Why are you laughing? Why?

296
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,110
I'm done.

297
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,300
Tell me.

298
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,820
Where is your daughter?

299
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,820
Seul-bi, where are you?

300
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,240
Seul-bi!

301
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,680
Seul-bi. Where are you?

302
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,180
Seul-bi!

303
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,320
Seul-bi.

304
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,630
Seul-bi.

305
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:43,990
Seul-bi.

306
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,830
What are you doing in front of me?

307
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,530
Seul-bi told me to make her a rabbit doll.

308
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,330
Don't touch my daughter's stuff.

309
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,560
She also asked me to make gloves for her.

310
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,770
Seul-bi.

311
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,370
Seul-bi, I'll make you some gloves. Okay?

312
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,190
Seul-bi.

313
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,440
Where did Seul-bi go?

314
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,320
Seul-bi.

315
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,100
-Mom, he's here. -Yes.

316
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,220
Here he comes.

317
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,880
(Bicycle thief)

318
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,550
Yes.

319
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,620
Where's my bike?

320
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,060
Shhh.

321
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,010
Myeong-seong.

322
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,610
What Eun-joo said is not true, right?

323
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,540
You won't do that, right?

324
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,980
Which side are you on, sister?

325
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,940
Well...

326
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,560
(Pay me 200,000 won for the bike)

327
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,830
200,000 won...
(Pay me 200,000 won for the bike)

328
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,340
Ms. Fang, that bike should still be there.

329
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,780
I'll get it back.

330
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,240
(Pay me 200,000 won for the bike)

331
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,740
Mom.
(Pay me 200,000 won for the bike)

332
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,450
Mom.

333
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,140
That's ridiculous. 200,000 won? 200,000 won!

334
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,100
Stop it. That's not your bike.

335
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,800
It's 40,000 won.

336
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,840
Mom. Isn't that a used bike you bought with 40,000 won?

337
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,390
(Pay me 200,000 won for the bike)

338
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:23,400
Mr. Myeong-seong, it's okay. I'll throw it away sooner or later.
(Pay me 200,000 won for the bike)

339
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,700
Mr. Myeong-seong, it's okay. I'll throw it away sooner or later.

340
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,950
Eun-joo! Oh Eun-joo!

341
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:30,170
What were you talking about? What's wrong with you?

342
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,690
Anyway, I'll go get my bike.

343
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,710
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

344
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,240
Wait, wait, wait.

345
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,960
Mom, who is that woman? I think she came down from upstairs.

346
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,340
Did she come from the attic?

347
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,870
Yes. That's why he refused to move out.

348
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,930
Mom, my bike...

349
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,770
You said you'd charge 200,000 won and buy me one from that uncle.

350
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,510
What? You silly boy!

351
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,190
You just said

352
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,820
we bought it with 40,000 won. And you would throw it away sooner or later?

353
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,700
What's wrong with you?

354
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,910
Me? When? Did I say that?

355
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,630
Mom.

356
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,470
Is she Myeong-seong's girlfriend? They must be family, right?

357
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,580
I think they look quite alike, right?

358
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,510
-Right, Mom? -No, Mom. My bike...

359
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,040
I can't stand you two.

360
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,970
Thank goodness. No one rode it.

361
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,740
We found it!

362
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,170
What are you doing? Get on the bike.

363
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,560
-Sit? -Yes.

364
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,570
Hey, sit back. Or you'll smell fishy like I do.

365
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,090
You smell so good, Soo-kwang.

366
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,910
Let's go.

367
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,770
Seul-bi, don't take off your gloves.

368
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,310
I don't want to wear them.

369
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,100
Seul-bi, you have to wear them.

370
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,580
Don't touch anyone with bare hands. It's dangerous.

371
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,740
Why not?

372
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,960
Why can't I touch people?

373
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,540
Because it's dangerous to predict the future.

374
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,310
We can foresee the future.

375
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,400
We can stop others' misfortune and call fortunes.

376
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,390
But this misfortune will not disappear.

377
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,240
-Can't disappear? -Yes.

378
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,600
It will pile up on us.

379
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,510
So Seul-bi, remember not to take off your gloves.

380
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,950
Eun-joo, I left your bike here.

381
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,160
I'm sorry.

382
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,290
Don't worry, Myeong-seong.

383
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,180
Your sister is so beautiful.

384
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,680
I'm not his sister.

385
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,550
What?

386
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,090
Then what's your relationship?

387
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,690
Well...

388
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,130
What's wrong? Do you have a headache?

389
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:36,400
I'm hungry.

390
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,670
You didn't even serve me dinner.

391
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:46,550
I'm sorry. Let's go upstairs. I'll cook the noodles for you.

392
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,080
Ramyeon? Ramyeon!

393
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,090
Ramyeon.

394
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:59,100
What? What's with that attitude?

395
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,840
Oh, she's his older sister.

396
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,110
She must be his older sister.

397
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,030
Actually, I like instant noodles too.

398
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,570
So yummy.

399
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,290
-You took off your gloves? -Yes, I won't wear them anymore.

400
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,590
-Is this your first time eating ramyeon? -Yes.

401
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,750
You must have forgotten.

402
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,450
How could I forget this kind of yummy food?

403
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,240
-But you don't even remember your parents. -You're right.

404
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,490
Maybe I had instant noodles before, but I don't remember.

405
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,450
Did you run away from home?

406
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,100
Your parents must be worried.

407
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,540
Soo-kwang.

408
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,470
This is the first time I've ever had this kind of food.

409
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,270
It's my first time riding a bike,

410
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,270
and I've never had fried dough twists too.

411
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,690
You've been living a luxurious life, I guess.

412
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,740
The day we first met, it's my first time on a bus too.

413
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,350
-I'm sure the driver always picked you up. -It's not like that.

414
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,410
Although I don't know why you ran away from home,

415
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,160
there are a lot of people who have a hard life.

416
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,990
They're trying their best to live every day.

417
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,040
And there are many bad people in this world.

418
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,120
You don't know how to deal with human relationships.

419
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,930
So if you came out just to have fun...

420
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,490
No, that's not true!

421
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,630
I didn't come out to have fun.

422
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:21,250
Soo-kwang. Don't send me back, please.

423
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,070
Then stay here for a while. Just a temporary stay.

424
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:46,750
And for this instant noodles... You'd better not eat them in a bowl.

425
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,620
Put them on the lid.

426
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,000
Eat the noodles like this.

427
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,190
They will taste better when put on the lid.

428
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,140
If you want to make ramyeon...

429
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:13,190
-Turn on the gas valve first. -Turn on the valve.

430
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:16,730
-And then... -Oh, my.

431
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,400
Okay. What if you're done making ramyeon?

432
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,360
I'll eat it.

433
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,740
No. You have to turn off the gas.

434
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,060
Then turn off the gas valve.

435
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,500
-Make sure to turn off the valve. -Otherwise, the gas might leak and cause a fire.

436
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,090
When you do the laundry, pour the laundry detergent first.

437
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,580
-Then close the lid on the washing machine. -Close it.

438
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,240
-Press the button again. -Press the button.

439
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,850
-Do you understand? -Yes.

440
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,600
This is easier.

441
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,260
Put it in. Wait. Ding.

442
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,740
-Done. -Ding.

443
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,140
When you pour water into the rice cooker,

444
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,460
the water level

445
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,780
should be based on the quantity of the rice.

446
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,660
-I want to try it too. -Okay.

447
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,980
No. No. No.

448
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,550
Wow, it's getting hot.

449
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:00,530
Hey, you mustn't heat this up.

450
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,370
Or it'll explode.

451
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,600
Soo-kwang, run!

452
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,670
Why did he let me escape?

453
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,380
Did he think I should run away?

454
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:46,340
Why should I run away? For what?

455
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:56,920
You must know the reason, Seon Min-joon.

456
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:10,900
Min-joon, Soo Gwang died.

457
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,640
Dad, did you do it?

458
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,970
Min-joon, let's go.

459
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,460
-Dad! -Min-joon! Get out!

460
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,810
-Answer me. -Get up.

461
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,290
Answer me, Dad!

462
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,660
Soo-kwang.

463
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,800
Are you scared?

464
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:38,450
I know what happened to Ms. Min who worked here before.

465
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:45,240
What? Do you want to make me be someone who is like her?

466
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,080
Tell me. Where is Seul-bi?

467
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,400
Where is Seul-bi?

468
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,950
Where is Seul-bi?

469
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,670
Tell me. Where did that bad girl who is like a rat go?

470
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,050
Where is she?

471
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,950
Affected by negative tunnel,

472
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:17,340
(Negative tunnel caused Jinhua Hotel's stock price dropped dramatically)
Affected by negative tunnel,

473
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,730
as Jinhua Group's stock price dropped,
(Negative tunnel caused Jinhua Hotel's stock price dropped dramatically)

474
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,140
Jinhua Biotech Company was involved in to the patent infringement litigation.
(Negative tunnel caused Jinhua Hotel's stock price dropped dramatically)

475
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,420
And the litigation...
(Negative tunnel caused Jinhua Hotel's stock price dropped dramatically)

476
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,650
Chairman.

477
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,440
For what we missed in the auction, I bought it in China this time.

478
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:48,910
Did you spend so much money just buying this?

479
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,990
It's said to be effective. Should I put it in the bedroom?

480
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:56,990
No, put it in the living room.

481
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,010
Yes, Chairman.

482
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,280
Wow. What's going on?

483
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,610
It's hot. What's going on?

484
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,219
-Soo-kwang. -Hey. What are you doing?

485
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:48,770
I did what you taught me. It's weird.

486
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,150
Damn it.

487
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,710
-Did you pour a bucket of laundry detergent? -Yes.

488
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,440
I want to play soap bubbles.

489
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,290
Hello?

490
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,120
Seul-bi is smiling.

491
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,600
Let's eat first.

492
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,270
-Wipe your hands. -Right.

493
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:03,330
Look, my hands are clean and shiny.

494
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,570
You're not a kid.

495
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,290
Are soap bubbles so interesting?

496
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,910
Yes, I envy soap bubbles.

497
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:17,000
-What? -Because they can fly far.

498
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,070
Soap bubbles, balloons, paper planes,

499
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,740
and dandelions, I envy all of them.

500
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,970
Because they can all fly far away.

501
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,960
Do you want to fly far away?

502
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,930
Well, I wanted to before but I don't want to now.

503
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,880
Because I came to you.

504
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,320
Have more.

505
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,220
I'm going to eat.

506
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,800
What are you doing?

507
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,360
What?

508
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,170
-You drew. -Yes.

509
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,740
Why aren't you getting ready? What are you doing?

510
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,160
What?

511
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,030
-Aren't you going out? -I'm going out.

(Bazaar)

518
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,560
Dad, I'm going over there.

519
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,020
Hurry up.

520
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,150
Hello. You only have to pay 30,000 won to participate.

521
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,210
For toys, clothes and shoes, any categories,

522
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,260
you can take five of them.

523
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,540
Here.

524
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,700
-How much? -30,000 won.

525
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,850
Dad. Seul-bi left this for me before she left

526
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,910
What's this? 30,000 won.

527
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,320
She asked me to take this to visit Beorn.

528
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,140
It's exactly 30,000 won, right?

529
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,650
OK. Thank you.

530
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,540
-Hyeon-su, pick five pieces that you like. -Okay.

531
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:49,640
Oh, that's right. Beorn. We need to find Beorn.

532
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,390
Are you Beorn?

533
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,310
Are you Beorn?

534
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,740
Let me help you. Wait a minute.

535
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:16,480
-Ta-da. -Wow.

536
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,120
Are you Beorn?

537
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,080
No? Sorry.

538
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:28,170
Dad. I let him transform. So cool, right?

539
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,930
Wow, Hyeon-su is amazing. So cool. Wang Hyeon-su.

Hyeon-su has beautiful eyes.

00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:46,590
He looks like his mom. His mother also has beautiful eyes.

542
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:51,990
I want to treat his eyes. What do you think?

What?

551
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,150
-It's so pretty. -What do you think?

552
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,250
No, no. Go inside.

553
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,350
Why not? Get out!

554
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,850
Stay away! Don't be close!

555
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:26,990
Hold on. Hold this. It looks good on you.

556
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:30,200
-It's pretty. -Turn around.

557
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,390
It will be a breast-baring accident.

558
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,140
Her back is scantily clad, isn't it?

559
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,910
Go inside.

560
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,670
Next.

561
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,180
What do you think?

562
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:47,360
You can't wear this. No! No!

563
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,300
Next.

564
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,660
Do I look good?

565
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,450
Gosh, it's so pretty.

566
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,460
No, I'm not asking you to choose a swimsuit for her.

567
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,380
I'm asking you to choose a suit. A suit!

568
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,620
-Why are your legs so pretty? -Really?

569
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,090
Oh, I got it. You wear these.

570
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:06,550
She is shining like diamond gold.

571
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,620
How can you let her wear this?

572
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,860
Aren't you going to sell it?

573
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,130
15,000 won. 25,000 won. 40,000 won.

574
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,480
So many pretty clothes.

575
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,710
You let her wear weird clothes.

576
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,720
We didn't sell anything expensive. Go, quickly.

577
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,860
-Thank you. -Go.

578
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,900
-Hello. -It's Myeong-seong's fault.

579
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,100
-Let's go. -Let's go.

580
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,860
Goodness. It's hard to do business in front of Myeong-seong.

581
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,890
I did well, right?

582
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,460
But it's Myeong-seong who bought your goods.

583
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,020
Will your business go well today?

584
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,890
Buy my goods. I'm screwed.

585
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,040
-Hello. -Hello.

586
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,750
Good morning.

587
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,230
-Hello. -Hello.

588
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,210
-Good morning. -Yeah.

589
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,050
-What is this? -She saw it.

590
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,020
Popcorn.

591
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,600

592
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,920
Chief Wang.

593
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,570
Thank you.

594
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:09,170
-Did you find Beorn? -Yes.

595
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,510
Thank you, my son...

596
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,320
My Hyeon-su...

597
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:18,730
His eyes are getting worse because of eye cancer.

598
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,650
He can't even see his dad's face.

599
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,570
I'm afraid he'll die like his mother at such a young age.

600
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:30,150
You don't know how anxious I was.

601
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,530
But thanks to you,

602
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:36,360
he can receive treatment from the best doctor who is an expert.

603
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,500
Thank you.

604
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,550
Don't cry.

605
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:54,190
See? Chief Wang is a good person.

606
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,150
Oh my god! Chief Wang is crying.

607
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:03,070
as a person who has worked in Seodong Market for 30 years,

608
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,580
I've never seen this before.

609
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,880
The loan shark is crying.

610
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,580
What's going on? What did she do?

611
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:13,640
We might have brought someone who's more troublesome than Go Myeong-seong to this market.

612
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,410
It doesn't seem like an atmosphere that causes headache.

613
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:18,100
Seong-deok, what's wrong with you?

614
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,580
Because you have no bad temper,

615
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,150
Go Myeong-seong is unwilling to leave.

616
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,340
That's right. Be careful.

617
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,060
-Why do you always blame me? -I...

618
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,220
Damn it.

619
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:36,900
Hello, Go Myeong-seong. Take good care of Seul-bi.

620
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,670
Tell me at any time if you need any help.

621
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:45,340
For what would I need your help?

622
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:49,040
Ask him for help. You need his help.

623
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,990
Don't charge the interest, five million won, that

624
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,480
I have owed you.

625
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:02,490
Okay, I won't take your interest.

626
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:05,370
If we cut off the interest, there are...

627
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,030
Then don't charge the principal of 15 million won.

628
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:09,340
You have no conscience.

629
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,880
That will be good.

630
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,200
But I'm already grateful that I don't need to repay the interest.

631
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,670
All right. You just need to repay the principal. Take your time.

632
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:21,540
It's hot.

633
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,800
-Seul-bi, are you hot? -Yes.

634
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,170
-Do you want ice cream? -Ice cream!

635
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,000
Okay.

636
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,880
I'll treat all of you to ice cream today.

637
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,290
-What? -What?

638
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,310
What did he say?

639
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:44,490
I must have seen a ghost.

640
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:47,970
Is he still the grueling Chief Wang

641
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:51,490
all times?

642
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,400
Let me tell you a secret.

643
00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:01,500
Actually, I'm the lucky girl.

644
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:07,870
Wait, I almost believed it.

645
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,130
It's true.

646
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:11,340
Have one, please.

647
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,440
-Chief Wang, what are you doing? -What's going on?

648
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,390
Did you win the lottery?

649
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:16,470
He was crying a lot earlier.

650
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:20,640
You're right. Chief Wang can treat us too.

651
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,120
Enjoy.

652
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,590
By the way, will you increase our interest

653
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:26,400
after we finish this?

654
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,350
What are you talking about? Just eat.

655
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:31,710
-You can't do that. -Okay.

656
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:34,870
-Can we really eat this? -Eat.

657
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:37,350
-Then I'll take one. -Enjoy.

658
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:45,830
Yes, it's a big white shark of cartilaginous fish.

659
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,590
It really looks like a shark.

660
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:59,490
Oh, this shark is like that.

661
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:04,540
-Myeong-seong, have ice cream too. -Okay.

662
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,350
I told you he's Soo-kwang.

663
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:08,680
Are you Myeong-seong or Soo-kwang?

664
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,980
I don't know who I am anymore.

665
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:21,390
But it's really strange.

666
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:24,390
Why do people hate Soo-kwang?

667
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,510
Here's the thing.

668
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:31,300
Since a year ago, he showed up in Seodong Market,

669
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,500
he has created a dark history for every businessmen in the market.

670
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,620
Dark history?

671
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:44,830
First, Ms. Fang, the owner of the chicken restaurant.

672
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:47,200
She and her family.

673
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,360
It was the day when Ms. Bang's son, Eun-soo and her daughter, Eun-jeong

674
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,070
-took the final and civil servant exams separately. -Try your best. Don't be nervous.

675
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:54,710
Let's do our best.

676
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:57,500
-Fighting! -Fighting!

677
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,890
Hello, Mrs. Bang, Eun-joo. Morning, Eun-jung...

678
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,780
Oh, my porridge.

679
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:09,940
Did you drop the porridge, Myeong-seong?
(Note: Its homophonic word means screwing up)

680
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,980
Damn it.

681
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:15,290
Eun-joo failed the exam that day

682
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,900
and Eun-jung's civil servant exam failed.

683
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:23,820
Next is Boss Park, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce,

684
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:27,260
and the merchants in the market.

685
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,110
Last fall, Boss Park wanted

686
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:33,400
to make friends with people around him after a long time.

687
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,190
Ah, this score will be enough for me, if I eat this one.

688
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:37,020
-No. -No.

689
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:41,530
Oh, my. I have this Wutong.

690
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:44,190
How did you get this card after eating?

691
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:46,150
There's no light. The skin isn't enough. It needs several times more.

692
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,950
-Hello. -Come on.

693
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:51,310
This is the new chief of the police station, Director Park.

694
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:54,110
-Hello. -Hello.

695
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:57,060
-It's illegal. -It's not illegal.

696
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,790
-No. -That's not it.

697
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:05,060
Why did you bring the police?

698
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,530
Boss Park and the marketing merchants

699
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:15,080
were arrested for illegal gambling.

700
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:20,820
How is that Soo-kwang's fault?

701
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,590
It's not his fault. It's his bad luck.

702
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:30,780
Next is a decisive blow.

703
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:31,580
A blow?

704
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:35,300
Last spring, because the umbrella he had

705
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:39,270
was blown away and hung on the wire,

706
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,610
there was a power outage, which lasted two days.

707
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:52,420
That's why all the food in the market

708
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:56,400
-all rotted. -Should I throw them away?

709
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:03,280
That bad guy...

710
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:05,830
What should I do with this?

711
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,110
I really want to make Go Myeong-seong...

712
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:13,710
So? You say he brings bad luck?

713
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,230
How unreasonable!

714
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,800
Soo-kwang will become a lucky guy in the Seodong Market.

715
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,510
What's wrong with her?

716
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:31,870
I'll make you a lucky guy.

717
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,580
Our dad, Chairman Seon Ju-cheol is so narcissistic.

718
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,470
How can he start a company on his birthday?

719
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:51,160
It's so unforgettable.

720
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,270
Because of that, I, who were driven out of Jinhua

721
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:55,370
came here every anniversary.

722
00:49:55,370 --> 00:50:00,250
-You said that last year. -Let me talk about something else.

723
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:05,700
That day when there was something wrong with dad...

724
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:09,070
you took away the thing he hid, rapidly. Right?

725
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:13,320
I never took it. I was just chosen.

726
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,780
Really?

727
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,090
Even if you're right, no matter you were chosen or anything else.

728
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:21,930
I guess it doesn't work these days.

729
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:24,190
You're running the company like that.

730
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,240
-Brother. -From next year,

731
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,620
celebrate this anniversary with your employees.

732
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:37,180
Don't always celebrate on dad's birthday. It's confusing.

733
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:41,130
Nowadays, young employees don't like big events.

734
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:43,120
Do I have to be bothered by young people?

735
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:48,210
From now on, I'll help you.

736
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,470
You, a punk.

737
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,860
I guess your nightmares are getting worse.

738
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:05,830
That thing... It's just an amulet to prevent nightmares.

739
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,810
I remember our dad looked for it before.

740
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:15,310
Although I don't need it anymore.

741
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:21,070
What do you mean?

742
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:29,770
Anyway, let's toast our family's future.

743
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:31,290
Come, cheers.

744
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:46,910
They're coming!

745
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:59,120
That will come to us.

746
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,850
No, should we go there?

747
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:20,920
Dad, I'm curious about something.

748
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,080
What did Uncle rob on the day of grandpa's accident?

749
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,640
And what does that nightmare mean?

750
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,130
Is it some kind of hereditary disease in our family?

751
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:32,530
You don't need to know.

752
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:37,170
You're always like this.

753
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,830
Uncle gave Min-Joon the management rights.

754
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:42,370
But you do everything on your own.

755
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:44,620
And you call me an idler.

756
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,900
I'm still full of energy, punk.

757
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,840
Fine. You can sit on your seat steadily

758
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,600
like the British Queen.

759
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,490
What did you say, punk?

760
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:55,340
Get lost, you bastard!

761
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,750
Damn it!

762
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,210
What's it? Why are they keeping it a secret?

763
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:32,330
This looks delicious.

764
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:36,250
I want to eat this too.

765
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:41,530
I can't eat this and this. I'll buy this.

766
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:44,130
Soo-kwang, look at this.

767
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:47,480
This is an earthworm belonging to the order Ciliformis, Oligochaeta, Phylum Annelida.

768
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,950
Do you have to say that?

769
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:49,790
What?

770
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:52,360
Why do you call it such a complicated academic name, which is difficult to remember?

771
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,460
An earthworm is an earthworm.

772
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,590
I think if I call them by their names with sincerity,

773
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:58,920
maybe I can meet them.

774
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,710
Oh, really?

775
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:06,330
Yes. I want to meet all of things in the world.

776
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:08,600
Buy it.

777
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,830
Oh yeah!

778
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,380
(Samsam Supermarket)

779
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:34,530
Come on. We're going to add saury today and green onions.

780
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:36,410
Thank you.

781
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:37,760
It looks delicious.

782
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:41,200
Wait.

783
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,210
We are out of gas.

784
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:46,710
-I'll get it right away. -Okay.

785
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:47,830
Wait for me.

786
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,750
No, I'm going too.

787
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,100
Why are you here?

788
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,130
Soo-kwang.

789
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:29,430
Don't call that name.

790
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:33,770
-Soo-kwang, I... -Gong Soo-kwang died two years ago.

791
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:37,000
What did you do back then?

792
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:41,470
Please let me see Min-Joon. I'm Min Joon's...

793
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:49,750
Hey, I'm Min-Joon's friend. I'm Gong Soo-kwang.

794
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:52,470
Min-Joon.

795
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:58,670
I was locked up too.

796
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:01,170
I had no idea what happened to you.

797
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,450
The Gong Soo-kwang you're looking for is gone.

798
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:09,360
So, let's never meet again.

799
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,630
Wait for me.

800
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:37,380
Wow, it tastes amazing.

801
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,250
Try it. I'll get it for you.

802
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,780
I'll get you some saury.

803
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,410
Here.

804
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:47,420
Eat up.

805
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,290
I need to try this saury.

806
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,460
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

807
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,830
It's delicious.

808
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:16,550
What are you doing?

809
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:19,490
From now on, I'm going to help at the fish shop.

810
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:20,160
All of a sudden?

811
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:20,770
Why?

812
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,180
Why do you think?

813
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:25,220
I told you I want to make you be a lucky man.

814
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:30,040
Don't say If I could bring you some decapoda longcauda arthropods for no reason.

815
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,170
You will drive away our customers.

816
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:34,530
Just stay at home comfortably.

817
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:37,810
No, I know how to do business.

818
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:39,540
What should we do?

819
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,150
Choose whatever you want.

820
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:43,960
Buy one and get one free. If you want, you can get me, too.

821
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,490
Hello?

822
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:46,150
What?

823
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:48,270
What's wrong with you? Why did you have to learn this?

824
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:50,570
I'm told that we'll attract a lot of customers by doing this.

825
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:53,580
Let's start with common sense. Think about it.

826
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,280
Sentence like "if you want, you can get me, too"

827
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,280
is like selling you for money,

828
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,180
right?

829
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,840
That's what Pi Dae Shik did to you.

830
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,350
Does that mean the uncle in the clothing store is a bad guy?

831
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,580
No. He was just joking.

832
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:09,450
Then I can also joke.

833
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:09,500
Choose whatever you want.

834
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,910
(Seodong Market)
Choose whatever you want.

835
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:11,900
Choose whatever you want.

836
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,470
We have arthropods of the family Portunidae with decapoda here.

837
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:16,800
Choose whatever you want.

838
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,770
There are marine fishes of the family Trichiidae of the order Perciformes.

839
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:22,720
There are alsomollusks in the family Octopauteidae with eight wrists.

840
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,930
-Choose whatever you want. -There are so many kinds of names.

841
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:27,120
Hey, the sentence that choose whatever you want. It's mine.

842
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,190
Why did you copy mine?

843
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:29,490
Just choose whatever you want.

844
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:32,400
Whatever.

845
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,680
How did you memorize all these?

846
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,780
Ticktock, try it.

847
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,180
Arthropods of the family Portunidae with decapoda

848
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,940
Perciformes...

849
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,070
I'm not sure.

850
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:48,180
Well done, my son.

851
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,970
Then...

852
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:52,160
What is this?

853
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,950
This is far eastern polylinaceous marine fish of the family Scorpenes.

854
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,380
Wow.

855
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,730
We should applaud.

856
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:00,120
I think I should buy one.

857
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,080
I'll take this one. What's this called? How much?

858
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,380
Okay.

859
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,290
Soo-kwang.

860
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:09,250
Two far eastern polylinaceous marine fish of the family Scorpenes.

861
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,190
Oh, two?

862
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:12,400
Okay.

863
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,650
Choose whatever you want.

864
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:16,630
Go ahead. Choose whatever you want.

865
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:18,170
Choose whatever you want.

866
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:19,610
Excuse me.

867
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:21,840
-Two hairtails. -Okay.

868
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,840
Soo-kwang.

869
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:26,660
This brother wants two marine hairtail fishes of the family Hairtail of the order Perciformes

870
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:29,340
-Okay, two hairtails. -Thank you.

871
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:30,570
Choose whatever you want.

872
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:32,540
-Go ahead. Go ahead. -Hey.

873
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,580
Did you knew what "brother" meant before?

874
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:35,640
Yes.

875
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,340
It's used to call men who are older than me.

876
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,420
Brother.

877
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,470
That's what the dictionary says.

878
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:46,710
But when I look back, he's obviously not your peer.

879
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:48,230
He doesn't look like your brother at all.

880
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,860
But when I called them brother, they buy a lot of fish.

881
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:56,840
Why are you so careless?

882
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,270
Who is it?

883
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:01,770
Who took my guest?

884
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:03,960
You're so unlucky, Go Myeong-seong.

885
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,360
How can you steal all my regular customers?

886
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:11,310
Who are you to yell at Soo-kwang, lady?

887
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:13,970
Who's Soo-kwang?

888
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,030
Go Myeong-seong...

889
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:19,520
You...

890
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,820
Are you Soo-kwang?

891
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,020
Well...

892
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,490
Who are you?

893
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:26,480
Why are you making me dizzy?

894
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,830
And who are you?

895
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:29,780
Are you his wife?

896
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:32,690
Wife?

897
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:34,350
She's nobody. Why did she suddenly...

898
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:35,590
Wife is that, right?

899
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,130
Men call her lover as wife after marriage.

900
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:38,560
Oh, that's right.

901
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:42,250
I'm his wife.

902
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:43,410
What do you want?

903
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:47,370
Hey, when did we ever get married?

904
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:48,360
It's okay.

905
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,820
We'll get married later anyway.

906
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:52,080
Oh!

907
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,160
Shut up!

908
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,540
Soo-kwang.

909
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:57,200
I'll have to fight with this lady.

910
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,890
I'll protect Soo-kwang.

911
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:01,810
-Goodness. -Chairman.

912
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:04,080
Hey!

913
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:06,960
Get out of the way! Let me fight!

914
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,130
Move!

915
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,360
Do you think you can hold me with just a fly paddle?

916
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,580
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

917
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:17,720
A kitten?

918
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:22,300
Do you have a cat?

919
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,430
Who are you?

920
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,700
(Preview of the next episode)

921
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,730
Lady.

922
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:08,850
What?

923
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:09,780
Didn't you say there was a fight?

924
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,520
I told her not to go beyond her bounds.

925
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,540
Who is this woman? Min-Joon and your dad are in a mess.

926
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:18,520
I'm not going back.

927
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,590
If my dad finds out you're here,

928
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:22,320
Soo-kwang will be in danger.

929
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,870
The back of Soo-kwang is so warm.

930
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:28,150
The longer she stays in the outside world,

931
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,240
the more she will become a monster.
