00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,720
(Episode 12)

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,750
Chairman Seon Il-jung suggested to appoint the three shareholders he recommended

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,840
as external directors during the regular shareholders' meeting next month.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,100
This time, the three external directors' term are almost ending.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,760
The board will refuse, right?

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,680
Chairman Seon Il-jung went to the court for a provisional disposition

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,340
to add the case to the agenda, so we have to agree.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,580
Then add that case to the agenda.

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,020
Since this is my brother's wish,

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,860
let's end him in the shareholders' meeting.

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,800
Before the next shareholders' meeting,

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,070
I'll pull as many people as I can to our side.

13
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,800
Do you know him?

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,130
He doesn't want to see anyone.

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,420
I don't think he wants to get involved in this.

16
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,310
I heard uncle is going to fight you head-on in the shareholders' meeting. Am I right?

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,379
He seems to be very confident.

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,790
But look at how many shares have I secured.

19
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,539
I need something reliable

20
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:12,820
that can defeat him completely.

21
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,900
How about I go to the witch's place

22
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,760
and see if we can take over Geumhwa Group?

23
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,500
Stop doing useless things.

24
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,539
Chairman, I've brought him to you.

25
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:27,330
You're here.

26
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,690
Hello, Chairman. I'm Wang Yun-ho.

27
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:40,280
Since a long time ago, that Superstar Loan is a place where I have deep feelings for.

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,700
Yes, Chairman.

29
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,310
How is it being the director?

30
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,259
I think there's a long way to go. I'll do my best.

31
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,660
Good.

32
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,750
I need someone who is responsible to replace

33
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,380
Director Choi and work for me.

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,700
Can you do it?

35
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,620
I'll do anything for you.

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,550
Then find that Director Choi who is extremely good at hiding

37
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,310
and bring him to me!

38
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,400
Yes, Chairman.

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,620
You look steady.

40
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,780
My poor dad,

41
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,770
how could you be threatened by a guy like Director Choi?

42
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,070
What do you know, brat?

43
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,840
You think I don't know?

44
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:24,650
You are really...

45
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,270
Is that something a human should do?

46
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,770
Thank you, Director Wang.

47
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,390
Yes.

48
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,730
(Director Wang. Don't worry. Everything is going well.)

49
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,840
Don't worry. Everything is going well.
(Director Wang. Don't worry. Everything is going well.)

50
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,280
Yes, he's my boss.

51
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,510
He even did this.

52
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,950
Do you know where he is now?

53
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,400
He's hiding. Eunseong Capital also seems to be finding him.

54
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,220
We have to find him first.

55
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,700
I’ll try to stop Eunseong from finding him.

56
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,170
(Be careful.)

57
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,790
Mi-soo, put the gun down! Put the gun down, Mi-soo!

58
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:56,280
No. That person deserves to die. I'll kill him myself!

59
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,660
No!

60
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,440
Mi-soo!

61
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,380
I'll go with Ms. Mi-soo.

62
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,930
Okay, let's do that.

63
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,260
Mom.

64
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,100
Mom. Mom.

65
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,200
Mom.

66
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,840
Mom, I was wrong.

67
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,110
I was wrong.

68
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,780
Mi-soo, I'm sorry.

69
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,680
Mi-soo.

70
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,690
I don't think your mother wants you to suffer like this.

71
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,940
Aunt.

72
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,300
I couldn't get out for the past 22 years.

73
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,140
I was locked up willingly.

74
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,430
The price I had to pay for my mistakes was to lock myself up.

75
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,010
Mi-soo.

76
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:42,450
But that price is on the kids again.

77
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,930
They're all innocent.

78
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,800
How can I break this endless cycle?

79
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,810
How did you break this curse?

80
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,730
Mi-soo, listen carefully.

81
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,500
If you want to save Seul-bi, you have to do this.

82
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,120
Geumhwa Group is a castle built by witches.

83
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,060
There are countless bad luck inside.

84
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,540
Seul-bi wants to clear the bad luck, so she locked herself in the castle.

85
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,170
To save Seul-bi,

86
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,320
we must destroy Geumhwa's castle completely.

87
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,570
Destroy it completely?

88
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,770
Also, what I said was very cruel.

89
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,030
But for these children.

90
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,600
You have to break this cycle.

91
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,370
I'm willing to bear everything.

92
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,330
I'll willing to bear everything.

93
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,550
You can't do this alone.

94
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,590
I don't know what you like, so I prepared a few.

95
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,720
Is there anything uncomfortable?

96
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,020
No.

97
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,860
I see.

98
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,070
Put some hydrangeas in the flower bouquet too.

99
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,360
Excuse me, please add some hydrangeas.

100
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,220
Okay.

101
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,350
Jang Kyung, what brings you here?

102
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,250
Auntie, I went to study abroad. I'm sorry I didn't come often.

103
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,310
This is my mom's favorite flower.

104
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:04,130
Auntie gave me a hairpin when I was young.

105
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,590
I still have it.

106
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,790
This.

107
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,690
You're interesting.

108
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,230
You look even more handsome when you smile.

109
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,570
Auntie, you must be happy. You have such a handsome son.

110
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:38,840
-You remember my mom likes hydrangeas? -What?

111
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,830
Yes.

112
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,890
Jang Kyung, thank you.

113
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,340
(Holy Flame Hospital)

114
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,890
Darn it.

115
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,210
It's here. It's here.

116
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,930
Damn it. It's here. It's here.

117
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,550
No. If you see your eldest son visiting you,

118
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,840
you should be energetic and think of some good advice for him.

119
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,980
Oh no, it's here.

120
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,840
Oh no, my head hurts.

121
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,370
I've been thinking about it. It's better to follow your original plan.

122
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,850
Yes. That's right.

123
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,900
I should use my trump card now.

124
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,320
Nice to meet you again.

125
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,420
Does Chairman Seon Il-jung know that you came to see me?

126
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,440
Yes.

127
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,970
Don't worry about my family.

128
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,670
I brought a lot of money today.

129
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,020
What do you want me to show you?

130
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,680
Hey, my dad is going to take over Geumhwa Group.

131
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,950
Then what can I get?

132
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,840
No.

133
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,020
When can I inherit it?

134
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,410
I don't like that wet tissue. It smells like disinfectant.

135
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,890
What smell do you like?

136
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,070
Fishy smell?

137
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:28,850
Yes.

138
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,590
You have a special preference.

139
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:35,560
I like fishy smell, the smell of fried chicken, the smell of twisted doughnuts,

140
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,750
and the smell of pancakes in the restaurant.

141
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,740
I hate the smell of mixed food.

142
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,770
Oh, it's weird.

143
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,680
What do you mean?

144
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,120
-You smell weird. -What?

145
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,590
I smell metal.

146
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:52,810
Do you know how expensive this perfume I'm wearing today?

147
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,390
Goodness.

148
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,870
I'll let you smell it.

149
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,670
Alright.

150
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,550
When can I inherit Geumhwa Group?

151
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,420
What do you mean? What are you doing?

152
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,040
I thought about it.

153
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,820
If it's Chairman Seon Il-jung, I think I can get more money.

154
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,450
So I want to adjust myself.

155
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:22,000
You must really like money.

156
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,510
-I got a call. -What?

157
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,840
(Chairman Seon Il-jung)

158
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,900
Chairman Seon Il-jung.
(Chairman Seon Il-jung)

159
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,490
Chairman Seon Il-jung.

160
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,400
My dad?

161
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,440
Hello, Chairman.

162
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,010
You should've cleaned up this place.

163
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,730
No, it's okay.

164
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,780
Why did you leave the notice here?

165
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,430
Look at this. It's so dirty!

166
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,260
This lady has completely fallen for him.

167
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,540
Mr. Jung, my mom eats two bowls of rice every meal.

168
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,920
Oh, she's fortunate.

169
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,190
Fortunate?

170
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,370
Once Ms. Bang shouts, those fortune will disappear.

171
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,480
That’s right.

172
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,750
The noise from a train is only 90 decibels.

173
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,090
But my mom's voice can reach to 100 decibels.

174
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:18,810
-Sometimes, I'll also get surprised! -You scared me.

175
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,940
But when it comes to me, she really...

176
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,590
Hyun Taen.

177
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,300
I put the notice in the first drawer.

178
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,240
My goodness. My goodness.

179
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,630
-What's wrong? -This is bad. This is bad.

180
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:35,090
-But Mr. Jung and Ms. Bang do look like a perfect match. -That's right.

181
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,180
You're talking nonsense again.

182
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,800
Hey! Hey!

183
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,650
Look at that broad shoulders, the formal wear, and the shinning look!

184
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,730
Brother-in-law.

185
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,850
-Hello. -Hello.

186
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,990
Since you work at a big company, I can't even recognize you.

187
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,150
Have you all been well?

188
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,300
The market is quiet without you and Seul-bi.

189
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,170
Bring Seul-bi with you next time.

190
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,550
-Is Seul-bi doing well? You have to treat her well. -That's right.

191
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,870
Are you really her matrilocal husband?

192
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,380
What?

193
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,200
Yes, tell us.

194
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,350
Is Seul-bi really the daughter of Geumhwa Group's chairman?

195
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,490
Mr. Jung won't tell us.

196
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,520
I searched online. They don't have a daughter.

197
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,610
Mr. Jung, you need to come with me.

198
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,520
Where?

199
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,760
Come with me. Hurry.

200
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,330
Sorry, we have to go.

201
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:24,950
What?

202
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,640
Where are you going?

203
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,500
You're leaving already?

204
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,770
An employee of a big company has a lot to do. They're very busy.

205
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,580
That's how my husband, Jung-tae is.

206
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,580
I see.

207
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,740
Who will watch the store?

208
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,250
-Rock, paper, scissors. -Paper.

209
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,430
-Rock, paper, scissors. -Paper.

210
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,990
Welcome.

211
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,130
2 kilograms of hairtail fish is 28,000 won.

212
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,630
Why are we going home?

213
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,050
Mi-soo.

214
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,150
Can I hold your hand?

215
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,250
Mi-soo.

216
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,930
You must have suffered a lot.

217
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,630
Mi-soo,

218
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,880
I was wrong.

219
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,080
I wanted to betray you before. I even wanted to betray Seul-bi.

220
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,790
I was wrong.

221
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,900
I'm sorry.

222
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,240
I'm so sorry.

223
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,339
How's Seul-bi doing?

224
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,280
Jung Hyun Taen, from now on, listen carefully.

225
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,390
The hypnosis I placed on you 20 years ago...

226
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,260
Now, I'll remove it for you.

227
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,700
This child is your daughter.

228
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,490
You love me.

229
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,090
Take me and run away.

230
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,320
Seul-bi isn't your daughter.

231
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,230
She's your daughter.

232
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,520
You love me.

233
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,370
We've never been in love.

234
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,870
Take me and run away.

235
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,850
You took me with you because you were hypnotized.

236
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,950
Nothing happened between us.

237
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,660
She said Seul-bi isn't my daughter.

238
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,300
Mr. Jung.

239
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,660
Geumhwa Group will hire a lawyer for your retrial.

240
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,120
The injustice you've suffered.

241
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,340
Geumhwa Group will testify for you.

242
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,740
Even if I give you a lot of money, it may never be enough.

243
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,390
But I'll compensate you as much as I can.

244
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,330
Seul-bi...

245
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,330
I won't see her again, right?

246
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,140
Mr. Jung, this...

247
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,900
Mi-soo gave this to you.

248
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,030
You have to do it to others, not me.

249
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,860
Soo-kwang,

250
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,870
Seul-bi made a promise to Seon Il-jung because of me.

251
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,070
A promise to show a certain someone the future.

252
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,350
Secretary Cha.

253
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,070
Secretary Cha, it's true.

254
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,820
Seul-bi went to see Chairman Seon Il-jung. She insisted on going alone...

255
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,430
Is that possible?

256
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,100
When did you start colluding with Eunseong and giving them information?

257
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,490
No, I didn’t.

258
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,630
When you took the money and did that,

259
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,870
you must've prepared yourself.

260
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,200
Secretary Cha. Secretary Cha.

261
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,150
I saw you logged in on an overseas' online gambling site. You lost a lot.

262
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,400
Since you like gambling, I'll send you there.

263
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,030
The debt collectors from the casino will come to you.

264
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,260
The people there are very rude.

265
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,540
Secretary Cha, no.

266
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,280
I'll die.

267
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,520
Please let me go.

268
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,880
Don't ever come near here again.

269
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,390
Don't tell anyone what you saw here.

270
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,740
Yes, sir.

271
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,560
I will never come here again.

272
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,020
What?

273
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,250
Seon Il-jung is still...

274
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,690
I'll go to Eunseong Capital and bring Seul-bi back.

275
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,940
Not there.

276
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,700
What?

277
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,540
You came here without me?

278
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,170
Why?

279
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:18,020
When you meet him, read his future.

280
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,180
Who will he meet? What will they talk about?

281
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,320
And whether he has any other hidden shares.

282
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,640
When will he die?

283
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,380
Why is it so quiet?

284
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,940
Is he dead? Damn it.

285
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,440
Don't come over! Don't come over!

286
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
Don't come over!

287
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,740
Ok-jin.

288
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,910
Ok-jin.

289
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,910
Help me see my future, Ok-jin.

290
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,840
What did you see?

291
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,520
What did you see?

292
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,860
She's the one who will bring me to the top of the world.

293
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,220
Dad, what do you mean?

294
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,240
Dad, your eldest son needs to take Geumhwa back.

295
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,580
So do you have any hidden shares?

296
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,850
What is in the will?

297
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,970
Think about it.

298
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,330
What? What did you see? Tell me.

299
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,550
Let go, Ok-jin.

300
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:11,040
Let go. Let go. Please.

301
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,640
Ok-jin, please let go.

302
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,760
Ok-jin?

303
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,210
Who is Ok-jin?

304
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,530
Your blood is coming.

305
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,030
The curse that binds you all your life.

306
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,180
He will take it away.

307
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,870
Oh, that curse again!

308
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,240
That curse!

309
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,570
Hey, that's not what I meant.

310
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,900
Tell me what you saw.

311
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,680
Go and meet the Chairman of Yeongjin Foundation, Eun Ok-jin.

312
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,830
Eun Ok-jin?

313
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,590
She will give you what she has.

314
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,830
Seon Il-jung!

315
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,840
You called me by my name. Are you so disrespectful now?

316
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,490
Do you feel like the whole world is under your feet?

317
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,860
Listen carefully.

318
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,180
I may have endured it until now,

319
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,650
but I won't be like this in the future.

320
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,380
I won't be so merciful anymore.

321
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,640
Merciful?

322
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,240
Giving to beggars is merciful.

323
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,150
How long do you think I'll appreciate your arrogance?

324
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,770
Not appreciation.

325
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,100
But you have to be prepared for it.

326
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,530
Gosh, you punk...

327
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,250
Dad!

328
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,620
Dad! Dad!

329
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,860
That's how your eldest son is being treated.

330
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,360
Dad, listen to me.

331
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,680
-Dad. -Let's go.

332
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,780
Can you hear me?

333
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,250
Dad, wake up!

334
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,780
Dad!

335
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,320
Hey!

336
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,390
Hey, you!

337
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,860
Is that witch more important to you

338
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,340
than your own blood, punk?

339
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,300
The Chairman of Yeongjin Foundation, Eun Ok-jin.

340
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,350
Go and find out.

341
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,360
Yes.

342
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,140
Can you tell me what happened there?

343
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,890
You can't tell anyone

344
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,130
what you saw and heard here.

345
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,860
If you tell anyone,

346
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,220
your father, Secretary Jung will disappear quietly.

347
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,880
I won't force you.

348
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:44,310
I won't let Seon Il-jung bother you again.

349
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:46,750
Why?

350
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,020
Why did you do that?

351
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,010
To me, you and Chairman Seon Il-jung are the same.

352
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,680
Seul-bi.

353
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,290
You said you'd never let him bother me again.

354
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,200
Then there's something you must know.

355
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,280
I saw the news.

356
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:59,090
The US SIG's assets will be frozen.

357
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,710
Chairman Seon Il-jung

358
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,030
has been using the investment funds for the private foundation since 2017

359
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,220
to buy Geumhwa's shares.

360
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,220
But he's giving the money he got from the new investors

361
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,250
to the previous investors.

362
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:30,090
It's like supporting a foundation with another foundation.

363
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,900
It's the way he works.

364
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,170
That's a shallow investment fraud.

365
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,660
Who's the closest to my eldest brother in the Financial Supervisory Service?

366
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,950
Director Lee.

367
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,940
He said we can meet tonight.

368
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,570
But do you think Director Lee will join our side so easily?

369
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,910
Then we should give him a reason

370
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:55,260
that's enough for him to turn against his best partner.

371
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,140
Isn't this the investment contract of US SIG's financial investment company?

372
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,880
This is what we planned to invest recently,

373
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,210
but it is pending.

374
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:15,470
Seon Il-jung will invest in this company.

375
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,750
Seul-bi!

376
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,210
What happened?

377
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,050
Are you okay?

378
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,980
It was you.

379
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,680
You're that person.

380
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,730
Seul-bi.

381
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:46,100
You will take my curse away.

382
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,580
You will take the curse away for me.

383
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,330
Soo-kwang.

384
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,860
You will take my curse away.

385
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:04,050
You will take the curse away for me.

386
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,140
Are you feeling better now?

387
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,570
Yes.

388
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,260
Let's meet my aunt tomorrow.

389
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,110
Ms. Eun Ok-jin?

390
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,720
I have to see her tomorrow.

391
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,630
Why?

392
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,330
Why do you

393
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,790
have to do this?

394
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,450
Seul-bi.

395
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,110
I can't bear to see you suffer so much.

396
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,420
I...

397
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,720
Even if I can see the future,

398
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,200
there are somethings I can't do.

399
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,750
Even if I can foresee it,

400
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,070
I can't change it.

401
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,660
So,

402
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,690
no matter how hard I try,

403
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,000
I can't stop it.

404
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,550
I have no choice.

405
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,060
Two years ago,

406
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,490
I couldn't do anything for you.

407
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,560
I hate my previous self.

408
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,960
No, Seul-bi.

409
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,449
I'm sorry.

410
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,929
I'm sorry for saying that to you.

411
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,920
It's not your fault.

412
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,510
It's not your fault, Seul-bi.

413
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,900
I'm not asking you to never take it off.

414
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,500
I just hope, at least for me,

415
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:41,449
the one... who cares about you the most,

416
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,929
please don't take it off so easily.

417
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,200
Soo-kwang, take a seat.

418
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,770
No, thanks.

419
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:07,140
I have to see Secretary Cha.

420
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,310
When you see Secretary Cha, remember to bring all the documents back.

421
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,420
Documents?

422
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,840
Investment contract.

423
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,330
Soo-kwang will take care of that.

424
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,360
It's better this way.

425
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,550
Okay.

426
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,180
Let's eat.

427
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,320
Aren't you going to the hospital?

428
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,060
You were in shock and pain yesterday, weren't you?

429
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,290
I'm fine now.

430
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,400
Did something happen when you went to see my grandpa yesterday?

431
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,480
I'll tell you later.

432
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:56,390
I'm glad you came back safely.

433
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,190
I didn't expect you to say that, dad.

434
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,820
From now on, you must go out with Secretary Gong.

435
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,460
And...

436
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:15,180
Here. Use it if you need it.

437
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,120
This is our card.

438
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:23,550
Can I use this card at will?

439
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,130
Yes.

440
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,270
Your preparation on the wedding with Jang Kyung seems to be going well.

441
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,680
Eat.

442
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,340
Secretary Cha.

443
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,680
Oh, Secretary Gong.

444
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,820
The chairman told me to give this to you.

445
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,660
It's the investment contract.

446
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,520
We need to find a way to let Seon Il-jung invest in it.

447
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:18,100
For him to take the bait, we need someone who can pretend to be his friend and get close to him.

448
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,220
I heard you know someone like that.

449
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,780
Yes, I do.

450
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,670
Nice to meet you, Chairman.

451
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,710
Long time no see.

452
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,140
You...

453
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,110
Aren't you dead?

454
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,910
My sister and I are twins.

455
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,660
What?

456
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,440
Yes, you are twins.

457
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,420
My goodness.

458
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,690
You two look so alike.

459
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,310
So...

460
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:01,500
You are the chairman of Yeongjin Foundation, who can subvert the political and economic industries with one sentence.

461
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,210
It's you, the witch.

462
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:11,360
I'm sorry, Chairman.

463
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,850
How have you been?

464
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,360
Why did you come to me?

465
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,610
There's only business between Geumhwa Group and me.

466
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:32,850
It's not easy to get over hatred that lasted for decades.

467
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,450
What do you want?

468
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,420
I'll get straight to the point.

469
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,680
I want to take back Geumhwa.

470
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,720
Please help me.

471
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,940
Why should I do that?

472
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,080
Aren't you one of the Seon family?

473
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,710
Because

474
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,870
you hate Seon Sam-jung very much.

475
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,760
The witches he caught...

476
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,950
No.

477
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,230
It's the mother and daughter.

478
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:06,810
They are related to you.

479
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,270
Am I wrong?

480
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:16,700
As long as your shares are on our side,

481
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,460
I will take Geumhwa back.

482
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,300
I'll free those poor witches...

483
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,830
No, I mean...

484
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,860
I'll free the mother and daughter.

485
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,600
Okay.

486
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:35,300
You're so straightforward.

487
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,510
On one condition.

488
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,360
This is...

489
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:51,400
This is an investment contract of

490
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,130
the US SIG, a financial investment company.

491
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:58,030
How much cash flow does Eunseong Capital have?

492
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,090
Well...

493
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,790
I'll use Geumhwa Group's shares as equity mortgage

494
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,760
to ask you to invest in SIG.

495
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:11,020
This is too much.

496
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,640
It's just sixty billion won.

497
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:20,600
I can just buy Geumhwa Group's shares with this money.

498
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,560
The shares you bought now

499
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,460
have no rights to vote at the shareholders’ meeting.

500
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,640
You're right.

501
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,780
You are willing to vote in person?

502
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:48,050
As long as you can vote for us at the shareholder's meeting, then I'll do it.

503
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,570
Thank you.

504
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:11,950
What will happen after Seon Il-jung invest in SIG?

505
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,130
The US SIG's assets...

506
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,570
will be frozen.

507
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,820
That means Seon Il-jung will have no cash flow.

508
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:23,720
Yes.

509
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,700
Then, if the investors ask for the investment funds from Seon Il-jung,

510
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,790
he'll have to sell Geumhwa Group's shares.

511
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,650
Will he sell it?

512
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:36,730
Or...

513
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,660
he will go to jail.

514
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,920
As long as Seon Sam-jung holds the shares of Geumhwa Group,

515
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,650
you can't be free, Seul-bi.

516
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,770
Geumhwa Group...

517
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,160
will collapse.

518
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,800
You...

519
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,100
You saw everything.

520
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,690
You're the most poor thing in the world.

521
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,990
I'm sorry I couldn't save you as soon as possible.

522
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,000
Since you have such incredible talent,

523
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,290
you should be free in the future.

524
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,210
Come on, drink up.

525
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,370
By the way,

526
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:42,350
why did Seul-bi ask us to get together?

527
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,930
That's right.

528
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:46,770
By the way, I saw it on the news recently that

529
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,960
Geumhwa Group is in a huge mess.

530
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,730
Is that Seul-bi family's company?

531
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,120
What happened?

532
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,470
It seems to be brothers fighting over the management right.

533
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:57,740
That company wasn't inherited by the eldest son, but the second son.

534
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,520
I heard that the eldest son wants to take back the company.

535
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,280
But I don't understand this.

536
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,900
If Seul-bi is one of the brothers' daughter,

537
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,450
what about Jung?

538
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:09,010
Jung told me

539
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:10,980
he's not Seul-bi's father.

540
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,340
-What? -What?

541
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,870
So she's not his daughter?

542
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:16,350
For the past 20 years, he thought she was his daughter?

543
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,460
I knew it. It's so obvious.

544
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,400
They don't look alike.

545
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,430
Don't you think they look alike?

546
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:24,210
She's pretty and they do look alike.

547
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,190
There she goes.

548
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,780
I think she's just confused.

549
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,000
That's why Hyun Taen seemed off

550
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,230
and closed the shop so early.

551
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,020
-Bye. -Bye.

552
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,270
Bye.

553
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:37,910
Welcome.

554
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:40,270
Oh, Soo-kwang.

555
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,800
Is everyone here?

556
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,710
Yes, they're all upstairs.

557
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:46,790
You two look good together.

558
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:50,300
Thank you.

559
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,470
Let's go, Seul-bi.

560
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,040
Okay.

561
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,450
Now my view on love has changed.

562
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,400
It's no longer going forward and never back down.

563
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,060
I'll keep going and going,

564
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,930
and never look back.

565
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:09,210
Let me get in this car.

566
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:10,460
Eun-jung.

567
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:13,010
What are you doing?

568
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,390
Okay, then.

569
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:15,910
Wow.

570
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:18,380
-One beer. -Got it. Thank you.

571
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,240
We're here.

572
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,790
Hey, Seul-bi.

573
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:23,680
-Seul-bi, come here. -Sit.

574
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,130
You've become so pretty.

575
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,300
The fish shop closed so early.

576
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,370
Jung has been a little depressed lately.

577
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,150
He closed early and went to rest.

578
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,760
By the way, Seul-bi.

579
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,820
I'm curious about something.

580
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,240
What's your relationship with Jung?

581
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,350
I'm sick of this question.

582
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:40,800
Stop asking.

583
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,690
Let's change the question.

584
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:44,470
How much does the conglomerate have?

585
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:46,300
Stop asking, Mr. Park.

586
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,250
Seong-deok, you know the answer.

587
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,790
If it is converted into seafood boxes, it will be able to pile up the 63 Building.
(Note: 63 Building is a skyscraper in Seoul.)

588
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:51,370
If it is converted into seafood boxes, it will be able to pile up the 63 Building.

589
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:54,140
That's trillions.

590
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:54,890
Ten trillion?

591
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,420
A trillion?

592
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,900
I think it's the bird that the chicken are categorized in.
(Note: One trillion and bird in Korean are homophones.)

593
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,850
I think it's the bird that the chicken are categorized in.

594
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,410
How many chicken do I have to sell to get so much money?

595
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:02,950
It's not funny.

596
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:06,340
Well... Soo-kwang, do you live with them as a matrilocal husband?

597
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,740
You are so lucky.

598
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,880
Stop making fun of me. Please.

599
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,220
Guys.

600
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,140
I called you here...

601
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,660
You want to ask for our help, right?

602
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,700
You want us to help you, right?

603
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,640
Hey, tell us. What is it?

604
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,640
We'll promise you anything.

605
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,610
What is it?

606
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,510
Why are you all so happy?

607
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:25,290
Every time you ask us for help, good things will happen.

608
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:25,920
That's right.

609
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,960
What is it?

610
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:31,260
Say it.

611
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,210
Seul-bi.

612
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:33,660
Don't worry.

613
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,440
We'll take care of it perfectly.

614
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,300
I love you.

615
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,420
Don't worry.

616
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,000
Bye.

617
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,760
We don't need anything.

618
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,100
Go. Go.

619
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:48,190
What coronation ceremony?

620
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:51,680
Well...

621
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,870
When the shareholders' meeting is over,

622
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,690
-I'll visit you then. -Come on.

623
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,450
There is nothing to congratulate.

624
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:00,740
-Thank you. -Let's have a drink sometime.

625
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,430
Min-joon?

626
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:04,800
He is totally out of the game.

627
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,140
Bye.

628
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,100
Hey!

629
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,460
Is Geumhwa Group yours now?

630
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,740
Why are you enjoying others' congratulation?

631
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,730
Dad.

632
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:16,590
My friend asked me to arrange a branch leader position for him.

633
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:18,710
Are you crazy?

634
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:19,530
Get out.

635
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:20,650
Dad.

636
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:22,260
Can't I even do this?

637
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,380
I'm the executive director of this company.

638
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,240
Did you pay the investment?

639
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,240
Don't worry. I've transferred it.

640
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,550
This game will end before the shareholders' meeting, Dad.

641
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:37,440
Those guys didn't care about me before.

642
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,750
Now they're asking me to arrange a director position of a branch company for them.

643
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,910
Damn it!

644
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:47,370
Isn't this the power of money?

645
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,980
Those jerks.

646
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:52,340
(Art Museum Director, Eun Ok-jin)
Those jerks.

647
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:56,650
(Art Museum Director, Eun Ok-jin)

648
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,500
(Chairman Eun Ok-jin. Seon Il-jung has invested in SIG.)

649
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,800
Chairman.

650
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,110
Seon Il-jung has invested in SIG.

651
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,520
Chairman.

652
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,770
I heard that US SIG's assets were frozen for failing to fulfill their debts.

653
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,250
(… SIG, a large professional financial investment company involving many listed companies in the US stock market, has been caught in the embezzlement of funds. Its assets have been frozen and the pre-sale has been suspended. The impact is constantly affecting the stock market. On the 19th, SIG’s assets of US$732 million were frozen by East Star Bank, and the authorities suspended the approval to open new investments, causing the share price of affiliated companies to plummet for two consecutive days. )

654
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:32,990
I saw the news.

655
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,670
The US SIG's assets...

656
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,470
will be frozen.

657
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:48,570
Contact those major clients who invested in Seon Il-jung's private equity fund.

658
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:49,490
Yes.

659
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,380
Request to repurchase the investment fund now.

660
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:05,460
What?

661
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:07,440
What are you talking about?

662
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,330
Why would the assets be frozen?

663
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:10,770
What do you mean?

664
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:11,560
Hey!

665
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,950
Okay, I know. Bye.

666
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:14,900
Dad.

667
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:15,920
What's going on?

668
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,210
Mr. Yeom.

669
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,480
We'll contact you after the confirmation.

670
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,510
Hey, what's going on?

671
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:26,160
The investors want to repurchase the fund.

672
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,330
Banks and securities are questioning our funds.

673
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:31,280
Whatever. Just return the money they invested.

674
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,400
But the cash flow is in US SIG.

675
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,510
It's true.

676
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:36,420
Dad.

677
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,420
SIG's assets were frozen.

678
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,720
What's going on?

679
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,660
Darn it.

680
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,190
How is this possible?

681
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,370
Darn it.

682
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:55,930
Why isn't she picking up? Gosh.

683
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:01,830
Oh, Chairman.

684
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:03,270
Well...

685
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:05,530
What's going on?

686
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:08,220
SIG's assets were frozen.

687
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:11,680
What about my money?

688
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,560
Money is not a problem.

689
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,610
Didn't you say I only have to vote for you at the shareholders' meeting?

690
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,560
But...

691
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,710
I need the money right now.

692
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,740
If you are in need of money right now,

693
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,870
you have to raise money somewhere else.

694
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:30,230
Chairman, but still...

695
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:38,170
You wanted to take Geumhwa back with just sixty billion won. You should be able to handle this.

696
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:42,400
Humans are too greedy and stupid.

697
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:42,930
No!

698
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:44,130
Hello. Chairman.

699
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:46,340
Hello? Hello? Hello?

700
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,690
Darn it.

701
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:04,170
Go and meet Ms. Eun Ok-jin, the chairman of Yeongjin Foundation.

702
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:08,160
Hey.

703
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,240
That witch. That little witch.

704
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:13,910
That bitch!

705
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,540
How dare she mess with me.

706
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,650
Damn it.

707
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:19,380
Bring that bitch here right now!

708
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,490
How?

709
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:21,870
She's at Geumhwa Hotel.

710
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:23,970
Shut up, you brat.

711
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:27,510
Hurry up. At least get Secretary Jung.

712
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,480
Darn it.

713
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:34,280
How dare she mess with me?

714
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:44,290
My gosh, handsome guys.

715
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:45,430
Do you want to buy a suit?

716
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:46,820
A suit?

717
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,070
Where's Jung Hyun Taen?

718
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:49,050
(Pay me back! You thief! Pay me back!)

719
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,250
What?
(Pay me back! You thief! Pay me back!)

720
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:50,920
What's going on? Who are you?
(Pay me back! You thief! Pay me back!)

721
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,950
What's going on? Who are you?

722
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:52,930
Are you looking for Jung Hyun Taen?

723
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:54,050
Do you know Jung Hyun Taen?

724
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:55,500
Where is Jung Hyun Taen? Damn it!

725
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,000
Excuse me.

726
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:57,210
I'm the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

727
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,650
(Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce)
I'm the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

728
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:02,510
The merchants will be in panic seeing you guys come here like this.

729
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:06,790
Jung Hyun Taen whose working here... Where is he now?

730
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,590
Jung Hyun Taen.

731
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:09,800
Oh, my!

732
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,030
Jung!

733
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:15,920
Well... he took all of our merchants' money and ran away.

734
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,280
Gosh.

735
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,140
Hey.

736
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,760
Are you on his side?

737
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,590
I think you're very weird.

738
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,990
I've seen him there before

739
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,070
at Superstar Loan's office.

740
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:26,930
Don't you remember?

741
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:27,450
Oh, my!

742
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:28,210
-Oh, my. -That's right.

743
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:28,990
It's him.

744
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:30,080
Oh, my!

745
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,950
I'm the mackerel madam. Don't you remember me?

746
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:34,120
That bastard stole all my savings.

747
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,510
Find him for me.

748
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,250
Bring my one million won back to me.

749
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,210
Aren't you the professionals on this?

750
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:41,380
-Professionals. -My money! My money! My money!

751
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:41,900
My money!

752
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,150
We got cheated too.

753
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:44,960
Please get our money back for us, mister.

754
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,090
My losses are the worst.

755
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,200
We will not let it go.

756
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,830
Let's call the police together.

757
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:50,350
-Okay. Let's call the police. -Let's...

758
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:51,680
Call the police.

759
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,090
-Call the police! -Jung Hyun Taen!

760
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:54,990
-Oh, my. -Oh, my.

761
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:57,110
Did you find Hyun Taen?

762
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,390
Hyun Taen.

763
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,920
Please find my Hyun Taen.

764
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,320
I don't need any deed or money.

765
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,710
Please bring him back to me.

766
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,980
-Don't be like this. -Please find my Hyun Taen.

767
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,940
-Hey! Hey! -Madam.

768
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,750
Don't be like this.

769
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:13,680
-Handsome. -Hey.

770
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,500
-Please help us. -Don't go.

771
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,780
Please help us.

772
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,460
He is gone.

773
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,990
Perfect.

774
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:25,120
Did we do what Seul-bi asked us to do?

775
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,300
-Of course. -Seul-bi asked it. Of course we can do it.

776
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,540
Oh, my, Ms. Bang is such a great actress.

777
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,410
Darn it.

778
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,200
Why do they keep calling me?

779
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:45,440
Goodness.

780
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,830
What now?

781
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:50,130
-We lost all our money. -Damn it.

782
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,510
I'm going to kill them.

783
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:57,220
Those bastards!

784
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,700
That witch...

785
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,790
That bitch!

786
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:03,950
And her father! I'm going to kill them all!

787
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:05,920
Chairman.

788
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:10,500
We can't find Secretary Jung.

789
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,860
Darn it.

790
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,240
Get out! Damn you!

791
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,240
Get out!

792
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,200
Who are you?

793
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,070
We are from the No. 6 Criminal Division of Northern Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

794
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:26,290
Prosecutors?

795
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:28,000
Why are you detaining us?

796
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,210
The Northern Prosecutors' Office?

797
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:30,650
Fund fraud.

798
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:31,700
Investment fraud.

799
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,690
Inside-market trade.

800
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:35,210
Dad, the Financial Supervisory Service has sued you for these.

801
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:36,410
What are you talking about?

802
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:38,220
Make it simple, brat.

803
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,760
In a word, you're screwed.

804
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,310
Move.

805
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:45,700
Gosh.

806
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,770
Wait.

807
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,980
Director Lee.

808
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,880
I'm Seon Il-jung from Eunseong.

809
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:58,990
No, Director Lee.

810
00:55:58,990 --> 00:55:59,920
Hello?

811
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:12,120
Ah, Minister Kim.

812
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,870
I'm Seon Il-jung.

813
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,370
If you refuse to be summoned without a proper reason,

814
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:21,930
we may conduct a forced investigation.

815
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:24,120
Please cooperate.

816
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,430
-Dad! -Chairman!

817
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,350
Dad!

818
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:35,240
Chairman!

819
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,190
-My blood pressure. -Dad!

820
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:38,040
Chairman!

821
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:38,590
Dad!

822
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,740
-Dad, what's wrong with you? -Chairman!

823
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,900
Dad!

824
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,010
-Chairman! -Dad!

825
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:43,530
Chairman!

826
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:44,400
Dad!

827
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:47,780
Ambulance. Ambulance.

828
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,510
Call an ambulance!

829
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:50,660
Call an ambulance!

830
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,840
-Call an ambulance! Your jerk! -Ambulance!

831
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,650
Dad!

832
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:56,110
Call it now!

833
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:56,470
(Eunseong Capital)
Call it now!

834
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:59,010
(Eunseong Capital)

835
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:08,710
The show is on. Now it’s your turn, Director Lee.

836
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,650
Okay, thank you.

837
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:16,990
This is great, Chairman.

838
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:18,620
We protected Geumhwa.

839
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,140
This way, the shareholders will unanimously vote against Seon Il-jung's appointment as an external director.

840
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:29,140
Thank you, Secretary Gong.

841
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:09,240
Thank you for saving me from Seon Il-jung.

842
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:13,510
Dad.

843
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,130
Dad?

844
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,400
You know I'm not your dad.

845
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:27,540
I just want to call you dad.

846
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,190
You've been supporting me for 20 years.

847
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:37,500
For 20 years,

848
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,940
I thought I have a daughter.

849
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:48,220
When I get out, I will go see my daughter.

850
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,340
How pretty would she be?

851
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,890
How beautiful would she be?

852
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,880
I lived every day by thinking about these.

853
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:12,190
Thank you for letting me be your dad during this period of time.

854
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:33,430
You'll have a wife

855
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:36,030
and have children.

856
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,210
You will have a happy and sweet family.

857
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:45,450
I'm not young anymore. How can I have a wife and children?

858
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:52,180
But it's you who said it, it makes me feel like it's possible.

859
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:51,000
(In the next episode)

860
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,280
Seul-bi.

861
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,440
If you saw Min-joon's future and

862
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,050
you still decided to stay by his side,

863
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:59,390
I think there must be a reason.

864
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:01,680
The curse won't disappear.

865
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,320
It won't disappear, but it will be transferred.

866
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,460
It will be passed down through generations.

867
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,920
I've sent someone to look for her. There will be news soon.

868
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,530
Make sure to keep her alive and bring her to me.

869
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:14,780
I always felt bad for my mom.

870
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,340
But now...

871
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,050
I feel sorry for myself.
