(Superstar Loan Episode 11)

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,720
What are you carrying? It's so heavy.

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,210
You brought everything here.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,860
It would be pity to
(Note: The formal language is used here)

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,180
throw them away. These are important things.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,760
Boss told me to keep them safe.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,450
How important can these be?

8
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,180
I have a favor to ask.

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:41,050
Give the toys your secretary brought to Soo-kwang. Please.

10
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,520
No.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,380
-Why did you take it? Give it to me. -Don't touch it.

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,980
Hello, sir.

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,630
What kind of office is this?

14
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,530
I thought Superstar Loan is rich.

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,140
I didn't expect the office to be this small.

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,720
Yes. What brings you here?

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,060
Have a seat, please.

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,820
Coffee. Get the coffee.

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,840
Coffee. OK.

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,050
Bring me all the files your former CEO had.

21
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,060
Files?

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,240
-USB. -USB?

23
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,090
Is that all?

24
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,650
I brought them all. But I haven't sorted them out yet.

(Debt Collection Agency)

26
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,289
-This is the office. -Anyone here?
(Debt Collection Agency)

27
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:27,830
-This is the office. -Anyone here?

28
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:32,090
Mr. Wang. No. Director Wang.

29
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,660
You're already the director. But the office is still the same.

30
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,390
But he has a female secretary now.

31
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,360
Where should I put this?

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,110
Here.

33
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,390
-No, it should be put on the desk. -It looks good there.

34
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,060
Why are you all here?

35
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,170
We're here to congratulate you on becoming the director.

36
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,630
Seul-bi asked us to buy you gifts and congratulate you today.

37
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,580
-Seul-bi? -Yes.

38
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,560
That's why we went too far.

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,240
You're the director, we should have given you the gifts.

40
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,910
I'm sorry, Mr. Wang.

41
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,600
Congratulations on becoming the director.

42
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,890
-This is the fried chicken. Enjoy it. -Thank you.

43
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,560
Thank you, everyone.

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,720
This looks great on you.

45
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,140
Good.

46
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,450
I think I put too much ice in it.

47
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,180
Why did you put the fresh here? It's fishy.

48
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,120
My goodness. You scared me.

49
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,380
Where else should I put it? Into the sea?

50
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,550
You old woman. Do you know who this is?

51
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,000
Who are you?

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,770
-Are you here to borrow money? -Me?

53
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,720
Wait. I think I've seen him somewhere.

54
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,640
Where? Where?

55
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,450
-Oh. -You scared me.

56
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,510
-Soo-kwang's friend. -What? He's Soo-kwang's friend?

57
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,860
We're doing business in the same market with Soo-kwang.

58
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,080
He's Soo-kwang's friend.

59
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,770
But he's the son of the boss of Superstar Loan.
He's a big shot.

60
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:14,530
-Look at his big hands. -His hands are big.

61
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,530
This is our new fried chicken. Try it. It's delicious.

62
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,440
If the ice melts, the fresh things won't be fresh.

63
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,060
Where's the fridge, Mr. Wang?

64
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,820
Fridge? The fridge is broken.

65
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,900
What should we do then?

66
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,690
It's very expensive and sensitive to temperature.

67
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,430
Why don't you take this home now?

68
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,010
Goodness.

69
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,980
-Oh no. -Shit. What are you doing?

70
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,860
-Damn it. Did you take everything? -Yes.

71
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,440
Let's go.

72
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,600
Hey, don't step on it.

73
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,720
Darn it.

74
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,770
What a waste.

75
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,680
He's different from Soo-kwang. He's so cold.

76
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,640
He's too much. He has no manners.

77
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,700
What's all this?

78
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,010
Let's meet Jang Kyung together.

79
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,390
Why do you bring me with you?

80
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,200
Jang Kyung likes you. She asks me to take you.

81
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,420
But I don't need new clothes.

82
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,540
But you can't meet her with the one you bought at the market, right?

83
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,410
This one is pretty too. I bought it from Mr. Hong.

84
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,010
Seul-bi. I am not happy with your going there frequently.

85
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,960
I just meet the people in the market.

86
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,750
Am I not good enough to you?

87
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,560
No, Min-joon. You've been so nice to me.

88
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,090
Then tell me wherever you go.

89
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,260
-And bring the bodyguards with you. -Okay.

90
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,659
And this.

91
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,040
I have a phone.

92
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,270
Use mine.

93
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,320
Yours is paid by Soo-kwang, right?

94
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,400
Do you still want to trouble him?

95
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,520
Seul-bi. Do you want to leave here now?

96
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:36,670
Mom. How can we be happier?

97
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,390
If you're happy, I'm happy, Seul-bi.

98
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,830
But I thought about it in the outside world.

99
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:51,620
Not only you, but also Uncle Jung is not happy.

100
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,570
Everyone is unhappy, but I'm the only one...

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,330
I can't just make myself happy.

102
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,710
Seul-bi.

103
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,150
Mom. I'll find a way to make everyone happy.

104
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,120
That way, I can be happy too.

105
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,600
Mom, I found this person.

(Eun Ok-jin Seoul Folk Culture Museum)

107
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,159
Your aunt Ok-jin...

108
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,330
went to a good place.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,700
When you reach the outside world, you must contact her.

(Soo-kwang)

111
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:24,970
-Soo-kwang. Soo-kwang. -Hi.

112
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,510
Hey, I was almost frighten to death

113
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,910
because of this.

114
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,550
What is this?

115
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,380
Seul-bi told me

116
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,950
to give you the toys my secretary brought.

117
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,700
-Seul-bi told you? -Yes.

118
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,300
I think it should be this.

119
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,220
Oh, it's a USB.

120
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,070
I knew it. This was with the other USBs.

121
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,210
Gosh.

122
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,320
What a pity. The view of the love seats is better.

123
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,660
Sorry. I didn't know this was your date.

124
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:19,050
It's okay. It's nice to have a twist like this.

125
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,740
Oh, by the way, I am reading your novel.

126
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,910
Really?

127
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,560
Yes, it's really fun.

128
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,600
What about the male lead in the novel?

129
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,120
I tried to make it look like Min-joon.

130
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,600
Very handsome.

131
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,850
Right?

132
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,250
I chose the right person.

133
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,309
But my writing isn't going well lately.

134
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:42,870
So I wanted to interview Min-joon.

135
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,270
But he has always been busy.

136
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,960
Seul-bi. How about I interview you?

137
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,660
What's your room number?

138
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,720
I live in a very special place.

139
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Is there such a place in Geumhwa Hotel? Which floor?

140
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,450
Jang Kyung. I think I should also read your novel some time.

141
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,730
To get to my room...

142
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:10,310
You need to go through a place that is full of noise and iron smell,

143
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,000
and follow the gloomy and quiet corridor...

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,900
Seul-bi.

145
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,620
What? I'm really curious. I'd like to see.

146
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,940
-Do you want to go? -Sure.

147
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,760
No.

148
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,230
I want to go to Seul-bi's room.

149
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,980
Do I need your permission?

150
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,040
Seul-bi is just kidding. There's no place like that.

151
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,460
Have you done? Let's go.

152
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,810
I haven't eaten yet. Why are you being like this?

153
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,480
-Did you bring her to see Jang Kyung? -Yes.

154
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,670
What are you thinking?

155
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,520
Jang Kyung knows Seul-bi. So don't get so worked up.

156
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,710
Jang Kyung knows Seul-bi. Then how did you introduce Seul-bi?

157
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,100
The kid who was hiding at home?

158
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,670
I said she's the woman I like.

159
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,460
You are trying to destroy us all.

160
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,810
Our family is a mess already.

161
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,650
Seul-bi, let's go.

162
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,370
Min-jun. I'd like to talk to Seul-bi alone.

163
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,500
Can you leave first?

164
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,410
Okay.

165
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,890
Can you let me...

166
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:25,960
meet him? That Soo-kwang.

167
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,520
Mom, I broke up with Soo-kwang.

168
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,910
No. You still have contacts.

169
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,580
Since long time ago, you two have been connected with an invisible strong link.

170
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,660
Goodness.

171
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,480
Gosh.

172
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,080
It's okay. Just leave it. I'll clean it up later.

173
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,320
No, I really...

174
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:10,090
Why is Mi-soo's photo here?

175
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,860
What?

176
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,840
Oh, this photo.

177
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,180
I took this photo when I was young.

178
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,310
But I can't remember who the woman in the photo is.

179
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,470
Soo-kwang. Gong Soo-kwang.

180
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,180
Is this kid you?

181
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,860
This woman is Seul-bi's mother.

182
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,590
What? Why we took a photo together?

183
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,530
Does she know me?

184
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,480
Who are you?

185
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,990
Soo-kwang. Where are you heading for in the early morning?

186
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:21,450
After we escaped from Chairman Seon Ju-cheol's house,

187
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,500
your mother took us in.

188
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,490
A long time ago? When?

189
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,900
Thank you. You helped us a lot.

190
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,400
It's okay. Enjoy.

191
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,630
What's your name?

192
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,860
Soo-kwang. Gong Soo-kwang.

193
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,000
Soo-kwang, what are you doing?

194
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,350
I'm greeting the baby.

195
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,860
Baby?

196
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,130
Yes, she's cute.

197
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,190
Hello, baby.

198
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,420
What's wrong with you, Soo-kwang?

199
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,470
Thank you.

200
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,580
Soo-kwang, thank you.

201
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,140
I've seen Soo-kwang

202
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,880
and his mother long ago.

203
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,180
I couldn't even say goodbye to your mother before we left.

204
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,980
I was stupid and cheated by Seon Ju-cheol.

205
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,700
I brought Mi-soo back to him.

206
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,420
How long do you think you can escape?

207
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,900
I know you're an ambitious man.

208
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,640
Tell me what you want.

209
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,000
Okay.

210
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,350
-Send Go Sang-cheol there. -Yes, sir.

211
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,040
Mi-soo, we have to go.

212
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,510
Why are you here?

213
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,660
Where's the chairman?

214
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,890
You should have been clear about the reason Chairman Seon sent me here.

215
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,550
Seon Ju-cheol, you lied to me.

216
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,200
Let's go.

217
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,810
Let go of me!

218
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,640
Let go of me!

219
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,570
Let go of me!

220
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,650
Let go of me!

221
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,020
Let go of me!

222
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,790
I was blinded by money.

223
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,090
I can't believe I gave up the woman who truly trusted me...

224
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,410
Seon Joo-chul took Mi-soo, and put the blame on me.

225
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,890
And there was more than one crime.

226
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,900
I was also accused of embezzling company's fund and attempted murder.

227
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,360
But fortunately, I survived.

228
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,620
I almost died because of your dad.

229
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,120
My dad?

230
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,540
No, no.

231
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,990
I'm talking nonsense again.

232
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,280
I need some fresh air.

233
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,410
You're the most important to me.

234
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,240
The wind is cooler.

235
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,680
Seul-bi.

236
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,240
Do you remember what I said before?

237
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,440
I said I wanted to be your boyfriend.

238
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,740
No.

239
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,380
Min-joon, don't do this.

240
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,430
I'm sorry.

241
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,130
If you don't like, I won't do this again.

242
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,900
Who is he?

243
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,580
Does that matter?

244
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,150
Sir, I should at least know whom I am going to kill.

245
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,340
Gong Soo-kwang.

246
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,090
He is the one who joins Geumhwa Group with the first place.

247
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,580
Okay.

248
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,970
Make sure to handle it properly.

249
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,480
Yes, sir.

250
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,530
Darn it. This isn't right either.

251
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,760
Hey!

252
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,620
None of these is correct.

253
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,410
None of them!

254
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:19,260
You didn't even take a look before handing them in?

255
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,540
I'm looking for the video Mr. Choi mentioned.

256
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,120
The video he recorded!

257
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,680
I think he has hidden with the video.

258
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,020
No way. Then you should've found him and brought him to me,

259
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,860
instead of standing here like a fool.

260
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:46,800
Thanks to me, I made you, a street vendor prosperous.

261
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:52,440
How dare you bite the owner back?

262
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,290
Were you the one who were hired

263
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,570
to kill me two years ago?

264
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,580
You heard it from Secretary Jung?

265
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,810
Then why...

266
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,980
you saved me instead?

267
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,250
I heard a prophecy.

268
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,450
Your son will die today.

269
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,930
What do you mean? Why will he die?

270
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:05,890
If I save your son, then do me a favor.

271
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,480
Go home now.

272
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,510
There is a gas leak at your home, so you need to stop the lighte.

273
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,690
Then your son will live to an adult.

274
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,300
Thanks to that witch's prediction, my son was saved from danger that day.

275
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,750
But she asked me to do her a favor.

276
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,480
You'll be asked to kill a child in 20 years.

277
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:39,470
Please save that child. Promise me.

278
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,500
That witch's earnest request

279
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,650
has been in my mind for 20 years.

280
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,980
And 20 years later, I was truly asked

281
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,760
to kill you.

282
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,160
Soo-kwang.

283
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,980
That witch begged me for saving your life.

284
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,540
What should I do?

285
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,700
What should I do indeed?

286
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,190
You know,

287
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,340
this is the first time you asked me about my thoughts.

288
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:01,090
All you wanted to know was just the future I know.

289
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,480
I've always wanted to know

290
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,400
your needs

291
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,520
and your thoughts in the past times.

292
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,510
But you didn't ask until just now.

293
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,280
Will you help me

294
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,320
realize it if I tell you?

295
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,760
I will.

296
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:46,330
Ask Soo-kwang here.

297
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,430
Bring that kid here.

298
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,880
Gong Soo-kwang?

299
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,570
(Gong Soo-kwang)

300
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,020
Chairman.

301
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,230
Who is he?

302
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,580
Does that matter?

303
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,600
I at least need to know whom I'm going to kill.

304
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,450
Gong Soo-kwang.

305
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:39,600
He is the one who joins Geumhwa Group with the first place.

306
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,520
Make sure to handle it properly.

307
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,840
Yes, sir.

308
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,510
This is the truth of the incident two years ago.

309
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:56,500
You knew it, didn't you?

310
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,050
Why didn't you call the police and carry out the prosecution? You did nothing but to see me.

311
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,380
Every crime has a motive.

312
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,640
Investigating the case will get

313
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,020
Seul-bi involved.

314
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:15,600
You abandoned me. Seon Il-jung tried to kill me.

315
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,160
And my mother was killed...

316
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,370
I'm not the one behind this,

317
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,670
but I'm the reason.

318
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,930
It's also my family's fault.

319
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,690
I'll compensate you as the way you prefer.

320
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,570
If I expose this to the public,

321
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,550
you'll only be sentenced in jail for a few years.

322
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,890
No.

323
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:41,280
You'll use your power to shorten the sentence and punishment.

324
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,230
But the innocent Seul-bi

325
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:49,530
will be hurt by people's opinions and rumors.

326
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,330
Then what do you want?

327
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,040
I only want two things.

328
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,280
Chairman Seon Il-jung must pay the price.

329
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:04,910
And...

330
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,990
Set Seul-bi and her mother free.

331
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,390
I can help you with the first thing.

332
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,950
But the second...

333
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,250
I didn't force Seul-bi to stay.

334
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,300
What do you mean?

335
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,180
Seul-bi is willing

336
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,740
to stay herself.

337
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,510
Ask Soo-kwang to come.

338
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,280
Thanks for your hard work.

339
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,020
Director. Everyone.

340
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,170
This is Gong Soo-kwang. He's the new secretary of chairman.

341
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,600
I'm Gong Soo-kwang. Nice to meet you.

342
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,290
Welcome.

343
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,330
-Looking forward to working with you. -Okay.

344
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,870
What's going on?

345
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,060
Min-joon, this...

346
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,230
You're here.

347
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,310
Yes, Chairman.

348
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,110
Wait.

349
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,680
Wait. I want to talk with Soo-kwang.

350
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,220
Let's talk later, Seul-bi.

351
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,210
Secretary Gong.

352
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,160
In front of other colleagues,

353
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,600
you should call her Miss Seul-bi later.

354
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,560
Yes, Miss Seul-bi.

355
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,530
Miss Seul-bi. From now on, your and Miss Mi-soo's home

356
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,410
will be managed by Secretary Gong.

357
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,230
Go and meet other colleagues.

358
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,600
Dad, what are you doing?

359
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,310
I'm trying to make up for what happened two years ago.

360
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:56,250
He was the top one then.

361
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,610
So it's okay to appoint him as a secretary.

362
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,240
Even so, can we go back to two years ago?

363
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,540
Can you ignore what happened in the past two years?

364
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,620
Let Soo-kwang go.

365
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,900
You were so angry when I let Soo-kwang go at that time. Why are you doing this now?

366
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,260
Is it because of Seul-bi?

367
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,280
I'll make Soo-kwang leave.

368
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:20,340
I chose Secretary Gong myself.

369
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,840
You can't fire him.

370
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,780
Dad, what's wrong with you?

371
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,570
Is this something you should talk to me about?

372
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:31,640
The company is in turmoil.

373
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,340
How dare you argue with me for a secretary I appointed.

374
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,620
Don't mention Secretary Gong again.

375
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,310
I can't believe Seul-bi lives here.

376
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,610
What will happen after this?

377
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,640
A bunny nest?

378
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,250
Secretary Cha, how long have you been hiding this?

379
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,520
I don't understand.

380
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:35,370
The situation here is more complicated

381
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:38,030
than you know.

382
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:10,429
You're Soo-kwang, aren't you?

383
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,210
You were still a kid when I met you.

384
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,070
Who are you?

385
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,480
Soo-kwang, where are you going so early in the morning?

386
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,130
You grew up so well.

387
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,139
Your mom must be proud of you.

388
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:02,320
I owe your mom a lot.

389
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,580
I also... Two years ago...

390
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,750
Thank you for saving my life.

391
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,260
Don't worry.

392
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,630
I can't see the future anymore.

393
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:35,490
Please take good care of Seul-bi.

394
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,700
Yes.

395
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:46,400
I... I met him.

396
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,170
You must meet him.

397
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,520
Now, what are you going to do?

398
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:33,700
First, I'm going to destroy that door.

399
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,200
(Lucky Fish Shop)

400
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,880
Half original and half seasoned chicken.
(Lucky Fish Shop)

401
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,180
-Okay. -Okay.
(Lucky Fish Shop)

402
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,860
You should come over and have a drink. Why do you stay alone?

403
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,360
Sit down. And have a drink.

404
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,900
Have a drink.

405
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,110
I haven't seen my brother-in-law for days. What's going on?

406
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,420
He won't be here for a while.

407
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,470
-Why? -Why?

408
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,360
Is he sick?

409
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,610
No. Now he works at Geumhwa Group.

410
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,840
-What? -What?

411
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,240
How can a merchant work in a big company?

412
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,550
He's not doing business?

413
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,050
Is the annual salary of a big company higher?

414
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,900
Soo-kwang's business is good these days.

415
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,200
Goodness. Is it because Seul-bi doesn't like man who runs a fish shop,

416
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,080
then she has crush on a rich man?

417
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,680
No. He went there for Seul-bi.

418
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,930
-What? -What?

419
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,140
What do you mean?

420
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,970
What's her relationship with Geumhwa Group?

421
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:25,570
Is Seul-bi the daughter of Geumhwa Group?

422
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,990
No, not like that.

423
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,580
My goodness.

424
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,470
She's the daughter of Geumhwa Group?

425
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,530
Jung, what's your relationship with Geumhwa Group?

426
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,740
No. Nothing.

427
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,500
What do you mean?

428
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,470
Goodness. It must be a story about the driver and the daughter of the boss.

429
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,310
I need to look into it.

430
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,230
Wait.

431
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,650
If Seul-bi is the daughter of Geumhwa Group,

432
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,910
then is brother-in-law a matrilocal son-in-law?

433
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:52,140
No, no. It's not like that.

434
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,880
You're so annoying.

435
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,490
Okay, okay. Calm down. Sit down.

436
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,290
-Sit. -Sit.

437
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,180
Sit down and calm down.

438
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,300
Sit.

439
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,630
Then my brother-in-law and Seul-bi won't come to our market?

440
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,930
What should we do?

441
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,570
The market will be quiet and boring.

442
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,470
Gosh.

443
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,400
Hyun-tae. I will be nicer to you.

444
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,640
Why are you here?

445
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,240
I thought you might want to read this book. I brought it.

446
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:37,060
Wow, there are so many books here.

447
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,820
I've been curious

448
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,590
what you read and how you live.

449
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,070
Why are you here?

450
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,430
You didn't answer my calls. I was worried.

451
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,590
Is that why you're here?

452
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,560
I came because you weren't coming.

453
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:04,160
I told you I would protect you.

454
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,950
Soo-kwang, go back.

455
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:19,790
I have nowhere to go. I can't remember.

456
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,960
When I woke up after the accident,

457
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,750
I couldn't reach anyone.

458
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,630
I only remember you.

459
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,880
I wanted to say that,

460
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,900
but I remember everything.

461
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,460
I remember everything.

462
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,320
So I came.

463
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:54,890
I don't want to turn memories about you into reminiscence.

464
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:00,830
Now and in the future,

465
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,860
I want to be with you.

466
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,000
It'll be dangerous if you stay here.

467
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,170
I'll be fine because you're here.

468
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,270
I'll put you in danger.

469
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,600
We'll be fine together.

470
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,700
Soo-kwang.

471
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,190
I'll stay in Room 1901 for the time being.

472
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,380
Call me if you need anything.

473
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,520
Oh, right.

474
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,410
Here.

475
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,700
Uncle Jung asked me to give this to you.

476
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,320
Bye.

477
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,020
(Marketing World)

478
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:08,800
Did you go to Marketing World to explore?

479
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,000
Yes.

480
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,560
Yes. The world that makes your fish shop prosperous is here.

481
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,900
It smells good.

482
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:45,030
My dad never loved my mom.

483
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,030
Even if I knew it was all because of you.

484
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:53,920
I never resented you.

485
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,320
Because it was all my dad's fault.

486
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,890
But now, I'm very angry.

487
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,600
Why are you doing this to me?

488
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,220
Don't you trust me?

489
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,270
Are you afraid

490
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,630
I will lock Seul-bi up like my dad did to you?

491
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,510
Min-joon.

492
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,270
You...

493
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,630
You can't be Seul-bi's boyfriend.

494
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:34,920
You can't predict the future anymore, right?

495
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,190
So don't be sure.

496
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,980
I won't give up Seul-bi.

497
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:11,770
Gong Soo-kwang. Why are you here?

498
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:16,060
Are you spying on my actions to Seul-bi?

499
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:20,170
Min-jun, I have nothing,

500
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,680
except Seul-bi.

501
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,370
That's why I can only come here.

502
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:28,320
No.

503
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,680
You came here to drive me crazy.

504
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,350
Let's see what your father did,

505
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,490
and see what you did.

506
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,870
You want me to see it by myself?

507
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:51,920
The reason why you are suffering when you see me is your conscience,

508
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,740
not me.

509
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,890
Soo-kwang. I said that

510
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:00,890
I can do anything you want me to,

511
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,340
expect things about Seul-bi.

512
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:08,400
You don't have to do anything for me, Min-joon.

513
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,530
You don't have to feel guilty either.

514
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,670
I didn't mean anything. I just want to say that for things two years ago,

515
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,020
don't be sad.

516
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,140
What did you talk with my dad?

517
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:34,410
Is that a secret too?

518
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,970
You're drunk. Stop drinking.

519
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,140
This is the first time you called me here.

520
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,430
I have something to tell you.

521
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:23,670
Do you still think Seul-bi

522
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:29,280
is his daughter?

523
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,190
What?

524
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,460
Seul-bi...

525
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,010
She is your daughter.

526
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,070
If Secretary Jung had nothing to do with you,

527
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:56,930
why did he take you and run away?

528
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:04,040
Back then, I tried to escape there,

529
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,550
so I lied to him.

530
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,500
I'm sorry.

531
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,240
What do you want to do?

532
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,960
The things you want to do.

533
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,660
Why do you want to know that now?

534
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,130
Think about it.

535
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:33,950
Why did you call Soo-kwang here?

536
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,510
Aren't you going to answer?

537
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,560
I'm asking why you called Soo-kwang here.

538
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,530
I'm sure your mother told you.

539
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:52,040
-If you have bad luck in the body... -I'll become a witch

540
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,300
and curse people around you.

541
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:01,160
Are you worried that I'll curse Min-Joon?

542
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:05,580
I wanted to stop you from being miserable.

543
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:11,610
That's your mother's wish.

544
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:15,460
When did you start to fulfill my mother's wish?

545
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:19,200
When were you curious about what I want to do?

546
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:47,940
I mean it's Gong Soo-kwang.

547
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,760
-Are you sure it's Gong Soo-kwang? -Yes.

548
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,350
-Okay. I know it. Bye. -Okay.

549
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,810
My gosh.

550
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,540
I got hit.

551
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,600
Hey, what are you doing? I'm so confused.

552
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:16,500
Dad. He said Soo-kwang became uncle's secretary.

553
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,680
Gong Soo-kwang?

554
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,410
I gave him so many good conditions but he refused to come.

555
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,540
He hit me.

556
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,310
What are you doing?

557
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:28,890
You bragged about bringing him here.

558
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:31,250
Now you've missed the witch and that guy.

559
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,540
Dad. We didn't miss the witch.

560
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,980
Didn't she say she'd come to help with fortune-telling?

561
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,690
Did you do that? It was me.

562
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:38,900
No matter who did it,

563
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,590
as long as she can come and help with the fortune-telling. It's OK.

564
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:42,900
I told you it's not like that.

565
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,220
The luck that the witch brings

566
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,420
will come to that guy.

567
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,300
So two years ago...

568
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,780
Two years ago?

569
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,180
Get out.

570
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:56,060
-Get out! -I'll get out!

571
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,290
Darn it.

572
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:03,390
I should have killed him two years ago.

573
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,580
Did you find Mr. Choi?

574
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:10,320
Not yet.

575
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,990
Find him now! Darn it!

576
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:43,350
I did it as Secretary Gong suggested. It's not bad.

577
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:45,310
Take this table away too.

578
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:49,350
You'd better put a table for the family.

579
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:50,260
Yes, sir.

580
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,290
There's a big shareholder meeting this morning.

581
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:56,190
I have an appointment with the director of Baeksan General Hospital.

582
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:56,820
Okay.

583
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,740
Are you sick?

584
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:05,130
You called Soo-kwang here just to make me uncomfortable, right?

585
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:09,660
If you're tired, don't stay at the hotel. Go home.

586
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,360
Move your office to the headquarters building.

587
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,310
No. I didn't think about that.

588
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,940
-Seul-bi... -Stop talking about Seul-bi.

589
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:42,170
What are you doing? I'll take care of it.

590
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,710
So what did you do?

591
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:45,500
If our mom knows what's going on, she'll faint.

592
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,270
Jang-geun.

593
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,240
Seon Min-joon! Darn it!

594
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:50,720
Brother!

595
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,670
Hey, aren't you being too harsh?

596
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:59,620
I heard you brought that woman to see my sister.

597
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,090
Stop it. Brother.

598
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:03,400
Do you think my sister is a pushover?

599
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,480
Dong-sik told me

600
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,750
that Geumhwa Group is in a rage because of the stock issue.

601
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,950
Is that why you've been fooling with Jang Kyung?

602
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:13,660
Don't fool with my sister.

603
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,890
Don't underestimate our family.

604
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:17,330
-Let's go, brother. -Let go.

605
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:29,360
-I'm sorry, Min-joon. -It's okay.

606
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:41,390
I don't know what's going on right now.

607
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:45,390
Why did Seul-bi come out from there?

608
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:46,660
Jang Kyung.

609
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,260
And what is he doing here?

610
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,300
You don't want to explain?

611
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:58,460
Then Seul-bi,

612
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,300
let's talk.

613
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,620
Jang Kyung, let's talk.

614
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,290
No.

615
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:07,640
I need to talk to Seul-bi alone.

616
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,790
Does the chairman know about your relationship with Min-joon?

617
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:35,630
No. We are not the relationship that you thought.

618
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:38,010
Let's say that's what you said.

619
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,070
What about Soo-kwang? What is he doing here?

620
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:48,280
You said you couldn't give up Seul-bi. What about Jang Kyung?

621
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,960
Jang Kyung and I have broken off our engagement.

622
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,010
I don't think so.

623
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,420
It has nothing to do with you.

624
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,780
Seon Min-joon.

625
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:02,240
I'm leaving.

626
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,950
-Secretary? -You're right.

627
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:11,770
Seul-bi. For me,

628
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:14,260
I know Min-joon likes you,

629
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,620
so I decided to quit.

630
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,720
But how could you bring your boyfriend

631
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,070
here?

632
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:23,180
-That's not it. -Why not?

633
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,550
You should be polite.

634
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:27,210
How do you think you took Soo-kwang here,

635
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:29,410
how would Min-joon feel?

636
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,050
Jang Kyung.

637
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,540
What are you doing?

638
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:39,990
Put hydrangea in the bouquet too.

639
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:40,900
What?

640
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,210
I know you're a bit strange.

641
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:48,740
But what are you talking about in this situation?

642
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:55,150
I'll take you home. Let's go, Jang Kyung.

643
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:06,380
Let's never meet again.

644
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:32,800
Jang Kyung, it's not Seul-bi's fault. So don't blame her.

645
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,320
They like each other now.

646
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,080
And you have a crush on Seul-bi?

647
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,520
Is that why you brought Seul-bi here,

648
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,920
and then brought Soo-kwang here?

649
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,420
What are you doing?

650
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,370
Since you were young,

651
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:53,860
you have been the first in the terms of study, kindness and appearance...

652
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,890
I don't think I deserve you.

653
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:00,910
I never confessed to you.

654
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:04,020
But why are you here like a fool?

655
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,430
Why is my protagonist living like this here?

656
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:10,800
Jang Kyung.

657
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,440
I'm so sad.

658
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,930
I should use the weapon I own now.

659
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:24,950
You don't have to love me.

660
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,410
You need the shares of our hospital, right?

661
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,790
Marry me.

662
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:42,720
I'll make you mine.

663
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,190
Why did you call me here?

664
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,090
Gong Soo-kwang.

665
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:26,790
Did you really become my uncle's secretary?

666
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:27,820
Yes.

667
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:31,990
Are you working for Min-joon?

668
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,580
Well, I gave you great offer,

669
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,200
but you refused.

670
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,590
You just wanted to work for

671
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:39,470
the guy who stole your girlfriend?

672
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:42,740
Think whatever you want.

673
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:46,070
But you should know this.

674
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,490
My dad will take over Geumhwa Group.

675
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:54,110
You'll be working for me then.

676
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,640
I'm busy. Bye.

677
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:11,350
They ignore me whenever they see me.

678
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:21,220
What's all this?

679
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:25,610
The chairman said he would change here into family space.

680
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:26,750
Family?

681
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,430
Have a seat.

682
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:31,640
Mom, have a seat.

683
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,330
Soo-kwang, you should sit too.

684
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:43,940
It's working hours.

685
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,330
Still, you should have dinner. Sit down.

686
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:50,250
Yes, Soo-kwang. Let's eat together.

687
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,740
Min-joon.

688
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:02,560
Min-joon, have a seat. Let's eat together.

689
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:14,680
Eat up.

690
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,630
Min-joon, you too.

691
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,410
I heard you were friends.

692
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,260
They said you were best friends.

693
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,530
Really?

694
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:38,440
I wish you could be good friends again.

695
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:46,920
(Preview of the next episode)

696
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,910
Seul-bi wanted to keep herself there

697
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:51,080
to get rid of those bad luck.

698
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:55,660
To save Seul-bi. I must destroy the castle, Geumhwa completely.

699
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,800
You said you'd never let him mess with me again.

700
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,560
Then there's something you need to know.

701
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:02,120
What is this? They came here without taking me?

702
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,150
Two years ago,

703
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:08,420
I couldn't do anything for you. I hated myself.

704
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:11,110
I'm sorry for saying that to you.

705
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:12,670
It wasn't your fault, Seul-bi.
