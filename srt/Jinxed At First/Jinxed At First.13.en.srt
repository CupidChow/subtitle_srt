1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,100
(Episode 13)

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,830
Are you bodyguards?

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,340
-Seul-bi's bodyguards? -What?

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,610
Seul-bi.

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,850
She has fair skin and very pretty.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,550
Oh, you mean Chairman's niece?

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,700
Niece?

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,760
Thank you.

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,520
Oh, that lady?

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,390
I heard she is a distant relative.

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,060
Maybe from Argentina.

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,240
I heard it's Brazil.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,640
Brazil?

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,580
Jang Kyung.

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:46,890
Min-joon.

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,590
What are you talking about?

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,470
I'm not sneaking around for secrets.

18
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,890
Surprise?

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,900
You haven't eaten, right? You must be hungry.

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,800
Let's... have dinner.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,670
Well, Seul-bi is

22
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,860
so mysterious.

23
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,250
The marketers say Seul-bi is a conglomerate heir.

24
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,700
But as far as I know, she's not your relative.

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,150
But the hotel employees think she's your relative.

26
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,930
I've always been curious about everything.

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,770
Let's stop talking about Seul-bi.

28
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,550
Let me ask you another way.

29
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,280
What can she do for you?

30
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,280
Can she help you with the company business, or make you feel comforted?

31
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,229
Jang Kyung.

32
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,440
I've been busy with work lately.

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,570
Okay, let's talk about business.

34
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,950
The reason you need me... is the company's business, isn't it?

35
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,060
Since you're busy,

36
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,910
I'll prepare for the wedding .

37
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,320
My mom said she's going to tell fortune

38
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,580
to find a perfect day to send the birth date and token for your family.

39
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,820
Jang Kyung.

40
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,490
I knew you like someone else,

41
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,430
so you can't marry me without conscience.

42
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,120
But you can't cancel the cooperation with our hospital yet.

43
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,310
So just listen to me,

44
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,460
and be grateful to me.

45
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,640
Jang Kyung, can you control your heart?

46
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,700
I can't, of course.

47
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,740
If I follow the orders of my brain, our relationship has ended long ago.

48
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,370
But I guess I'm stupid.

49
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,540
I keep moving forward even though I know I'm at a disadvantage.

50
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,730
That's why I also want to follow my heart.

51
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,520
Me too. So does my mind.

52
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,540
Min-joon, you can't do whatever you want.

53
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,370
Because you're Seon Min-joon of Geumhwa Group.

54
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,910
Secretary Gong, you are not busy at all.

55
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,910
Secretary Gong is on an important mission.

56
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,530
So your important mission is to accompany the lady you like?

57
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,520
No.

58
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,950
I'm accompanying a competent person.

59
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,530
Isn't she super pretty?

60
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,220
She's competent, but she seems to be arrogant.

61
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,210
Arrogant? Really?

62
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,350
If she's a capable person,

63
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,370
then I should respect her self-esteem.

64
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,390
Annoying.

65
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,120
Since she's arrogant, why should you respect her?

66
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,829
Secretary Gong.

67
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,280
Yes?

68
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,650
What do you think is the duty of a secretary?

69
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,320
I saw Secretary Cha.

70
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,560
He was with the Chairman.

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,490
He kept saying he's going to work hard. It's time to meet someone.

72
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,120
It's time to work out and dine.

73
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,060
Then I should nag Seul-bi too.

74
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,990
What is it?

75
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,100
I think you'd better

76
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,010
hang out with me right away.

77
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,690
Really?

78
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,730
Let's go.

79
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,490
Wait for me.

80
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,200
Look at this.

81
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,410
Come here.

82
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,440
Do I look good?

83
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,260
Yes, you're so cute.

84
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,730
Where's Miss Mi-soo?

85
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,490
She went out

86
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,470
with Chairman.

87
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,700
Seul-bi didn't answer my phone calls.

88
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,190
Seul-bi went out with Secretary Gong.

89
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,620
(Seul-bi)

90
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,050
Seul-bi.

91
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,300
Yes?

92
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,050
Do you want to bring Miss Mi-soo

93
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,940
and live with me in an isolated place?

94
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,910
Where is the isolated place?

95
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,190
Forest, beach or a desert island.

96
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,230
I saw a man

97
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:39,390
building his own hut and living alone in the forest.

98
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,850
Why don't we build one too

99
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,390
and live there?

100
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,050
Are you worried about Min-joon?

101
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,580
I know staying with Min-joon is enough to make you misunderstand.

102
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,420
-But... -I know.

103
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,310
If you saw Min-joon's future,

104
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,530
and you still decided to stay by his side,

105
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,150
there must be a reason.

106
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,450
Seul-bi.

107
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,820
Can you tell me what you saw?

108
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,280
The curse that falls on Chairman Seon Ju-cheol

109
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,510
will be passed down to Min-joon.

110
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,540
What?

111
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,200
There's a way to stop it, right?

112
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,730
Seul-bi, tell me.

113
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,640
To prevent the curse from falling on Min-joon... What should we do?

114
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,000
There's no

115
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,940
solution.

116
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,610
Does Min-joon know it?

117
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:19,170
No, there must be a way.

118
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,410
This place is still the same.

119
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,990
But we've changed a lot.

120
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,190
When are you going to tell him?

121
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,940
Give me more time.

122
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:52,560
I can't tell Min-joon right now. His emotion is unstable.

123
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,300
You have to tell him now.

124
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,910
If you can't, I'll tell him.

125
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,960
Why now?

126
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,540
There's something you must know.

127
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,680
Are you waiting for me?

128
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,960
Why did you come back here?

129
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,180
Min-joon.

130
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,410
You came back because you chose me, right?

131
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,830
It's not like that.

132
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,230
No?

133
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,100
No.

134
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,600
Why did you make me so embarrassed?

135
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,350
Because of my dad?

136
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,780
You want to get revenge on my dad, so you did this to me?

137
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,190
I want you to be safe.

138
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,330
Seon Min-joon.

139
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,290
Let's talk.

140
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,250
What are you planning with my dad?

141
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,580
Why did you come to the company and disturb us?

142
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,490
Min-joon. I have to be here.

143
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,650
Did my dad ask you to separate Seul-bi and me?

144
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,920
I came back voluntarily.

145
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,950
Because I want Seul-bi to be freer.

146
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,190
She's not free here.

147
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,510
Are you taking Seul-bi away?

148
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,320
Do you think you're the only one who can give her freedom?

149
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,270
Oh, that fish shop.

150
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,260
Do you want to keep Seul-bi in a place where hundreds of people come and go every day?

151
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,240
Is that really for Seul-bi's sake?

152
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,120
I'll make her happy wherever we are.

153
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,230
Min-joon. I don't want to quarrel with you.

154
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,480
Seul-bi sincerely hope you can be well.

155
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,500
Sincerely?

156
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:38,370
You two treated me like I were a fool, but you want me to be fine?

157
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,540
Min-joon.

158
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,690
Everything would be fine if you didn't come.

159
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,560
Then Seul-bi would gradually forget you.

160
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,680
If you didn't come, everything would go back to normal.

161
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,820
Min-joon, I...

162
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,170
I resented you and Chairman for the past two years.

163
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,660
I thought I'd never see you again.

164
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,270
But after two years,

165
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,490
you're still the same. You're my friend Seon Min-joon.

166
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,190
You're my friend who is extremely tenderhearted

167
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,180
and kind-hearted.

168
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,010
My feelings for Seul-bi are real too.

169
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,380
And I don't want to lose my friend, Seon Min-joon.

170
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,480
I will never give up on Seul-bi.

171
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,870
No matter what it takes,

172
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,390
even if I have to give up everything I have,

173
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,660
I won't give up on her.

174
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,890
Same here, Min-joon.

175
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,690
Where are these bastards?

176
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,110
Here.

177
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,570
What about my investment money, you liar? Give my money back!

178
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,710
Who are you? How did you get in?

179
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,590
Who else?

180
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,790
Someone who were cheated by you and didn't get the money from you.

181
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,440
Shit! Let go of me!

182
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,070
What about my 5 billion won? Give it back to me!

183
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,740
Go to the bank and argue.

184
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,730
Bank? But you already transferred the money.

185
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:45,430
-Get out! Get out! -Are you crazy?

186
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,460
Let's take the stuff here.

187
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,780
Get ready for that!

188
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:55,350
Get out. Take them all, you beggars.

189
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,600
Get out!

190
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,750
Take them all. Get out.

191
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,700
You have to tell the fortune for others, not me.

192
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,260
I'll arrange a meeting with a noble lady soon.

193
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,830
You can come by then.

194
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,500
Ok-jin, let go of me! Please let go of me!

195
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,180
Ok-jin? Who is Ok-jin?

196
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,480
Your kid is coming.

197
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,100
The curse that binds you all your life.

198
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,780
He will take it away.

199
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,040
His kid came to take away the curse, right?

200
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,780
The kid will take away the curse?

201
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:48,240
Seul-bi. Seul-bi.

202
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,520
-My gosh. Mr. Jung. -My Seul-bi.

203
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,660
You're drunk every day.

204
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,760
It's closing time. but we can't even close.

205
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,260
I've been a father for 20 years, so I'm going to quit.

206
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,860
Don't want to be a father anymore?

207
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,660
In a rich family, if you resign and say you don't want to be a father anymore, can it be accepted?

208
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,470
Seong-deok, can you even joke about that?

209
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,720
You always scolded me.

210
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,890
Seul-bi.

211
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,940
Your 20-year daughter is living a happy life in the rich family.

212
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,340
You should live a good life too.

213
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,780
That's right. The good fortune is on its way.

214
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,530
Hyun Tae, you must be drunk.

215
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,060
Eun-joo, help Uncle Jung go home.

216
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,910
What? No.

217
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,580
We can't let him sleep here! We have to send him home.

218
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,140
Why should we send him home?

219
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,910
He's not a tenant living in the attic.

220
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,950
Come here, you punk.

221
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,360
Hyun Tae.

222
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,350
Mom.

223
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,670
Uncle Jung always pretended to be pitiful to make you sympathetic to him.

224
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,960
Mom, don't fall for it.

225
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,720
-Wow. -Hey.

226
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,350
I worked so hard to raise you. Why can't I fall in love?

227
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,770
Do you hate it that much?

228
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,030
Ask Eun-joo to send him home together.

229
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,100
-Wow. -Wow.

230
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,740
Hurry.

231
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,520
-Wow. -Wow.

232
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,079
Be quiet.

233
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,599
Eun-jung, walk on his left side. Eun-joo, on the right.

234
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,880
Mr. Jung, get up.

235
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,180
Be gentle and polite!

236
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,829
Why did you drink so much?

237
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,270
Take him home quickly.

238
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,030
What are you looking at?

239
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,780
Why is she so angry?

240
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,580
(Family Relation Registration Form)

241
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,770
(Family Relation Registration Form: It's a series of procedure for Korean citizens, who haven't been registered yet as family members.)

242
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,590
Is Seul-bi...
(Family Relation Registration Form: It's a series of procedure for Korean citizens, who haven't been registered yet as family members.)

243
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,160
Is Seul-bi...

244
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,390
She's my daughter.

245
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,850
Not now.

246
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,340
If you apply to the court,

247
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,570
you have to explain everything to the court.

248
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,620
Why hasn't Seul-bi got her ID card? How did she grow up?

249
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,050
Will the public just let it go?

250
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,980
Can you handle it?

251
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,420
But at this rate, Min-joon will...

252
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,930
At least after the shareholders' meeting, After that...

253
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,770
I'll keep this until then.

254
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,140
Min-joon.

255
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:23,960
Min-joon.

256
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,300
(Family Relation Registration Form)

257
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,540
Min-joon.

258
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,910
You said she wasn't my sister.

259
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,050
You said Seul-bi wasn't my sister.

260
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,710
I...

261
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,620
I'll explain.

262
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,220
Explain what? What to explain?

263
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,700
Min-joon.

264
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,210
You said she wasn't.

265
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,950
You said I wasn't his daughter for the past 20 years.

266
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,890
Seul-bi.

267
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,050
I had this thought when I was young.

268
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,170
He could be my dad.

269
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,130
But you said he wasn't my dad.

270
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,490
That's why I gave up that thought.

271
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,210
But the person who locked us up,

272
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,800
and I hated most

273
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,000
was my dad.

274
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,130
What about Min-joon?

275
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,120
Seul-bi.

276
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,150
Is that why you can't be with me?

277
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,290
Because of that?

278
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,640
When I first saw you, I think you were like a glass bead.

279
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,540
It was the first time I wanted to protect someone desperately.

280
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:10,130
When I held your hand, I was afraid to hurt you.

281
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,900
When I found out that you lived in Soo-kwang's,

282
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,080
I knew I shouldn't have guarded Soo-kwang like that.

283
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,430
You have no idea how jealous I was.

284
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:31,250
I knew you like Soo-kwang, but I still love you.

285
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,690
I love you so much.

286
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,600
My feelings for you are real.

287
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,230
I hope you understand that.

288
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:52,470
You're a very precious person to me.

289
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,190
I don't know why, but we're quite alike.

290
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,000
Unconsciously, I'm attracted to you.

291
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:09,660
I wondered if I liked you.

292
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,810
For over 20 years, I always wanted to know who my dad was.

293
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,540
I thought my dad would be somewhere outside.

294
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,300
But my father was the one

295
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,700
who locked us up for 20 years.

296
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,660
I'm sorry, Seul-bi.

297
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:02,820
Sooner or later, Min-joon and Seul-bi will know the truth.

298
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,730
I beg you for a favor.

299
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:12,350
Please take good care of them, Soo-kwang.

300
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:35,280
He is my dad.

301
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,660
I always felt sorry for my mom.

302
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:51,860
But now, I'm more pitiful.

303
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,760
There's something you must know.

304
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:53,110
A curse is a disaster brought by people with ambition.

305
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,670
It won't disappear.

306
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,050
I knew.

307
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:04,060
The curse will not disappear.

308
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,290
It will be passed down through the bloodline.

309
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,420
So I'll be the next one, right?

310
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:18,150
No. It's not you.

311
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,540
Min-joon is in danger.

312
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:30,140
No, that's impossible.

313
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,790
No.

314
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,090
Seul-bi saw his future.

315
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,890
No, it can't be Min-joon.

316
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,690
You can stop it, right?

317
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,630
Mi-soo. Mi-soo.

318
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,030
We have to end this.

319
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:53,370
We need to reveal everything to the public and return everything back to normal.

320
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,570
Or Min-joon will...

321
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,490
You have locked them up for 20 years.

322
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,220
Do you think this will end easily?

323
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,960
It won't end like this.

324
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,430
It can't end like this.

325
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,000
My kid.

326
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:06,530
My only kid. The one to take the curse away.

327
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:13,660
That will come to us, that will come to us.

328
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:21,010
It will never end.

329
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,020
It will never end.

330
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,300
It will never end.

331
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,850
It will never end.

332
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,990
It will never end.

333
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,450
Dad. Dad.

334
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,470
Yes?

335
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,850
Min-joon, are you okay?

336
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,840
How could I be okay?

337
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,330
Min-joon.

338
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:18,290
The wealth, reputation and this huge castleI I accumulated

339
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:22,850
are all for you.

340
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,490
Because you're my son.

341
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,280
So?

342
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,490
What's left in this huge castle?

343
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,810
Wealth? Reputation?

344
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:38,950
No.

345
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,870
Only your greed and hypocrisy.

346
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,040
That's not true, Min-joon.

347
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,720
If you want to save Seul-bi, you have to deal with this properly.

348
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,540
Geumhwa Group is built by witches' powers.

349
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,140
There are countless bad luck inside.

350
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,540
Seul-bi was trying to get rid of the bad luck. That's why she's still there.

351
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,250
To save Seul-bi,

352
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:23,310
you have to destroy Geumhwa Group.

353
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,720
Seul-bi wants to eat alone in her room.

354
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,040
I'll go get Min-joon.

355
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,070
No need.

356
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,520
Don't let him go out these days.

357
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,370
Let him stay in the hotel.

358
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,540
Yes, sir.

359
00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:02,160
And cancel all my schedule today.

360
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,230
You mean all?

361
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,540
Yes.

362
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,110
It looks delicious.

363
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,830
Let's dig in.

364
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,030
Don't you like shrimps? Enjoy the meal.

365
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,670
It must be delicious.

366
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,110
Why did you choose to take my side instead of Il-jung?

367
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:57,120
Who said I'm on your side?

368
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,890
I know I can't make you forgive me in any way.

369
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,610
But please tell me

370
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:06,310
what can I do to make up for my mistakes?

371
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:09,970
Since you locked my niece and granddaughter up for 20 years,

372
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,730
you should lock your son up for 20 years.

373
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:19,050
Just lock me up.

374
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,850
I'll dig a hole. I'll live like a mole for the rest of my life.

375
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:26,750
So please let Min-joon go.

376
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,200
You're not here to reflect on yourself and apologize,

377
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,380
but to save your son.

378
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,970
You just put on a mask for a while.

379
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:43,350
I will give up everything

380
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:47,180
I'll get rid of all my wealth and reputation.

381
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,880
Everything you've accumulated?

382
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,770
Geumhwa was built by witches.

383
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,150
So destroying that tower is what witches should do.

384
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,000
It's not up to you.

385
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:08,350
You're right. I will return everything.

386
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:13,840
Please tell me how to save my son, Min-joon. Please.

387
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:22,620
How far can you go for your son?

388
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,900
I can give up my life.

389
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,470
Do you prepare the money in your Debit Account?

390
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,110
Yes. I took out all my money. What should I do now?

391
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,840
Let's wait and see.

392
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,110
Let's see if he's going abroad or hiding somewhere.

393
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,080
Why did Uncle take her from you?

394
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,380
What are you talking about?

395
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,120
If Uncle hadn't taken that witch from you,

396
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,790
Geumhwa would have been yours.

397
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:18,429
Then I wouldn't have been pulled hair by those stupid investors.

398
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:21,940
Are you saying it's all my fault?

399
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,760
Of course it's yours.

400
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:28,960
You said

401
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,920
witches will bring luck to the person

402
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,310
who held hands with her for the first time?

403
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:34,489
In that case,

404
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,699
two years ago,

405
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,889
you should've let her hold my hands first. Right?

406
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,230
What have you been doing?

407
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,830
Hey, I want to...

408
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:54,449
Mr. Choi... I should...

409
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:59,020
Geumhwa should have been mine.

410
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,410
I shouldn't have let Seon Min-joon get it so easily.

411
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,440
What are you talking about?

412
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,340
Seon Min-joon won't get what I can't get either.

413
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,900
That punk...

414
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,170
What is it?

415
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,980
My heart aches.

416
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,040
Your only uncle is in hospital.

417
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,240
How could you not visit him as his nephew?

418
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,280
I heard he was hospitalized. That's why the call was postponed.

419
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,560
Are you saying that he pretended to be ill because he doesn't want to be investigated by the prosecution?

420
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:47,640
I guess Uncle's hobby is to send people who he doesn't like to the hospital.

421
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,090
That's why our grandpa is in a mental hospital and my dad is in the general hospital.

422
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,490
What are you trying to say?

423
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,840
This tragedy was so painful,

424
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,690
so I went to see my grandpa.

425
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,510
You can't go out.

426
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,660
-Move! -You can't leave!

427
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,590
Director. You can't leave.

428
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,690
What is it?

429
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:17,720
I'll go to the hospital and see my uncle. Is it OK?

430
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,970
Min-joon, the chairman...

431
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,790
Call Dong-sik if you don't believe me.

432
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,590
Go.

433
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:58,240
(Dad, I thought Santa Claus would bring you back, but he didn't.)

434
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,870
Soo-kwang, I'm just like you.

435
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,550
I don't have any memories with my dad.

436
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,300
In my memory, the chairman is the person

437
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:27,180
who tormented my mom and

438
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,470
the person who locked us up.

439
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,490
He is like a monster.

440
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,500
From now on, you can accumulate good memories

441
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,200
until them cover up all the bad ones.

442
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,530
You still have a lot of time left.

443
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,350
Did grandpa say anything about Seul-bi?

444
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,530
I don't know what it is,

445
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:29,630
but he said he'd only tell you and not tell me.

446
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,880
It's you. You finally come.

447
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:59,480
The one who will take my curse away. The one who will take the curse away in my place.

448
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,720
Come here.

449
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,130
Come here. Come closer.

450
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,750
Come closer.

451
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:16,960
Hurry.

452
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:31,650
Dad, I'm Sam-jung.

453
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:38,200
Sam-jung is here.

454
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:52,540
It's time to end this.

455
00:39:53,410 --> 00:40:05,740
Dad. I'm the bloodline who will take your curse away.

456
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:15,670
The bloodline who will take my curse away ?

457
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:21,170
Yes, it's me.

458
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:28,930
No, it isn't you.

459
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:41,290
-It isn't you. -Dad.

460
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:50,870
Dad.

461
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,950
-Sam-jung. -Dad, It's me.

462
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:16,300
Dad, it's me.

463
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,820
Grandpa, this is Min-joon.

464
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,430
I remember the last time I saw you was when I was young.

465
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:20,840
Grandpa! Grandpa!

466
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,740
Grandpa!

467
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,380
Chairman!

468
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,320
What happened?

469
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,970
He's been acting strange since he got off.

470
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,080
Get back to work.

471
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,670
Are you...

472
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:26,500
Min-joon, where are you?

473
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:30,870
What? Chairman Seon Ju-cheol...

474
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:49,130
Seon Ju-cheol, the honorary chairman of Geumhwa Group passed away last night.

475
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,510
He was 94 years old.

476
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:55,110
Chairman Seon Ju-cheol has been stared Geumhwa,

477
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,500
and expanded his business in sectors of circulation and hotel,

478
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,780
and eventually made Geumhwa Group one of the 20 major enterprises in Korea.

479
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,480
Darn it.

480
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,310
These policemen... These guys even followed us to the funeral home.

481
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:24,850
They were embarrassing me.

482
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:32,160
Sir, if you're tired, please go back to your room.

483
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:43,510
Hey. You don't have hallucinations?

484
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,850
Why do you ask?

485
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:50,440
No. You've been working hard for the funeral.

486
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,550
But you're safe.

487
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,700
Didn't you say the curse will be transferred?

488
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,310
What are you talking about?

489
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,950
Sir, I'm sorry for your loss. Take care of yourself.

490
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:11,690
I'll visit you later.

491
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,180
I'll see Jang Kyung off.

492
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,620
I'll ask the servants to prepare the food.

493
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,730
Am I here to eat?

494
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:32,120
You said you wanted to eat.

495
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,440
Shut up! You punk.

496
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,390
How dare you interrupt me?

497
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,560
Sum-jung.

498
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,850
For the investment this time, I need your help.

499
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:54,370
Don't you want to talk to me anymore?

500
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,740
Why are you ignoring me?

501
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,960
I have my trump card.

502
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,050
Do you want to know what it is?

503
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:15,970
Sum-jung, you have to protect me for your own sake.

504
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:18,020
We're family, right?

505
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,680
Do you always evade the law like this?

506
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:25,340
What?

507
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:35,270
You use, plunder, trample on the weak.

508
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,520
If there are something wrong in legislation,

509
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,950
you always push it to your brother.

510
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:44,230
Who the hell are you? How dare you talk nonsense to me?

511
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,840
Chairman Seon Il-jung.

512
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:54,810
You can't escape this time.

513
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:00,230
Secretary Gong, stop it.

514
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,630
How dare you!

515
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,530
If you keep this up, I'll kill you.

516
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:14,030
You're so annoying.

517
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,690
I'm mourning so I won't dispute with you.

518
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:21,190
If my dad hadn't passed away... How dare you...

519
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:24,140
Let's go.

520
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:30,200
I'm mourning so I won't dispute with you.

521
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:33,330
Uncle, I'm going home.

522
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,700
How embarrassing.

523
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,720
The chairman didn't say a word in the forum.

524
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,220
He never talked to anyone.

525
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,770
Is it too shocking?

526
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,570
Shouldn't you take the chairman to the hospital?

527
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,990
(Seon Min-joon)

528
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,280
Min-joon.
(Seon Min-joon)

529
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:30,940
Min-joon.

530
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:32,830
What is this? Registered letter from the court.

531
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:34,440
(Korea Family Hospital Express Delivery)
What is this? Registered letter from the court.

532
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,090
What is this? Registered letter from the court.

533
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:39,340
The chairman was declared as quasi-interdicted person.

534
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:43,640
Min-joon. You have been elected as his appointed guardian.

535
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,000
(Korea Family Hospital Declaration)

536
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,910
Dad, why did you do that?

537
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,120
Dad.

538
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:05,960
Are you okay?

539
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,820
Why aren't you saying anything?

540
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:16,350
Your father is in the same condition as Chairman Seon Ju-cheol.

541
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:21,770
What do you mean? Why is he in the same condition as grandpa?

542
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:26,180
Have you heard about your grandfather's illness?

543
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:34,730
When I was young, I heard that grandpa wasn't mentally ill, he was cursed.

544
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,970
The bad luck accumulated by a witch

545
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,850
transferred to those who own a witch.

546
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,710
That curse won't disappear.

547
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,700
It will be passed down from generation to generation.

548
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:00,820
You mean the curse has been transferred to my father?

549
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:04,120
Why? Why now?

550
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:09,470
Is he running away?

551
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,990
He made us so miserable. Did he run away?

552
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,560
He didn't run away. He did it for you.

553
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,850
In fact, you are the bloodline of the curse.

554
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:33,370
But he accepted the curse for you. He risked his life for you.

555
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:49,160
Hey, don't you have hallucinations?

556
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:57,870
Sun Dong-sik. That's why you let me visit grandpa?

557
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,190
Sun Dong-sik.

558
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:06,770
Dad. Do you think I will appreciate you because of this?

559
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,300
Why do you always make me miserable?

560
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:14,390
I'd rather be a fool and run away from this horrible place!

561
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:19,440
Dad, wake up!

562
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,150
Dad, wake up!

563
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:24,430
Min-joon! Don't do this!

564
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,200
Min-joon!

565
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,080
I'll go check.

566
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,340
Why am I so stupid?

567
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:00,150
Why didn't I know anything?

568
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,620
I didn't know you are my sister.

569
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:06,830
I didn't know what happened to my dad.

570
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:10,640
I'm useless.

571
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,190
Don't blame yourself.

572
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:16,640
I also didn't know

573
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:19,500
what I should do in the future.

574
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,560
Can I take the responsibility of Gwumhwa Group?

575
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,840
No. I can't do it without my dad.

576
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:32,370
I want to run away, Seul-bi.

577
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,820
Are you going to abandon your dad who is suffering for you?

578
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:43,430
Are you going to abandon your job and your friends?

579
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,560
If you abandon everything and run away,

580
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,030
will you feel better?

581
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:51,260
I told you

582
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,600
I envy you.

583
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,470
You have your best friends

584
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:02,240
and your dad who loves you so much.

585
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:07,160
So don't run away.

586
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,840
Go home with Soo-kwang.

587
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,850
I'll get some fresh air.

588
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,890
Min-joon, are you okay?

589
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,750
Yes, I'm fine.

590
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:04,090
Have some.

591
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:08,340
Just a little.

592
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,750
I didn't mean to.

593
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:27,760
I didn't expect you to go this far.

594
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,820
I did this to you.

595
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,100
I...

596
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,490
Look at me.

597
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,930
Look at me.

598
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:48,900
Call my name again.

599
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:51,310
Please.

600
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,000
Call my name again.

601
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:15,670
Sum-jung.

602
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:19,940
He won't kill me like this, will he?

603
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:22,160
Dad, what's your trump card?

604
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,860
Do you have a definite counterattack?

605
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,460
There's no such thing.

606
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:32,730
Sum-jung won't let me go to jail.

607
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:35,460
He just won't let go.

608
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,210
That's the common fate.

609
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,190
That's family.

610
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:41,160
Family?

611
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:44,210
Family?

612
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,440
You lost completely.

613
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,920
Don't worry.

614
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,520
Have you ever seen your dad in prison?

615
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:56,590
As long as I coax Sum-jung,

616
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:58,560
he will cover it up no matter what.

617
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,530
You should go to jail.

618
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,610
Just go to jail with integrity.

619
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,440
Don't pray and beg shamelessly.

620
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,360
How dare you talk to your dad like that?

621
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:11,450
Dad, what are you doing?

622
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:13,350
You're always making fun of me

623
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:15,980
and asked me what I would do and what I am better than Min-Joon.

624
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:19,800
You'll only torture me with your inferiority for uncle.

625
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,170
What did you leave for me?

626
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:24,270
You...

627
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,680
What happened to Mr. Choi of Superstar Loan?

628
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:44,100
We're looking for him.

629
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,570
We'll get some news soon.

630
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,560
Bring him to me alive.

631
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,700
Yes, sir.

632
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,880
Also, don't test my dad and me.

633
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,390
Be clear.

634
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,370
You won't catch a rotten rope, will you?

635
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,500
The weather is really nice.

636
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,740
When are you going back?

637
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,610
I need to find a container.

638
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:20,770
Let's go together.

639
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:21,940
Why should I?

640
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,900
Do you think Seon Il-jung can't find you?

641
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,780
I threatened Seon Il-jung about instigating murder.

642
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,560
If it get caught, you'll die too.

643
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,210
Stop it.

644
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:34,650
Let's get enough money from Seon Il-jung

645
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,060
and run away together.

646
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:37,390
Let's go to Hawaii.

647
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:41,260
and have fun with the hot girls.

648
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:41,930
What do you think?

649
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:44,890
Will that threat work on 	Seon Il-jung?

650
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:46,960
Don't make trouble.

651
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,140
Just stay quietly for a few years.

652
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,130
Am I crazy?

653
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:51,950
He ruined me.

654
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,920
I can't let this go.

655
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,880
I'll keep cheating from him

656
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,530
until he has nothing.

657
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,200
Why are you following me?

658
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,800
Because I want to see you walk.

659
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,570
It's nice to keep watching.

660
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,740
I miss you too.

661
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,430
It was always so at the funeral.

662
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,150
So come to the place in front of me.

663
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:59,350
I was so worried when I was chasing Min-joon's car.

664
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:03,720
I was worried that you might disappear with Min-joon.

665
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:08,870
I always met red lights while chasing him.

666
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,930
I thought I'd lose him. I'm going crazy.

667
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,820
Everything will get better as time passes.

668
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,860
I have a request. Soo-kwang.

669
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:45,620
Please hold my hand.

670
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,920
What?

671
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,320
I don't know my future.

672
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,410
I can see others' future,

673
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:57,350
but I can't see my own future.

674
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:59,760
But as long as I hold your hand,

675
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:02,300
I can see our future

676
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,080
and me in your future.

677
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:13,460
So just once.

678
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:15,200
Let me see my future.

679
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:18,530
-But Seul-bi... -Please.

680
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,720
It's her.

681
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,100
(Preview of the next episode)

682
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,180
Mom.

683
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,830
Can the future I see

684
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:39,890
be wrong?

685
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:40,860
What did you see?

686
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,530
Yes, I'm crazy.

687
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,410
So if you refuse here,

688
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:46,030
can you imagine what will happen?

689
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:48,380
The truth will come to light, Soo-kwang.

690
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,400
It's that woman.

691
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,650
That woman is the witch who has been locked up for 20 years

692
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:53,450
in the secret room of this hotel.

693
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:56,060
I'll be shown clearly to the world.

694
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:58,360
I'll be miserable and...

695
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:00,660
You will leave me.

696
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,300
That is the future I see.
