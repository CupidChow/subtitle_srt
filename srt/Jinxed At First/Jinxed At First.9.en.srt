00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,080
Excuse me.

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,020
Are you Gong Soo-kwang?

4
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,190
You must meet her.

5
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,800
The one who came to see Gong Soo-kwang, instead of Go Myeong-seong.

6
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,590
Do you know me?

7
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,730
Where is the prophecy witch?

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,530
If you're here for fortune-telling,

9
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,630
please go to the fortune-telling shop at the end of the market.

10
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,430
There's no one you mentioned here.

11
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,230
I'm not here for fortune-telling.

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,770
I might have come to the wrong place.

13
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:05,770
Come to me when you are in need.

(Seoul Folk Museum Eun Ok-jin﻿)

15
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,420
They said the domestic investment only goes through the Silver Line Investment Company.

16
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:46,390
This is tricky.

17
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,390
That's why

18
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,170
you asked me to investigate Silver Line Investment Company.

19
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,140
Silver Line Investment Company? It won't work out this way.

20
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,720
Go find other investors.

21
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,410
The former vice president of Eunseong Capital

22
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,120
is the CIO there, right?

23
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,500
Yes.

24
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,440
Of course we can't let Eunseong Capital participate

25
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,889
the investment of Geumhwa Biotech Company.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,030
Didn't the investors from Hong Kong come to Korea?

27
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,270
He's going abroad to Hong Kong today.

28
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,090
Keep him stay.

29
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:18,940
What?

30
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,170
The Hong Kong investor?

31
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:27,079
Didn't they say that as long as we get the SG in Singapore, we can get the Geumhwa Biotech Company?

32
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,400
I think Director Seon Min-joon

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,680
brought an investment company in Hong Kong.

34
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,190
Darn it.

35
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,790
When will Secretary Jung bring her here?

36
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,600
She's already at Geumhwa Hotel.

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,980
What?

38
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,670
When?

39
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,620
How did you know?

40
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,800
So do as I say this time, dad.

41
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,660
Do as you say? When did things work as you said?

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,829
When did you ever listen to me?

43
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,390
Just do as I say this time.

44
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,550
Wow, the photos look nice.

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,560
Hello, are you Soo-kwang's girlfriend?

46
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,920
Or a lucky charm?

47
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,300
Delete the photos.

48
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,970
Delete them!

49
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,180
People are watching.

50
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,750
Let's talk somewhere quiet.

51
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,730
I'll send you the address. Come along later.

52
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,200
Let's get closer.

53
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,890
By the way, I also made an appointment with Soo-kwang.

54
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,090
We can meet together, right?

55
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,070
Min-joon, let's go.

56
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,610
See you later.

-Dong-sik, is it here? -I said it is.

59
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,800
Are you sure it's here?

60
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,030
Hello, sir.

61
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,930
Welcome.

62
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,510
-Soo-kwang. Gong Soo-kwang. -Jang-geun.

63
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,280
He insisted on coming with me.

64
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,850
-You're alive and live well. -Long time no see.

65
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,519
Let's have a drink somewhere.

66
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,340
We should hang out. I want to know how you've been through.

67
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,040
What do you think, Dong-sik?

68
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,250
Of course, we should.

69
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,480
I heard that the man who held hands with the witch for the first time

70
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,070
would get the most luck of the witch.

71
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,370
And then that man would become the witch's lover.

72
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,500
That's why if other people want to get luck from the witch,

73
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,880
they must get rid of that man, right?

74
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,300
If we don't kill her lover, that man,

75
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,250
it's useless to bring the witch here.

76
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,900
He died, right?

77
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,860
Dad, did you know he died before?

78
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,040
Died before?

79
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,770
Are you saying he revived?

80
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,450
How did you know? How did you know he died before?

81
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,730
Well... What are you talking about?

82
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,400
Why are you getting mad?

83
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,360
Anyway, what you think will happen

84
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,390
if the witch's lover is on our side?

85
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,030
If that man is on our side,

86
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,110
that witch will be on our side soon.

87
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,960
Cheers! Why don't you drink?

88
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,690
It's nice to see you again.

89
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,409
-It'd be great if we all get together. -Yes.

90
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,860
Min-joon, you're here. Come here.

91
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,230
Come here.

92
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,570
-Who is she? -Soo-kwang's grilfriend.

93
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,090
She's Soo Gwang's girlfriend.

94
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,270
I was wondering why Min-joon brought a girl here.

95
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,150
I misunderstood. Come here and have a seat.

96
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,720
What are you doing? Sit down.

97
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,110
-Come here. -This way.

98
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,820
-I need to go the restroom. -Okay.

99
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,430
Jang Kyung, did you see the address I sent you?

100
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,330
I'm not going. Am I a chauffeur?

101
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,880
You like Min-joon, don't you?

102
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,740
This is your chance. Take it.

103
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,100
No, he likes another woman. Why should I take the initiative?

104
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,770
Hey, what's with the atmosphere?

105
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,850
By the way, when did you two start dating?

106
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,310
A long time ago.

107
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,020
You've been dating for a long time?

108
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,950
We broke up.

109
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,180
What?

110
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,850
It's so awkward.

111
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,320
Let's play something fun.

112
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,010
-Can you tell my fortune? -Hey. Are you drunk?

113
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:16,300
No. I'm told Soo-kwang's grilfriend is good at fortune-telling.

114
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,430
Really?

115
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,590
That's enough.

116
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,950
-Don't worry about it. -Just go. This is my friends' gathering.

117
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,220
If you want to read fortune, you have to pay.

118
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,240
Of course I will pay for it. As long as you can help.

119
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,900
Gong Soo-kwang.

120
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,120
Let go of her hand.

121
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,220
Hey. I felt weird since you came.

122
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,180
Seul-bi is Soo-kwang's girlfriend.

123
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,830
Why do you keep taking care of her?

124
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,900
What's the relationship between you two?

125
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,340
Are you the "another woman" that Jang Kyung mentioned?

126
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:11,730
Are you crazy? Is that really your relationship?

127
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,660
Soo-kwang. Do you know this as well?

128
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,530
I can't stay here anymore.

129
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,390
Hey, Jang-geun! Wait for me!

130
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,280
Can you come out like this?

131
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,120
How are you going to introduce yourself to others?

132
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,850
Your name doesn't exist in this world.

133
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,400
How will you introduce your existence?

134
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,179
Stop it.

135
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,930
You said she's your woman, right?

136
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,880
Then you should've let her show up independently in front of others.

137
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,540
If your relationship

138
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,980
is hard to define,

139
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,460
you shouldn't have taken her out like this.

140
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,670
Stop talking, Soo-kwang.

141
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,850
Go back.

142
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,780
I didn't do anything wrong. Why can't I be confident?

143
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,200
Just because I don't have an ID card like yours,

144
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,040
I'm supposed to be locked up like the animals in the zoo?

145
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,900
Or because my strange ability?

146
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:24,100
I couldn't adapt to this world. I wasn't able to live an normal life.

147
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,680
I'm also strange.

148
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,460
But I've never done anything that made you humiliated.

149
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,840
I'm leaving.

150
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,130
Are you leaving?

151
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,320
Hey, drink more.

152
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,570
Seon Dong-sik, that's enough.

153
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,590
I was wondering why you went to meet the investors of Hong Kong

154
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,410
after meeting the investors in Singapore.

155
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,970
It's under Seul-bi's guide, right?

156
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,720
Wow, that power is so attractive.

157
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,280
Min-joon, let's go.

158
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,080
You'll regret for ignoring me like this.

159
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,130
Oh, you're the one..

160
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,430
Yes, I bought shrimps before.

161
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,560
Ah.

162
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,430
This is awkward.

163
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,530
Jang Kyung, see you next time.

164
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,010
Let's go together. I'll drive.

165
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,230
You can't drive because you're drunk.

166
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,470
No need.

167
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,910
I want to go with Jang Kyung.

168
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,570
Let's go together. Let's talk on the way.

169
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,640
She's really unique.

170
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,470
When did you find out about Seul-bi's ability?

171
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,030
Not long.

172
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,380
I was surprised when I found it out.

173
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,270
The reason my uncle could make his company so prosperous

174
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,080
is to lock those witches up to tell fortune.

175
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,810
Does that make sense?

176
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,530
It's really unbelievable,

177
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,980
but he's my uncle, so I can't call the police.

178
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,350
And the witch who ran away becomes your girlfriend,

179
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,080
that's another reason I can't do that.

180
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,200
Seul-bi has nothing to do with me anymore.

181
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,870
Hey, are you going to quit like that?

182
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,390
Hey. I'm going to punch him hard.

183
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,980
Come to our company.

184
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,440
I'll pay you a high salary,

185
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,970
with an imported car. I'll offer everything you need.

186
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,170
Let's join hands and punch the Geumhwa Group.

187
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,220
Dong-sik.

188
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,570
Don't use me like that.

189
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,680
How can you say that?

190
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,660
Anyway, we used to be good friends.

191
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,590
We're still friends.

192
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,130
If you're dragging me over because of Seul-bi,

193
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,000
I'll refuse.

194
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,210
Hey, it's not like that.

195
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,660
Think about my proposal.

196
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,430
Are you saying the man who has been with that witch

197
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,600
was the same guy two years ago?

198
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,000
I think so.

199
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,050
You think so?

200
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,280
Look what you did!

201
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,160
Look into it again. From two years ago.

202
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,140
What's going on? Shit.

203
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,160
Where do you live?

204
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,470
Seodong Market. No, Geumhwa Hotel.

205
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,800
Oh, right. Seodong Market.

206
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,790
You moved from there?

207
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:09,250
By the way, you don't live in the hotel together with Min-joon, do you?

208
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,410
Min-joon lives in the hotel too. Does that mean we live together?

209
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,680
-You live in the same room? -No.

210
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,680
Min-joon often came to see me.

211
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,190
What? Then who did you live with at Seodong Market?

212
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,390
I lived in the same room with Soo-kwang.

213
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:29,980
Wow, she's really surprising me.

214
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,090
Shut up.

215
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,120
I'm going to book a room for long-term stay.

216
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,150
-Are you kidding me? -I'm serious.

217
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,160
I think a long-term stay can help me to write a popular novel.

218
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,710
Novel? Are you a writer?

219
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,000
Yes.

220
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,250
Wow, I love reading.

221
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,610
Really?

222
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,630
But... It's easier to read my novel online.

223
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,490
How? Teach me later.

224
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,080
I'll send you the link.

225
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,720
Director, I brought Gong Soo-kwang here.

226
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,590
You came earlier than I expected.

227
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,910
Director. Do you know how to turn Seul-bi into an ordinary human being?

228
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,820
Yes, I do.

229
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,800
How do you know?

230
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,010
Let me show you. Seeing is believing.

231
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,290
This looks exactly like Seul-bi's necklace.

232
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,170
This was my necklace.

233
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,850
What?

234
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:46,660
-Then... -I used to be the prophecy witch you met.

235
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,260
But I became an ordinary human being.

236
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,700
How did you do that?

237
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,180
You have nothing to do with Seul-bi now, right?

238
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,610
Come to me

239
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,470
when you're determined to turn her into an ordinary one.

240
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,930
But don't be too late.

241
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,170
It's dangerous to leave Seul-bi alone.

242
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,250
What do you mean?

243
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,580
Lady, it's just 15,000 won.

244
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,050
What's there to think about?

245
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,510
Don't hesitate.

246
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,230
Gosh.

247
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,300
Soo-kwang, why are you so late?

248
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,470
This is only 15,000 won.

249
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,990
How many times have you slept on it?

250
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,990
Gosh, it's so pretty. Turn around.

251
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,420
Soo-kwang, you're here.

252
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,740
Hello.

253
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,700
-Hello. -Oh, you're here.

254
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,060
Thank you.

-You're good at drawing. -Yes, I am.

258
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,390

Here are arthropods of the decapod family Crustacea.

260

There are also mollusks of the octoceratops family.

It's dangerous to leave Seul-bi alone.

Please look forward to it.

When you're drunk, there's a kangaroo hopping in your head. The jellyfish is attacking you in your belly.

266
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,860
There are waves in front of you.

267
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,790
This is the dried walleye pollack soup to alleviate a hangover.

And steamed eggs.

269
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,900
Mom, try it.

270
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,760
How is it?

271
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,840
It's so delicious.

272
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,690
That's great, mom. Have more.

273
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,270
My dad told me this before.

274
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,650
You can have her, but don't love her.

275
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,730
How foolish the word is.

276
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:38,250
She can always be by your side, but don't like her.

277
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,870
But...

278
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:49,620
I foolishly said the same thing to my son.

279
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:54,770
I'll talk to Min-joon and persuade him to let Seul-bi leave.

280
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:03,420
My dad has been in the hospital for 20 years.

281
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,080
If I hadn't brought Mi-soo back then,

282
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,020
would nothing have happened?

283
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,140
Would Mi-soo and my dad be safe?

284
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,620
If I had turned a blind eye

285
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,970
on Mi-soo's escape...

286
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,840
You didn't know it back then.

287
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,100
No one knew that would happen.

288
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,520
So you've been blaming yourself for over 20 years. Stop blaming yourself.

289
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,580
I'm not blaming myself.

290
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:49,490
If I blamed myself, I wouldn't use Mi-soo anymore.

291
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:56,780
Jeong-hun. I'm a shameless person.

292
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:06,170
At this point, I become a coward for being afraid of those things will happen to me.

293
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,930
I am a coward.

294
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,680
Why don't you let them leave together?

295
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,570
Just let Mi-soo leave, Seul-bi will leave too.

296
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,810
And then forget everything.

297
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,390
If you're still worried, I'll follow them and take care of them.

298
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,280
Now,

299
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,860
let Mi-soo go.

300
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,230
Yes, I should do that.

301
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,420
But the one who made my life

302
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,760
the most dazzling,

303
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,020
and the most vicious woman,

304
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,460
I can't let her go, Jung-hun.

305
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,240
My Soo-kwang,

306
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,540
his broad shoulders look half smaller today.

307
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,290
I need to bring him something delicious.

308
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,610
Where are you going?

309
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,090
Go away.

310
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,070
You want to give this to him again, right?

311
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,940
I'm hungry. Give it to me.

312
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,420
You don't know how hard I tried to make this seasoning.

313
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,710
You gave the fried chicken I made to him last time.

314
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,090
Are you crazy? Get away.

315
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,530
And you told me it was the disaster of the catering industry.

316
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,870
Okay, I'll try what you made today.

317
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,420
Just let them fight.

318
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,710
What?

319
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,840
Just let them fight. Don't stop them.

320
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,790
Are you crazy?

321
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,540
-Let go! Let go! -I won't.

322
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,380
I'm warning you. Let go!

323
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,950
Hey, you two!

324
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,740
Get out!

325
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,420
Get out!

326
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,800
Please stop. I can at least endure it.

327
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,510
Oh, no.

328
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,480
This is the seasoning I'm going to sell at night. They ruined it all.

329
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,890
What a waste.

330
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,150
Oh, my.

331
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,850
Wow, this is a new level of seasoning.

332
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,480
Wow, it's so delicious.

333
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,220
Seul-bi.

334
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,960
I knew what you meant now.

335
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,640
Seul-bi.

336
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,850
Molluscan squid of the order Cephalopoda Decapoda.

337
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,860
Far eastern multilinear fish of the redfish family.

338
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,720
The mollusk clams of the true Petromyzidae family.

339
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,060
Wow, you memorized them perfectly.

340
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,270
Perfect?

341
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,930
Yes, perfect.

342
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,810
You're a perfect man, Young-woo.

343
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,380
Young-woo is perfect.

344
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,210
What's going on? Why did you call us so eagerly?

345
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:54,870
I have to run my shop.

346
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,060
What happened? Why did you call us up here?

347
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,950
She said there was a miracle today.

348
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,610
What? Ms. Bang won the lottery?

349
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,850
If it was a lottery, she would have kept it a secret.

350
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,290
Why would she spread the news?

351
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,840
What's going on?

352
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,020
Is everyone here?

353
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,090
What?

354
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,540
Do you want to taste this miraculous seasoning?

355
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,670
Seasoning?

356
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,170
Try it.

357
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:13,930
Really?

358
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,190
Yes.

359
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,720
Gosh.

360
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,730
Wow.

361
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,130
Isn't it perfect?

362
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,140
Isn't it perfect?

363
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,230
No.

364
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,890
Young-woo is perfect.

365
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:25,650
What?

366
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:30,510
Young-woo, you're perfect too. This seasoning is perfect!

367
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,000
It's my perfect life.

368
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,480
Thank you, Seul-bi.

369
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:42,500
-Congratulations, Ms. Bang. -Congrats.

370
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,250
-Nice. Nice. -Thank you.

371
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,650
Seul-bi.

372
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:52,430
Mom, these are the pictures I took at Seodong Market.

373
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,040
There are many shops here.

374
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,430
This is a fried chicken shop.

375
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,510
And this is Young-woo's home-cooked set dish restaurant.

376
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,910
And this is the fried twisted doughnuts shop.

377
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,090
It looks delicious.

378
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,770
Mom, do you want to eat the twisted doughnuts?

379
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,670
They are very delicious.

380
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,290
I went there with Young-woo every day.

381
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,590
I'll buy some for you too.

382
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,210
Hey, Min-joon.

383
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,410
I need to go to Seodong Market.

384
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,170
Should I go buy some?

385
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,370
No, wait.

386
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,360
The castella powder is not perfect here.

387
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,420
Can you stop saying "perfect"?

388
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,940
Hey, Seul-bi is coming!

389
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,400
Seul-bi. Our Seul-bi.

390
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,920
Twisted doughnuts, pack them all for me.

391
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,040
Seul-bi wants some.

392
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,970
Seul-bi? Is Seul-bi coming?

393
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:10,750
-Seul-bi is here. -Seul-bi is here?

394
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,240
-She's here. -She wants some twisted doughnuts.

395
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,310
Twisted doughnuts.

396
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,620
What else does Seul-bi like but the twisted doughnuts?

397
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,000
Oh, right. She likes that.

398
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,450
(Twisted doughnuts Original fried chicken)
Oh, right. She likes that.

399
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,870
-What about ours? -Side dishes...
(Twisted doughnuts Original fried chicken)

(Twisted doughnuts Original fried chicken)

401
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:20,680
Seul-bi. That sexy underwear.
(Twisted doughnuts Original fried chicken)

402
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,540
Seul-bi. That sexy underwear.

403
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,010
Yes, underwear.

404
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:23,600
Underwear?

405
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,930
What's wrong? What's wrong with Seul-bi?

406
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,590
Seul-bi is here. She wants twisted doughnuts.

407
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,820
Seul-bi is here.

408
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:29,990
Wait. What should I get her?

409
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,450
(Stewed Octopus Soup Spicy Whelks)
Wait. What should I get her?

410
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,460
Hyun Tae. Seul-bi is here. Let's go and meet her.
(Stewed Octopus Soup Spicy Whelks)

411
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,610
Hyun Tae. Seul-bi is here. Let's go and meet her.

412
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:33,990
(Original Fried Chicken)
Hyun Tae. Seul-bi is here. Let's go and meet her.

413
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,650
Seul-bi. Seul-bi. Our Seul-bi.

414
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,720
Seul-bi.

415
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,360
Why did you leave without saying goodbye?

416
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,290
Do you know how much I missed you?

417
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:48,140
I didn't even have chance to thank you. Do you know how hard it was for me?

418
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,460
Thank you so much.

419
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,210
I could survive thanks to you.

420
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,830
Seul-bi. You should've at least told me before you left.

421
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,680
I'm sorry.

422
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,750
I missed you, Seul-bi.

423
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,880
Young-woo, I miss you too.

424
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,000
Seul-bi, you're perfect.

425
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,560
It's not perfect at all.

426
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,230
I'm so sad that you left like that.

427
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,490
-Seul-bi. -Oh my.

428
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,090
Seul-bi, thank you so much.

429
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,850
I didn't stop them because you told me not to.

430
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,340
It turned out to be a miraculous seasoning.

431
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,740
That's great, Ms. Bang.

432
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,610
Why did you suddenly become the lead? Move.

433
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,590
Hyun Tae, come and say hello.

434
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,970
-Come here. -Come here.

435
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,210
Hurry up.

436
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,250
Where are you going?

437
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,950
This isn't the right time.

438
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,930
Myeong-seong's wife, the market is quiet and boring when you're not here.

439
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,540
It's not fun at all.

440
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,570
Don't call her Myeong-seong's wife anymore...

441
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,770
I'll buy groceries here from time to time.

442
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,780
Can you come again, because Soo-kwang is still...

443
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,150
I'm so clueless.

444
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,390
Soo-kwang.

445
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,900
Are you done delivering the goods?

446
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,850
Brother-in-law.

447
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:03,470
Since we're all done greeting, let's go.

448
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,370
No, I have something to say.

449
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,950
-Seul-bi. Come again later. -Seul-bi.

450
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,200
-Bye. Call me. -I have something to say.

451
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,160
-Let's talk next time. I haven't started yet.

452
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,240
This cruel love triangle.

453
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,520
Young couples these days can still be friends after breaking up.

454
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,920
I can't do that.

455
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,710
Hello, Gong Soo-kwang.

456
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:29,980
The disasters that the witch blocked would be accumulated on the witch's body. As time passes, it will explode one day.

457
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:34,230
That kind of disaster will destroy the witch,

458
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,790
and hurt the people around her.

459
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,070
Why are you here?

460
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,820
My mom wants to eat fried twisted doughnuts, so I came to buy some.

461
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,350
Do you have to buy that yourself?

462
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,380
Ask the hotel staff to buy it. Will they refuse?

463
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,390
Leave now.

464
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,080
Don't be so aggressive.

465
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:04,920
Are you...

466
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,910
okay?

467
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,450
What?

468
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,600
Don't you feel anything strange?

469
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,470
Let's go.

470
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,280
Don't always let her out.

471
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,050
It's none of your business.

472
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:26,730
Seul-bi. She can't meet people.

473
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:30,940
Why? You were the loving couple in the community.

474
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,460
Are you embarrassed?

475
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,670
It's not like that.

476
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,210
I'm sorry, Soo-kwang.

477
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,010
I won't come again.

478
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,250
What?

479
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,820
Mom, what are you doing there?

480
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,810
Whatever. I'm hanging up.

481
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,950
Min-joon, this is bad.

482
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:28,020
My mom went to Geumhwa Hotel.

483
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,740
What?

484
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,540
Hide for now. Quick!

485
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,560
Don't run into my mom. Hurry to hind from her.

486
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,530
I'll go get my mom now.

487
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,270
Hi, Min-joon.

488
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,050
Min-joon.

489
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,760
Hello, Councilor.

490
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,120
Don't call me that.

491
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,740
We're going to be a family soon.

492
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,350
I'm sorry.

493
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,800
Apology is not necessary.

494
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,460
My son-in-law is so polite.

495
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,120
Min-joon.

496
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,330
Jang Kyung is a bit special.

497
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,560
It looks like she's writing a novel now.

498
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,150
You are not an unreliable kid, are you?

499
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:10,330
About breaking off the engagement... Jang Kyung made the decision herself, right?

500
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,970
Councilor, I...

501
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,130
You don't look like a secretary. Then who are you?

502
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,980
Hello.

503
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,080
I'm Min-joon's cousin.

504
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,540
Oh, my. You're the cousin.

505
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,020
Councilor, what's your room number?

506
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,500
I'll visit you later.

507
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,500
That's great.

508
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,950
Why did you say that to Jang Kyung's mom?

509
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,060
I didn't want to make things difficult for you.

510
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,760
I've decided to break off the engagement with Jang Kyung.

511
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,740
I'm dealing with it.

512
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,510
Jang Kyung likes you. It's true.

513
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,950
But I like you. I like you.

514
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,580
Why are you ignoring my feelings?

515
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,930
Then why didn't you say that earlier?

516
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,410
I'm the woman you like.

517
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,310
Just now, in front of that lady, you didn't say that.

518
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,330
Min-joon, this is what you think of me?

519
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,450
There is a holy lamp that will only be taken out when you need.

520
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,970
I'm like a fairy living in it.

521
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,600
(Bang's Chicken)

522
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:57,410
If she's your daughter... You should've talked to her.

523
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,230
No.

524
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,540
Is she really your daughter?

525
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,720
If that's true...

526
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,790
What are you doing?

527
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,390
Do you feel anything?

528
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,080
Do you remember anything?

529
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,270
Numbers, lottery numbers? Tell me if you remember anything.

530
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,680
I don't remember anything.

531
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,460
I guess it's not hereditary.

532
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:33,970
It's bad for your stomach.

533
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:38,730
(Original Fried Chicken)

534
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,880
Soo-kwang.
(Original Fried Chicken)

535
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,040
(Original Fried Chicken)

536
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,090
Are you okay?
(Original Fried Chicken)

537
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,580
Did you drink again?

538
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,810
Where's Seul-bi?

539
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,600
Did she leave?

540
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,330
Goodness. Soo-kwang'll have to deliver all the goods tomorrow morning.

541
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,120
Why did you let him drink so much?

542
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,980
Uncle Jung is the one who dragged us down.

543
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,030
I'm sorry I dragged you down.

544
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:04,460
It's okay. There are times when you're dragging others down.

545
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,610
How can people be perfect without flaws?

546
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,110
Goodness. You said that even if Soo-kwang becomes more hairy,

547
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,760
that was because of his bad luck.

548
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,530
Why are you so generous to Uncle Jung?

549
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,910
Shut up, you brat.

550
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,820
Hey, Mr. Jung. I thought you were a good drinker. I was wrong.

551
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,660
Don't drink too much from now on. Eat up.

552
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,880
I'll give you more snacks next time.

553
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,530
Soo-kwang, help him in.

554
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,300
Thank you.

555
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,850
Bye.

556
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:31,670
-Thank you. -Well.

557
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,630
You're always a burden. Why are you so mean?

558
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,190
When did you ever give us anything?

559
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,980
Boss Park, you always say I should give gifts. Gifts!

560
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,690
What? Is life a gift?

561
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,870
What are you looking at?

562
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,660
What are you talking about?

563
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:49,450
Hey, Ms. Fang. Did you cover your eyes?

564
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,240
It's all covered up.

565
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,970
Mom, what are you doing? It's embarrassing.

566
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,960
Sit down.

567
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:06,070
Does Min-joon have any other cousin besides Dong-sik?
(Note: Cousin and cousin are pronounced the same in Korean.)

568
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,090
No. Why?

569
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,750
She was with Min-joon just now.

570
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,170
She's pretty and considerate.

571
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,830
She must be a cousin.

572
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,460
Min-joon's mom and I are close.

573
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,040
I've never heard of her niece.

574
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,590
Who would talk about her niece whenever she met anyone?

575
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,590
Mom, that's enough. Let's go home.

576
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,199
I'm not getting married.

577
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,469
You're so immature. Why are you doing this?

578
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:37,860
I get angry when I see you.

579
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,570
If you don't marry Min-joon,

580
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:44,350
I won't even give you a penny.

581
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,420
I don't want your money!

582
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,990
Drink this to sober up, uncle Jung.

583
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,970
Thank you, boss.

584
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,980
And don't speak formally to me. You're Seul-bi's father.

585
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,790
As for Seul-bi's mom, I really hated her.

586
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,710
She ruined my life.

587
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,670
Why is she at Chairman Seon Ju-cheol's house?

588
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,050
She even held my hand.

589
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,610
That's why I hated her.

590
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:52,160
When I saw Seul-bi. I found her looks alike her mom.

591
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,600
Do you like Seul-bi?

592
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,840
Don't like her.

593
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,640
Even if you like her, it will change.

594
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,790
She can't live an ordinary life.

595
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,420
Even if you like her, it will change in the end.

596
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,610
When will you bring him?

597
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,910
He's always so self-approbation.

598
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:34,680
He runs a fish shop in the market, with high self-esteem.

599
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,600
He doesn't listen to people's advice easily.

600
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,930
That's what you do.

601
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,140
I've been taking you and Min-joon to barbecue since you were kids.

602
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,630
Min-joon chose beef.

603
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:50,650
You only liked the last dessert, candy which costed just 50 won.

604
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:55,340
Who do you take after? Just 50 won?

605
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,720
Who else?

606
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:57,920
You...

607
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,220
Don't.

608
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:04,860
I'm sure he's already getting nervous. He'll come to me.

609
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,860
Min-joon showed up at the bar with that witch.

610
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,320
How can he not be nervous?

611
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:17,280
Min-joon came out with that witch?

612
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,110
I told you.

613
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,110
Stop eating.

614
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,600
I'm leaving.

615
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,310
Gosh, this guy...

616
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,420
Sam-jung.

617
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,510
I don't care about your family.

618
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:57,680
But I don't know if you know...

619
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:04,210
Are you crazy?

620
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,770
What are you doing?

621
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,240
You took her out to drink with your friends.

622
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,150
What if someone takes pictures of you outside?

623
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,820
How are you going to explain it to Jang Kyung's family?

624
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,440
Are you crazy?

625
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:21,470
Mr. Cha, it's time for my dad to take his medicine. Hurry up.

626
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:23,630
Min-joon.

627
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,170
You...

628
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,430
Sir, I'll talk to him later. Go back to the room.

629
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,430
Why did you buy so much?

630
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,710
I didn't buy them. People in the market sent them to me.

631
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,610
I met a lot of good people in the outside world.

632
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,410
Then why did you come back?

633
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,320
I wanted to go out with you.

634
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:13,550
Try this. It's really delicious.

635
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,850
How is it? Is it good?

636
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,710
I can buy you anything you want.

637
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,360
I can make it for you.

638
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:32,720
Let's go shopping next time. Let's go to Busan too. OK?

639
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,670
Seul-bi, don't stay here.

640
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,780
Go where you want to go.

641
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:44,420
I want you to go back.

642
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,830
Will you go with me?

643
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,780
If you go with me, I'll go.

644
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:54,970
Mom.

645
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,140
Why won't you leave?

646
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,310
It's not that you can't leave. You don't want to leave.

647
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,380
I want to be a mortal too.

648
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,400
But why didn't you become one?

649
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,900
I've lost that chance forever.

650
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,210
Because I was wrong.

651
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,950
What did you do?

652
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,700
Good morning, Soo-kwang.

653
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,270
How's my makeup?

654
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:47,420
I learned it online. It's a style of the head girl.

655
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,060
It's the trend these days, but she keeps saying it's embarrassing.

656
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,330
Oh, Hyun-tae. Hi.

657
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,240
Yes.

658
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,660
Yes, it's cool.

659
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,180
Right?

660
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:55,910
Soo-kwang.

661
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,060
Boss Park.

662
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,120
What's going on?

663
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,340
Your eyes are bruised and your face is covered so much.

664
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,290
You should know something...

665
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,570
Goodness.

666
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,590
Soo-kwang. I need your help.

667
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,830
Boss Park, that's enough.

668
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:13,460
Others will think Soo-kwang works at the Chamber of Commerce in the Seodong Market.

669
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,780
Are you going to pay him?

670
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,190
It will be good if you can pay him.

671
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,710
No need.

672
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,610
I need to get fresh from the truck.

673
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,960
Jung is here.

674
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,280
Okay, I'll go get it.

675
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,220
Boss, no. Soo-kwang made me dried pollack soup.

676
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,530
My stomach feels much better.

677
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,370
Hyun-tae, be careful! Your waist!

678
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:36,460
Mom, I'm so embarrassed.

679
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,910
How is that embarrassing?

680
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,630
Soo-kwang, let's talk something important inside.

681
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,890
Let's go inside.

682
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:47,380
This is the proposal for the renovation of the Seodong Market.

683
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,740
According to this condition,

684
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,420
it can lend money to other businessmen on better terms.

685
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,270
-The executor is the Superstar Holding Company. -Yes.

686
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,360
Wait.

687
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,060
Is this company related to the Superstar Loan?

688
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:03,430
Yes. The Superstar Holding Company manages the Superstar Loan.

689
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,810
But with this proposal...

690
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,610
Why? Is anything wrong?

691
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,740
I need to meet the CEO of this company.

692
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:19,850
Who? Why is a small market so troublesome?

693
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:23,410
Okay, okay.

694
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,160
My stomach.

695
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,910
Why do I get diarrhea whenever I eat crab?

696
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,050
(Superstar)

697
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:06,200
The big shot is the chairman of Eunseong Capital.

698
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,250
(The big shot is the chairman of Eunseong Capital Capital)
The big shot is the chairman of Eunseong Capital.

699
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:14,850
-There is a heart. The boss's secretary, right? -Darn it.

700
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:17,380
Bro, you are wrong. This way.

701
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,300
We have to collect the money.

702
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,450
Seon Il-jung, the chairman of Eunseong Capital?

703
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,970
Isn't he Seon Sam-jung, the chairman of Geumhwa Group?

704
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,530
Yes.

705
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:30,400
Did Eunseong Capital look for Seul-bi?

706
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:35,060
One side is Seon Il-jung, and the other is the Seon Sam-jung.

707
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,010
Are they fighting for Seul-fei?

708
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,330
Well, how great is Seul-bi?

709
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,290
Two chairmen had a fight because of her?

710
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,390
Be quiet.

711
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,300
Come to me

712
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,220
when you really want Seul-bi to be a mortal.

713
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:58,300
It's dangerous to leave Seul-bi alone.

714
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,900
Brother. Can you find out more about Chairman Seon Il-jung?

715
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:07,730
Sure. I don't like him anyway.

716
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:11,730
He's the one who hired a gangster like our boss.

717
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:16,590
-Do you think he'll let go of the prey he likes? -That's right.

718
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,870
I'll give her a chance to go out alone.

719
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,030
Darn it.

720
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:33,360
Take her outside no matter what you do.

721
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,710
I'm just taking a walk in a hotel.

722
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,290
Let the bodyguards follow you please.

723
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,120
-I'll call you when I'm done. -Okay.

724
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,050
(She's out.)

725
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:12,290
Okay, let's meet the witch.

726
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,990
Who is this?

727
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,550
Team Leader, shouldn't we go?

728
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,770
It's okay. Let him be.

729
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:40,800
You're Soo-kwang's girlfriend. No. You're Min-joon's girlfriend, right?

730
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,150
Are you following me?

731
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:47,190
It's just a coincidence. I have something to tell you.

732
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,380
-Do you have money? -What?

733
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:55,060
-Fee for divination. -You are so sensible.

734
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,220
Of course I have.

735
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:02,720
Can I get a wet tissue?

736
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,310
It'll be more accurate if I clean my hands?

737
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:20,270
I'm really nervous.

738
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,230
-Chinese restaurant. -What?

739
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:51,130
Eat dumplings at a Chinese restaurant tomorrow.

740
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,730
Chinese restaurant?

741
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,370
Will anything happen there?

742
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,140
Fee for divination.

743
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,600
Oh, fee for divination.

744
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:07,630
Do you think I'll be lucky if I eat dumplings at a Chinese restaurant?

745
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:13,330
Which Chinese restaurant should I go?

746
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:21,450
Seul-bi.

747
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,760
-Seul-bi, what's wrong? -Mom.

748
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,370
Whose hand did you hold?

749
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:34,510
Sun Dong-sik.

750
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:36,530
What did you see?

751
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,380
Snake.

752
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:44,650
I saw the coiled snake that covets the weak.

753
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:45,960
Ignore him.

754
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:47,670
Why?

755
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:52,250
Sometimes, you should do nothing to the little snakes.

756
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,470
Because it'll get bigger and eventually become a monster.

757
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:55,990
How can you turn a blind eye

758
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,520
when you see someone innocent becomes unfortunate.

759
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,300
Seul-bi.

760
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,400
You said the same thing that day.

761
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,440
Just ignore it.

762
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:05,350
That's why Soo-kwang's mom died.

763
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:10,910
If you can see the future, when my mom died,

764
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,520
I'm sure you saw it that day.

765
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,360
You should've told me before my mom died

766
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,010
so that I could avoid the accident.

767
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:19,210
But why did you just stand by that day? Why?

768
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,060
I'm sorry, Mom.

769
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:31,160
There are things we can't stop even if we know the future.

770
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:36,470
And we can't know all the future.

771
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,910
The future you see is just a short moment.

772
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:43,890
When every single moments stays together,

773
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:47,060
no one knows what will happen eventually in the future.

774
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,030
So be careful.

775
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:11,680
Hello.

776
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,810
Soo-kwang.

777
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,610
Mom, he's Soo-kwang, right?

778
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,480
It's said that men rely on clothes.
(Note: Dress is Wings (literal translation))

779
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:28,040
No. He's an angel with wings.

780
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,270
You crazy jerk.

781
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:32,860
-Mom. You have no right to look at me like that. What?

782
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,290
Hello, Hyun-tae.

783
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,530
-You must live with your son-in-law. -Mom.

784
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,300
He's so charming.

785
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,690
-Mom. -Be quiet.

786
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,170
He is so charming.

787
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,830
-Let's eat. -Okay.

788
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:08,290
What a feast.

789
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:13,970
-When we were eating dumplings. Something interesting will happen. -Something interesting.

790
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:17,910
Yes, we're experiencing the skills of a witch.

791
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:26,790
-Mr. Park, please enjoy. -Okay.

792
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:30,540
Have some, Mr. Kong. The dumplings here are delicious.

793
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,260
-Let's eat. -Okay.

794
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,840
I read the traditional market modification proposal.

795
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:41,520
Your conditions for loans are very attractive.

796
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,810
That's the philosophy of our company.

797
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:49,030
Although for this modification project, the government will donate 70 percent.

798
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:51,030
The merchants have to share 1.5 billion won.

799
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:55,500
1.5 billion won? How can we have so much money?

800
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,520
That's why we proceed from the whole situation. I'll loan you at the cheapest price.

801
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:04,010
In that case, it will be free.

802
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:10,640
Then you'll take the filthy lucre?

803
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:20,180
Filthy lucre? You think we're hooligans?

804
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:24,160
Sir, please calm down. Let's hear him out first.

805
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:29,160
I found that the construction organizer's authority was delegated to you.

806
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,740
No. The executioner can only meet the construction organizer

807
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,810
and change the schedule

808
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:36,560
then compensate the merchants,

809
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:39,750
so that things can go smoothly.

810
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,310
This is how you got bribes

811
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:44,140
from the construction organizer.

812
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:48,300
You even exaggerated the construction fee and took money from merchants in traditional markets outside of town.

813
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,350
There are many markets that were scammed.

814
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:52,310
What? Really?

815
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:53,630
No.

816
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:57,590
There are times when you need more funds for construction.

817
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:59,460
So what do you want?

818
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:03,010
Besides, the pre-sale rights of the new store isn't ruled clearly.

819
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:06,570
In that case, that you'll gain profits from the sale of new shops.

820
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:09,370
As for loss,

821
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,810
it will be covered by our merchants.

822
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:12,720
Darn it.

823
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,570
-You liar. -Calm down. Calm down.

824
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:21,940
Mr. Park and this young boss are nice.

825
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,160
I'll make an exception and give you a good suggestion.

826
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,700
I can't just make money myself.

827
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:33,720
How about I share it with you?

828
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,750
Is it too little?

829
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:38,250
I'll give you the pre-sale rights of the new store.

830
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,440
As for the loan, proceeding from the whole situation, I won't take your interest.

831
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,180
No. I don't want to get involved in anillegal behavior.

832
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:51,210
Sir.

833
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,300
It's so refreshing just listening.

834
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,170
How can a loan company lend money without interest?

835
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,880
Sun Dong-sik, why did you come out from there?

836
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,070
I'll take care of this first.

837
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,900
Sir, please listen to me.

838
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:12,800
-Mr. Choi. -Yes?

839
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:17,660
You know my dad hates using money to cheat him.

840
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,590
Do you know that?

841
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:24,340
But how dare you use my dad's money casually.

842
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:28,080
You didn't even report it to your superiors.

843
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,310
Did you take all the money you earned?

844
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:32,270
Sir.

845
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:34,200
Come in, Mr. Yeom.

846
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,660
Sir, please listen to me.

847
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,570
Take him away.

848
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:39,890
-Take him away. -Yes, sir.

849
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:42,730
-Let's go. -Sir.

850
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:46,560
Sir, I gave you a lot during the merger.

851
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,870
and we manipulated the stock price, sir.

852
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:50,170
Hey, don't go.

853
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:56,310
I don't know what he's talking about.

854
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:04,180
Soo-kwang, you have to come to me. It's not too late to change your mind.

855
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:08,420
Come to our company, okay?

856
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:12,480
Did Eunseong Capital look for Seul-bi?

857
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,940
One side is Seon Il-jung, and the other is Seon Sam-jung.

858
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:19,130
Are they fighting for Seul-fei?

859
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,530
-Don't you want to come to our company? -No.

860
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:27,740
I'm disappointed.

861
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,690
-Let's go, Mr. Park. -Okay.

862
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,700
Next time we meet, we'll just chat. Stop talking about work.

863
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:49,540
-Okay. Just say a person who's not loyal to your CEO. -What?

864
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,870
Good job.

865
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:58,790
-Seul-bi. -Hello.

866
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:00,870
Why are you here again?

867
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,520
I'll get going. Come back later.

868
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,930
-See you later. -Bye.

869
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:17,390
Let's eat together.

870
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:25,960
-Seul-bi. -Okay?

871
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,800
Okay. Let's eat together.

872
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:38,250
-Hello. -Chief Wang.

873
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:40,090
Why is Mr. Park here?

874
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:44,230
Is this Chinese restaurant famous? Am I the only one who doesn't know?

875
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:47,130
-Its dumplings are famous. The dumplings here... -What dumplings?

876
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,960
Seul-fei asked me to meet here.

877
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,870
-Seul-bi? -Yes.

878
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,100
Seul-bi planned all this to teach him a lesson.

879
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:02,090
-What? -Nothing. Just do your best.

880
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:03,940
What?

881
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:10,110
Hello, the reservation person is Seul-bi.

882
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:12,100
-Seul-bi? -Yes.

883
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,310
-Okay. Follow me. -Okay.

884
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,910
Find someone useful.

885
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:26,810
Chief Wang.

886
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,450
Excuse me. I think you made a mistake.

887
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:32,510
-It's this room. -What?

888
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:35,460
It's him, bro.

889
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:41,080
Enjoy the dumplings he bought.

890
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,900
(Enjoy the dumplings he bought)
Enjoy the dumplings he bought.

891
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,320
Enjoy the dumplings he bought.

892
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:45,860
Buy him some dumplings.

893
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,010
(Buy him some dumplings)
Buy him some dumplings.

894
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:48,970
Buy him some dumplings.

895
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,170
Who is he?

896
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:55,710
He's Wang Yun-ho, the manager of the branch in Rudong Market of Superstar Loan.

897
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:57,300
Then why didn't you mention him earlier?

898
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:01,190
-Is he loyal to your CEO? -No. Never.

899
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:04,570
-Because his class is low. -Yeah.

900
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:06,110
Low class?

901
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:12,310
We need fresh blood to reorganize the organization.

902
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:15,400
And we're old friends, right?

903
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:19,690
Really? I don't remember.

904
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:22,450
But who is he?

905
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:25,560
This is Sun Dong-sik of Eunseong Capital.

906
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,400
Hello.

907
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:43,650
-Did you come here because you knew I was here? -Yes.

908
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:45,950
Why?

909
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:50,980
You went to the market a few days ago and you're here today.

910
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,390
Why are you doing this?

911
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:57,490
Soo-kwang, Min-joon, you helped me a lot.

912
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:01,220
I've only accepted it, but I've never repaid you.

913
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,600
-No. -No.

914
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:13,250
When I knew nothing about the outside world and couldn't get used to it, you took care of me and helped me.

915
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:14,730
Thank you, Soo-kwang.

916
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,790
Min-joon. You helped me to see my mother again.

917
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:22,450
And with your help, I can come and go freely. Thank you.

918
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:28,510
You'll feel awkward when you're together, right?

919
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,380
But I really want to treat you to a delicious meal.

920
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,910
Actually, I thought about inviting each of you out, respectively.

921
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:37,990
No, it's good to eat together.

922
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:40,340
Thank you for understanding.

923
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:44,290
I bought this with the money I earned. So eat up.

924
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:48,530
How did you make that money?

925
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,680
-By fee for divination. -What?

926
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:57,130
Did you open a fortune-telling store for her at the hotel?

927
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:00,730
No. I didn't let her do it.

928
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,470
I didn't even give her money to read my fortune.

929
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:06,870
It's the worst if others don't pay when I tell their fortune.

930
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,490
-I can't eat. -Me too.

931
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:15,750
Eat. I bought these with my hard-earned money.

932
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,540
You have to eat.

933
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,350
Eat up.

934
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:30,850
-Who did you tell fortune for? Sun Dong-sik.

935
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,950
Sun Dong-sik, that jerk...

936
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:36,720
Why did you do that for him?

937
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,190
Yes, because I told his fortune,

938
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,970
Seodong Market is safe.

939
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,850
Eat up.

940
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:58,410
Seul-bi. You can't always read others' fortune.

941
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:00,550
You'll be in danger.

942
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,730
Soo-kwang, thank you for your concern.

943
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:28,400
The reporters surrounded the PR department.

944
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:32,950
Not only did they say you broke off your engagement with Jang Kyung,

945
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:37,750
but also some reporters even asked me if I had a mental history.

946
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:41,210
These aren't just fabricated.

947
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:55,140
What are you trying to do with my son?

948
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,600
I'm doing what Min-joon wants.

949
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:03,460
-What do you think he wants? -What?

950
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,570
Do you have the right to talk to Seul-bi?

951
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:49,750
(Preview of the next episode)

952
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:54,960
-From now on, Soo-kwang is our lucky man in the Seodong Market. -That's right.

953
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,740
You're really obsessed with that girl. How dare you drag your dad into this?

954
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,330
What are you thinking?

955
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:04,090
-Do you want to take away the management rights from your father? -Yes.

956
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:06,230
You're always like this.

957
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:10,470
I really want to give it a try. "Control" what you said.

958
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:12,370
Remember this.

959
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:14,660
If she can't become a mortal soon,

960
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,920
she might become a witch.
