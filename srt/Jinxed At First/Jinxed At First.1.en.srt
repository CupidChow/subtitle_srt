1
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,860
Mom.

2
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,630
Why do we have to live here?

3
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,680
Where should I start to tell you?

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,500
The story has started

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,590
since long ago,

6
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,360
which is your great grandma's grandma's age.

7
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,720
Long time ago,

8
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,560
a group of women could see the future of the person in front of them through touching him.

9
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,480
Pigeon!

10
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,560
Flying arrows.

11
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,390
It's inevitable.

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,080
If we can predict the future in advance, we will avoid the bad luck

13
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,800
and bring the good luck.

14
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,250
I will give birth to a daughter.

15
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,200
Then I will make her the princess.

16
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,509
No one knows where these women came from.

17
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,970
But their abilities will be passed on to their daughters.

18
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,370
For hundreds of years, they've been accompanying the emperors as prophets.

19
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,720
They witnessed the kingdom collapsed.

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,180
The world was in chaos.

21
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,180
The witch left the palace and sneaked into the world.

22
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,970
After that,

23
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,350
the war broke out.

24
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,790
The woman who inherited the blood of the witch found someone who could protect her.

25
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,730
Take me away.

26
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,990
No matter what you want,

27
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,420
I will all help you get.

28
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,810
(Congratulations on the completion of Jinhua Hotel)

29
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,310
The man who took the woman away
(Congratulations on the completion of Jinhua Hotel)

30
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,329
achieved great success during wars

31
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,870
and enjoyed a luxurious life ever after.

32
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,460
He secretly took the woman to a secret spot,

33
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,360
and considered her as his own lucky charm.

34
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,070
In this way, this woman and her child,

35
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,110
and her child's child

36
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,400
are still isolated from the world,

37
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,670
living somewhere in this world.

38
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,270
(Episode 1)

39
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,590
Chairman.

40
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,089
Something happened on the Prince Zamil of Shalike Group.

41
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:23,400
They will postpone the signing ceremony with Jinhua Biotech Company,

42
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,150
On the day of the signing ceremony?

43
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,050
Without any reasons?

44
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,720
We are still investigating,

45
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,020
but there's no information got yet.

46
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,120
Even the institutional investors have withdrawn their investment.

47
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,040
Only by promoting the investment contract with Shalike Group,

48
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,110
Jinhua Biotech Company can be established as planned.

49
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,390
Leave us alone.

50
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,550
The chairman is going inside.

51
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,800
Nice to meet you.

52
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,220
Give him your bag.

53
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,810
Shaking hands.

54
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,330
That man...

55
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,070
Chairman Seon II-joong.

56
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,180
Check whether Seon II-joong of Yinsheng Capital

57
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,860
have met the Shalike Group.

58
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,280
I heard that Chairman Seon II-joong, together with the Sincerity Pharmaceutical Company,

59
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,240
contacted and bribed Prince Zamir's henchman.

60
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,300
We've got the video, and sent it to Prince Zamir.

61
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,460
Prince Zamir said

62
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,350
he would sign an investment contract with us as planned.

63
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,580
That's a relief.

64
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,770
Hello, Sir.

65
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,850
Cham-jung.

66
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,710
Do you only know how to block my way?

67
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,870
How is that possible?

68
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,800
We're the first to push forward the investment project.

69
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,409
Why did you suddenly come to the biological industry?

70
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:37,429
You can do it, why can't I?

71
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,830
Why won't you give me a share?

72
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,220
You used dirty tricks to steal Jinhua.

73
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,640
With time passing by,

74
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,580
now you feel no guilt at all, don't you?

75
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,750
Even 20 years ago, I didn't feel guilty.

76
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,560
No matter back then or at present,

77
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,730
as for playing dirty tricks,

78
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,990
you're the more talented one.

79
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,690
How disrespectful

80
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,270
this guy is!

81
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,520
What?

82
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,960
That girl has grown up a lot.

83
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,950
It's time for her to awaken gradually.

84
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,210
You have to pay close attention to her.

85
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,890
Don't let anyone touch her.

86
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,250
This one.
(Where Did a Coin Go?)

87
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:36,560
And this one. We won't accept any of them.

88
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,420
(How to Make Money with Cookies)
And this one. We won't accept any of them.

89
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,030
Law, economy, politics, social and psychological related books are all not allowed to read.

90
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,590
How many times do I have to tell you?

91
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,960
What are you waiting for? Get out.

92
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,140
Seul-bi.

93
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,520
New books.

94
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,600
Books.

95
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,680
What's all this?

96
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,570
I've read all of these.

97
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,950
And this one, I've read 179 times.

98
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,050
(Animal Illustrations, Jellyfish)
And this one, I've read 179 times.

99
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,410
But that book is old, this one is new.

100
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,530
Once the immortal jellyfish gets old,

101
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,980
as if time can go back, they'll return to the immature stage.

102
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,840
In comparison with humans, it is like the rejuvenation.

103
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,930
And they will grow again.

104
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,310
Because they will repeat the process infinitely,

105
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,100
so as long as they don't get eaten, they'll be able to survive and live forever.

106
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,800
Wow, this place is amazing.

107
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,360
Min-joon.

108
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,470
Can we drink them all?

109
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,040
Will we be scolded by my uncle?

110
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,350
My dad went to a seminar in Busan.

111
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,300
He won't be back by tomorrow.

112
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,360
Nice.

113
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,660
Hello? So just Chairman Seon and you live here alone?

114
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,410
Ever since my mom passed away,

115
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,860
my dad said it's comfortable living here.

116
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,170
Wow, Seon Min-joon.

117
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,010
How does it feel to live in a luxury hotel?

118
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,370
It feels like a boarding house.

119
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,690
Many people live together.

120
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,010
We'll be served food when it's dining time.

121
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,710
Min-joon, let me stay here too.

122
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,550
Why don't we switch our dads?

123
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,310
Hey.

124
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,430
No way.

125
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,430
My sister is engaged to the only son of Jinhua Hotel.

126
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,000
If it were the only son of Yinsheng Capital,

127
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,590
I feel like my sister will suffer a loss.

128
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,210
Gong Soo-kwang, what are you doing?

129
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,190
Get down.

130
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,300
-Soo-kwang, come here. -Okay.

131
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,020
Seul-bi.

132
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,000
What are you doing?

133
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,380
Come here.

134
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,550
If you keep doing this, I'll tell Chairman Seon.

135
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,220
Despicable!

136
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,830
Despicable! Multiply 100!

137
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,160
-Cheers! -Cheers!

138
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,790
What?

139
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,280
-Oh. -Soo-kwang.

140
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,840
Are you raising fish?

141
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,500
Are you?

142
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,370
Are you raising fish?

143
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,510
I can't drink anymore. Really.

144
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,400
Little mermaid.

145
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,920
Do you really want to become a human?

146
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,670
You can become a human if you get a kiss from the prince,

147
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,900
but if you can't have it, you'll become a bubble.

148
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,200
Mom.

149
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,110
When can I meet the prince?

150
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,570
When you grow up.

151
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,090
Will Chairman Seon let me meet the prince?

152
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,280
When?

153
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,630
When? I'm already a grown-up.

154
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,360
-Seul-bi. -Yes?

155
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,690
Meeting the prince

156
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,350
may not necessarily mean happiness.

157
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,380
Mom.

158
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,270
That's a fairy tale book.

159
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,570
Seul-bi.

160
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,030
Mi-soo needs to get some rest.

161
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,450
Seul-bi, you should take a nap too.

162
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,300
I'm not sleepy at all.

163
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,340
Soo-kwang is amazing.

164
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,680
With Jinhua Group's scholarship, you keep reading from middle school to college.

165
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,450
He's already worked in the company

166
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,610
before graduation.

167
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,110
Hey, Soo-kwang.

168
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,280
You'll have to be loyal to Min-joon for the rest of your life.

169
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,060
That's because Soo-kwang is excellent.

170
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,310
Do you think anyone can get the first place at Department of Economics and Management of Korea University?

171
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,170
Only our company can hire such a talent.

172
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,970
So, be degraded, Gong Soo-kwang.

173
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,720
Hey, it's boring. Turn on the music.

174
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,310
What's that sound?

175
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,480
I don't know.

176
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,330
Open your mouth.

177
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,930
Every time I take this,

178
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,910
I become sleepy.

179
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,390
Bang, bang, bang.

180
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,140
The elephants are the largest animals on land.

181
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,180
The elephants hunt with their long noses.

182
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,170
This is not an elephant!

183
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,370
It's human!

184
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,380
People.

185
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,060
Stand still.

186
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,250
Say hello.

187
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,340
These are my friends.

188
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,330
I'm Seon Dong-sik.

189
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:09,920
He's...

190
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,840
You crazy jerk.

191
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,780
What are you doing?

192
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,550
It's boring for us to play alone.

193
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,790
It's time to have some fun.

194
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,230
We were just drinking just now.

195
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,170
Hello.

196
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,160
Jang-geun, what are you doing over there?

197
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,190
You have to come out.

198
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,060
And say hello.

199
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,120
I knew it. Come out.

200
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,090
It's no joke. Hello. Hello.

201
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,820
Hello. Nice to meet you.

202
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,960
These two will follow Jang-geun.

203
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,940
You two can follow him this way.

204
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,930
Isn't the atmosphere good?

205
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,820
What shall we do now? Drinking!

206
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,970
But this wine...

207
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,470
The prince?

208
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,410
Min-joon, what are you doing there?

209
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,280
Why are you standing still?

210
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,750
You're the one who is most like my uncle here. Come here.

211
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,390
Hello, Mom.

212
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,240
Are you in the dorm?

213
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,310
I came out to hang out with my friends.

214
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,130
Why?

215
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,440
Nothing.

216
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,670
Have fun.

217
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,480
Remember to eat on time.

218
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,880
Do you want me to visit you?

219
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,950
No.

220
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,200
No need to visit. I don't want to disturb you.

221
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,859
I just need to hear my son's voice.

222
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,530
It's okay. I'm not studying anyway.

223
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,650
I'm going home now.

224
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,020
Do you want to get some fresh air?

225
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,920
I'll make you your favorite fried cuttlefish.

226
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,790
Okay.

227
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,960
See you later.

228
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,260
You scared me.

229
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,950
Seul-bi.

230
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,050
Seul-bi.

231
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,940
Hey.

232
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,390
-Aren't you going to pay? -What?

233
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,050
Hey.

234
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,330
Why didn't you say anything?

235
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,000
You have to pay for the bus.

236
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,550
Oh, she's with you? Okay.

237
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,060
It's moving. It's moving.

238
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,690
I want some too.

239
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,540
Cuttlefish.

240
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,530
At the Lucky Fish Shop.

241
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,700
Soo-kwang's Shop.

242
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,930
Our shop's name

243
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,050
and my name,

244
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,600
how did you know them?

245
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,410
Look over there.

246
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,400
You followed me from the hotel, right?

247
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,140
Are you staying at Jinhua Hotel?

248
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,020
Are your parents there too?

249
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,160
Why are you following me?

250
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,220
Prince.

251
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,010
Get off at the next stop and go back.

252
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,450
I'll take you home.

253
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,950
No.

254
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,360
What should we do, Ms. Min?

255
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,490
We can't find her.

256
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,120
Put them on.

257
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,680
It's beautiful.

258
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,100
(Lucky Fish Shop)

259
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,530
Hello.

260
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:02,920
You're a saury, the warm-water fish from the beloniformes of Scomberesocidae, right?

261
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,600
You're...

262
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,860
a squid of the cephalopoda.

263
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,920
Hello. Nice to meet you.

264
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,590
I'm Seul-bi.

265
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,380
Do your parents work at an institute of oceanology?

266
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,160
Soo-kwang.

267
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,340
-Oh my son! -Mom!

268
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,040
My dear son.

269
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,830
Look at me. I smell fishy.

270
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,760
It's okay.

271
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,230
I love the smell of Mom.

272
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,300
I missed you so much.

273
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,860
I miss you so much too.

274
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,120
How are you doing?

275
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,430
Let me see, my dear son.

276
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,240
Oh my, your...

277
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,520
Your shoes...

278
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,380
Who is this lady?

279
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,740
I'm hungry.

280
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,790
What?

281
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,060
Oh my!

282
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,560
Squid.

283
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,300
Yummy. Yummy. Yummy.

284
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,910
Thank you for enjoying the food.

285
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,990
Eat slowly, please.

286
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,160
I have to send her home after dinner.

287
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,850
I'm not leaving.

288
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,160
I want to stay here with Soo-kwang.

289
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,890
Why did you keep calling me Soo-kwang?

290
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,170
Hey.

291
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,860
Your parents must be waiting for you.

292
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,230
Can you eat more?

293
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:22,930
Goodness.

294
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,290
It's okay.

295
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,980
Eat more please.

296
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,540
Blue fish.

297
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,430
Perciformes.

298
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,710
Mackerels!

299
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,730
Hey! Hey!

300
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,680
What's wrong with her?

301
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,500
Mackerels!

302
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,030
-Hey! -Mackerels!

303
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,450
-Hey, what's wrong? -We need a lot of mackerel.

304
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,870
-Here's the mackerel. Why? -Do you want mackerel?

305
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,020
A lot of mackerels.

306
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,300
Do you want mackerel?

307
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,130
No, no.

308
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,810
They need a lot of mackerels.

309
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,290
How many mackerels do you have?

310
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,930
We need about 100.

311
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,540
We don't have that much in our store.

312
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,530
Yes. We have!

313
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,060
Someone ordered a lot yesterday. But they suddenly canceled the order.

314
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,810
I was worried that the fish would be scrapped in a few more days.

315
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,380
I'm so lucky.

316
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,740
I should be the lucky one.

317
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,430
I'm a nutritionist at school.

318
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,270
But the delivery company is in trouble today, so they can't come.

319
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,820
Thanks to you, we can provide food to the kids at school today.

320
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,090
Pack them up please.

321
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,220
-Okay, Mom. -Mackerels...

322
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,560
Okay, over there.

323
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,940
Mackerel. Mackerel.

324
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,570
Miss,

325
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,400
how did you know...

326
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,910
I'm not Miss. I'm Seul-bi.

327
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,570
Okay, Seul-bi.

328
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,710
Oh, my.

329
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,790
Don't tell me that you're...

330
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,800
Mom, should I just put these in?

331
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,830
Okay.

332
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,110
Let me do it.

333
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,300
Here.

334
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,110
Here.

335
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,280
Bye.

336
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,300
Take care.

337
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,820
Try these on.

338
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,610
They should fit your feet.

339
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,270
They are just right.

340
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,000
So pretty.

341
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,230
Aren't they beautiful?

342
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,580
The shoes suit you so well.

343
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,450
Mom.

344
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,880
Since you have such nice shoes, why haven't you worn them?

345
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,400
You always wear the old shoes.

346
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,540
I'm going to wear them at a nice place.

347
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,250
But I didn't get the chance to wear them.

348
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,640
I wore these shoes before

349
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,670
when I went to the amusement park with Soo-kwang and his dad.

350
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,540
So I only have happy memories in the shoes.

351
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,230
Amusement park.

352
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:35,720
The train there can turn upside down in the sky, right?

353
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,520
And there's a huge ship like a swing.

354
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,300
That's the place, right?

355
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,090
Yes.

356
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,570
I want to go too.

357
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,670
I'm going to the amusement park with these shoes on.

358
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,570
You're making me dizzy.

359
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,220
Hey, where are you going?

360
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,000
Mom.

361
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,440
I have to send her back to Jinhua Hotel.

362
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,720
Okay.

363
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,640
-Come out. -Amusement park.

364
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,790
Mom, when I get paid, I'll buy you the best shoes.

365
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,400
You can put them on and we'll go to nice places.

366
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,870
Okay, thank you, my dear son.

367
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,140
Send her home.

368
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,300
Take care.

369
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,360
Bye, Mom.

370
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,510
Bye.

371
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,280
Bye.

Here we go.

374
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,680
Smile, Soo-kwang.

375
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,750
Thank you so much.

376
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,000
Look over there. What's that?

377
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,460
You're driving me crazy.

378
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,010
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

379
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,730
-You want me to throw them out? -Yes.

380
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,010
Hurry up.

381
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,360
Drink up. Drink up.

382
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,900
-Cheers. -Cheers.

Okay.

00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,730
Seul-bi is missing.

388
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,060
Go back to Seoul now.

389
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,630
Wow, amusement park.

390
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,790
It's an amusement park.

391
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,130
It's open again?

392

(The amusement park reopens now. It's free today.)

393

Amusement park!

394
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,010
Wait.

395
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,860
This is a merry-go-round.

396
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,640
Amusement park.

397
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,420
Wow.

398

You're a prince.

399

What? So childish.

400
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,140
All right, let's go.

401
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,870
There's no one here. I'm scared.

402
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,110
Let's go.

403
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,330
No! Come here!

404
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:45,000
What are you doing?

405
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,010
Dad.

406
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,250
Uncle, you're back.

407
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,560
What are you doing here?

408
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,450
We were just drinking.

409
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:58,350
Who else is here?

410
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,260
Just us.

411
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,100
Get out!

412
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,870
I'm sorry, Uncle.

413
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,920
-But... -Get out now.

414
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:17,050
Wait in the corridor.

415

Where is your daughter?

416
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,800
She's been locked up here for 20 years since she was born.

417
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,340
So where is she now?

418
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,320
Since she has nowhere to go,

419
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,570
she will come back.

420
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,100
Are you sure?

421
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,280
She's on her way back.

422
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,580
Go inside.

423
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,560
Wait. Who are you?

424
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,400
Soo-kwang, it's you.

425
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,150

427
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,870
What are you doing?

00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,420
You ungrateful jerk!

429
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,720
What's wrong?

430
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,560
Send the guest's child back to the guest room.

431
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,530
Yes, sir.

432
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,130
He attempted to kidnap the client's child.

433
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,150
Take him to the police station.

434
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,920
Dad, you misunderstood.

435
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,470
Soo-kwang just came to hang out with me.

436
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,340
Take him to the police station.

437
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,480
Take him away.

438
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,630
Yes.

439
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,450
Soo-kwang.

440
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,800
Confiscate his phone.

441
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,790
Dad.

442
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,570
Chairman.

443
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,990
Confiscate it.

444
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:32,460
Mom, I saw... I saw Soo-kwang's future.

445
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,690
Soo-kwang.

446
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,730
Follow me.

447
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,680
Who are they?

448
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,600
Prophets.

449
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,640
What?

450
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,390
She's yours.

451
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,740
From now on, she will stop your bad luck

452
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,280
and bring you good luck.

453
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,830
So no one can see her

454
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,340
or touch her.

455
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,440
She's a lucky charm that only exists for you.

456
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,920
So no one can take her away.

457
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,580
Tell me your mom's number.

458
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,360
You should ask your family to come.

459
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,820
Tell me your mom's number.

460
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,140
I'm from Jinhua Group.

Your entry into Jinhua Group has been canceled.

00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,700
It's okay.

467
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,980
It's okay, Soo-kwang.

468
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,220
That's not the only company in the world.

469
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,660
I'm sure you will be hired

470
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,830
by a better company because of your skills.

471
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:19,680
My son has always been great.

472
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,200
As long as you're safe, everything will be fine.

473
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,870
Mom!

474
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,260
Mom!

475
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:12,230
Mom!

(Central Operating Room)

479
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,990
Well, the truck driver confessed his fatigue driving.

480
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,400
He said he couldn't remember the details.

481
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,210
It's done. They won't suspect us. Also,

482

I've dealt with of Ms. Min who took care of Seul-bi.

Sir, a portion of gizzards, please.

Min-joon, Soo-gwang is dead.

487
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,230
It was said that it was suicide.

488
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,090
He only left his suicide note and shoes.

489
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,480
We couldn't find his body.

490
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:59,030
-Dad! -You ungrateful jerk!

491
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,200
He attempted to kidnap a client's child.

492
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,730
Take him to the police station.

493
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:05,810
Dad.

Are you drunk in front of your dad?

Dad, my friend Soo-kwang is dead.

499
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:24,570
Should I cry?

500
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,190
What did you mean by that?

501
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,040
She's yours.

502
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:35,280
So no one can see her

503

or touch her.

504

506

take good care of your belongings.

507
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,760
Dad, did you really do it?

508
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,900
Dad, answer me.

509
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,600

00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,310
Min-joon, go.

512
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,160
-Answer me. -Get up.

513
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,390
Dad!

514
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:07,580
Answer me! Dad!

515
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,180
Dad!

516
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,190
He disappeared completely. Mind your daughter's business.

517
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,280
If it happens again...

518
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,420
Will my daughter die too?

519
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,700
No. So all of things that have happened before

520
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,990
are all your faults.

521
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,140
No.

522
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:13,630
He's not dead. Soo-kwang is not dead.

523
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,570
You are finally awake.

524
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,450
You've been in a coma for three days.

525
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:04,740
Where am I?

526
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,030
When I took the net, it's so heavy that I couldn't even stand up.

527
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,240
I thought I would be rich.

528
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:14,190
I thought I was going to catch whales or sharks.

529
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,060
But I have bad luck. I caught a bloody guy.

530
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,420
I thought you were being chased,

531
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,320
so I called a doctor I know

532
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,600
to treat you.

533
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,420
You heard so much. You should thank me.

534
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:36,250
You shouldn't care about me. Just let me die.

535
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,760
Your mom passed away, and you owed a lot of money.

536
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,110
So you committed suicide pessimistically.

537
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,850
Are you the person on the newspaper?

538
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:51,520
But I don't think it was suicide.

539
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,470
Who was trying to kill you?

540
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,720
(A man in his 20s is very pessimistic. Under a massive burden of debt and his mother's death, he jumped into the sea and chose to die.)

541
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:20,560
Mom, I miss Soo-kwang.

542
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,960
Seul-bi.

543
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,010
Why are we living like this?

544
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,540
Why are you living like this?

Seul-bi.

546
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:39,060
I want to be an ordinary person.

547
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:44,500
I want to be an ordinary person and live in the outside world.

548
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,220
Seul-bi, it's time to get injection.

549
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,610
What are you doing?

550
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,420
Mom! Mom!

551
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,490
Take her out.

552
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,220
-No! -Mom!

553
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,290
-Take her out. -Seul-bi.

554
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:11,300
-Mom! Mom! No! Take her out.

555
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,350
No! Mom!

556
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,970
It's not much, but you should need it.

557
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,610
Thank you, Uncle Go.

558
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:31,810
And this.

559
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:35,190
What is this?

560
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,190
It's your name.

561
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:40,360
If you go to Seoul, those who wanted to kill you will still chase after you.

562
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,200
Use this name these days.

He's my son.

He died a year ago, but his death hasn't been registered yet.

Come on, buy one and get one free.

00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,240
You can get me, too.

If you bring him along, your life will be ruined.

Don't go.

Hey.

Have you seen Jung-tae?

He's your husband. How can you say his name directly？

601
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:27,240
He's not my husband. He is nothing.

It's not opened yet, right?

609
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,700
You told me not to go this way, right?

610
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,580
Don't worry. I'll open it for you.

Why are you always forgetting the day to pay me back?

651

If you keep getting in my way, my business will be worse.

652

Then I won't be able to pay back.

Look at him.

654

I'll always give you the best treatment.

I couldn't get him into a Biotech Company.
