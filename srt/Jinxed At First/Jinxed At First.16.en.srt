It's this demoness! It's this demoness!

10

No one did this to you.

12

Go back?

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,730
I'll never get caught.

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,720
I told you not to move.

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,289
You said I did this to you?

23
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,650
Yes. I made you into this monster.

24
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,970
So I'll make sure to stop you.

25

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,190
Where is Seul-bi?
(Looking for a missing person.)

168
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,980
Where is Seul-bi?

169
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,760
I should've clung onto her like a barnacle.

170
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,470
Don't worry.

171
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,340
Is Seul-bi an ordinary person?

172
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,480
She'll come back using that weird power.

173
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,130
Stop saying she's weird.

174
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,210
Hyun Taen, why are you out here?

175
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,840
Have some Ssanghwa tea.

176
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,480
You need to pull yourself together at times like this.

177
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,910
Seul-bi will be back soon.

178
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,140
Hyun Taen, let's have a drink.

179
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,070
Shut up. Why are you drinking in broad daylight?

180
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,410
Are you crazy?

181
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,840
By the way, how's Soo-kwang?

182
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,150
Soo-kwang?

183
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:14,420
I heard he's looking for Seul-bi everywhere.

184
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,590
Our brother-in-law. What should we do?

185
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,600
Stop drinking.

186
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,740
You're the one, right? You said you saw Seul-bi?

187
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,220
Where is she now?

188
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,830
What does she look like?

189
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,940
She's tall, slim, and has long hair.

190
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,580
When she says the fish's or animals' names, it's weird, right?

191
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,530
Soo-kwang.

192
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,350
It's not her.

193
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,920
Are you sure?

194
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,310
She looks like her, so I took a picture.

195
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,800
Yes, it's not her.

196
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,580
Then there's no reward?

197
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,280
We said it's not her.

198
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,580
-We'll reward you if you find the right person. -But they look alike.

199
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,310
They look alike, but it's not her.

200
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,300
-No... -It's not. It's not. Thank you.

201
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,590
Pull yourself together.

202
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,760
Why...

203
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,530
did she disappear?

204
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,960
Does Seul-bi have to pay a price

205
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,080
to be ordinary?

206
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,740
It's all my fault.

207
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,310
It's all my fault.

208
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,420
Where could she go?

209
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,730
If you're destined to meet again,

210
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,180
even if you go to the end of the world,

211
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,420
you will...

212
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,090
meet again.

213
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,330
It's snowing, Seul-bi.

214
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,870
You said that no matter where you are,

215
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,110
this necklace will find its owner.

216
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,520
But I don't know where you are.

217
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,240
If you tell me where you are,

218
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,170
I'll go to you immediately.

219
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,370
Just tell me where you are.

220
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,960
Please.

221
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,830
Soo-kwang.

222
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,920
Even if we're separated because of some things,

223
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,000
and we're far apart,

224
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,710
you'll shine like that star and

225
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,520
I'll find you.

226
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,250
I'm sorry, Seul-bi.

227
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,850
I couldn't protect you.

228
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,590
I'm really sorry, Seul-bi.

229
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,280
I'm sorry, Seul-bi.

230
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,090
Time passed like a blade of light.

231
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,370
Because without you,

232
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,360
because without your warm hug,

233
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,500
time became an ice sword and scrapped my life away.

234
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,780
Mr. Wang! Dae Shik!

235
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,720
What now?

236
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,700
I guess we got another call.

237
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,230
Being a secretary is really hard.

238
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,180
I have to look everywhere in the country.

239
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,730
He always turns off his phone.

240
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,010
When is he going to move out of this attic? Gosh.

241
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,790
Mr. Wang, I think I need to go to Namhae.

242
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,030
News about Seul-bi?

243
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,520
Yes. Someone said they saw a person who looks like her.

244
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,770
I'm sure it's just someone who looks like her.

245
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,660
Sir.

246
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,020
Yeongjin Foundation's board meeting has been postponed for the fourth time.

247
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,600
You can't just ignore this important task

248
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,700
that Ms. Eun Ok-jin assigned to you.

249
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,980
-Although Seul-bi is important too... -Hey!

250
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,830
How dare you say that about Seul-bi?

251
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,410
I mean...

252
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,570
What about the board meeting?

253
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,320
What about the board meeting?

254
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,150
The budget proposal for next year has been confirmed and agreed by the directors.

255
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,100
You just need to approve it.

256
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,520
Let's have a video meeting for the rest.

257
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,900
Video meeting, okay?

258
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,270
Video meeting?

259
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,550
Wow! Wow!

260
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,140
Why didn't I think of that?

261
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,550
What are you doing? Get in.

262
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,520
Okay.

263
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,020
You contacted me, right?

264
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,220
-Over there. -Over there?

265
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,980
Is anyone there?

266
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,160
Who is it?

267
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,140
Hello, Grandma.

268
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,750
Is there a tall woman with long hair and fair skin living here?

269
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,600
She uses long names for animals.

270
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,480
Gyeong-ja?

271
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,800
Gyeong-ja. We got it wrong again.

272
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,320
-It's under the Cephalopod. -A mollusc, squid!

273
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,810
It's our Gyeong-ja.

274
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,680
Gyeong-ja!

275
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,610
It's a shark under the Chondrichthyes, the great white shark. I got it.

276
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,750
Gyeong-ja!

277
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,670
Yes, Grandma?

278
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,400
There are people here to see you again.

279
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,380
Seul... Seul-bi.

280
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,460
Who are you?

281
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,890
I'm Gyeong-ja. Oh Gyeong-ja.

282
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,800
That's the name of my daughter who ran away from home.

283
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,010
She came here without knowing her name.

284
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,250
That's why I call her Gyeong-ja.

285
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,500
Grandma, I said I'll be your granddaughter.

286
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,460
Shut up.

287
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,090
Then I won't massage your shoulders anymore.

288
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,940
I have this.

289
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,140
You're so stingy.

290
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,730
Come on, let me massage it for you, Grandma.

291
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,760
They look exactly the same.

292
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,660
What is going on?

293
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,300
It feels so good.

294
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,890
Oh my, my dear Gyeong-ja.

295
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:43,750
Isn't it comfortable?

296
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,970
Yes, very comfortable. My dear Gyeong-ja.

297
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,270
Goodness.

298
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,100
I want to be with Seul-bi,

299
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,970
but I can't leave Hyeon-su alone at home.

300
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,190
Okay. Hyeon-su is waiting for you. Please go.

301
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,290
What about you?

302
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,000
No. Sir, are you planning to stay here

303
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,750
until Seul-bi regains her memory?

304
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,450
Just take Seul-bi with you.

305
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,510
If I forcefully take her back, she might get agitated.

306
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,520
You guys go ahead.

307
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,830
Okay, we'll get going.

308
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,990
(Village Cafe)

309
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,930
Gosh, it's cold.

310
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,830
Goodness.

311
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,810
Gyeong-ja!

312
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,590
-Gyeong-ja. -Yes?

313
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,430
You should go out.

314
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,510
Why?

315
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,240
Just go out.

316
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,620
Goodness.

317
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,210
Who are you?

318
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,690
Elder brother?

319
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,830
Younger brother?

320
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,090
Boyfriend?

321
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,700
Or are you here to ask me for money?

322
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,170
-It's a... -It's a long story, isn't it?

323
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,820
It must be.

324
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,290
Everyone is like this.

325
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,350
I don't even know my name. I'm like a fool.

326
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,050
That's why, up to now,

327
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,330
there are so many men who lied to me and

328
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,980
wanted to take me away.

329
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,320
They claimed to be my boyfriend or my brother.

330
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,230
Some even said we're getting married.

331
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,190
Gosh.

332
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,690
I won't be fooled anymore.

333
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,020
So go home.

(Neighborhood Shop. Village Cafe.)

00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,140
Grandpa, I'm here!

336
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,980
Gyeong-ja is here.

337
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,430
How have you been?

338
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,950
I'm fine.

339
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,190
Seul-bi, are you okay?

340
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,490
Seul-bi, let me see.

341
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,640
Are you okay?

342
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,630
Yes, I'm fine.

343
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,110
Thank you.

344
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,340
Let's go.

345
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,660
It looks delicious.

346
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,770
-Thank you for the food. -Okay.

347
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,290
How is it?

348
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,020
It's so delicious.

349
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,070
I'll be back.

350
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,340
Wait.

351
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,300
This is for you.

354
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,680
Wow, you know quite a lot.

355
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,690
You and I have similar hobbies.

356
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,410
I thought I could meet them if I can call their

357
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,660
names sincerely.

358
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,550
Sir.

359

How do you know me?

360
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,080
Well...

361

It's a long story.

362
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:17,179
I sincerely pray...

363
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:20,120
You're so annoying.

364
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,120
Don't bring any bad luck.

365
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:27,050
I sincerely pray.

366
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,500
I pray that Seul-bi can regain her memory.

367
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,090
Boss, who still believes in this superstition these days?

368
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,120
Gosh.

369
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,750
You'll bring bad luck, brat!

370
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:41,870
This world is full of spirits that we don't know.

371
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:46,000
Otherwise, how do you explain

372
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,320
Seul-bi's power when she helped us?

373
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,370
Really?

374
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,949
That's true.

375
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:55,000
What matters for all beliefs is sincerity.

376
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,810
God! Buddha!

377
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:58,840
All gods!

378
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,690
Please help Seul-bi regain her memory.

379
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,040
Please help her regain her memory.

380
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,370
Who is calling me now? Darn it.

381
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,360
Soo-kwang.

382
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,850
No, Director.

383
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,990
What brings you here? You're busy.

384
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,730
Thank you, Uncle Cha.

385
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,460
I heard you found Seul-bi.

386
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,300
Let's talk on the way.

387
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,380
Seriously.

388
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,370
-Sister. -I feel so good.

389
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:38,150
-Don't you think the judge was very cool? -What?

390
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,090
Because the investigator used illegal methods

391
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,760
to collect evidence in the past,

392
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
I hereby declare not guilty.

393
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,660
Darn it!

394
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,600
Hey.

395
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,020
Anyway, what's important now is the initial verdict has been corrected

396
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:54,690
and Uncle Jung got a verdict of not guilty. Exactly.

397
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,650
Exactly.

398
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:59,140
You had been suffering, Hyun Taen.

399
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,540
I wanted to give it to you long ago.

400
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,160
I've been keeping it with me before I got the verdict of not guilty.

401
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,430
Oh my!

402
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,710
This is...

403
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,020
Why did you prepare this?

404
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,020
My goodness!

405
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,370
Kids, look how big this diamond is.

406
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,670
It's so beautiful.

407
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,660
It fits you.

408
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,680
All we need to do now is to set a date for your wedding.

409
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,960
We just need to get registered. There's no need for a wedding ceremony.

410
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,980
I've been married before.

411
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,130
I've never been married.

412
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,260
Mom.

413
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,210
You are breaking Uncle Jung's heart. What are you doing?

414
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,250
When did you start defending him?

415
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,550
Can't you tell?

416
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,610
She's interested in Uncle Jung's compensation.

417
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,690
Hey.

418
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,980
-No, I'm not. Shut up. -Yes, you are.

419
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,170
Okay.

420
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,590
When I get the compensation,

421
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,210
let's open a second fried chicken restaurant in Eun-jung's name.

422
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,030
Really?

423
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,490
What about a third restaurant?

424
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,010
Okay, let's open a third one.

425
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:05,580
Really?

426
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,150
Hey, go to college!

427
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,930
What are you thinking as a repeat student?

428
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,300
You have to go to college. Only then can I have a wedding.

429
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,110
Study hard.

430
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,830
It's Soo-kwang.

431
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,960
Soo-kwang?

432
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,760
Stop drinking. Why are you drinking in the middle of the day?

433
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,240
Did Seul-bi tell you where she is?

434
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,550
Gosh.

435
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,230
Bring some pancakes.

436
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,940
-Pancake. -Coming.

437
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,840
The pancake is here. It's a perfect scallion pancake.

438

Wow, it looks delicious.

439
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:41,520
Seul-bi must be very happy to eat this scallion pancake.

440
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,130
It's so delicious.

441

-Stop crying and eat. -They found her!

442
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,640
They found her!

Really?

446

Seul-bi?

447
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,670
Are you kidding me?

448
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,320
Aren't you always fooling me?

449
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,230
No.

and the books she read before.

467

Wow, it's so soft.

I heard everything in this room was made by your mom.

She made all these curtains, blankets,

and these toys.

00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:09,180
When can we stop seeing Go Myeong-seong while we do business?

503
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,230
The jinxed Go Myeong-seong.

504
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,350
Get out of our market!

505
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,800
Get out!

506
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,470
Who is Go Myeong-seong?

507
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,110
Your name is Gong Soo-kwang, isn't it?

508
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:20,990
Yes.

509
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,790
Do they hate you?

510
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,080
Yes. People used to hate me before you came.

511
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,510
Your personality is really annoying, isn't it?

512
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,360
It's not about my personality. It's me.

513
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,720
Who is this woman?

514
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,140
Yes. Why are you stealing my customers?

515
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:50,390
My husband is dealing with cat coins. I'm so worried about him.

516
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,570
Let me see.

517
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,930
Do you feel it?

518
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:53,780
You know cat coins, right?

519
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,370
Cat. Meow.

520
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,530
Do you think I should keep it?

521
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,820
Yes.

522
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,950
I failed.

523
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:03,480
Don't go.

524
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,410
Hey, Wang.

525
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,320
Come on, Wang.

526
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,070
Mr. Wang is so stupid.

527
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,760
How would I know a doctor?

528
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,630
I feel bad for his son.

529
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,330
Thank you, Seul-bi.

530
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:20,460
My son, Hyeon-su had the eye surgery successfully thanks to you.

531
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,290
I'll be loyal to you from now on.

532
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:25,760
It's itchy. It's itchy.

533
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,000
It's so itchy that I'm going crazy.

534
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,760
Take this off for me.

535
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,770
Take it off.

536
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,110
Take it off for me.

537
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:32,800
Ouch!

538
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,560
That's too much.

539
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,930
It's too much.

540
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:38,520
Hey!

541
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,310
Perfect.

542
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,230
This twisted doughnut is perfect.

543
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,910
Seul-bi is perfect too.

544
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,120
You are right, Young-woo.

545
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,830
Seul-bi is perfect.

546
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:52,140
By the way, we need someone to take Jeff to my mom's house in Busan.

547
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,810
-Who can take him back? -Take him back?

548
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,510
(Busan Front Sea)
-Who can take him back? -Take him back?

549
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,960
Let's take him to Busan.

550
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,650
It will take 10 hours to Busan.

551
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,710
10,000 won an hour. Deal?

552
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,980
Wait, wait a second.

553
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,350
Seul-bi!

554
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,900
I'm your dad.

555
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,440
You have no idea how much I missed you over the past 20 years.

556
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,660
Seul-bi.

557
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,370
This man is weird.

558
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,100
Weird?

559
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,420
Am I?

560
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,420
You are breaking Hyun Taen's heart.

561
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,930
He is not weird. He just said that he is your dad.

562
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:30,950
Am I weird?

563
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,570
No, you're very handsome.

564
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,540
-Why did she say that? -Am I weird?

565
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,270
You didn't stick to the script.

566
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:37,350
It was improvised.

567
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:38,890
It was improvised. Who's next?

568
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:40,290
Mr. Hong, it's your turn.

569
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:40,810
Me?

570
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:42,000
-Hurry up. -Oh my.

571
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,100
Splat.

572
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,370
Have you heard it?

573
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:49,040
Seul-bi isn't Jung's daughter,

574
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,350
but the daughter of the chairman of Geumhwa Group.

575
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,710
Oh my.

576
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:59,250
Seul-bi is the daughter of a rich family.

577
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,620
Wow.

578
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,430
Hey, so what you're a rich girl?

579
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:06,430
I like Soo-kwang before you.

580
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:07,710
Give him to me.

581
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:08,470
Shut up, you brat.

582
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:10,340
I told you to stick to the script.

583
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,390
Seul-bi. Recall it.

584
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:17,960
Our fried chicken restaurant developed a great sauce because of you.

585
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,070
It's really popular.

586
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:21,720
You are the lucky goddess!

587
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,310
Lucky goddess!

588
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:29,710
Happy birthday to you.

589
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:33,520
Our dear Seul-bi.

590
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,580
Memory. Come back.

591
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,130
Come back.

592
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:42,930
Do you remember it?

593
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:48,700
Do you remember it?

594
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,740
Boring.

595
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,960
They're so bad at acting.

596
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,950
Oh my.

597
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,940
Hey.

598
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,190
I like earthworm fudge.

599
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,390
Look at this card.

600
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:04,170
-Here is our card. -Seul-bi really likes this.

601
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:07,760
-Seul-bi. Look. -Look.

602
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,030
Stop!

603
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:13,910
I don't remember anything.

604
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,770
When people lose their memories,

605
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,450
will their personality change?

606
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:21,340
She hasn't changed at all.

607
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,360
She's smart, capable, and cute.

608
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,890
She's honest with herself.

609
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:25,820
Really?

610
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,290
-You are lame. -What's wrong with you?

611
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,240
Anyway,

612
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,250
thank you all.

613
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,830
-Okay. -Thank you.

614
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:33,850
Bye.

615
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:34,700
Bye. Bye.

616
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,870
Okay, see you.

617
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,310
-You are good. -Okay.

618
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,850
It's a bit unfortunate. It's a bit...

619
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:41,820
What is it?

620
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,430
-That was too much. -Yes.

621
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:48,030
Maybe it's the acting.

622
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:49,640
I did a good job.

623
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,980
How could you say that?

624
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,240
You call that acting?

625
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,880
I used to live here with you?

626
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:12,810
Yes.

627
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,910
Hey, it's me.

628
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:31,850
Yes.

629
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,550
Do you remember anything?

630
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:48,840
What did I do while I was here?

631
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,410
What do you mean?

632
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,820
You said we were dating.

633
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,050
A female and a male. At night...

634
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:03,180
Did you lose your social ability along with your memory?

635
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,190
What are you talking about?

636
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,080
You're so shy.

637
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,050
I'm not shy.

638
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:14,300
Nothing happened between us.

639
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,970
Nothing?

640
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,500
Well, we just...

641
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,530
kissed.

642
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:25,020
Ah, we kissed.

643
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:27,770
How did you feel?

644
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:30,170
What?

645
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:32,870
How did you feel when you kissed me?

646
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,990
If you're curious, try to recall it.

647
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:38,740
That's lame.

648
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,230
Do you want me to tell you?

649
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:41,120
Yes.

650
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,530
I'm so upset.

651
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:02,380
What's wrong?

652
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,590
No.

653
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,890
I don't even remember.

654
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:09,220
I feel like you're showing off after kissing another woman.

655
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:11,800
Bah.

656
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,090
(Leaves rustled and she could feel the temperature of someone approaching from behind. Seul-bi's man, Soo-kwang followed her. "Secretary Gong, it seems that you are not very busy?" "I'm doing something important." "Your important thing is to follow the woman you like?" The footsteps stopped abruptly...)

657
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:19,070
What is this?
(Leaves rustled and she could feel the temperature of someone approaching from behind. Seul-bi's man, Soo-kwang followed her. "Secretary Gong, it seems that you are not very busy?" "I'm doing something important." "Your important thing is to follow the woman you like?" The footsteps stopped abruptly...)

658
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,100
My new novel.

659
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,010
It is about Seon Seul-bi and Gong Soo-kwang.

660
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,430
You said you only write about me.

661
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:26,630
You said I'm the protagonist.

662
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,890
You're not a chaebol anymore.

663
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:30,470
You're not my protagonist anymore.

664
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,620
You're my man.

665
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,820
I'm getting jealous.

666
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:38,250
Right?

667
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,020
I'm jealous too.

668
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,680
In this year of finding Seul-bi, not only did you postpone our relationship,

669
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,540
but also our wedding.

670
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,620
We have to work hard.

671
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,110
What's your plan tonight?

672
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,630
I'm free,

673
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,490
but you are not.

674
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:55,900
Why?

675
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,640
Do you know that since your previous novel, the sales have been decreasing?

676
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,370
The views have dropped by 2,000.

677
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:03,420
Tonight, stay up in the study

678
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,870
and drain your soul.

679
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,870
That's too much.

680
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,620
How could you say that to your girlfriend?

681
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,640
I'm not saying this as your boyfriend.

682
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:16,320
I'm telling you this as the dark horse of the online novel platform

683
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,830
and the boss of content integration.

684
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,500
Yes, Mr. Seon.

685
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,380
I need to go to work now.

686
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,600
See you.

687
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,620
This feels good.

688
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,080
I...

689
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,230
I don't remember, but I like you.

690
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,720
I just like you.

691
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,800
You're like a prince.

692
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:01,500
Seul-bi.

693
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:05,170
Let's...

694
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,120
get married.

695
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,610
Even if you remember everything,

696
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:45,590
those painful memories will be more than those beautiful memories.

697
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:49,110
Is it really necessary to regain your memory?

698
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:57,090
Seul-bi is getting married, dad.

699
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:02,180
This is the dream day for our whole family.

700
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:06,980
She's like a treasure to us. She'll be happy in the future.

701
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:10,850
I hope you can come back and witness her happiness one day.

702
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,040
I miss you, dad.

703
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,300
It's really beautiful.

704
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,240
The wedding hall is so beautiful.

705
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,680
Seul-bi is beautiful too.

706
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,660
Just like in a drama.

707
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,670
Min-joon, I must use this part in my novel.

708
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:36,210
Seul-bi.

709
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,590
Be happy.

710
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:39,550
Thank you.

711
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,870
Brother.

712
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,870
Seul-bi.

713
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,230
Congratulations.

714
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,170
Please be happy.

715
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:51,370
Be happy, Seul-bi.

716
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,190
Thank you.

717
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,400
I don't remember clearly.

718
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,120
It doesn't matter if you remember.

719
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,610
What matters is to live on.

720
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:04,600
Of course.

721
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,590
Congratulations.

722
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:08,410
So beautiful.

723
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:09,730
I'm so envious.

724
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:12,360
One, two, three.

725
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,890
Honey! Honey! Kim Jung-tae!

726
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,890
He is so happy.

727
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,140
He is so happy.

728
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,960
She hasn't regained her memory yet. Does it make sense to hold a wedding?

729
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:30,540
It's a bit awkward.

730
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,790
It indeed sounds unreasonable.

731
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:33,030
Love and passion

732
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,480
are far more important than memory.

733
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,590
You sound very passionate.

734
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,770
Of course.

735
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:41,690
Of course I am.

736
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:44,430
You're a passion mixer with a super motor.

737
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,490
That's why I devote all my life to you.

738
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,380
That's why you are so passionate about nagging.

739
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,830
It's passion.

740
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,810
Anyway, it's really weird.

741
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:56,890
Why do the rich people get married in the market

742
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:59,320
instead of a hotel?

743
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,470
I thought I could enjoy the delicious hotel food gracefully.

744
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:03,860
-Shut up! -Shut up!

745
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:04,970
Shut up.

746
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:05,500
Eun-jung.

747
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,600
When the time comes, we can order a hotel set...

748
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,660
Yes, you can get married in the hotel. You made a lot of money.

749
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,760
I heard rich people are more stingy.

750
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,290
The Hollywood celebrity, Angelina or Gelina?

751
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:19,150
She has billions of won, but she still drinks a 900 won coffee.

752
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:20,950
Gong Soo-kwang, that bastard.

753
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:22,580
Stop nagging.

754
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,970
Who would say bad things about the groom on the wedding day?

755
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,660
It's because of the wedding.

756
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:31,970
The groom is supposed to be hung upside down on the wedding day and be hit on the feet.

757
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:34,380
That's why I'm so short.

758
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:39,560
By the way, I'm so nervous when I think about hosting.

759
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,720
What should I do? I'm so nervous.

760
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,290
Why are you nervous?

761
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:45,620
People will think you are the groom today.

762
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,820
So I wrote the congratulatory note in advance.

763
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:49,650
Good.

764
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:50,160
Let me see.

765
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:50,980
-What? -What?

766
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,180
You lost it, right?

767
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,750
Congratulatory note. Congratulatory note.

768
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,190
How could you lose it?

769
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:57,450
I think I dropped it on the way.

770
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:58,400
Seong-deok, what are you doing?

771
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,800
Just do what you usually do.

772
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,730
Just do it in your weird style.

773
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:03,600
Yeah, weird.

774
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,470
-Weird style? -Yes.

775
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,030
Soo-kwang, are you okay?

776
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,390
Uncle Jung, I can't breathe.

777
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:12,250
Take a deep breath.

778
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:13,750
Take a deep breath, Soo-kwang.

779
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,480
-What's wrong? -Why are you so nervous?

780
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:17,630
Hey, Soo-kwang!

781
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:18,470
Soo-kwang, Soo-kwang!

782
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:19,630
Jang-geun, you are here.

783
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:20,460
Tranquilizing pills.

784
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,860
Tranquilizing pills. Tranquilizing pills.

785
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,880
Tranquilizing pills.

786
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:32,420
Yes.

787
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,970
Tranquilizing pills. Are you okay?

788
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,630
Yes.

789
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,020
Hey, Soo-kwang.

790
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,260
I'm leaving.

791
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:38,960
Hey.

792
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,580
I haven't finished yet.

793
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:41,880
Aren't you getting married?

794
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,210
Swallow it.

795
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,720
-Great. -Let's go. Let's go.

796
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,350
Let's go.

797
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,940
-Let's go. -Let's go get married.

798
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:56,940
Okay.

799
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:01,790
It's time for the wedding to begin.

800
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,090
Groom.

801
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:05,410
Gong Soo-kwang.

802
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:06,700
Come in.

803
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:09,940
He looks good.

804
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,300
So handsome.

805
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,950
So handsome.

806
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:22,500
Ladies and gentlemen,

807
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,550
please look back.

808
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,270
She is so beautiful.

809
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:27,830
Let's welcome today's main character.

810
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:28,910
The bride.

811
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:30,270
Seul-bi.

812
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:32,960
Come in.

813
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,660
So beautiful.

814
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:17,900
Seul-bi.

815
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:35,360
Kiss her.

816
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:45,020
Hey, I need to announce it before you kiss.

817
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,750
Seul-bi.

818
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,110
Yes?

819
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:21,480
He's our son.

820
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:24,950
Hello.

821
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:31,910
Although the Seul-bi in my memory didn't come back,

822
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:36,620
I’m living with a prettier wife now.

823
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:37,810
Oh, Si-hyeon, you’re up.

824
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:39,040
I’m happier

825
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,400
and more passionate.

826
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,600
Hey, you pooped.

827
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,700
Si-hyeon. Seul-bi.

828
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,140
Seul-bi, get up.

829
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,700
Help Si-hyeon change his diaper.

830
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:50,950
Time for milk.

831
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:53,490
Get up and eat.

832
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:54,380
Okay.

833
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,780
I have to eat.

834
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,540
Si-hyeon, one more.

835
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:13,870
What?

836
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:16,100
He's asleep.

837
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:16,970
He's asleep?

838
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,400
