1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,600
(Episode 15)

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,200
Dad, you told me the wealth and reputation you accumulated,

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,240
as well as this huge castle

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,650
are all for me, right?

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,170
Thank you, Dad.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,270
Dad, thank you for everything you've done for me.

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,730
But...

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,440
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you again.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,120
I'm going to disband Geumhwa Group.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,730
I'll donate all the money I get from selling the company to the society.

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,810
I think in this way, I can stop

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,090
the curse that our family has accumulated for generations.

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,790
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,940
It's time to end all of these.

15
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,510
This is my lifelong wish.

16
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,780
To become an ordinary woman

17
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,960
and be loved by an ordinary man.

18
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,880
Seul-bi, you always asked me

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,340
"Mom, will it snow tomorrow?

20
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,810
Will Santa Claus come tomorrow?

21
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,900
Can we see the birds outside the window tomorrow?"

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,990
Did I ask you that?

23
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,880
Thanks to you, I have been looking forward to the days ahead,

24
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,180
bearing with the thought that tomorrow would be the day you enjoy.

25
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,590
Seul-bi. Be an ordinary person.

26
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,790
Don't worry.

27
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,850
No matter what happens, I'll protect Seul-bi properly.

28
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,720
When I first met you long ago,

29
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,329
the future you showed me became my lifelong hope.

30
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,640
I've been hoping that one day there would be a man deeply loves Seul-bi.

31
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:51,120
I also hope Seul-bi could be with the one she loves one day.

32
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,910
I'm sorry, but please allow me to say this.

33
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,240
After I leave,

34
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,460
please take care of Seul-bi.

35
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:24,520
Seul-bi. Chairman and Miss Seul-bi...

36
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,040
They have left, right?

37
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,280
What are you doing?

38
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,170
What are these?

39
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,100
Invitations.

40
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,780
Yes.

41
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,650
I'll officially invite them to be my guests here.

42
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,800
They prepared the birthday party for me,

43
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,500
but it was ruined.

44
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,860
They came to the press conference to protect me.

45
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,810
That's why I'm inviting them.

46
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,950
Wow, you're so good at drawing. Who is this?

47
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,000
Who is it?

48
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,730
It's Aunt Smile.

49
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,700
I didn't recognize her because she is smiling so happily.

50
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,090
She likes smiling now.

51
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,490
(You're kindly invited to Seul-bi's private house.)

52
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,230
You're kindly invited to Seul-bi's private house.
(You're kindly invited to Seul-bi's private house.)

53
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,090
You're kindly invited to Seul-bi's private house.

54
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,710
Will they like it?

55
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,700
Of course they will.

56
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,530
Everything is ready.

57
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,690
It won't be uncomfortable for you to stay here for a while.

58
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,700
Excuse me. Goodbye.

59
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,980
I heard...the policeman has contacted you.

60
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,690
I did something wrong, I should be punished.

61
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,010
Brother.

62
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,990
Let me hug you.

63
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,400
(Reliable policemen who are with the people)

64
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,140
(Reliable policemen who are with the people)

65
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,840
Arrested?
(Reliable policemen who are with the people)

66
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,100
Why did Secretary Cha go to the police station without telling us?

67
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,700
He testified that imprisoning Ms. Min

68
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,160
was done by himself.

69
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,970
For my day, Secretary Cha...

70
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,160
I've called Lawyer Park and decided to bail him out.

71
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,169
I heard Secretary Cha turned himself in at the police station.

72
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:41,179
He claimed all the illegal deeds of Seon Sam-jung as his.

73
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,570
I wanted to trample on him.

74
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,340
Why did he turn himself in?

75
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,640
Ladies.

76
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,880
-Yes. -Yes.

77
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,500
You must perform well this time, okay?

78
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,880
-Yes. -Yes.

79
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,750
It is okay?

80
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,160
-Yes. -Yes.

81
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,230
Take them away.

82
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,770
He's crazy.

83
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,880
I didn't expect him to be like that.

84
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,080
He's a psychopath, right?

85
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,080
(Informant X)

86
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,860
So the real owner of Geumhwa Group is a witch? Right?
(Informant X)

87
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,780
So the real owner of Geumhwa Group is a witch? Right?

88
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,700
Yes.

89
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:37,910
The witches have been manipulating the chairmen by hypnosis and prophecy,

90
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,170
and made them obey their orders.

91
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,460
So if they didn't listen, the witches would hypnotize them into delusions.

92
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,470
That's why all the chairmen ended up with a mental illness, right?

93
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,470
Yes.

94
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,290
If you see the manipulator with your own eyes,

95
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,300
you will be scared.

96
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,720
Not just manipulation,

97
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,200
I'm sure she's been absorbing other people's energy.

98
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,310
Yes.

99
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,290
So Chairman Seon Joo-cheol's energy was completely drained by the witches,

100
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,090
and eventually died as a skeleton.

101
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:00,980
That's cruel.

102
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,830
Wow, this is...

103
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,980
Let's see. They aren't witches.

104
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,840
They're monsters.

105
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,770
Where did they go?

106
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,440
Well, Uncle Jung isn't here either.

107
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,890
Is he having lunch now?

108
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,700
Hello.

109
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,850
-Hi. -Hi.

110
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,970
Look at this.

111
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,560
I'm going to throw a party at my place.

112
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,610
Please come.

113
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,520
Party?

114
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,220
We're too busy to join. We're afraid that we can't make it.

115
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,940
Seul-bi specially prepared this for you.

116
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,920
Come even if you're busy.

117
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,210
I'm sorry. Young-woo is ill seriously.

118
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,830
We're really busy.

119
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,230
I'm sorry.

120
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,310
How could this happen?

121
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,270
-It must be true. -Right?

122
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,130
It must be true.

123
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,450
-Hi, everyone. -Hello.

124
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,800
Hello.

125
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,250
I'm going to hold a party at home this weekend. Please come.

126
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,000
Well...

127
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,250
What's wrong with you all?

128
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,790
The goods I ordered are coming. I can't believe I'm still standing here.

129
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,300
I'll get going.

130
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,190
Seul-bi, I'm sorry.

131
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,310
Excuse me...

132
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,000
I...

133
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,900
My hand...

134
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,920
I've been busy lately. What should I do?

135
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,650
I think my herniated disc is back. I'm going to use the hot compress.

136
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,940
Ouch. My back hurts.

137
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,930
Where are you going?

138
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,110
-What happened? -What?

139
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,300
Well, I've touched her hand.

140
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,520
Have I been cursed by her?

141
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,120
What are you talking about?

142
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,190
-Well... -It's...

143
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,280
Really?

144
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,070
Soo-kwang.

145
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,120
Seul-bi.

146
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,250
There are rumors everywhere.

147
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,970
Mi-soo and Seul-bi have been manipulating Seon Ju-cheol and Seon Sam-jung,

148
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,680
and caused them to go crazy.

149
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,640
Who spread it?

150
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,080
From the internet.

151
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,640
They say that they're witches

152
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,690
who can tell fortune and manipulate others.

153
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,250
It must be Seon Dong-sik again.

154
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,160
It's okay. He's right.

155
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,210
Seul-bi. Let's go back now.

156
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,620
Okay.

157
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,160
Goodness.

158
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,890
She's here.

159
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,670
You're a witch.

160
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,070
You're the witch who's been draining

161
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,280
the energy of the chairman of Geumhwa Group.

162
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,460
Come out!

163
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,530
Come out!

164
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:48,590
You brought all the bad luck in the universe.

165
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,920
Witch, get lost!

166
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,540
You're a big ghost.

167
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,800
Stop it.

168
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,170
Stop it.

169
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,460
Soo-kwang, take Seul-bi home.

170
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,480
The ghost is gone. The ghost is gone.

171
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,220
Come on. Stop it.

172
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,830
You're a fortune teller too. Are you a ghost too?

173
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,920
I'm a fortune teller, but she's a witch.

174
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,440
Nonsense.

175
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
Go away.

176
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,130
She's a witch.

177
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,830
Let's go.

178
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,100
Well...

179
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,960
Did Seul-bi curse me

180
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,890
and made me do something weird?

181
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:51,440
I'm glad I didn't shake hands with her, and didn't let her tell my fortune.

182
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,290
I shaked hands with her many times.

183
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,150
Is that why you're so weak?

184
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,650
I did wash my hands, but I'm still worried.

185
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,560
Tell us.

186
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,790
The Chairman Seon Joo-cheol and Chairman Seon Sam-jung both have mental illness.

187
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,990
Is it really because of witches?

188
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,820
Why are you curious?

189
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,440
We all held Seul-bi's hand before and we're scared.

190
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,800
Seul-bi told your fortune. You were happy when your business was good.

191
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,550
She was embarrassed just because she has held your hands before?

192
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,200
When did we embarrass her, Hyun Taen?

193
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,180
That's enough, everyone.

194
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,670
Seul-bi was so nice to you.

195
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,080
I know.

196
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,840
It's because someone really has a mental illness. We're scared.

197
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,520
They deserve to be punished.

198
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,340
They just paid for what they did.

199
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,400
Seul-bi is innocent.

200
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,270
Don't say it. So do you, Miss Bang

201
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,120
Ms. Bang, you disappointed me.

202
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,690
Miss Bang. Miss Bang.

203
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,470
Why are you getting mad at me?

204
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,800
-We'll be cursed...-No way!

205
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,320
Go back now.

206
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,010
-Go back. -Yes. Yes.

207
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,720
Go back. All!

208
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,860
Okay.

209
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,030
Oh, no.

210
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,550
Drink this and you'll feel better.

211
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,710
Although they seem to be avoiding you now,

212
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,840
but they'll like you as they used to.

213
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,870
Look at me.

214
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,290
I used to be the most unlucky man in Seodong Market.

215
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,690
But what's my name now?

216
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,570
Lucky man.

217
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,530
Yes.

218
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,030
I'm going to sleep.

219
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,240
Don't think about anything and sleep tight.

220
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,030
Okay.

221
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,530
It's getting faster.

222
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,500
Will I really become like that?

223
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,780
It's that woman.

224
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,550
You brought all bad luck.

225
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,680
If no matter what choice I make,

226
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,050
the future will come...

227
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,620
No, it's impossible. I'll stop it.

228
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,210
Even if I will become a witch...

229
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,300
There you are.

230
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,000
How are you, Councilor.

231
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,810
Do I look good to you?

232
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,070
I'm sorry to let you worry about my family.

233
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,600
Where's the chairman?

234
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,230
I heard he got the mental disease, right?

235
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,540
I even wanted Jang Kyung to marry into a family like yours.

236
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,030
Thinking about it makes me shiver and sweaty.

237
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,840
I'm really sorry.

238
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,110
Just an apology?

239
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,410
A half-sister? A witch?

240
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,599
I heard you were in that kind of relationship with that witch.

241
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,730
How dare you covet Jang Kyung?

242
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,130
My sister and I are not like what you thought about us.

243
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,060
I think my mouth will be getting dirty if I go on the talk with you. So let's keep it short.

244
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,839
Let's forget about the marriage thing.

245
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,840
Don't ever contact my Jang Kyung again.

246
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,540
Jang Kyung.

247
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,470
My mom was here before, right?

248
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,660
What are you doing here?

249
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,100
If you are reported here by the journalists, what should we do?

250
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,500
So what? We're getting married.

251
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,010
Your mother just told me to cancel the engagement.

252
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,360
I'm old enough to marry the one I like without my parents permission.

253
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,080
Did you...

254
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,900
run away from home?

255
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,930
Jang Kyung.

256
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,240
I think you should listen to your parents now.

257
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,820
No. You'd better listen to me.

258
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,630
You know I'm stubborn.

259
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,910
I won't leave this place until I marry you.

260
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,270
I'll get you a room.

261
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,160
Come on.

262
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,520
Just let me live in yours.

263
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,340
We're getting married anyway. So what?

264
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,060
Where is my room?

265
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,380
Jang Kyung.

266
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,110
Seul-bi.

267
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,420
So this is your secret space,

268
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,460
right?

269
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,560
Wow, it's so magical.

270
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,250
It's like I were in a magical world.

271
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,810
Oh, by the way, people say Seul-bi is a witch.

272
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,910
Is that true?

273
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,880
Jang Kyung, let's go.

274
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,980
I like witches.

275
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,910
My favorite role is

276
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:24,090
the kind Northern Witch in The Wizard of Oz.

277
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,900
Let's get along and be close.

278
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,930
-Sure. -Can I look around?

279
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,940
Where's Soo-kwang?

280
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,470
He's been busy all day.

281
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,260
What is he doing? He's neglecting my sister?

282
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,070
I am not the most important one at the present, brother. You'd better spend some time with your girlfriend now.

283
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,680
Wow, what is this?

284
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,210
Go and check.

285
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,910
Jang Kyung, should we go?

286
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,520
Min-joon, come here.

287
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
(Doo-il Business Company Superstar)

288
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,300
Seon Dong-sik has been acting strange.
(Doo-il Business Company Superstar)

289
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,540
I thought he was going abroad.

290
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,360
But I heard he's gathering people domestic.

291
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,790
What is he going to do?

292
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,330
Does he want to be a gangster?

293
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,710
What about the police?

294
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,400
Well...

295
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,570
I already told the police station

296
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,430
about Mr. Yeom's fake license plate number and his anonymous phone number.

297
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:24,190
They should have tracked him down with the information.

298
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,130
But nothing happens till now.

299
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,430
Could it be...

300
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,500
That's right. They have spies in the police team.

301
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,410
I'm sure Seon Dong-sik must know that we're on your side.

302
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,520
Even the police have their men. We won't be killed, will we?

303
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,640
Anyway, we need to find Seon Dong-sik first.

304
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,300
I'll look into every possible place.

305
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,310
We must find him

306
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,140
and take him to the Prosecution.

307
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,860
Be careful.

308
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,530
By the way, how's Miss Seul-bi? The rumor I heard about her is quite strange.

309
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,760
She's quite upset.

310
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,650
Are you talking about the rumor on the internet? I saw it too.

311
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,100
Is she really a witch?

312
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,950
Whoops. What are you talking about?

313
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,250
No. No.

314
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,200
I mean I envy her.

315
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,510
She has superpower.

316
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,870
Yes, she does.

317
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,510
Take good care of Seul-bi.

318
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,140
We have a lot of customers right now. Why did you call us here?

319
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,140
-Right. -Right.

320
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,310
Everyone, be quiet. Soo-kwang has something to say.

321
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,740
Are you still mad at us?

322
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,630
Okay, Soo-kwang. Say it.

323
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,300
There was no window

324
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,650
in Seul-bi's room.

325
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,170
She wanted to know the outside world.

326
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,790
But, to know the outside world, reading was her only way.

327
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,230
That's why she kept reading.

328
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,770
She could only talk the way like the words she read in the books.

329
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:03,270
Seul-bi wanted to see the world outside,

330
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,380
so she envied paper planes.

331
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,450
For 20 years,

332
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,050
from infant to five,

333
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,790
from 10 to 20 years old,

334
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,700
she had been envying paper planes the most.

335
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,700
The first world she saw after escaping from that terrible place

336
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,480
was Seodong Market.

337
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,550
For Seul-bi, Seodong Market is her whole world.

338
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:34,690
The owners of Seodong Market are the people she knows in the entire world.

339
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,540
And Seul-bi,

340
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:45,020
loves everyone she knows in this world.

341
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,340
Seul-bi drew these with this emotion.

342
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:09,550
So please don't keep away from her

343
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,170
as you're the only ones she knows in this world.

344
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,930
I'm so touched.

345
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:21,800
Well... I think this is me.

346
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,180
This must be you.

347
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,110
She only knows us in this world.

348
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,410
Seong-deok, hurry!

349
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:31,790
Hearing you say this makes me feel weird.

350
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,670
Oh, this is me.

351
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,580
That's a great drawing.

352
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,040
Oh.

353
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,340
Ms. Bang.

354
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,700
Hyun Taen.

355
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,650
Don't get us wrong.

356
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,850
We are not fickle people who read those rumors on the internet.

357
00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:00,380
So this is the pass to access that forbidden place for 22 years, right?

358
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,090
-Yes. -Yes.

359
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,380
If there's something fishy like a haunted house... What should we do?

360
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,840
Stop talking nonsense.

361
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,230
Do you think a rich family's bathroom would be on the bed?

362
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,060
That's great.

363
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,150
-Then I'll flirt with a rich man too. -Go ahead.

364
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,060
What about Mr. Kim?

365
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:21,250
Are we all going to Seul-bi's house?

366
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,460
Of course.

367
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,690
What should I wear? I don't have decent clothes.

368
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,880
Don't worry. Come to my shop.

369
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,080
We have all kinds of red, yellow, green, blue and purple dresses.

370
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,980
You heard that? We'll all go.

371
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,210
So you should smile too.

372
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,080
That's right. Smile.

373
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,460
What's with Jung's face?

374
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,950
-Smile. -That's right.

375
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,360
Don't yell at us anymore.

376
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,470
-It's scary. -It's scary.

377
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,710
Smile.

378
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,830
It's good to smile, right?

379
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,030
I'm scared. Where are we going?

380
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,420
Don't put your hands down.

381
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,790
Okay.

382
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,970
We're almost there.

383
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,530
One, two, three. Look.

384
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,520
What's all this?

385
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,500
Soo-kwang.

386
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,250
If we go back to the beginning,

387
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,990
can we still remember everything happened,

388
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:06,180
and all the happiness we've been through?

389
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,590
Or will we forget everything?

390
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:16,170
Forget everything, Seul-bi.

391
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,590
Let's forget all unhappy

392
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,970
and sad moments.

393
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,790
Let's start over

394
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,830
from now on.

395
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,240
Soo-kwang.

396
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,230
What?

397
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,130
Gong Soo-kwang.

398
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,690
What?

399
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,600
Is that a star?

400
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,110
Yes.

401
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:49,460
From now on... I'm going to call that star Gong Soo-kwang.

402
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,060
Hey, stop doing this.

403
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,080
Why? That star looks like you.

404
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,460
Not at all.

405
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,740
Yes, it takes after you.

406
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,780
It's dazzling from afar.

407
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,820
Soo-kwang.

408
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,060
Even if we're

409
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,280
apart because of something,

410
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,990
and become distant from each other,

411
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,160
please always shine like that star

412
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,170
so that I can find you.

413
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,430
Seul-bi.

414
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,480
Yes?

415
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,560
You know,

416
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,570
actually, they are two stars.

417
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,370
Really?

418
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:49,500
Because they are together, they look like one star.

419
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,050
Hence, we will never be apart.

420
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,750
You know,

421
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,700
even tough without my ability,

422
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,760
you can still manage Geumhwa Group well.

423
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,410
That's why I chose you.

424
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,420
But you didn't know it yourself.

425
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,770
Fortunately,

426
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,680
I still have some ability left.

427
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:12,370
So I want to use the only ability left

428
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,320
on us.

429
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,050
So,

430
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,620
plese leave me

431
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,650
a happy memory.

432
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,660
Promise me, please.

433
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,630
Mi-soo!

434
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,480
Mi-soo!

435
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,080
Mi-soo!

436
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,160
Mi-soo!

437
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,060
Mom.

438
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,530
Hello?

439
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,740
Hello.

440
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,140
Sun Dong-sik.

441
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:56,960
You're right. Did you miss me?

442
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,180
The police will find you.

443
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:04,520
Police? I have to meet the police because of you.

444
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,330
You're making fun of me.

445
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:12,100
So I thought a lot about how to teach you a lesson.

446
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:17,610
Should I kill you or sell you somewhere?

447
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:22,390
But I find that I like playing with you.

448
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,040
You too, right?

449
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,900
Turn yourself in.

450
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,080
Then the crimes you've committed will be forgiven...

451
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,130
Hey.

452
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,660
I told you I'd play with you as much as I want.

453
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,870
You like playing with me too, right?.

454
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:44,150
Witch, guess.

455
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:49,300
Guess what I'll do next.

456
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,540
What do you want?

457
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,430
-You. -What?

458
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:59,730
It's you. I just want you.

459
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:03,480
I believe you'll come to me by yourself.

460
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,010
Hey, Soo-kwang.

461
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,350
Bro, I have a favor to ask.

462
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,840
Okay. Do as you say.

463
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,820
What are you doing?

464
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,260
The unlocking pattern of my phone is a heart for you.

465
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,639
Come on.

466
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,100
I can't stand it.

467
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:09,030
Wow, so sexy.

468
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,160
Well done, Mr. Yeom.

469
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,620
Hey, gambler.

470
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,750
Thank you for hiring us, sir.

471
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,110
We'll do anything for you.

472
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,880
We're all in the same boat. We both have nowhere to go.

473
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,710
By the way, sir, Mr. Wang and Pi Dae Shik are looking for you.

474
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,800
Really? It's so quick for them to find here.

475
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,300
You're amazing. Well done.

476
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,670
Very good.

477
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:45,060
-Did I make you upset? -No.

478
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,530
Then don't frown.

479
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,130
Give it to me.

480
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:06,340
Why is this in your trunk?

481
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,930
Whose money is this?

482
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,950
I thought you were too slow.

483
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:20,570
Whether it's to inquire about information or to arrest Mr. Choi,

484
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,490
Mr. Wang will do it for you.

485
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,720
See? And so it is now.

486
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,260
If you're going to run away, run away earlier.

487
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,770
Do you still want to say goodbye to me?

488
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,130
So you're too slow.

489
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,150
Sir, please spare me this once.

490
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,810
That crazy jerk.

491
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,370
OK. Let's begin.

492
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,070
For the Groups participating in the realization bidding of Geumhwa Group,

493
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:59,250
we have made a request to safeguard the interests of all employees and stabilize the employment relationship.

494
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,170
Okay.

495
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:07,970
(Seon Dong-sik I'm going to turn myself in. I'll meet you at the cafe in the hotel tonight. Just come to me alone.)

496
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,450
I'm going to turn myself in.
(Seon Dong-sik I'm going to turn myself in. I'll meet you at the cafe in the hotel tonight. Just come to me alone.)

497
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,510
Let's meet at the cafe of the hotel tonight.
(Seon Dong-sik I'm going to turn myself in. I'll meet you at the cafe in the hotel tonight. Just come to me alone.)

498
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,860
Just come to me yourself.

499
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,310
Okay.

500
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,870
Brother, I found Sun Dong-sik.

501
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,090
He was at Yu Song Company.

502
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:32,020
-In that abandoned warehouse? -Yes.

503
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,190
Darn it. Why didn't I think of that?

504
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,890
What brings you here?

505
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:57,200
Did Sun Dong-sik make you be here? Is he at Yu Song Company?

506
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,490
Take him.

507
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,410
-It hurts. It hurts. -I can walk...

508
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,130
My gosh.

509
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,790
-Seul-bi. -Seul-bi.

510
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,220
This place is so grand.

511
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,050
Why did you stay in the attic

512
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,530
instead of this grand house?

513
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,440
Seul-bi, you're so forward-minded.

514
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,230
It's nice but gloomy like a witch...

515
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,590
Why is she so nice? She has a high position and heavy responsibility.

516
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,650
The attic is high and the house is high.

517
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,720
What Seul-bi likes has high standards.

518
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,170
Why are you all here?

519
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,910
Soo-kwang gave us invitations

520
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,140
and threatened us that he would kill us if we didn't show up.

521
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,640
Mr. Park, when did I do that?

522
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,070
You did!

523
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:56,170
You gave us the invitations with cold eyes.

524
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,030
You're right. He fired a laser at me. Biu Biu Biu.

525
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,580
Seul-bi. I want to visit your house. Hurry up.

526
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,250
Yes, we do!

527
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,390
Thank you for coming.

528
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,900
Welcome to Seul-bi's house.

529
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,790
Oh, my. It's a garden.

530
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,060
Oh, my. It's like a jungle.

531
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,180
Tae San will appear in the jungle, right?

532
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,030
Tae San!

533
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,800
It's a library.

534
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,630
Oh, my. It's great.

535
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,670
-Seul-bi. -Yes?

536
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,970
Something came up at work. I will come back when I finish it.

537
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,180
Right now?

538
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,620
-I'm sorry. It won't take long. -Okay.

539
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:43,010
Seul-bi, come here. What is this?

540
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,300
See you later.

541
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:52,760
Let's drink gracefully.

542
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,840
Okay, let's do it gracefully.

543
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,210
Gracefully, cheers!

544
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,690
Gracefully.

545
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,760
Seul-bi. We are sorry for you for things happened in the market.

546
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,440
Aged people like us are cowards.

547
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,540
We're afraid of plastic bags on the floor

548
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,830
flying over to cover our face, right?

549
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,080
What are you talking about?

550
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,800
Don't you think so?

551
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,060
Let's not talk about this. There are always weird comments online.

552
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,390
You must be upset.

553
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:27,630
It's okay, sister. I never surf the Internet.

554
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,590
Seul-bi is really smart. I quit the Internet too.

555
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,390
Things on the Internet are annoying.

556
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,330
A bunch of weird people are always criticizing others all the time. So chattering.

557
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:41,630
No matter how dangerous the world is, we support you, Seul-bi.

558
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:45,030
That's right. All of us support you.

559
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,920
Seul-bi is so perfect.

560
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,540
Young-woo. Expect perfect, can't you say other words?

561
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,540
Seul-bi is more perfect.

562
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:58,570
You're much more perfect people. Thank you.

563
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,970
But where's Soo-kwang?

564
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,650
He told us to come, but he disappeared.

565
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:06,700
It's a big company, so he must be busy.

566
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,780
Let's take a picture together. Commemorative photo.

567
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,710
Sure.

568
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,710
Gosh.

569
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,830
What commemorative photo? It's tacky. Are you here for a tour?

570
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,420
Hurry up.

571
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:27,020
Excuse me, pretty lady. Take a photo for us.

572
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,020
Thank you.

573
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:34,230
Turn around.

574
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,270
Come on, let's be graceful.

575
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,980
Gracegul.

576
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,200
One, two, three.

577
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,630
If I have that, I can make him move.

578
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,160
(Seon Dong-sik I'm a little nervous to think about turning myself in. Soo-kwang, wait a little longer.)

579
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,060
I'm nervous to think of turning myself in.
(Seon Dong-sik I'm a little nervous to think about turning myself in. Soo-kwang, wait a little longer.)

580
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,660
Soo-kwang, wait a little longer.
(Seon Dong-sik I'm a little nervous to think about turning myself in. Soo-kwang, wait a little longer.)

581
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,500
(Seul-bi)

582
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,290
Hi, Seul-bi.

583
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,410
Soo-kwang, when are you coming back?

584
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,920
Oh, no. I have to deal with many things. I think it will take a long time.

585
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,360
Do you have fun with everyone?

586
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:24,200
Yes, I'm happy. Don't worry. Get back when you finish your work.

587
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,460
-Okay. Call me if you need. -OK.

588
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:55,110
Guess where the bomb is.

589
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:58,710
What are you doing? Where are you?

590
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,370
I'll give you an hour.

591
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:05,070
No, 59 minutes and 11 seconds. 10 seconds. 9 seconds.

592
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:09,220
If you come to me, the bomb won't explode.

593
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,510
But you have to come alone, you know?

594
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:16,960
If you tell someone else,

595
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,430
the bomb will explode.

596
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,950
Stop it. Or I will never let you go.

597
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:27,280
Why? Are you going to curse me?

598
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:32,700
Oh, right. Listen to something familiar.

599
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,230
Help!

600
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,810
-Help! -Help!

601
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,530
-Help! -Help!

602
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,050
Let them go.

603
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,210
I can only let them go if you come.

604
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,710
Come on. Let's play.

605
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,670
What? Are you all off work?

606
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,670
You're so disloyal.

607
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:00,640
Did the vibration ring from here?

608
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,140
You left your phone behind.

609
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,550
Are you recording all this time?

610
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,320
A heart.

611
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,200
What can I do for you?

612
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,140
Come closer.

613
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,030
If Pi Dae-sik and I get caught,

614
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,840
call Gong Soo-kwang.

615
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:45,100
Gong Soo-kwang!

616
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,110
Soo-kwang!

617
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,440
Witch, you're finally here.

618
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,030
You didn't let me down.

619
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,350
Seul-bi. It's dangerous. Run away.

620
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:15,830
Seul-bi!

621
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:18,280
-Seul-bi, run! -Are you OK?

622
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,970
I'm sorry. I make you suffer.

623
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:24,400
You should go.

624
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,670
Seul-bi, no.

625
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:29,330
You came here for us.

626
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,670
I'm so touched.

627
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:39,290
I'm here. Let them go. Let's stop here.

628
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:43,540
How can I do that? We made a deal, right?

629
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,360
You have to become mine completely.

630
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,390
Sun Dong-sik. I will kill you.

631
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,730
Make him stop talking!

632
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,000
No! Stop!

633
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:02,210
I... I want to posses all you own.

634
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:06,190
Your power. Your competence.

635
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:09,000
I want everything you have.

636
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,690
Let them go.

637
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:11,520
Darn it.

638
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:19,760
Why do you keep repeating the same thing?

639
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,270
Boring.

640
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,520
Besides, you not only want to save them,

641
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:32,290
but also want to save the people of Geumhwa Hotel.

642
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,470
Ta-da! Help!

643
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,320
-Seul-bi. -Seul-bi.

644
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,260
-She's not here. -No?

645
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,580
Where did she go? She didn't answer the call.

646
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,730
Ta-da. Seul-bi. Help me.

647
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,040
What? You didn't think of it?

648
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:06,110
Hey. Where would I most like to blow up?

649
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,230
Geumhwa Hotel, of course.

650
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:10,560
You monster!

651
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:13,780
You trained the monster yourself.

652
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:19,740
Follow me. Take you to a good place.

653
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,850
-Seul-bi! No! -No!

654
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,700
-Seul-bi! -Seul-bi!

655
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,800
-Seul-bi! -No. Don't follow him.

656
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,410
Soo-kwang. Seul-bi isn't in the hotel.

657
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:43,420
What?

658
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,780
I don't know when she left.

659
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,320
Sun Dong-sik.

660
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:11,520
To celebrate that you will become my woman, cheers!

661
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:18,970
Do you want me to blow it up right now?

662
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:23,770
Please don't do this. It's not late. Stop it.

663
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:25,080
Cheers.

664
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,540
Very good.

665
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,430
There's something I'm curious about.

666
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:49,080
How did you stop the time bomb last time?

667
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,540
Can you stop the bombs of Geumhwa Hotel at such a distance?

668
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:57,310
Please, stop it.

669
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:58,560
I'm pissed off.

670
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:03,850
Let's just enjoy ourselves.

671
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,730
You like playing with me, right?

672
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:12,500
Do you want to play something else with me?

673
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:20,440
-Are you curious that how could I stop the time bomb? -What?

674
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,240
There's a time bomb in the boiler room of the hotel.

675
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,370
Let's move now.

676
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:54,510
Yes, sir.

677
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,830
Give this to the chief.

678
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:11,510
If he doesn't take action after seeing this, tell him

679
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:14,110
he'll end up like me. he will be a criminal.

680
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,540
Yes, sir.

681
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:23,790
Hurry up.

682
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:26,950
(Reliable policemen who are with the people)

683
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,780
(Reliable policemen who are with the people)

684
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,070
You're really something.

685
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,450
Wow, you're amazing.

686
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,840
You're really amazing.

687
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:04,610
I want you.

688
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:11,930
I really want you.

689
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:13,020
Let go!

690
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,050
-I said let go! -Stay still!

691
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:42,510
Seul-bi!

692
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:49,730
No!

693
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:50,940
-No, Soo-kwang. -Seul-bi.

694
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,380
Soo-kwang, don't come.

695
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,710
No!

696
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:00,260
Darn it! Seul-bi!

697
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:12,040
-Seul-bi. -Soo-kwang.

698
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:16,840
-Seul-bi. -Soo-kwang.

699
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,620
Seul-bi!

700
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,760
No! Don't come near me!

701
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,380
Seul-bi.

702
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,570
Soo-kwang, you should go.

703
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,910
Darn it! It's him again.

704
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:30,920
I was going to blow him up with Geumhwa Hotel.

705
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:36,780
What should I do? Soo-kwang.

706
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:39,300
Soo-kwang.

707
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,100
Seul-bi.

708
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,630
Are you Prosecutor Park from the North Prosecutors' Office?

709
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:00,050
I'm Seon Min-joon from Geumhwa Group.

710
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:16,050
Brother.

711
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,590
What the hell?

712
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,750
You bastards!

713
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,190
I'll sneak in and stand by.

714
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:34,480
I'm counting on you.

715
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,790
Don't worry.

716
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,390
I have a favor to ask.

717
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:50,450
You need to be arrested by Sun Dong-sik.

718
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:53,280
To find out where Sun Dong-sik is and save Ms. Min,

719
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,340
we have to do that.

720
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,110
Brother, I'll go find Seul-bi.

721
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:16,320
Okay, go ahead.

722
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:19,290
Darn it.

723
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,360
Seul-bi!

724
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:39,760
Seul-bi!

725
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,450
Gong Soo-kwang, don't come near me.

726
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:42,650
Or I'll shoot.

727
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,030
That's enough, Sun Dong-sik.

728
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:51,780
The police are on their way.

729
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:54,670
Let's stop here.

730
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,480
It's this witch! This witch!

731
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,720
This witch made me like this.

732
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:06,520
No one did this to you.

733
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:10,940
You're the one who caused this.

734
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,770
If you stop now,

735
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,180
you can go back.

736
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:21,080
Don't move. Darn it.

737
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,020
Stop talking nonsense.

738
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,110
Go back?

739
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:26,810
I'll never get caught.

740
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:30,620
Dong-sik, stop, OK?

741
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,650
Dong-sik.

742
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:42,840
I told you not to come.

743
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:06,170
I did this to you?

744
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:10,470
Yes. It's me who made you become a monster.

745
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:16,550
So I'll make sure you stop.

746
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,240
We're both monsters, Sun Dong-sik.

747
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:27,590
Let's disappear together.

748
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,650
Seul-bi! No!

749
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,080
Seul-bi, stop.

750
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,820
Seul-bi!

751
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,830
Seul-bi, stop! No!

752
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:23,320
Seul-bi!

753
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,560
Are you okay?

754
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,710
Soo-kwang.

755
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,750
That's a relief.

756
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,280
That's a relief, Seul-bi.

757
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,330
I...

758
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,980
What did I do?

759
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,560
Nothing.

760
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,110
It's okay, Seul-bi.

761
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:52,630
It's okay, Seul-bi.

762
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,900
No.

763
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,090
No! Soo-kwang!

764
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:29,680
Soo-kwang! No!

765
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,660
No!

766
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:42,700
Soo-kwang! No!

767
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,540
Please come back.

768
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,940
Soo-kwang, come back.

769
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,890
Come back.

770
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:38,420
(Preview of the next episode)

771
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:44,680
It's all my fault.

772
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:47,390
It's all my fault.

773
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,090
Sir, this is your package,

774
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:51,200
but there's no sender on it.

775
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,310
If I had run away with you back then,

776
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:57,210
what would have happened to us?

777
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:59,130
I'm sorry, Seul-bi.

778
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,150
I couldn't protect you.

779
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,840
I'm sorry, Seul-bi.
