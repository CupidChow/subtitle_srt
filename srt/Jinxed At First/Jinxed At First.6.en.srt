00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,200
(Yu Song Company)

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,240
(Yu Song Company)

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,840
(Song)

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,560
(Yu)

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,510
Hello? I am here to deliver the hairtail.
(Yu)

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,010
Is anyone here?

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,520
No!

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,830
What happened?

10
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,550
Where are you?

11
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,780
Soo-kwang, where are you?

12
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:24,110
Let me think

13
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,450
what that place is.

14
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,470
(Yunmi-dong, Liujiang District, Yu Song Company)

15
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,100
Yu Song Company.

16
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,910
Yu Song Company.

17
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,740
I made some scallion pancakes, Myeong Seong’s wife.

18
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,810
Yu Song company！

19
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,610
Myeong Seong’s wife!

20
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,590
What's wrong with her? Why does she look so anxious?

21
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,020
Yes.

22
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,580
Did you make these for Myeong-seong?

23
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,910
Myeong-seong?

24
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,820
He's not here too.

25
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,170
By the way, is he delivering goods to Young-woo's grandma's chain restaurant?

26
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,250
Oh, really?

27
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,950
That's strange.

28
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,400
Back then, everyone wanted to kick him out.

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,110
But now, we're all his fans.

30
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,060
You can't be like this.

31
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,410
When did you ever make me a pancake?

32
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,170
Hi, Seul-bi.

33
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,800
Why did you call me in person? It's an honor.

34
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,860
Seul-bi.

35
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,640
Pi Dae Shik.

36
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,910
Long time no see.

37
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,130
Let go!

38
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,070
Let go!

39
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,980
Aren't you looking for Go Myeong-seong?

40
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,610
I know where he is.

41
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,010
Where is Soo-kwang?

42
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,220
Soo-kwang?

43
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,800
Is that how you call Go Myeong-seong?

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,590
If you want to know, come with me.

45
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,370
Let go. I'm going to call out loud.

46
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,329
Let me show you something.

47
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,410
Soo-kwang.

48
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,470
Are you going to find Go Myeong-seong,

49
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,530
or to wait for the news of his death?

50
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,150
Get in.

51
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,740
Get in.

52
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,560
(Seon Min-joon)

53
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,600
If Seul-bi hears Mi-soo's voice... She'll be happy.

54
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,890
Soo-kwang.

55
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,360
Soo-kwang! Wake up! Soo-kwang!

56
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,390
Soo-kwang!

57
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,890
What did you do to him?

58
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,380
It's okay.

59
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,340
He just took some anesthesia and passed out.

60
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,840
Why did you do that to him?

61
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,950
I want to know too.

62
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,430
I thought I just needed to bring you here,

63
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,909
but I was told to tie this big guy up as well.

64
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,990
It bothered me too.

65
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,340
-Why should I tie him up here? I'm tired. -Soo-kwang.

66
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,350
I should tie you up here too.

67
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,070
Okay.

68
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,980
That's all for my mission.

69
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,220
I'll get going.

70
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,610
What is this?

71
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,580
Is it valuable?

72
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,890
Oh.

73
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,220
Thank you.

74
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,540
Hey!

75
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,930
Pi Dae Shik!

76
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,740
You bastard!

77
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,590
Soo-kwang!

78
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,290
Soo-kwang, get up.

79
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,960
Soo-kwang! Hey, wake up!

80
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,170
Soo-kwang, are you awake?

81
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,490
Where am I?

82
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,350
Hey, Seul-bi. What are you doing here?

83
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,670
It was Pi Dae Shik.

84
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:54,770
Can you untie this rope?

85
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,030
You bastard!

86
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,170
Hey, Pi Dae Shik! You bastard!

87
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,450
Oh, shit.

88
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,970
Am I dreaming?

89
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,230
Is that a time bomb?

90
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,590
A bomb?

91
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,210
Put explosives in the metal container.

92
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,990
It's an explosive detonated by throwing or dropping.

93
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,990
It's urgent. You still want to recite the dictionary? You're really special.

94
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,950
Do you know how to remove the bomb?

95
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,790
No.

96
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,830
You should've memorized this useful knowledge, you fool.

97
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,340
I didn't know I'd need this knowledge one day.

98
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,450
Looks like it hasn't started yet.

99
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,630
Let's find ways to untie ourselves.

100
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,200
Okay.

101
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,880
Untie yourself.

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,340
Thank you.

103
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,980
Take care.

104
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,400
Hey, let's go.

105
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,400
What a nice day.

106
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,770
Seul-bi is in danger.

107
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,290
Min-joon.

108
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,770
What happened?

109
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,030
Nothing.

110
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,900
Gosh, they tried so hard.

111
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,880
You seem close to one another.

112
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,950
Soo-kwang.

113
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,480
You're a man, but you can't do anything.

114
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,180
Do something!

115
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,600
(Lucky Fish Shop)

116
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,240
(Chief Wang)

117
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,150
Seul-bi.

118
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,140
Myeong-seong.

119
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,940
Did Myeong-seong go out?

120
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,760
They left in a hurry.

121
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,950
Hasn't he been back yet?

122
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,020
How long has he been out?

123
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,450
About half an hour.

124
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,390
No.

125
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,909
It's almost an hour.

126
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,270
Hello?

127
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,850
Seul-bi. I couldn't reach you. I was so worried.

128
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,440
I'm not Seul-bi. I found this phone.

129
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,310
What?

130
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,530
Where are you now?

131
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,720
(Parking Lot)

132
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,540
-That phone... -Is this yours?
(Parking Lot)

133
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,450
-Yes. -Yes.
(Parking Lot)

134
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,230
-Yes. -Yes.

135
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,530
Thank you.

136
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,710
(Yu Song Company)

137
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,670
Yu Song company?

138
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,130
This name sounds familiar.

139
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,210
Mr. Choi, it's me.

140
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,740
Isn't Yu Song Company one of the hideouts that boss used before?

141
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,140
Is that place still available?

142
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,480
No?

143
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,680
Okay. I see.

144
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,030
Come on. Witch.

145
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,560
Let me see how you avoid misfortune.

146
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,690
Soo-kwang!

147
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,260
The countdown starts.

148
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,600
Seul-bi.

149
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,810
-Untie this no matter how hard it is. -What should we do?

150
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,950
We have to get out.

151
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,890
What should we do?

152
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:24,390
Push harder, Seul-bi. We have to get out.

153
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,770
I hope there's something sharp.

154
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,730
Something sharp?

155
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,500
I have!

156
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,550
Where is it?

157
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,610
This one. This.

158
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,270
This one.

159
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,710
It's a pin.

160
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,300
Oh, that's right.

161
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,980
I can untie it with this.

162
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,160
Can you give it to me?

163
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,760
No, my hands are tied up.

164
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,610
Come closer to me.

165
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,670
This way.

166
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,450
Come closer.

167
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,680
Yes, a little more.

168
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,550
-Hey, Seul-bi. -Ah.

169
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,400
Don't move. It hurts.

170
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,520
I'll do it.

171
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,990
Don't get hurt.

172
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,200
Hey! What are you doing?

173
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,380
Hurry up.

174
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,490
-Hurry up. -Okay.

175
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,710
Wait.

176
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,420
-Hurry up. -Shit.

177
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,300
Isn't this plot too common?

178
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,940
You don't have much time. Let me see if you can escape.

179
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,640
Show me what you've got, Miss Witch!

180
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,710
Good luck, Soo-kwang!

181
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,790
Come on! Come on!

182
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,510
This mosquito repellent smells...

183
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,790
too more bitter.

184
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,140
It's almost done. Hurry up.

185
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,090
-Hurry up. -Okay.

186
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,290
One.

187
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,220
Two.

188
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,140
-Three. -Three.

189
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,310
Hurry up.

190
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,030
Wait.

191
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,800
Good job, Soo-kwang.

192
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,360
You're the best, Soo-kwang!

193
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,420
Hey, here comes another man.

194
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,230
Why did he come alone?

195
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,080
Where's the search team?

196
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,830
Seul-bi.

197
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,630
Hey, he's so fast.

198
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,270
Tell our men to stop him.

199
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,720
Seul-bi.

200
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,730
Hey.

201
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,770
Why did you come to my place?

202
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,010
Who are you?

203
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,360
Where is Seul-bi?

204
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,840
Wait. I think we're almost there.

205
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,390
Soo-kwang! Hurry!

206
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,240
Are we done?

207
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,290
Hurry up.

208
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,420
Soo-kwang.

209
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,520
Seul-bi.

210
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,150
Darn it!

211
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,450
Gosh, how miserable Seon Min-joon is.

212
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,100
Just for a witch? He's the dignified Seon Min-joon.

213
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,330
I make it.

214
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,470
Wait.

215
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,590
Hurry up.

216
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,310
Wait.

217
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,490
Seul-bi.

218
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,770
Seul-bi, wait.

219
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,550
Okay, Seul-bi.

220
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,430
Untie me too.

221
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,260
Okay.

222
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,270
-It's untied. Let's go. -Get out. Come here.

223
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,560
Hey!

224
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,620
Hey!

225
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,730
We're almost there.

226
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,890
Ten.

227
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,520
Nine.

228
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,130
Eight.

229
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,860
It will be fine,

230
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,150
Soo-kwang.

231
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,570
What's that?

232
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,770
What's that?

233
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,920
It stopped, Seul-bi.

234
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,500
The bomb stopped!

235
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,080
Seul-bi, we're saved!

236
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,230
Hey, what are you doing?

237
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,750
Get in! Hurry!

238
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,890
Okay.

239
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,350
Seul-bi, let's go.

240
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,280
What?

241
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,620
Darn it. Why didn't it explode?

242
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,170
Darn it.

243
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,240
Follow me!

244
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,730
Soo-kwang.

245
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,190
Seul-bi, are you awake?

246
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,460
Let's go home.

247
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,230
Okay, let's go home.

248
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,530
Mr. Wang, let's go home.

249
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,460
Is Seul-bi awake?

250
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,280
Yes.

251
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,840
It's okay, Seul-bi.

252
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,160
Everything is fine now.

253
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,560
What happened?

254
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,940
The timer stopped.

255
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,540
Did that woman stop it?

256
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,240
Interesting.

257
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,410
I'll put it away.

258
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,480
Darn it.

259
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,490
Hey!

260
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,870
Darn it.

261
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,710
Oh. That's right. Be careful.

262
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,570
Goodness.

263
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,540
Seul-bi. Don't you need to see a doctor?

264
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,730
I'm not going.

265
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,890
It hurts here.

266
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,839
Blow it for me.

267
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,750
But you're bleeding.

268
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,940
The scratch is deep.

269
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,020
Wait for me.

270
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,859
Be careful.

271
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,609
Hang in there.

272
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,619
-Blow it for me. -Oh.

273
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,089
-Blow it. -Okay.

274
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,240
It hurts, right?

275
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,270
What should I do?

276
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,720
I'm fine.

277
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,650
Seul-bi, don't worry and get some rest.

278
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,720
I'll blow on him.

279
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,100
Why are you blushing?

280
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,340
It's like burning fire.

281
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,270
As hot as the flame.

282
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,860
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

283
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,130
Feel better now?

284
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,250
Goodness.

285
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,960
I've been dreaming since she left.

286
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,430
Are you scared?

287
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,120
Are you afraid you'll end up like that too.

288
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,660
Just like your dad did.

289
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,940
Seul-bi is different from me.

290
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,550
She can be a normal person and lead a normal life.

291
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:46,040
Bearing those unrealistic thoughts, you caused such a mess.

292
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,430
Have you considered what would happen later?

293
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,490
You're really despicable.

294
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,760
I'm despicable?

295
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,020
If you were so scared, why didn't you kill me back then?

296
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,540
I've been protecting you for 20 years.

297
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,630
And I have raised that child.

298
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,900
Am I going to pay for that?

299
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,390
Protect?

300
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,440
You're just trying to satisfy your ambition with the help of my ability.

301
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,170
You kept Seul-bi just to make her a tool for your son.

302
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:26,710
She won't be able to come back anymore.

303
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,450
The misfortune of the outside world is piling up on her body.

304
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,680
Of course I can't let her be Min-joon's side.

305
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,010
Are you scared?

306
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,050
I thought the people who were looking for Seul-bi were her family.

307
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,820
Who are the people trying to catch her?

308
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,310
Shouldn't we call the police?

309
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,050
What if the big shot works for the police?

310
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,440
No way.

311
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,470
But we can't guarantee it's not true.

312
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,480
Since he can be protected by our boss so well,

313
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,880
maybe his status is far beyond our imagination.

314
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,190
Seul-bi isn't an ordinary person.

315
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,440
I'll catch Pi Dae Shik and ask him about what happened.

316
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,970
Don't even trust the police.

317
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,250
I see.

318
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,490
We should be able to find them first.

319
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,130
Min-joon, what happened?

320
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,730
I had a fight at the bar.

321
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,690
What are you doing out there?

322
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,870
Min-joon, let's talk.

323
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,070
Don't you need to go to the hospital?

324
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,490
I'm fine.

325
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,510
You didn't fight at the bar, did you?

326
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,120
You're not that kind of person.

327
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,890
I do that occasionally.

328
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,750
Okay. Which bar is it?

329
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,720
Who are they? I'll deal with this.

330
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,210
Just forget about it since it's not a big deal.

331
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,390
When you can't handle it,

332
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,280
you must let me know.

333
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,060
I'm okay.

334
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,450
Soo-kwang.

335
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,830
Soo-kwang, look at this.

336
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,540
I fried an egg!

337
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,920
Are you okay?

338
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,240
Are you feeling better?

339
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,630
Yes.

340
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,510
Ta-da.

341
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,560
Try it.

342
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,530
Try it.

343
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,180
It's good.

344
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,740
Really?

345
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,620
Really? Are you serious?

346
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,660
Yes.

347
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,720
I was praised.

348
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,070
Seul-bi.

349
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,420
What?

350
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,200
How did the bomb stop in that warehouse yesterday?

351
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,630
I don't know.

352
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,720
Maybe it's broken.

353
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:40,050
You said you were worried before I delivered the goods.

354
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,740
Did you know that I would be in danger at the warehouse?

355
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,100
What?

356
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,610
What you say...

357
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,090
will become reality soon.

358
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,600
Well...

359
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,730
I dreamed about it.

360
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,110
My dream is accurate.

361
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,060
If I had a bad dream,

362
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,080
that would happen that day.

363
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,820
Can you tell me the truth now?

364
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,310
Why did you run away?

365
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,570
Who are you hiding from?

366
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,610
Who...

367
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,580
Who are you?

368
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,840
Since you said you like me, then why can't you be honest to me?

369
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,910
Why do you keep lying to me?

370
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,220
How can I like someone who always lies to me?

371
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,680
I'm sorry.

372
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,910
Where is your necklace?

373
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,510
The necklace...

374
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,120
Pi Dae Shik took it away.

375
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,620
That necklace is important to you, right?

376
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,510
You've been wearing it.

377
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,350
It's okay.

378
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,150
The necklace will come back.

379
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,390
Seul-bi.

380
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,150
I'm hungry.

381
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,480
I'm eating. Do you have to keep scolding me at the moment?

382
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,400
This gem is part of you.

383
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,450
So no one can take it away.

384
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,720
What if I lose it?

385
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,230
Once it is separated from you,

386
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,230
it will return to you with its own will.

387
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,880
This is a stone.

388
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,970
What?

389
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,530
What do you mean?

390
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,060
Take a good look.

391
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,510
Isn't this a blue diamond?

392
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,000
No way.

393
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,240
It's just a rock.

394
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,920
Can ordinary stones be so crystal clear?

395
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,940
Can there be such color?

396
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,950
It shines at night.

397
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,350
I don't know though.

398
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,230
This necklace is 18K.

399
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,070
You can just sell this necklace.

400
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,670
Forget it.

401
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,750
Who are you trying to fool?

402
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,030
You know, it looks like a valuable treasure.

403
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,070
Can't you recognize precious stones?

404
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,480
You're indeed Myeong-seong's woman. What a bad luck.

405
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,560
That's a pity. I'll wear it myself.

406
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,570
What?

407
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:43,130
So itchy.

408
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,690
What are you doing in front of my store?

409
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,510
-Darn it. -This necklace...

410
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,960
Don't touch me.

411
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,470
Go to the hospital.

412
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,160
No need.

413
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,440
Over there.

414
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,260
I have to go that way.

415
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,480
Where is that?

416
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,380
Seul-bi is fine.

417
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,390
I'll protect her.

418
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,610
Don't do this.

419
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,620
You'll be in danger if you bring her back.

420
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,420
What's wrong?

421
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,040
He looks like a zombie!

422
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,620
If you're sick, go to the hospital.

423
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,950
Don't come near him.

424
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,780
What if we get infected?

425
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,500
He may get the parasites that kill people in the movie.

426
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,770
Why isn't Mr. Wang here yet?

427
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:47,930
Goodness.

428
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,240
Myeong-seong.

429
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,200
Pi Dae Shik has been acting like this.

430
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,920
It's so itchy.

431
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,840
Take it off for me.

432
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,910
Hey.

433
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,610
Stay away from Seul-bi.

434
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,890
Myeong-seong.

435
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,520
It's because of the necklace.

436
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,690
When did you get here, bro?

437
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,380
I almost died.

438
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,760
Come here, you bastard!

439
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,550
-Bro! -Follow me, you bastard!

440
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,210
See?

441
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,910
It's back.

442
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,100
Bro.

443
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,590
Bro, please forgive me this time.

444
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,150
I understand now.

445
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,280
What do you understand?

446
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,690
You're right.

447
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,130
That girl...

448
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,830
She... she's not an ordinary person.

449
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,900
I won't mess with her anymore.

450
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,880
I won't do it again.

451
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,740
I'll reflect on myself.

452
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,930
Who told you to kidnap Seul-bi?

453
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,270
I don't know.

454
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,120
Maybe a rich man.

455
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,720
He gave me a huge amount of money.

456
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,270
Call him.

457
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,470
Okay, I'll call him.

458
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,230
Let go of me.

459
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,350
Call him first.

460
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,650
Darn it.

461
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,650
Here you are.

462
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,900
The number you dialed does not exist.

463
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,970
Please check the number and dial again.

464
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,370
Do you want to die?

465
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,220
What I said is true.

466
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,480
It's true. That number is right.

467
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,450
Please don't kill me.

468
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,870
I've been with you since elementary school.

469
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,020
I'm really reflecting on myself.

470
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,640
I will sincerely apologize to her.

471
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,420
You bastard!

472
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,740
If you do this again, I'll kill you! I won't let you off so easily.

473
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,150
Okay, okay.

474
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:47,050
Goodness.

475
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,560
He really threw me down.

476
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,330
Darn it.

477
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,720
(Yinsheng Capital)

478
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,970
You punk.

479
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,050
Stop.

480
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:00,180
(Chairman Seon Il-jung)
Stop.

481
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:00,920
(Chairman Seon Il-jung)

482
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,360
I'm sorry, sir.

483
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,940
If you forgive me this time, I will never...

484
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,010
How dare you block my report

485
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,380
and cause the trouble.

486
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,060
Then why do you keep isolating me?

487
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,400
What do you know? How dare you participate?

488
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,630
Even Min-joon knows. Why won't you let me know?

489
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,680
You punk.

490
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,910
Take him out.

491
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,570
Sir, just bury him.

492
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:49,000
No way. Take him to the hospital.

493
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,740
Thank you, sir.

494
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,860
It's all you fault, punk.

495
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,630
How can you call me punk?

496
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,340
Stop exaggerating and get up.

497
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,130
Just show off in front of them. Do you think you're doing that on your own?

498
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,270
It's all my money. Mine!

499
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:19,340
So? Where is that girl?

500
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,180
What can you give me if I tell you where she is?

501
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,090
You...

502
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,480
Dad, I'm your only child.

503
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,050
Your only son.

504
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,320
Let me ask you again.

505
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,040
Where is she?

506
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,020
At the market.

507
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,080
Market?

508
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,310
It's a traditional market in Seodong District. Darn it.

509
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,600
Market?

510
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,340
Sung Duk, well...

511
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:50,930
That necklace stuck to Pi Dae Shik for a while.

512
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,710
Then when Seul-bi came there, he became better. Is that so?

513
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:57,510
That's right. You would be surprised if you saw it too.

514
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,670
It's weird.

515
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:03,070
I saw it clearly with my eyes. It looked like he's possessed by a ghost.

516
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:05,170
Gosh, that's scary.

517
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:09,070
If you touch something like that, you might end up like that.

518
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:12,370
Then Seul-bi's necklace is a Summoning necklace. Right?

519
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:16,830
Or Seul-bi?

520
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:20,320
-Well... She was right about your husband's virtual currency, right? -Yes.

521
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,210
She even cured Chief Wang's son's illness.

522
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:28,110
You're right. Does that mean Myeong-seong falls love with a Summoning woman?

523
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:31,659
He's just too unlucky. Even if he falls in love with a woman, how can he fall in love with that woman.

524
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:34,679
-What should we do? That's scary. -Well...

525
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,620
Well... Shouldn't we take her to the fortune-telling store?

526
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,929
Why?

527
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:45,510
I heard witches there can suppress Summoning people, or they'll get voodoo.

528
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,340
It's either a serious illness or a big trouble.

529
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:52,489
What should we do to Seul-bi?

530
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,699
-Hello. -Hello.

531
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:56,020
Give me two hairtails. Thank you.

532
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,600
Soo-kwang, two hairtails.

533
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,680
Okay, two hairtails.

534
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,840
Seul-bi.

535
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,810
Sister.

536
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,840
Brother-in-law, buy more.

537
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,650
Okay.

538
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:06,790
Okay.

539
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,170
This girl... She has a bright future.

540
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:18,690
She has a bright future.

541
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,740
And she will be married.

542
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,530
Let's see whether her Summoning ability can be suppressed whatever you do.

543
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,820
There's nothing I can't do.

544
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:34,380
This is the key.

545
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,760
We'll find a way to get some money. Please take a look at her.

546
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,260
Okay. Come in. Bring her in.

547
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,480
Who is she? How can she make you...

548
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,720
Why... Why are you here?

549
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,820
What are you doing?

550
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,490
God, God of Heaven, God of Jade, Buddha, Baby General!

551
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,900
Oh my! Please bless me, all gods.

552
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,480
That's why I'm asking you whether you can suppress her Summoning.

553
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,020
No, I can't.

554
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,230
Hello.

555
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,940
Why are you doing this to me?

556
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,540
This is the biggest crisis in my life.

557
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,910
Why are you doing this to me?

558
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,010
Goodbye.

559
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,270
As a witch, she can't do anything to suppress the Summoning people.

560
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:37,090
Shouldn't she accept the ritual of unnerving?

561
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,560
I knew something was wrong from the beginning.

562
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,940
What should we do?

563
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,880
What do you think? He's already living with the witch.

564
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,050
The only thing can I do is that when she's doing the ritual, I play the drums.

565
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,100
Why are you being so rude?

566
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:53,610
Who are you calling a witch?

567
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,730
Well...

568
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,200
I?

569
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,920
I...

570
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:16,850
Why are you listening to people talking about you here?

571
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,740
There are so many people looking for you. Who are they?

572
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,000
And why are they looking for you? You know it actually, right?

573
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,380
You didn't lose your memory. You remember your family.

574
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,650
But why are you here? Why?

575
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,510
Just go home.

576
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,810
You have to go home sooner or later.

577
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,200
No.

578
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,180
I'm not going back.

579
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,350
Don't act like a child.

580
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,600
Stop being so.

581
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,630
I'm not going back.

582
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,860
Gong Soo-kwang, it's really you. You really didn't die?

583
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,410
Sun Dong-sik.

584
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,810
Hey, how have you been through all these years?

585
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,580
Let's talk somewhere else, okay?

586
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,730
Who is she?

587
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:43,860
Is she your girlfriend?

588
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,060
Can you go inside first?

589
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,260
I'm going to talk with a friend.

590
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:11,020
You should've called me since you are alive.

591
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,910
I wanted to forget everything then.

592
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:20,020
That's right. You were suddenly dismissed from Geumhwa Group.

593
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,120
I heard your mother passed away in an accident.

594
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,790
Can you tell me now?

595
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:44,510
Why did you run away? Who are you hiding from?

596
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,570
Since you said you like me, then why can't you be honest?

597
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:53,530
Just go home. You have to go home sooner or later.

598
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,220
Soo-kwang, come to our company.

599
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,860
Although it's smaller than Geumhwa Group, it's not bad in the financial field.

600
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,290
I'm sure you'll get a good job.

601
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,840
Thank you. I will think about it.

602
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,230
What's there to think about?

603
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:53,290
You're the top student in the management department of Hanguk University. Does this make sense?

604
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,040
Just come to me.

605
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,430
What have you been looking at?

606
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,640
It's raining.

607
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,900
I think the roof might leak.

608
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:15,760
What kind of house do you live in? Will the roof leak?

609
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,960
Hold on.

610
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,100
(Prince)

611
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,640
Why isn't she picking up?

612
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:42,040
She's not in good health. Is she getting wet?

613
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,090
Who is she? Is she that girlfriend just now?

614
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,200
Dong-sik, I'm sorry.

615
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,860
Let's talk next time.

616
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,610
I have to go home now.

617
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,840
Okay.

618
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,350
Go back and take a look, Soo-kwang.

619
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,880
Seon Min-joon and Gong Soo-kwang are addicted to the witch.

620
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:24,820
Seul-bi.

621
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,250
Seul-bi.

622
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,780
Gong Soo-kwang.

623
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,810
What should we do? These books are getting wet.

624
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,370
What are you doing? You're drenched.

625
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:07,440
You'll catch a cold.

626
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,280
Your book. They are your dream.

627
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:20,300
You actually wanted to do this.

628
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:25,650
So I have to keep an eye on them.

629
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,460
No, Seul-bi.

630
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:35,820
It doesn't matter.

631
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,840
What's important to me...

632
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,960
is you.

633
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,320
You're the most important.

634
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,060
Even if you find your family and leave me,

635
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,100
even if I'm alone again,

636
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:34,260
even if I'm the only one who gets hurt, it's OK.

637
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,530
I really like this moment when I'm with you.

638
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:50,480
I really like you.

639
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,180
Seul-bi, eat...

640
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:38,570
Why are you always like this when you read? Aren't you dizzy?

641
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:43,500
Yes, I'm on a trip in the world of books.

642
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,340
What kind of world are you traveling in?

643
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:50,650
A way to gain customers' value through a price strategy.

644
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,690
You went to the marketing world to explore?

645
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:58,440
Yes. The world that makes your fish shop prosperous is here.

646
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,090
If only this world exists in real life.

647
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:05,520
It can come true in real life. I'll be with you.

648
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:16,930
It smells good. What's for breakfast?

649
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,090
Steamed egg.

650
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:21,060
Wow, it sounds delicious.

651
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,620
Support the market modification plan

652
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,580
or the online grocery shopping plan, choose one.

653
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,630
Think about it before you write.

654
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:33,400
-Hello. -Hello.

655
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,810
Hello.

656
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:37,100
You're here. So pretty.

657
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,960
So pretty.

658
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,670
Have you eaten, brother-in-law?

659
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:45,700
She's so pretty. So what if she's a witch?

660
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,510
Yeah, so what if she's possessed by a ghost?

661
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,060
It's nice to be so cheerful and optimistic?

662
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,490
Yesterday, you said she has summoning ability.

663
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,630
Did she even guess the lottery number?

664
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:56,360
Lottery?

665
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,420
Come on.

666
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,130
You're going to get punched by Myeong-seong later.

667
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:03,280
He was so angry yesterday. I can see lasers in his eyes.

668
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,250
His eyes were glowing too just now.

669
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,630
If I get hit then I will win the lottery... It's a profitable business.

670
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,390
Seul-bi.

671
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,620
Excuse me.

672
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,470
Here, this is for you.

673
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,910
Seul-bi.

674
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:25,180
Just follow your instinct and feeling.

675
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:28,800
Choose the numbers whatever you want.

676
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,990
Any?

677
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:30,870
Choose?

678
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:35,160
Ms. Fang, what are you doing?

679
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,850
Hold on.

680
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,170
I know what this is.

681
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:40,450
This is that one, right?

682
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:43,290
People choose six numbers. If they are right, they will win the money.

683
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:44,380
That's right.

684
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,520
Here, choose.

685
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:59,410
Ms. Fang.

686
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:00,270
No.

687
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:01,230
You said no?

688
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:02,030
Never?

689
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:02,780
Not even once?

690
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,970
No.

691
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:06,900
I'm so unlucky. My damn life.

692
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,530
I'm glad to hear that.

693
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:10,070
How is that a relief?

694
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:11,730
If you win,

695
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:15,570
Eun-joo might be addicted to gambling and end up with losing all fortunes.

696
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:17,330
How did you know, Soo-kwang?

697
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:18,780
It's obvious.

698
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,820
I shouldn't have come here to talk to you.

699
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,090
I'm so unlucky.

700
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:23,620
I haven't heard that for a long time.

701
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:24,610
Please leave.

702
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,110
You're interrupting my business.

703
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,490
What about me?

704
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:28,020
No.

705
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:28,650
Oh, really?

706
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:29,650
Let's go.

707
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,130
You're interrupting my business. Go!

708
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:34,170
These people...

709
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:36,040
Don't do this, Soo-kwang.

710
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,460
The people here are nice to us.

711
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:43,280
Don't say that.

712
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,410
Secretary Jung has been released.

713
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,920
Has it been 20 years?

714
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,160
What should we do?

715
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,600
What can he do now?

716
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,800
I'll send someone to keep an eye on him.

717
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,790
Okay.

718
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:06,080
What about that girl?

719
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,480
Yinsheng Capital did something unusual. I've been watching her.

720
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,960
I think we'll find her soon.

721
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,680
Find her as soon as possible.

722
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:19,400
Don't let her fall into anyone's hands.

723
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,900
Yes, sir.

724
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,960
Hello? Hello?

725
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,410
Yes.

726
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:48,850
Fish shop?

727
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,370
(One missed text, Mr. Yeom)

728
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:55,530
(Mr. Yeom) (Lucky Fish Shop) (47 Jinji-dong, Seodong-gu, Incheon)

729
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:57,010
(Lucky Fish Shop)
(Mr. Yeom) (Lucky Fish Shop) (47 Jinji-dong, Seodong-gu, Incheon)

730
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:57,640
(Mr. Yeom) (Lucky Fish Shop) (47 Jinji-dong, Seodong-gu, Incheon)

731
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:05,830
My gosh, the emails I received are all bills.

732
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,770
An email? A letter?

733
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,090
Is there a letter for me too?

734
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:12,470
Does anyone else write to you?

735
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:15,660
No, no.

736
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,860
Of course not.

737
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,750
What are you doing?

738
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:24,590
I learned this from a chef on TV today. It's about how to make delicious octopus instant noodles.

739
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,930
-Really? -Yes.

740
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,520
Wow, you're good at drawing.

741
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,400
You're talented.

742
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,260
I'm, right?

743
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,980
It's all done.

744
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,900
It'll look better if we add a plastic wrap.

745
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,550
(Octopus instant noodles)

746
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:42,220
Oh.
(Octopus instant noodles)

747
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,780
Young Woo's mom.

748
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,580
I don't think Young Woo has any appetite lately.

749
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,700
I'm sure he'll enjoy it if I make this for him.

750
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,010
Okay.

751
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:50,880
Give me an octopus.

752
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,850
Okay.

753
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:52,600
Soo-kwang.

754
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:59,210
Okay. I'll give you an eight-wrist-shaped software octopus.

755
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:00,220
What?

756
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,170
You two are more and more alike.

757
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:03,580
When did you write it down?

758
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:07,240
-It's a secret. -What?

759
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:09,810
Seul-bi.

760
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:11,690
Hyeon-su.

761
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:17,440
Hyeon-su. Do your eyes recovery totally?

762
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,020
It's still under treatment.

763
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,670
But he's much better now. He's discharged.

764
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:22,940
Doctor said he only needs to see patients regularly.

765
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,380
It's all thanks to you, Seul-bi.

766
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,670
Congratulations, Hyeon-su.

767
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,130
Hyeon-su must be brave.

768
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,870
He's strong. He's been treated.

769
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:32,740
Yes.

770
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,510
I'm as brave as my dad.

771
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:36,930
What dad?

772
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:39,660
Okay. You will be as outstanding as your dad.

773
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:40,610
Okay.

774
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,000
Thank you, Seul-bi.

775
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:47,950
Hey, Pi Dae Shik.

776
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:49,270
What are you doing? Come here.

777
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,510
What are you doing? Go over there.

778
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:52,400
Go. Hurry.

779
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,590
Dae Shik wants to apologize to you.

780
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,030
That won't be enough.

781
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,000
-He kidnapped... -I'm sorry.

782
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,670
I won't do it again.

783
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:06,370
If you can forgive me this time,

784
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:08,290
I will treat you as my benefactor.

785
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:10,840
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

786
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:21,890
It must hurt.

787
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:23,820
Gosh, that head is like a stone.

788
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,790
If you don't keep your promise,

789
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:30,550
I will chase you to the end of the world

790
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:34,480
and put this necklace on you.

791
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,320
Okay, I promise.

792
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,130
Please forgive me.

793
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,680
I won't do it again.

794
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,270
Uncle is a coward.

795
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:44,000
Don't be like him, okay?

796
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,710
-Sir. -Yes?

797
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:47,970
Why are you standing in my way?

798
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:48,960
Do you want some dough twists?

799
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,650
No, I'm sorry.

800
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,750
That girl...

801
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,980
Talk to her when you see her.

802
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,570
What?

803
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:11,700
Welcome.

804
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,340
What would you like?

805
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,230
The most popular goods today is octopus instant noodles.

806
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:16,980
No, no.

807
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,930
I'm not here to buy fish.

808
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:20,950
-Are you here to work? -Yes.

809
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:22,020
Soo-kwang.

810
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,580
Someone's here to work.

811
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,360
-Really? -Yes.

812
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,860
Hello. Welcome.

813
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:32,930
I've been sticking these leaflets for a week. You're the first one to come here.

814
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:35,270
It's really hard to hire people these days.

815
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,240
Do you have a C1 license?

816
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:40,300
Yes, I do.

817
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,320
That's great.

818
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,360
Thank goodness, sir.

819
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,520
Please come in first.

820
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,710
Seul-bi, stay here.

821
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:47,980
Okay.

822
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,310
Come in.

823
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:52,720
Come in.

824
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:57,540
When delivering, we'll start from the closest Bong Mun-dong.

825
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:01,330
It should be the most effective way in a counterclockwise direction.

826
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:02,230
Sir?

827
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:03,070
Are you listening?

828
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:04,970
Yes, I'm listening.

829
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:05,710
In a counterclockwise direction.

830
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,570
Yes, that's right.

831
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:09,410
-Thank you, sir. -Yes.

832
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,460
Myeong-seong.

833
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,600
Yes.

834
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,710
Hold on.

835
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:15,900
What is it?

836
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,830
We're doing a questionnaire.

837
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,450
Excuse me...

838
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:24,990
Is your name Seul-bi?

839
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:26,330
Yes.

840
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:27,710
You're so pretty.

841
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,070
Thank you.

842
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,240
How old are you?

843
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,720
How old am I?

844
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,190
21 years old.

845
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,370
21.

846
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:41,040
Sir, please come out.

847
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:49,020
He's the new employee here.

848
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,140
This is our chairman.

849
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,780
What's your name?

850
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,800
I'm Jung Hyun Taen.

851
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,900
Then can I call you Mr. Jung?

852
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,220
Sure. Suit yourself.

853
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,270
Okay.

854
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:03,470
Boss Park is the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in Seodong Market.

855
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:07,420
You can tell him if you need help.

856
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,000
Okay.

857
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,610
-Hello. -You startled me.

858
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:14,640
This is the new employee here.

859
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,710
Oh, my. This is your new employee?

860
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:20,850
I'm the owner of the fried chicken restaurant across the street.

861
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,740
Oh, hello.

862
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,980
You're a gentleman.

863
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,580
You are really good-looking.

864
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:28,880
What's going on?

865
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,800
It's making me feel itchy.

866
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:33,660
Nice to meet you.

867
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:37,750
Let's draw together.

868
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:42,190
Hello? Find out who the big shot is. Hey.

869
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:45,280
I'm looking into it.

870
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:47,820
Hyeon-su.

871
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,320
Let's draw together.

872
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:54,290
Hi, Seul-bi.

873
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,470
Hey.

874
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,350
Keep an eye on Hyeon-su.

875
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:06,120
Are you asking me to find out who the big shot is or take care of the kid?

876
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,590
Soo-kwang.

877
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:13,290
My head hurts.

878
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:14,290
Headache?

879
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:15,250
Does it hurt a lot?

880
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,080
Let's go to the hospital.

881
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,550
Where?

882
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:18,930
An ambulance? Should I call an ambulance?

883
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:20,150
No.

884
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:25,260
I just need to go home and take a nap.

885
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,610
But still...

886
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:28,720
Don't you need to take the medicine? Do you want me to walk you back?

887
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,020
No.

888
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,110
No.

889
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:34,330
There must be someone in the shop.

890
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:37,210
Come back after you finish your business.

891
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:39,490
I'll go home and have a good sleep.

892
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:40,430
Don't bother me.

893
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:41,660
Okay?

894
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,620
I'll get going.

895
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:43,900
Don't worry about me.

896
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,150
My head hurts.

897
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:52,650
You two live together?

898
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,660
Yes.

899
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,240
You live together? My daughter...

900
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:58,520
What?

901
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,630
Nothing.

902
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,370
Why did you...

903
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:06,930
Did you catch a cold?

904
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:15,780
I told you, didn't I?

905
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,330
If you want something from someone else, you need money.

906
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:22,420
When you get out, exchange these for money.

907
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,700
Chief Wang, where did you get these?

908
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,590
Why?

909
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:31,380
I'm afraid we need to check if these are cultural relics

910
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,280
or make an auction in a museum.

911
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,980
I can't buy them.

912
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,330
What?

913
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:39,380
This is just ordinary gold.

914
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,530
I'll buy this.

915
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:43,290
Please give me more money.

916
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:44,820
Of course.

917
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,640
So mean.

918
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,920
Seul-bi.

919
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,020
Did Myeong-seong just let you work without paying you?

920
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,770
I don't even charge him interest.

921
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:58,240
How dare he let you work for nothing?

922
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,310
Don't criticize Soo-kwang.

923
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,160
I won't.

924
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,500
By the way, Seul-bi. What are you going to do with this money?

925
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,820
Yes, it's 14-2.

926
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,400
I'm afraid you need to come as soon as possible.

927
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,820
There's a lot of stuff here.

928
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,150
Thank you.

929
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:21,250
Okay.

930
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,400
The district government said they'll take it soon.

931
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,810
The things we bought will be delivered soon.

932
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:26,880
Thank you.

933
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,060
It's nothing.

934
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:33,540
Wow, if Myeong-seong sees these, he'll be shocked. He must think he came to the wrong house.

935
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,120
Isn't it pretty?

936
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,980
You're always the best whatever you do.

937
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:41,050
Let me paint it for you.

938
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,070
No need.

939
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:44,170
I'll do this myself.

940
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:45,720
Okay.

941
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,090
What is it?

942
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:54,560
Boss.

943
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:57,630
Steel said he found something useful.

944
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:58,760
And?

945
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,870
Hey, don't keep us guessing. Just say what you want.

946
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,060
Our boss's secretary.

947
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:04,610
(Seul-bi's daily routine) 1. Make breakfast for Soo-kwang! 2. Choose clothes for Soo-kwang! 3. Check which fish is coming today! 4.Live happily with Soo-kwang.)

948
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:29,500
Ta-da.

949
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,460
Did you do all this?

950
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:44,560
Yes. Soo-kwang and Seul-bi's home.

951
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,780
I feel like I'm dreaming right now.

952
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:52,390
Come here.

953
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:28,300
(Soo-kwang & Seul-bi Lucky Fish Shop is bomming! )

954
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:38,490
Soo-kwang.

955
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:43,230
You won't be alone here anymore.

956
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:46,610
I'll always be by your side.

957
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:08,250
Don't go.

958
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:11,780
What's wrong, Seul-bi?

959
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,500
Don't go, Soo-kwang.

960
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:52,560
(Preview of the next episode)

961
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,720
You look so pretty when you're asleep.

962
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,170
Then should we keep sleeping?

963
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:03,040
If you find her, take her to villa in Cheongpyeong.

964
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,450
I'll see her.

965
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:05,390
Okay.

966
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:06,360
Chief Wang.

967
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,410
Who's the big shot?

968
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:08,480
How would I know?

969
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,430
Just tell me.

970
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:10,420
I'll give you three days.

971
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:12,780
Jung Hyun Taen got released?

972
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,920
-Let's go around. -Have you seen a woman like this?

973
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,530
They came to catch Seul-bi. A bunch of bad guys came to catch Seul-bi.

974
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,010
I heard everything.
