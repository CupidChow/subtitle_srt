00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,170
(Episode 7)

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,880
Look.

3
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,490
-Did you make all these? -Yes.

4
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,700
This is Soo-kwang and Seul-bi's home.

5
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,670
I feel like I'm dreaming right now.

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,260
Come here.

7
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,260
(Soo-kwang & Seul-bi Lucky Fish Shop Awesome!)

8
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:27,160
Soo-kwang. I won't leave you alone here.

9
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,610
I'll always be by your side.

10
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,880
-Don't go. -What's wrong, Seul-bi?

11
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,370
Don't go, Soo-kwang.

12
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,120
Where can I go?

13
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,509
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.

14
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,970
You look so beautiful when you're sleeping. I've been watching you for a long time.

15
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,860
Then I'll sleep a little longer.

16
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,280
No.

17
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,329
You look beautiful too when you're awake.

18
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,610
He came to the market last time, and so did this time.

19
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,890
I don't think he's here to buy anything.

20
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,730
-What are you doing alone? -I can't reach...

21
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:42,240
You can't reach it? Take it. It's okay now.

22
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,450
(Boiled octopus; Grilled eel; Octopus ramen)

23
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,590
-Excuse me. Can I help you? -Hello.
(Boiled octopus; Grilled eel; Octopus ramen)

24
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,750
-Excuse me. Can I help you? -Hello.

25
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,590
Hairtail.

26
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,079
Who are they?

27
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:03,460
(Octopus ramen; Spicy whelks; Spicy braised hairtails; Grilled shrimps with garlic&cream)

28
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,950
-I want to eat spicy whelks today. -Okay!
(Octopus ramen; Spicy whelks; Spicy braised hairtails; Grilled shrimps with garlic&cream)

29
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,950
-Can you pack me a kilo of shrimps? -Okay.

30
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,720
-I'll grab something at the nearby store. I'll be right back. -Don't worry. I'll pack the shrimps for you.

31
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,600
-Thank you. -Okay.

32
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,100
You're good at making money.

33
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,250
-Isn't it pretty? -Yes, but you're prettier.

34
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,420
-Hello. -Welcome.

35
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,520
Hello.

36
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,640
What would you like to buy?

37
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,780
You need to take off the sunglasses to pick out better seafood.

38
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,450
For example, check their freshness.

39
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,409
Give me two kilos of shrimps.

40
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:43,680
-Okay. -Thank you.

41
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,070
Crustacean prawns of the Penaeidae of the Decapoda prawn family.

42
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,960
Wow, you're so cool.

43
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,440
-Thank you. Soo-kwang. Give her more shrimps.

44
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,600
Okay, okay.

45
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,230
-Hello. -Hello.

46
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,140
Welcome. Have we met before?

47
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,540
-Well... -Yes?

48
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,750
-Are the two at the Lucky Fish Shop lovers? -Oh, my.

49
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,870
Why are you curious about that?

50
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,700
They look perfect together, right?

51
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,550
-They're dating right now. -I knew it. Thank you.

52
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,650
-Buy one, please. -Give me three.

53
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,140
Gosh, you're so generous. Here you are.

54
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,860
-Can I pay by credit card? -Of course you can.

55
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:40,340
-Oh, by the why, that woman has another man. -Oh, my.

56
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:46,180
The man who comes to that fish shop every day is a grandson of a rich family.

57
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,900
Ah.

58
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,700
-Bye. -Bye.

59
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,890
So heavy.

60
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,580
Min-joon, what are you doing?

61
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,400
Where should I put this?

62
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,510
-What are these? -Plants and other things.

63
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,440
I personally like catchflies and sundew,

64
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,890
but I don't want to scare you,

65
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,270
so I picked these for you.

66
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,170
Okay. Thank you.

67
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,690
You haven't had lunch, right? Let's eat when we do the interview.

68
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,160
-Interview? -Did you forget?

69
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,060
You have to do an interview for my online novel.

70
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,370
You kept avoiding it, so the novel hasn't been progressed.

71
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,810
The Editor-in-Chief wants to fry me up now.

72
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,680
Can we do the interview next time?

73
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,210
You want to do the interview or get married with me?

74
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,900
Are you saying this to avoid the interview?

75
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,710
Jang Kyung, I'm busy right now.

76
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,800
I think I have to marry you.

77
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:53,500
Sweetheart, I have to beg you father to buy me a purse.

78
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,530
Isn't it tasty?

79
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,260
It looks delicious. I bought this at Seodong Market.

80
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,490
-Did you follow me? -Yes, I did.

81
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,710
I was angry because the interview failed.

82
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,800
So what did you find out at Seodong Market?

83
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,200
The woman who captured your heart is an owner of a fish shop!

84
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,110
Min-joon. This topic will be so attractive!

85
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,430
It’s totally my taste.

86
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,670
Where did you and that woman meet? How did you know each other?

87
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,540
Let's ... just get married.

88
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,270
You're so cruel to yourself.

89
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,550
Why are you so eager to protect her?

90
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,830
Hello.

91
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,120
Jung Hyun Tae was released?

92
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,560
-Secretary Jung was released? -Oh.

93
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,960
Do you still miss him? Your feelings for him will be back soon, right?

94
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,670
It's not love. It's guilt.

95
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,760
Why did you choose him?

96
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,990
-He's much better than you. You're ignoble. -What?

97
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,809
You were afraid of your father. You didn't dare to do anything.

98
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:45,440
You promised to let me go, but you never wanted to keep your promise, right?

99
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,080
Locking a witch like you here

100
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,240
is the best thing I have ever done.

101
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,610
It's scarier to release you outside.

102
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,330
You and your father Seon Ju-cheol...

103
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,800
Is he still in a mental hospital?

104
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,050
It's my mom who made him so. He had a long life though.

105
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,150
-Shut up. -You will be like that. After all, you inherited the same blood from him.

106
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,610
Shut up!

107
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,550
Let go of me!

108
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,540
Don't look at me like that.

109
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,280
It's yummy.

110
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,200
-Yummy? -Yes.

111
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,760
-It's yummy. -It's yummy, right?

112
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,400
-Nice job. -It's good, right?

113
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,690
It looks better than mine.

114
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,810
Gosh.

115
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,370
What are you doing?

116
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,610
Praying.

117
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,490
What is praying?

118
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,820
When you need to thank the God or beg the God for something,

119
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,210
you can put your hands together and pray.

120
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,500
God. Thank you for letting me meet Soo-kwang.

121
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,430
We will always be together.

122
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,860
We'll meet again even if we are apart.

123
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,400
Even if we are apart again, we will meet again.

124
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,510
Let us love each other forever.

125
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,600
You fool. Praying is to say your wishes in the heart.

126
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,910
It'll be easier to be heard if you say it out loud.

127
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,460
Thank you!

128
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,700
Th God will listen to my prayers. Pray now.

129
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,500
What are you praying for?

130
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,770
You can't interrupt me with praying.

131
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,870
Say it out loud. Tell me yours.

132
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,090
You can wander around outside. I'll go find you later.

133
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,560
(I)

134
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,880
What are you doing?

135
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,910
What did you pray for?

136
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,370
It's a secret.

137
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,250
I'll keep it a secret too.

138
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,080
-What? -Secret?

139
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,490
-What is it? -It's a secret.

140
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,750
I caught you. Are you really not going to tell me?

141
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,100
I won't tell you.

142
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,400
It's a secret.

143
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,770
Tell me.

144
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,390
I choose this one.

145
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,300
Okay.

146
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,350
What size do you want?

147
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,490
Which size?

148
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,910
The size of your girlfriend's finger.

149
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,200
Oh, I see.

150
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,900
If you don't know now,

151
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,340
you can text me the size when you do.

152
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,480
Okay. I see.

153
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,890
Okay.

154
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,390
Myeong-seong, why are you at my flower shop?

155
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,490
I need flowers in a few days, so can I book now?

156
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,740
-Are you going to propose? -Shh!

157
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,100
(Stewed octopus soup; Spicy whelks)

158
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,870
Wow.

159
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,950
-Are you done delivering the goods? -Yes.

160
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,190
(Original fried chicken)
-Are you done delivering the goods? -Yes.

161
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,390
(Original fried chicken)

162
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,540
-What are you doing? -Nothing. Nothing happened.

163
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,210
See? I hung up the ad. for stewed octopus soup today.

164
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:18,300
I'm going to hang up all the seafood recipes here.

165
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,510
Is that so? No more space now.

166
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,910
Don't worry. I can make it. Fighting!

167
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,700
Hello?

168
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,780
Do you have something to tell me?

169
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,290
Nothing.

170
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:40,580
(Original Fried Chicken)
Nothing.

171
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,420
What is it? Tell me, now!
(Original Fried Chicken)

172
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,750
What is it? Tell me, now!

173
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,970
Well... If I want to buy a ring for Seul-bi,

174
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,200
which size should I buy?

175
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,740
-That's too much. -That's why I didn't want to ask you.

176
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,910
Size 7.

177
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,980
Thank you.

178
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,700
Lucky seven. Okay, size 7.

179
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,610
You scared me.

180
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,550
You're back.

181
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,120
I've delivered all the goods to six places.

182
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,120
Thank you for your hard work. Have a rest please.

183
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,160
Why is it lucky 7?

184
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,340
Size 7.

185
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,780
Even if you're holding a fish, you look like a figure coming from the comic book.

186
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,350
He's so charming.

187
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,800
Chasing bravely and never give up. This should be my attitude towards love.

188
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,300
(Keep it frozen to make it's fresh)
Chasing bravely and never give up. This should be my attitude towards love.

189
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,650
What should I do now?
(Keep it frozen to make it's fresh)

190
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,790
I have nothing to wear on my finger. How pitiful I am.

191
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,160
The oil temperature to fry the chicken should be between 170 degrees to 180 degrees.

192
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,510
Sister.

193
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,410
What?

194
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,080
What oil is this?

195
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,440
It's used.

196
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,800
Look over there. That's mustard oil.

197
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,100
Aren't you going to the reading room? Why are you still here?

198
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,470
I've already had a choice, Mom.

199
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,450
I told you not to think about that.

200
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,670
There's no need to think about that now. Just submit your application form based on your scores.

201
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,660
No, I don't want to go to college. I'm gonna run a fried chicken shop.

202
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,670
There's no major in fried chicken in college.

203
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,570
-You... -Mom, it hurts.

204
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,110
You must've done a lot to avoid studying.

205
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,630
Go to the reading room now!

206
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,970
Even though I enter a big corporation after graduation, I still need to run a fried chicken shop.

207
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,160
Even thought I become a civil servant later, I will still run a fried chicken shop after retirement.

208
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,410
I am going to end my life with fried chicken anyway.

209
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,100
So I should just inherit the shop directly,

210
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,930
and become a BTS in the chicken industry.

211
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,100
Hey, you have a sister.

212
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,350
Who said you could inherit this shop?

213
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,540
Sis, you should marry him and run a fish shop.

214
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,990
I wish I could.

215
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,980
I can't live anymore because of you two.

216
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,120
-Have a good day. -Come again.

217
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,430
Thank you.

218
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,250
(Keep it frozen to make it's fresh)
Thank you.

219
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:48,330
(Keep it frozen to make it's fresh)

220
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,240
Myeong-seong.
(Keep it frozen to make it's fresh)

221
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,390
(Keep it frozen to make it's fresh)

222
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,410
Uncle Gao.
(Keep it frozen to make it's fresh)

223
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,430
What brings you here?

224
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,900
You haven't showed up recently. I came to see if you were dead.

225
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,460
You should've told me in advance so that I could pick you up.

226
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,400
What is this?

227
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,119
I just brought a few beatfish. You need to put some ice inside.

228
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,450
(Keep it frozen to make it's fresh)
I just brought a few beatfish. You need to put some ice inside.

229
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,440
Wow, it's the flat sea fish of Paralichthyidae.
(Keep it frozen to make it's fresh)

230
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,900
Wow, it's the flat sea fish of Paralichthyidae.

231
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,710
Hello, hitfish.

232
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,220
Hello.

233
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,810
She's my girlfriend.

234
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,450
What a beautiful girlfriend.

235
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,630
I told you before. This is Uncle Go.

236
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,760
The man who helped me when I was in trouble.

237
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,380
Nice to meet you.

238
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,020
Yes, nice to meet you.

239
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,840
This is Mr. Jung, our new employee.

240
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,720
This is ... my dad.

241
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,510
Your dad?

242
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,560
Are you leaving?

243
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,360
Let's go eat something nice tonight.

244
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,630
Let's eat something nice.

245
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,730
No, it's going to rain tonight. I have to go now.

246
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,000
I just need to see you.

247
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,170
I'm so sad. Are you just going to leave?

248
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,020
Yes, I'm leaving.

249
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,560
Dad, let's go eat something delicious.

250
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,600
You...

251
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,950
Why are you here?

252
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,420
Just run!

253
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,270
Mom.

254
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,850
Do I have a dad too?

255
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,510
Of course you do.

256
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,190
Where is he now?

257
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,160
In the outside world.

258
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,940
Do you love Dad?

259
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,150
Well...

260
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,110
Don't you love him?

261
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:52,910
I think loving him is the hardest thing in the world.

262
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:57,510
Why is love so hard?

263
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:03,580
Some people in this world think love is insignificant.

264
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:09,230
People like that will only use us to achieve success.

265
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,330
So we need to figure out

266
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,150
who will only take advantage of our ability,

267
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,740
and who will truly love us.

268
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,570
Why did you call me out?

269
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,280
Hey, Jung Hyun Tae.

270
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,510
Why are you with my son?

271
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,450
I didn't know he was your son.

272
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,930
What are you doing here? Why did you come?

273
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:49,770
What do you think? Didn't you see that necklace?

274
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,690
That's...

275
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,790
She... She is my daughter.

276
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,490
What?

277
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,640
How could my daughter get involved with your son?

278
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,910
Try to lay a finger on my son if you dare!

279
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,800
I won't let you go.

280
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,870
What else can you do?

281
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,580
I'm not who I was 20 years ago.

282
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,400
Do you know who my backer is?

283
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,770
If you mess with me, you're dead too.

284
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,540
Fine. Who's your backer?

285
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,900
Who sent you to my son?

286
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,790
Seon... Seon Il-jung.

287
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,710
Seon Il-jung?

288
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,010
Yes. So let your son leave my daughter.

289
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,670
Or your son will die.

290
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,610
Seon Il-jung.

291
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,260
Mr. Wang. What?

292
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,360
Don't you know who I am?

293
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,070
Of course, I do. My boss likes you so much.

294
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,750
If you do, you can't flirt with me like this.

295
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,640
Yes, I can't.

296
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,500
What do you want indeed?

297
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,110
Who's the big shot?

298
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,060
How could I know?

299
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,940
Then I'll have to send the photos to the boss.

300
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,850
Do you want to see some of the photos?

301
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,260
I really don't know.

302
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,900
Then find it out. You can check the boss's files and phone at all.

303
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,250
If I get caught, I'll die.

304
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,700
No. If you can't check it out, you'll die.

305
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,580
Seriously.

306
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,990
You're given three days.

307
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,280
I think it's in Seodong District.

308
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,780
If you find her, take her to the Cheongpyeong Villa. I'll see her there.

309
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,930
Okay.

310
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,110
This is the list of investment companies that can replace the Shalike Group.

311
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,430
You can negotiate with companies in Hong Kong and Singapore, right?

312
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:31,450
But they want to talk to you directly.

313
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,050
You said you didn't need the help of prophecy. And you're the one who needs to show your ability.

314
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,610
Give me more time, please.

315
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,330
You need to catch the right timing to show your ability.

316
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,220
If you miss the chance, you'll miss it.

317
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,640
No matter how high your expectations were, when did I let you down?

318
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,420
I really don't know what else I can do to meet your standards.

319
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,600
My standard?

320
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:02,500
No. It is the criterion to be the chief commander of a big enterprise.

321
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,570
Have you arrived?

322
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,470
Check every stores in the market.

323
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,220
Don't miss anything, okay?

324
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,890
Thank you. Come again.

325
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,090
Myeong-seong's wife.

326
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:41,940
What?

327
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,390
Just give me two hairtails, please.

328
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,210
Okay.

329
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,580
I don't want any whelks.

330
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,430
You called me Myeong-seong's wife, so gave you them for free.

331
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:06,450
Really? I'll call you that no matter what.

332
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,170
Myeong-seong's wife.

333
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:07,870
Yes.

334
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,710
Myeong-seong's wife.

335
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,770
Yes.

336
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,920
(Call me Myeong-seong's wife, you can get more than you want!)

337
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:20,890
(Call me Myeong-seong's wife, you can get more than you want!)

338
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,490
Master.

339
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,300
Master Pretty.

340
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,600
Me?

341
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,680
You knew you're pretty.

342
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,550
Please listen to me carefully from now on.

343
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:37,440
I've been a witch for 20 years.

344
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,190
It's my luck.

345
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,460
So,

346
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,420
if you can teach me a little bit of your ability,

347
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,590
I will repay you with what I have.

348
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,660
I'm not willing to.

349
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,730
I knew you'd be like this.

350
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,180
You're quite charismatic.

351
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,000
Please do me a favor. Okay?

352
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,540
I'm not a master. Call me Myeong-seong's wife.

353
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,810
Myeong-seong's wife,

354
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,570
please help me this time.

355
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,930
Just once.

356
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,900
Seul-bi.

357
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,360
You're here.

358
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,620
What's going on?

359
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,690
Hey, when did you put this up?

360
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,290
So what?

361
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:25,960
Then how about I let them call you Seul-bi's husband?

362
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,850
What?

363
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,060
Okay?

364
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,980
What?

365
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,240
God of Heaven and Earth, God of Jade Emperor, God of Milky Buddha...

366
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,480
Om Mani Padme Hum.

367
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,740
Don't touch him.

368
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,040
My goodness. There's a person with such a clear soul in this world.

369
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,550
Gosh, you're so dazzling.

370
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,090
Are you buying fish or not? If you aren't, just leave.

371
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:50,320
I'll buy it. If you catch the cod with your pure hands,

372
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,270
I'll be able to make a pot of cod soup.

373
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:58,130
Master. I don't know the relationship between you two... Oh my.

374
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:16,790
Go over there. You go this way.

375
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:20,510
Ah, wait a moment.

376
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,900
I'm the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

377
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:28,490
Why did you come to our market? Are you here for group buying?

378
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,020
Have you seen this woman?

379
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,990
No.

380
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,280
Who is she?

381
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,370
You don't need to know.

382
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,600
They're coming in groups.

383
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,710
They're here.

384
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,170
That man of the political marriage...

385
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:50,790
They must be sent by that rich family.

386
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,100
Young-woo. Young-woo.

387
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,810
Go find Seul-bi right now. Tell them the bad guys are here to catch her.

388
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,910
Those bad guys...

389
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,440
Hey, Mrs. Smile.

390
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,100
There is a bunch of weird people in the market.

391
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,460
This is bad!

392
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,200
The bad guys are here.

393
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,970
-Young-woo, what's wrong? -What happened?

394
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,440
The bad guys came to catch Seul-bi.

395
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,840
This is really bad.

396
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,360
Hello. Welcome.

397
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,030
Hey, have you seen this woman?

398
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,210
Oh my, isn't this a whore?

399
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,810
My husband doesn't go to the Arisan club anymore.

400
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,440
Did you come from that club?

401
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,630
Are you from there?

402
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,620
Excuse me.

403
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,600
Oh, no.

404
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,990
Oh, no.

405
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,480
I'm all wet.

406
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,440
Oh, no.

407
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,600
-I'm sorry. -I'm sorry, sir.

408
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,720
-Are you okay? -You're all wet. Sorry.

409
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,990
-I've never seen her before. -Why don't you eat this? This tastes good.

410
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,760
Gosh, it's so wet.

411
00:28:59,250 --> 00:28:59,980
Hello?

412
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,460
Director.

413
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,380
Did you find her?

414
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,800
Not yet.

415
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,220
Go check over there.

416
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,630
Have you seen this woman?

417
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,890
Oh...

418
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,530
Yes.

419
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,670
Where?

420
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:50,160
"Desperate Men". Isn't she an actress in that drama?

421
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,660
The weekend drama?

422
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,520
No, it's a morning drama.

423
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,560
Are they still here?

424
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:01,410
The marketing merchants said that you were interrupting their business.

425
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:05,010
You didn't buy anything and messed up the market.

426
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,000
We came as soon as we received the report.

427
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,560
Yes, they're here.

428
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,590
These people...

429
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:12,410
I heard you got in the way of their business.

430
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,670
What are you doing here?

431
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,970
We're looking for a missing person.

432
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,710
Did you report her missing?

433
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,510
Not yet. We're looking for her on our own for some reason.

434
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,820
Who went missing?

435
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,270
I can't tell you that.

436
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,900
You neither reported her missing,

437
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,340
nor can't you tell the police who she is.

438
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,040
And you're obstructing everyone's business in this market.

439
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,530
What's going on?

440
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,620
This is very suspicious.

441
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,830
Please show me your ID cards and your contacts.

442
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,380
Let's go.

443
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,430
Where are you going?

444
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,660
Where are you going?

445
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,280
-Where are you going? -Hey!

446
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,850
Wait, please.

447
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,730
I may call you next time. Please cooperate with us then.

448
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,760
Hurry up.

449
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,050
I'll give it to you next time.

450
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,310
I told you to come.

451
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,860
I did well, right? I'm so nervous.

452
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,930
Me too.

453
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,250
Seul-bi.

454
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,050
You know Min-joon, right?

455
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,520
The people who came to the market to look for you

456
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,100
are from Geumhwa Hotel, right?

457
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,480
I first met you at Geumhwa Hotel two years ago.

458
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,720
But when I sent you back to the hotel,

459
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,030
the chairman was furious at me.

460
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,470
(Hello, this is the Personnel Section of Talent Group.) I'm sorry to tell you that you didn't pass the interview. Thank you for your concern and precious time. We wish you good health and good luck. Thank you.)
the chairman was furious at me.

461
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,510
(Hello, this is the Personnel Section of Talent Group.) I'm sorry to tell you that you didn't pass the interview. Thank you for your concern and precious time. We wish you good health and good luck. Thank you.)

462
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,900
I finally lost the valuable chance to join Geumhwa Group.

463
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,590
What's your relationship with Geumhwa Group?

464
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,780
It's time to tell me the truth.

465
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,960
I want to know the truth too.

466
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,470
Soo-kwang.

467
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,780
Soo-kwang.

468
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,480
If what you said is true,

469
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,090
If you were imprisoned because of that ability,

470
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,940
did my mom die because of that?

471
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,120
The day we first met two years ago.

472
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,590
Mom!

473
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,370
My mom was in a car accident

474
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,550
and someone tried to kill me.

475
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,290
Soo-kwang.

476
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:27,890
(Lucky Fish Shop)

477
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,750
(Director Seon Min-joon)

478
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,370
Soo-kwang.

479
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,490
What? Hotel?

480
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,520
You came to the hotel?

481
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,429
Let Seon Sam-jung go out. Where is the Chairman?

482
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,239
Gong Soo-kwang.

483
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,270
Let's talk.

484
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,460
Get back to work.

485
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:29,090
Hey, Seon Min-joon.

486
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,810
You knew everything too, right?

487
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:40,110
You knew what your dad did, right?

488
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,830
I don't understand what you're talking about.

489
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:49,670
You locked someone up and kidnapped someone who escaped.

490
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,429
You tried to kill people to avoid being found.

491
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:56,370
Is Geumhwa Group a den of criminals?

492
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,460
Soo-kwang.

493
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,520
Go up.

494
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,270
You...

495
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:37,330
Yes, I'm Gong Soo-kwang.

496
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,460
You're alive.

497
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,430
You were the one who caused

498
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,820
my mom's death, right?

499
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,550
Is it really you?

500
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:11,200
No, it can't be.

501
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,010
My friend's father... The person who recognized and sponsored me.

502
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,560
I regarded him as my father.

503
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,140
He would never do that to me.

504
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,190
I thought about it hundreds and thousands.

505
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,270
I thought it wouldn't be you.

506
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,090
But did you really do it?

507
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,660
Was it because of Seul-bi?

508
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,520
You call yourself a human?

509
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,080
Soo-kwang,

510
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,200
what you know is not true.

511
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,880
I will tell the world

512
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,890
what you've done.

513
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,390
I'll make sure you get punished.

514
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,920
Don't come to Seul-bi again.

515
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,760
Gong Soo-kwang.

516
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,940
Seul-bi is my woman.

517
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,850
What?

518
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:41,690
Seul-bi was already my woman before she met you.

519
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,700
You locked her up and said she was your woman.

520
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,950
I'm protecting her.

521
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,730
Seon Min-joon, you're disgusting.

522
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,260
Soo-kwang.

523
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:56,170
If the world finds out the secret about Seul-bi,

524
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:00,100
people will be happy and want to see her.

525
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,170
And those who can't get her will try to get rid of her.

526
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,420
Will these happen?

527
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:24,510
I didn't know... Gong Soo-kwang is alive.

528
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,720
Is what Soo-kwang said true?

529
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:35,600
Dad. You caused his mother's death

530
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,430
and tried to kill him?

531
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,740
No.

532
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,240
No?

533
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,140
No, I didn't do it.

534
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,920
Then why didn't you explain anything to him?

535
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,210
Why let Soo-kwang misunderstand you?

536
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,610
Is that so important?

537
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,680
Then what is important?

538
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,610
Dad! Dad!

539
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,070
Dad!

540
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,440
Why did you...

541
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,900
come to me?

542
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:30,840
Soo-Kwang.

543
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,600
Thanks to your ability,

544
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,360
My mom passed away.

545
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,920
What brings you here?

546
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,210
Soo-kwang, I'm sorry.

547
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,510
It's not your fault.

548
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,340
Don't go.

549
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,200
Don't go! Soo-kwang!

550
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,040
Don't go!

551
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,110
Gong Soo-kwang is still alive.

552
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,250
You knew, didn't you?

553
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,040
He is alive.

554
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,900
You locked her up and said she was your woman.

555
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,830
Seon Min-joon, you're disgusting.

556
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,620
(Holy Flame Hospital)

557
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,190
You're here.

558
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,790
You're here.

559
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,640
Come to us.

560
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:26,630
Come to us.

561
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:31,480
Or we can go to you.

562
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,570
Dad.

563
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:38,570
Kill that witch.

564
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:45,060
That's the only way we can get out of here.

565
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,760
She's a witch.

566
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,700
Mi-soo!

567
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,940
Mi-soo!

568
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,110
Drop your gun. Drop your gun. Mi-soo!

569
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:07,410
No, he deserves to die. I'll kill him myself.

570
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,250
-No! -No!

571
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,290
Mom!

572
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,330
Mi-soo.

573
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:35,290
Mom.

574
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,040
I'm sorry.

575
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,310
Mom! Mom! Open your eyes! Mom!

576
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:57,060
Mom!

577
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,440
Mom!

578
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,170
She took advantage of us to find us.

579
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:14,500
We should kill that witch.

580
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,940
Chairman, are you okay?

581
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:43,920
Let's go.

582
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,030
I thought you'd come with the chairman.

583
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,500
Why did you come separately?

584
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,740
I came to check the medical records.

585
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:11,000
The chairman has been watching your grandfather's medical records.

586
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,570
No. What I want to check is not my father's medical records

587
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,130
but my dad's medical records.

588
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,710
Well...

589
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,760
I'm his guardian.

590
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,610
Soo-kwang.

591
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:59,350
Don't you think this place is small?

592
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:03,270
It's much bigger than there.

593
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:06,110
Because I can walk out whenever I want.

594
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,370
You've grown up.

595
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:12,670
I should thank you. You made me grow up.

596
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,040
How could you say that?

597
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,780
Move to a place where Min-joon can't find you.

598
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,690
I'll arrange a place for you.

599
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,900
I don't need your help now.

600
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,860
You can't stay here.

601
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:35,910
You should know what will happen, if you get along with people longer.

602
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:41,740
I want to be an ordinary person.

603
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:45,300
If Soo-kwang sees who you really are, would he still keep you by my side?

604
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,330
If it's easy to be an ordinary person,

605
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:52,190
your mom wouldn't have lived like that forever.

606
00:46:55,410 --> 00:47:00,790
When I find a place to stay for you, I'll send someone to pick you up.

607
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:02,520
I want to see my mom.

608
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,350
As long as you agree to move out,

609
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,620
I'll consider it.

610
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:25,490
Myeong-seong.

611
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:28,860
These are the flowers you ordered last time.

612
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:34,040
Wow, my brother-in-law. They are beautiful.

613
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,910
I heard he's going to propose to her. I think it's true.

614
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:43,860
Hey, why don't you pick up the bouquet?

615
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,290
Come on. Sister.

616
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,510
How much is that?

617
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:49,560
100,000 won.

618
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,030
100,000 won? That's too expensive.

619
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:55,840
What's wrong with you?

620
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,680
Leave me alone.

621
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,050
Sister!

622
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:01,050
What?

623
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:03,280
Myeong-seong and Seul-bi are getting married. Really?

624
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,560
I don't know.

625
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,170
If you marry Myeong-seong. I'll possess the fried chicken restaurant.

626
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,170
You punk.

627
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,050
Do you think the reason why I worked so hard to give you education

628
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:12,480
is to let you run a fried chicken restaurant?

629
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,810
What's wrong with that?

630
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,870
Mom, you should be proud of your work.

631
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:18,940
I admire you for making delicious fried chicken.

632
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,210
You admire me?

633
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,530
Yes.

634
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:26,240
It's hard to do one thing well in people's life.

635
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,380
Our head teacher said that.

636
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,830
But you did two great things.

637
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:32,730
Two things? What else?

638
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:34,850
You raised us so well.

639
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:36,270
Eun-joo.

640
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:39,300
Hey, don't be so sentimental.

641
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,870
You just try to inherit this restaurant.

642
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,930
Hurry up. Do your homework.

643
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:44,010
Guys.

644
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:48,210
80% of the investment in the fried chicken restaurant is a loan.

645
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,170
I'm going to the reading room.

646
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:55,360
Son.

647
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,140
Whatever, I'm so touched.

648
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,550
Where did I put the exercise book of civil service examination?

649
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,640
(Seodong Market)

650
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,950
(Frozen enough to make sure it's fresh.)

651
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:15,410
Seul-bi.

652
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,450
Hello.

653
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:18,760
-Did you get home safely yesterday? -Yes.

654
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,100
Hello.

655
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,340
You're so shy.

656
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,290
You're so cute.

657
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,570
You must be very introverted.

658
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,880
Myeong-seong's wife.

659
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,180
Sister.

660
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,800
Here.

661
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,800
I made this sandwich for you two.

662
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,830
So delicate.

663
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,200
Thank you.

664
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,410
Seul-bi.

665
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:44,730
These are couple shirts.

666
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:48,830
I found that when you took wedding photos, you must wear casual clothes.

667
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:50,360
A wedding photo?

668
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,780
It's the photo taken before the wedding ceremony.

669
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,520
You really don't know anything.

670
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,360
That's how she gets to know gradually.

671
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,310
-Thank you for the clothes. Thank you. -OK.

672
00:49:58,310 --> 00:49:59,280
Hey.

673
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,070
You are all here.

674
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:01,870
This is for you.

675
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,280
What is this? Sister.

676
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,180
This is a cactus couple.

677
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:07,050
This is Myeong-seong. This is you.

678
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:08,560
I heard it's very reproductive.

679
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,620
Thank you.

680
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,950
Let me know if you need a hall.

681
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:14,460
I'll introduce you to a nice place.

682
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,740
Mr. Park, the chairman of Merchant Prosperity

683
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:19,620
will host the wedding.

684
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,300
I should go prepare a suit.

685
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,970
I'll sing a congratulatory song.

686
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:26,340
Stop it, everyone.

687
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:33,590
I'm sorry. I want to talk to her alone.

688
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:35,080
-OK. -Sure. Sure.

689
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,950
-You two talk. -OK.

690
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,480
-Take it. -Come here.

691
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,040
Don't come to the market anymore.

692
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,050
Soo-kwang.

693
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:50,590
I need time to think about it.

694
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,050
I was in pain when I saw you.

695
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,680
Soo-kwang. I will do better.

696
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,770
That's not what I meant.

697
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,050
I'm sorry.

698
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:02,330
It's not your fault. Well...

699
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,120
Please leave.

700
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,800
Soo-kwang, I hate you.

701
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,530
Seul-bi.

702
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:21,150
What? Come here.

703
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,530
I think you two had a fight.

704
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:29,060
But how could you make a woman cry?

705
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:34,380
What are you doing? Let's go inside.

706
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:41,940
That's right. Don't believe him.

707
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,110
Men are ships and women are harbors. That's how it is.

708
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,140
Goodness.

709
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:52,990
Brother-in-law,

710
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:55,960
I heard you didn't want to see her and told her to leave you. Really?

711
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,990
Why?

712
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:57,750
Yes.

713
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,450
You live together, and you agreed to get married.

714
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:04,540
But you're pushing her away in front of us. Is it correct?

715
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,950
That's right. Myeong-seong, you did something wrong.

716
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,810
Which side am I on right now?

717
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:14,830
Let's go.

718
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,130
I'm not going back.

719
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,560
I didn't ask you to go back there.

720
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,670
Let's go our home.

721
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,290
Goodness.

722
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:28,620
Our home?

723
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,050
Okay.

724
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:34,920
Goodness.

725
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,260
Wait.

726
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,170
A woman should be cool sometimes.

727
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:40,700
You're too easy to please.

728
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,080
Goodness.

729
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:44,000
(Original fried chicken)

730
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,210
Yes.

731
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,990
What happened?

732
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:05,390
Just wait. It's serious here.

733
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,200
What do you mean?

734
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,640
I'll call you back.

735
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:14,120
What did he say?

736
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,700
I'm not sure.

737
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:21,140
We don't know anything. We are just waiting?

738
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,620
He's just trying to get more money, right?

739
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:32,330
Since the Geumhwa Search Team is here, that means Sam-jung knows it too.

740
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:34,030
How can we wait?

741
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:37,460
Since the search team went there, the police have been watching closely.

742
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,810
So I think we should wait a little longer, sir.

743
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:41,930
Darn it.

744
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,730
Did you buy this for me?

745
00:53:58,830 --> 00:53:59,680
No.

746
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,450
No? Give it to me now.

747
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:04,490
I said no.

748
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:35,790
The size is perfect. So beautiful.

749
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,340
Thank you.

750
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,420
(Lucky Fish Shop)

751
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,090
What are you doing?

752
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,130
I'm packing up.

753
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,700
I won't go back.

754
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,740
Whether it's a single room or a study room, I'll find a temporary place for you.

755
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,030
If you don't want to go back to Geumhwa Group. Don't force yourself.

756
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,830
I'll find a place to stay.

757
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:26,040
No need.

758
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,310
Seul-bi.

759
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:31,340
You can't live here with me.

760
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,750
I told you I don't need a place to stay.

761
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,250
Pack up.

762
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,370
Soo-kwang.

763
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,360
That woman! That woman!

764
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:57,540
Soo-kwang.

765
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,070
You must see that woman.

766
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,300
You must see her.

767
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,560
She's the one who came to see Gong Soo-kwang not Go Myeong-seong.

768
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,790
I knew it when I saw you at the market.

769
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,730
That's it.

770
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,840
It's been two years.

771
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,620
It's newly built.

772
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:42,370
It's perfect for newlyweds.

773
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,940
Wedding house?

774
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,170
Yes.

775
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:52,170
Myeong-seong is looking for houses with Mr. Kim, the real estate agent.

776
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:53,290
What?

777
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:55,920
I guess they were just having a quarrel. I was worried for nothing.

778
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,560
Right.

779
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,280
They're newlyweds. I'm so jealous.

780
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,970
So they won't live in my attic anymore?

781
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:04,630
Actually, that place can be used as a wedding house.

782
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,850
-Oh! -My goodness. You scared me.

783
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,140
So annoying.

784
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,740
This is your chance. The timing is perfect.

785
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:11,390
Hurry up.

786
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:11,850
(Original fried chicken)
Hurry up.

787
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,830
-Eun-jung. -Oh!

788

(Original fried chicken)

789
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:17,150
What's wrong with him?
(Original fried chicken)

790
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:30,180
Seul-bi.

791
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:59,260
Seul-bi!

792
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,680
Seul-bi!

793
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,760
Seul-bi!

794
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:13,670
Seul-bi!

795
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,580
What do you want from me, Myeong-seong?

796
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:25,880
Seul-bi?

797
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:29,540
I haven't seen her today.

798
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,160
No, it's okay, bro.

799
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,650
I'll call you back.

800
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,260
Seul-bi, where are you?

801
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:58,970
Chief Wang! Chief Wang!

802
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,420
Seul-bi.

803
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,810
Seul-bi!

804
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,220
Seul-bi.

(Superstar)

806
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:26,790
But I hated myself.

807
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:30,320
I brought you back home that day.

808
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,600
(Preview of the next episode)

809
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:12,300
Let go.

810
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,700
Since you can see the future, why did you do that day?

811
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,610
Why were you so indifferent that day?

812
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,790
Soo-kwang.

813
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:21,550
I heard you've been in psychiatric care for a long time.

814
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:23,990
Seul-bi isn't a witch.

815
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:27,340
-She went back to the hotel. -Hey.

816
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:29,480
I told you to pretend to look for her. Why did you take her back?

817
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,020
I didn't catch her. She went back on her own.

818
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:32,910
She went back on her own?

819
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,690
-Myeong-seong's back. -You are back.

820
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:38,290
I'm Gong Soo-kwang from now on.
