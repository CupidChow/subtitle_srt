(Doo-il Business Company Wholesale Retail Superstar)

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,890
Did you come here to drink last night?

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,090
You didn't close the door, did you?

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,140
Seul-bi?

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,650
Chief Wang.

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,640
How did you get in here?

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,180
Do you want me to lend you money?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,160
Why?

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,030
Don't ask why.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,460
How much do you need?

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,590
How much does it cost to rent a house?

14
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,900
A house?

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,610
Why?

16
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,100
You've decorated the attic carefully.

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,420
Why do you need another house?

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,230
It's obvious.

19
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,420
She must have a fight with her boyfriend and ran away.

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,010
What?

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,760
No wonder last night Myeong-seong was...

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,470
Seul-bi. You should get back together with him.

23
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,220
Lend me some money.

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,570
I'll make money to pay you back.

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,970
Stay here for a while.

26
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,800
I'll talk to Myeong-seong.

27
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,170
If you don't lend me money, I'm leaving.

28
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,210
Wait. Wait. Wait

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,240
I'll get the money. Stay here for a while.

30
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,320
Take care of Seul-bi.

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,080
Hey, make her a cup of instant coffee.

32
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,580
That's...

33
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,000
Gosh.

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,150
The number you dialed is not answered.

35
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,729
Please try again later.

36
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,890
Why didn't he answer the phone?

37
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,320
Here, have another cup of coffee.

38
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,040
I think it'll be easy for you to make money.

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,970
Why?

40
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,140
Just like what you did to Chief Wang last time.

41
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,640
You can see everything when you hold people's hand, right?

42
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,680
Even witches can't do that.

43
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,950
But you can do it by holding people's hand.

44
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,270
Can I make money with that?

45
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,090
Of course.

46
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,890
You can charge money for fortune-telling.

47
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,690
I have a girl friend who wants to get married.

48
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,590
She wants to know her fortune.

49
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,930
Can you help me?

50
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,670
Liar.

51
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,670
She's not your girl friend.

52
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,280
You like her.

53
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,320
Wow.

54
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,840
Wow, amazing.

55
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,090
You're amazing.

56
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,720
Although she is not my girlfriend now,

57
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,130
I mean I want to date her and marry her in the future.

58
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,800
When the siren rings,

59
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,140
stand on the crossing in front of the market,

60
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,080
then she'll be your girlfriend.

61
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,090
Wow, my heart is racing.

62
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,460
I'm leaving.

63
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,510
Hey, is that true?

64
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,550
What about your rent?

65
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,420
Okay, I'll be right there. Okay.

66
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,240
Young-woo's mom, didn't you get a call?

67
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,530
-Hurry up. -Okay.

68
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,570
Bye.

69
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,840
Where are you going?

70
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,610
Mom.

71
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,420
It's said that it works.

72
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,520
I'm scared.

73
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:25,910
Over there.

74
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,000
What are you scared of?

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,150
Over there.

76
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,930
People are talking about it.

77
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,210
Tell me your wish. Tell me your wish.

78
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,490
Our master

79
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,070
can know the things thousands miles away

80
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,570
with only one hand and one glance.

81
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,750
He can use the auro in the universe

82
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,890
to bring light to our lives.

83
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,760
Fairy of Light.

84
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,890
Oh, my.

85
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,440
Seul-bi.

86
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,410
Seul-bi.

87
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,960
What's going on?

88
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,110
The witch said she hired an amazing master.

89
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,140
So it was Seul-bi.

90
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,440
You liar.

91
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,230
We asked you to help Seul-bi with the suppression.

92
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,310
But you asked her to advertise your business?

93
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,820
Shut up!

94
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,980
You look terrible. I need to perform a witchcraft for you.

95
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,260
I've done it many times.

96
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,500
Really?

97
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,440
Right.

98
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,680
OK. Everyone can ask a question

99
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,820
and put your hand

100
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,660
on the master's delicate hand.

101
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,250
Come on, line up.

102
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,850
Well, let's try.

103
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,640
If she is capable of it,

104
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,150
it might be better for Seul-bi's life.

105
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,420
She's getting married. What are you talking about?

106
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,500
Can't a witch get married?

107
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,860
Can a witch get married?

108
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,070
I can't get married.

109
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,080
This isn't right.

110
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,310
Well, I...

111
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,790
I'm going to do a fortune-telling.

112
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,150
My goodness.

113
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,600
Me too.

114
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,290
Then I will do it too.

115
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,610
-Excuse me. -Sir.

116
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,560
-Excuse me. -I...

117
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,900
Line up.

118
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,520
(Lucky Fish Shop)

119
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,050
Where did he go?
(Lucky Fish Shop)

120
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,850
(Lucky Fish Shop)

121
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,320
He's not picking up.
(Lucky Fish Shop)

122
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,970
He's not picking up.

123
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,730
Hello?

124
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,830
Hey, Go Myeong-seong. Why didn't you pick up the phone?

125
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,330
Did you have a fight with Seul-bi?

126
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,700
Did you see Seul-bi?

127
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,640
She's sleeping in our office.

128
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,590
And...

129
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,450
What happened?

130
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,040
Seul-bi wants to borrow money and rent a house.

131
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,260
I'll be right there.

132
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,450
Leave them alone and let them fight.

133
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,280
What?

134
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,630
Sorry. What did you say?

135
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,270
Just let them fight. Don't get involved.

136
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,200
Okay.

137
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,240
Leave it to Soo-kwang.

138
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,930
Or something bad will happen.

139
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,910
Something bad?

140
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,950
Leave it to Soo-kwang.

141
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,860
Okay.

142
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,080
She said something bad will happen.

143
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,570
Chief Wang.

144
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,640
Did you two fight?

145
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,250
Make it up.

146
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,860
-Why did you fight with a woman? -Is she here?

147
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,900
Seul-bi, what's going on?

148
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,730
What? You said she was here.

149
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,320
Pi Dae Shik, that jerk. I told him to stay here and take care of Seul-bi.

150
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,500
What are you talking about?

151
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,870
He must have taken her out.

152
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,580
What?

153
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,640
Where did they go?

154
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,950
I don't know. Pi Dae Shik, that jerk.

155
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,390
Thank you.

156
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,390
-Madam. -Yes?

157
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,490
Stop your husband! Don't let him go to the oil shop!

158
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,610
Oil...

159
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,540
If he goes to the oil shop now, he'll be in big trouble. Stop him!

160
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,830
-Okay. -Hurry.

161
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,650
What is it?

162
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,330
Police.

163
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,890
What's the police's number?

164
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,180
-Oh, my. -Police.

165
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,080
Why isn't he picking up?

166
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,020
Honey, where are you?

167
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,600
Why? I'm on my way to the oil shop.

168
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,840
Don't go in there.

169
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,490
Why?

170
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,700
I'm asked to get the sesame I left here.

171
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,970
No, you can't go into the oil shop.

172
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,840
No!

173
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,340
Come back quickly.

174
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,510
Gosh.

175
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,450
The siren... The crossing...

176
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,010
It's a siren.

177
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,620
When the siren rings,

178
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,530
stand on the crossing in front of the market.

179
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,290
A crossing.

180
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,270
Oil shop.

181
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,140
Oil shop.

182
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,180
Don't come over!

183
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,320
What should I do?

184
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,600
Don't come over! What should I do?

185
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,030
What should I do?

186
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,419
Put the knife down.

187
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,240
Darn it.

188
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,910
Oh, my. Are you okay?

189
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,480
Are you hurt?

190
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,340
Should I talk to her?

191
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,190
Robber! It's dangerous! Move!

192
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,440
It's dangerous! Move!

193
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,370
Get him!

194
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,170
-Drop the knife. -Drop the knife.

195
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,130
Drop the knife.

196
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,310
I got him. Hold his arms.

197
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,710
Thank you, Chief Wang.

198
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,080
What's going on?

199
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,420
Your girlfriend called the police

200
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,090
and stopped a big accident.

201
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:50,920
Seul-bi?

202
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,680
Yes. Cuff him.

203
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,950
What's going on?

204
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,660
He's my ex-husband.

205
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,500
He came to die with me after his business failed.

206
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,940
Bastard.

207
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,040
He should die himself.

208
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,190
There's a strange man. He's been wandering around here for a few days.

209
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,790
Yes, I saw him too.

210
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,690
It's a hot summer. He was covered tightly in black.

211
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,270
You should've said it earlier. Something bad could happen.

212
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,270
Where's Seul-bi? Isn't she here?

213
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,040
My goodness.

214
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,610
This madam survived thanks to Seul-bi.

215
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,540
She's amazing.

216
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,410
Young-woo's dad got survived too.

217
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,280
She's amazing.

218
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,820
She knows everything.

219
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,000
What...

220
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,310
Brother-in-law.

221
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,460
What are you doing?

222
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,810
What are you doing?

223
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,230
Who cut in line?

224
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,380
-The one with a pure soul. -Come out!

225
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,880
Come out!

226
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,140
Master. Master!

227
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,140
Let go of me!

228
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,020
I can make money and rent a house. I can do it.

229
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,660
Don't tell me what I should do.

230
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,550
Really?

231
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,500
Can you make money here?

232
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,410
Is this what you did at Geumhwa Hotel?

233
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,900
Fortune-telling?

234
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,570
You quitted because you don't like it.

235
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,410
But now you're doing the same thing.

236
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,330
Is that why you ran out?

237
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,710
No, Soo-kwang.

238
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,220
I came to see you.

239
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,500
If you could see the future, why did that happen that day?

240
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,060
You should've seen it that day.

241
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,970
You should've told me before the accident.

242
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,700
Then I could have stopped her.

243
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,110
Why didn't you do anything back then?

244
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,200
Soo-kwang.

245
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,180
Why did you run away?

246
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,010
No matter where you are, you're doing the same thing.

247
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,380
You shouldn't have run away.

248
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,440
I wish you didn't have that talent.

249
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,380
I really wish you didn't have that shit talent.

250
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,030
I want to be ordinary too.

251
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,380
That's why I came to you.

252
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,290
That's why I left my mom

253
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,340
to see you.

254
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,640
Maybe I was too selfish.

255
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,850
I was wrong.

256
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,210
I'm going back now.

257
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,050
Seul-bi.

258
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,580
Chief Wang.

259
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,990
Hey, Seul-bi.

260
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,080
Come with me.

261
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,950
Okay.

262
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,460
Seul-bi.

263
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,120
Seul-bi.

264
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,700
Chief Wang.

265
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,170
Where's Seul-bi?

266
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,300
She's going back to where she used to live.

267
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,680
She asked you to open it at home.

268
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,390
Well...

269
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,290
Didn't your mom talk about me?

270
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,170
Do you know my mom?

271
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,750
How?

272
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,800
I...

273
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,120
I'm your dad.

274
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,140
I know it's been 20 years and I have no right to say that.

275
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,490
But I'm glad to see you.

276
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,930
I don't know you.

277
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,590
Seul-bi.

278
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,880
I said I don't know you.

279
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,660
What are you doing there?

280
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,970
When will you bring your daughter back?

281
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,540
Hey, sir.

282
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,510
I told her I'm her dad.

283
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,870
Let me catch up with my daughter.

284
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,520
I've been saving up a lot to talk to her.

285
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,650
I want to say that I've suffered so much for you.

286
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,990
Now, please help me.

287
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,010
And my Seul-bi says, "Okay, dad."

288
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,180
Then I can bring her back.

289
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,830
Just wait.

290
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,840
Let her go.

291
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,730
Seul-bi.

292
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,820
Why are you talking so much after you decided to sell your daughter?

293
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,750
Goodness.

294
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,250
Dad.

295
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,590
What are you doing here again?

296
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,510
Come on.

297
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,960
Dad, why do you shout at me everytime you see me?

298
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,280
I have a great idea.

299
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,850
Jang Kyung.

300
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,770
Mom said she'll meet Chairman Seon tomorrow

301
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,960
and set a date for you and Min-joon's wedding.

302
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,840
What?

303
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,110
Why should I get married?

304
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,560
What's the next step of getting engaged?

305
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,060
Marriage.

306
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,580
You've been visiting Min-joon frequently lately.

307
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,240
The news has reported it.

308
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,940
It is said that you are overjoyed.

309
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,910
What?

310
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,490
Min-joon likes another woman.

311
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,350
What?

312
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,020
Mom.

313
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,390
I'm not getting married.

314
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,890
What do you mean why?

315
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,630
My engagement has been canceled.

316
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,140
I'm hanging up. It's so annoying.

317
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,640
What about you?

318
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,670
What about me?

319
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,150
Don't you like Min-joon?

320
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,920
You like him, but he doesn't like you?

321
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,640
Dad.

322
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,350
Dad!

323
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,800
I did it.

324
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,900
I did it.

325
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,130
(Geumhwa Hotel)

326
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:59,300
You'll keep your promise, right?

327
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,980
I will.

328
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,920
Min-joon.

329
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,490
Move!

330
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,590
Min-joon!

331
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,500
Min-joon!

332
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,690
I said no!

333
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,360
It's the chairman's order.

334
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,360
I'll find a new place for Seul-bi.

335
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,180
Seul-bi won't go anywhere.

336
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,790
Min-joon.

337
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,770
Move.

338
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,430
Let her...

339
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,120
out.

340
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,790
You said no one could take her from you.

341
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,660
I'm going to do as you said.

342
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,340
She's a witch.

343
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,680
No, Seul-bi is just a human.

344
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,480
Mom.

345
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,520
Mom.

346
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,190
Mom.

347
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,650
Mom, I miss you so much.

348
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,410
Mom, I'm home.

349
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,950
I'm home.

350
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,290
Mom.

351
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,600
Who are you?

352
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,560
Mom.

353
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,340
Where's Seul-bi?

354
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,100
Mom.

355
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,280
-Mom! -Seul-bi!

356
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,080
Seul-bi! My Seul-bi.

357
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,950
Seul-bi! Seul-bi!

358
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,130
Mom.

359
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,310
My Seul-bi.

360
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,040
Mom.

361
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,760
-Mom, I'm here. -Where's Seul-bi?

362
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,340
Mom, I'm here.

363
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,440
-Seul-bi is here. -What should Seul-bi do?

364
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,960
Mom, I'm sorry.

365
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,830
I have to find Seul-bi.

366
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,270
Mom.

367
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,480
Mom, I'm sorry.

368
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,570
Mom.

369
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,180
Mom. Mom.

370
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,910
Mom!

371
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,190
Mom, is this where you married my dad?

372
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,080
Yes.

373
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,760
But why didn't you come here before?

374
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,920
Your dad passed away too early.

375
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,200
So I resented your dad.

376
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,440
Why did he leave in such a hurry?

377
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,820
He didn't even see you in kindergarten.

378
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,410
He just left.

379
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,070
That's why I hate coming here.

380
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,710
But...

381
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,870
You've grown up into an outstanding man.

382
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,120
And you got such a decent job.

383
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,530
I just want to show off to your dad.

384
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,580
Your dad must be so proud of you.

385
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,610
I don't remember anything about my dad.

386
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,290
But your dad remembes you.

387
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,320
He must be watching.

388
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,550
Soo-kwang's dad,

389
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:55,150
Soo-kwang has grown up and got a decent job.

390
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,030
You must be proud.

391
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,650
When he finds a good wife, we'll come and see you again.

392
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,000
I only have you in my heart.

393
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,620
What are you talking about?

394
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,980
You're the best, Mom.

395
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,420
Stop lying.

396
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,440
It's true.

397
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,000
It fits perfectly.

398
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,970
Isn't it pretty?

399
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:48,540
You'll regret bringing her back.

400
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,480
Sleeping disorder.

401
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,040
Depression.

402
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,240
Delusion of persecution.

403
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,810
I heard that you have been receiving psychiatric treatment for a long time.

404
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,950
Seul-bi isn't a witch.

405
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,970
Dad.

406
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,300
She's not a prophet witch to me.

407
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,110
Then what is she?

408
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,880
The woman I love.

409
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,550
You...

410
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,050
Are you crazy?

411
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,840
You're the one who should be treated.

412
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,810
I won't use her power.

413
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,070
So,

414
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:34,320
you don't have to worry that I will end up like you.

415
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,590
I have to hurry back.

416
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,810
You should quit gambling.

417
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,890
She went back to the hotel.

418
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,420
Hey!

419
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,600
I told you to look for her. Why did you bring her back?

420
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,730
I didn't do it.

421
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,760
She came back herself.

422
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,170
She came back herself?

423
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:19,830
Yes.

424
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,120
Okay, you can leave.

425
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,960
Darn it.

426
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,890
She went back alone, right?

427
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,230
Back to Min-joon?

428
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,850
What about Soo-kwang?

429
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,300
Mr. Jung.

430
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,000
Mr. Jung, get up.

431
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,550
-Mr. Jung. -Prisoner number 2514...

432
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,730
Yes, boss.

433
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,650
You stink.

434
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,130
My stomach hurts.

435
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,080
Eat slowly.

436
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,880
I'll deliver the goods in the morning.

437
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,460
Please take care of the shop after you finish.

438
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,450
I'm sorry.

439
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,750
Myeong-seong is here.

440
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,410
Mr. Jung is having breakfast.

441
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,040
Good morning.

442
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,500
You're all here.

443
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,690
Why haven't I seen Seul-bi lately?

444
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,910
Right.

445
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,670
Bring her here.

446
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,240
I want to thank her for saving my husband.

447
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,320
Seul-bi is so amazing.

448
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,060
Did you fight with her because she worked at the fortune-telling shop?

449
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,220
Goodness.

450
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,730
Brides are busy.

451
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,150
They need to make a wedding gown

452
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,810
and go find a makeup artist.

453
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,580
And they need the skin care.

454
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,650
We're not getting married.

455
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,650
-What? -What?

456
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,650
Why?

457
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,440
Seul-bi won't come again.

458
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,320
She went home.

459
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,550
Oh, my. Did she leave?

460
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,080
Why are you doing this?

461
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,580
Bring her back.

462
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,990
My Seul-bi.

463
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,390
Where did my Seul-bi go?

464
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,160
My Seul-bi?

465
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:17,710
My gosh. What do you mean by that?

466
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,870
My Seul-bi.

467
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,550
My Seul-bi.

468
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,730
My daughter left.

469
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,050
What do you mean, Mr. Jung?

470
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,770
Daughter?

471
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,000
Did you all hear that?

472
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,910
Yes.

473
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,670
It's been 20 years since I met my daughter last time.

474
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,720
Goodness.

475
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,750
Oh, my.

476
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,790
Is Seul-bi your daughter?

477
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,820
Tell us more.

478
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,620
Seul-bi.

479
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,750
Mom.

480
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,580
This is a church.

481
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,860
They say we can pray to God there.

482
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,590
Have you been there?

483
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,440
This is Busan.

484
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,310
Looking at the sea here,

485
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:18,360
you can see the blue sea until the sea meets the sky.

486
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,520
What are you doing?

487
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,390
I've found a place for you to stay.

488
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,580
Move.

489
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,720
I'm not leaving.

490
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,670
This is my home. This is where I was born and raised.

491
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,370
You tried so hard to stop me from going out.

492
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,050
What are you doing now?

493
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,990
What did you do outside?

494
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,590
How many people have you met?

495
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,160
How many dirty hands have you touched?

496
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:56,430
How many bad luck have you witnessed with your eyes?

497
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,290
You're bringing the disgusting and dirty stuff

498
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,990
to Min-joon. It's you.

499
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,330
Dirty?

500
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,130
Disgusting?

501
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,830
You shouldn't live here.

502
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,720
Get out!

503
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,210
Don't...

504
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,940
yell at my daughter.

505
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,860
Mom.

506
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,230
Mom.

507
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,050
Mom, do you remember me?

508
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,090
Seul-bi.

509
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,410
You're my Seul-bi.

510
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,680
My Seul-bi. I miss you so much. Seul-bi.

511
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,280
Why are you back?

512
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,760
I'm sorry, mom.

513
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,840
Don't touch her.

514
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,360
Don't you dare take Seul-bi away.

515
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:25,110
Thank you for letting me meet Soo-kwang.

516
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,510
We will always be together.

517
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,840
We'll meet again even if we are apart.

518
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,170
We'll meet again even if we are apart again.

519
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,560
Bless us to love each other forever.

520
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,110
What did you pray for?

521
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,140
Well.

522
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,910
It's a secret.

523
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,050
I'll keep it a secret too.

524
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:44,470
(I)
I'll keep it a secret too.

525
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,080
(I)

526
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,600
(Love)

527
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,790
(You)

528
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,120
I'm not telling you.

529
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,370
It's a secret.

530
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,690
Tell me.

531
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,780
If you run into bad guys, spray it on their faces and run away.

532
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,890
Spray.

533
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,220
This is a whistle.

534
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,770
Blow it if you are in danger.

535
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,110
Be quiet.

536
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,440
Don't take it off.

537
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,310
Wear it when you sleep.

538
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,040
What matters the most to me...

539
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,070
is you.

540
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:26,370
You are what matters the most.

541
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,610
Liar.

542
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,820
It's all a lie.

543
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,240
I'm here to cancel the missing announcement.

544
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,110
I'm the missing person.

545
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,960
Gong Soo-kwang.

546
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:30,940
(Family Court)

547
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,500
Uncle Go.

548
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,390
I was suprised when you called me and invited me to dinner.

549
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,150
It's been a long time.

550
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,430
Uncle Go.

551
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm going back to Gong Soo-kwang.

552
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:01,050
You haven't found anyone who'll kill you yet.

553
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,410
What if you're in danger?

554
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,590
That's not why I gave up my old name.

555
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,900
Then why?

556
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,320
When I lived as Gong Soo-kwang,

557
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,050
there was no good thing in my life.

558
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,140
My parents died long ago.

559
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,380
No one welcomes this name.

560
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,440
No one likes it.

561
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,930
So I gave it up.

562
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,250
But after that, someone kept calling me Soo-kwang.

563
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,710
I realized that

564
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,590
how much love my name conveys,

565
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,140
and

566
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,400
how much my mom loves me.

567
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,910
That's why I want to try not to give up this name.

568
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,920
To be honest, after Seul-bi left, I feel so upset.

569
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,600
I shouldn't have let her work as a witch.

570
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,750
You're right. Men cares about it when they are getting married.

571
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,980
See?

572
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,200
Seong-deok, you should've stopped her.

573
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,410
You two encouraged her to do it.

574
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,230
All of you went to fortune-telling happily. Why do you blame me?

575
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,790
By the way,

576
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:20,630
Mr. Jung who works at the fish shop.

577
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,980
Is he really Seul-bi's father?

578
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,350
He said that himself.

579
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,820
It's a little strange.

580
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,120
No, that's impossible.

581
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,460
Seul-bi is from a rich family.

582
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,450
How could Mr. Jung of the fish shop be her father?

583
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,530
I know.

584
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,990
Maybe it's like in a drama.

585
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:40,230
He used to be a driver for a rich family and slept with the rich girl.

586
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,150
What?

587
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,220
That makes sense.

588
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,580
Nonsense. That makes no sense.

589
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,830
Please stop spreading weird rumors about Seul-bi.

590
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,980
That's...

591
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,120
A foster daughter.

592
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,810
It's like a drama.

593
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:54,880
Myeong-seong is coming.

594
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,390
I'll get back to work.

595
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:58,880
Hello.

596
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,600
-Hello, brother-in-law. -Myeong-seong.

597
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,800
From now on,

598
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,220
my name is Gong Soo-kwang.

599
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,050
What?

600
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,700
My name is...

601
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,430
Gong Soo-kwang.

602
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,750
Okay.

603
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,230
Gong Soo-kwang.

604
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:25,980
What is he saying?

605
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,290
He even changed his name after breaking up with Seul-bi.

606
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:32,740
Seul-bi always called him by Soo-kwang.

607
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:36,070
That's weird too.

608
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,480
What should we do?

609
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,210
Gong Soo-kwang.

610
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,470
What?

611
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,920
You scared me.

612
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,370
I've been watching you for days.

613
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,340
What?

614
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,110
I'm just curious why Seon Il-jung sent you to get close to them.

615
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,990
What are you talking about?

616
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,780
I'm here to see my daughter.

617
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,730
You...

618
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,420
decide to sell your daughter?

619
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,650
What are you talking about?

620
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,110
How much do you sell her?

621
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,770
Stop talking nonsense. Go away.

622
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,850
You poor thing.

623
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:24,300
What?

624
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,940
You had been in prison for 20 years.

625
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,210
You should at least think about how to take revenge.

626
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,690
How could you do things for the Seon family?

627
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,790
Revenge?

628
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,800
What if I die?

629
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,410
I'll be the one to suffer.

630
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,680
I heard your daughter broke up with my son.

631
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,610
Then you have no reason to stay with my son.

632
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,330
Go away.

633
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,110
He's not your son anyway.

634
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,690
Didn't you say his original name is Gong Soo-kwang?

635
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,800
Get out of here.

636
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,790
If you do anything to my son, you...

637
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,090
You'll die.

638
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,390
How do you feel living here?

639
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,490
Thank you.

640
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,100
Did you have lunch?

641
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,680
Yes, I did.

642
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,080
Call me if you need anything.

643
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,620
Okay.

644
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,420
Thanks, boss.

645
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,700
And I'm sorry.

646
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,950
Stop drinking, Mr. Jung.

647
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,890
If you keep drinking, I have to hire someone else.

648
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,340
I won't drink.

649
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,070
It won't affect my work anymore.

650
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,290
Work is important,

651
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,240
but you have to think about your health.

652
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,690
Is Seul-bi

653
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,290
really your daughter?

654
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,350
Of course.

655
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,530
She's my daughter.

656
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,850
Does she know?

657
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,460
I tried to tell her.

658
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,420
But it's been 20 years, how could she believe a man

659
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,070
telling her that he is her dad?

660
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,100
Then...

661
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,660
Do you know where she grew up

662
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,890
and how she grew up?

663
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,860
I used to be the secretary of Chairman Seon Ju-cheol of Geumhwa Group.

664
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,590
And I met Seul-bi's mother back then.

665
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,020
I can't wait anymore.

666
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,870
Mi-soo, I'll inherit Geumhwa Group soon.

667
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,360
I'll set you free then.

668
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,450
Just wait.

669
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:44,650
-Give me more time. -No.

670
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,300
I don't trust you anymore.

671
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,700
Mi-soo.

672
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,430
You don't want to go out.

673
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,350
-Mi-soo! -Let go!

674
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:52,560
-Mi-soo! -No!

675
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,570
No!

676
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:58,140
-Mi-soo, please. -Let go.

677
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,250
I met Seul-bi's mother who was locked

678
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:03,270
at Chairman Seon Ju-cheol's villa.

679
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,080
I shouldn't have met her.

680
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,280
I shouldn't have known her.

681
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:20,200
Is Jung Hyun Taen my father?

682
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,340
Did you see him?

683
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,190
I...

684
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,600
I'm so sorry for him.

685
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:37,140
I made his life

686
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,800
miserable.

687
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,680
What should I give to Myeong-seong? No, Soo-kwang.

688
00:43:58,490 --> 00:43:59,730
Not that.

689
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,100
Not that either.

690
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:07,590
(Cooking oil)

691
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,090
Not this.

692
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:11,150
(Original Fried Chicken)
Not this.

693
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,900
(Original Fried Chicken)

694
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,490
Give anything to him.

695
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,120
Why isn't this working?

696
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,860
Why can't I open it?

697
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,320
What a pain.

698
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,490
What's wrong?

699
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,390
Mr. Park. Don't just watch.

700
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:29,170
Come and help.

701
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,810
Okay.

702
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,830
Wait.

703
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,570
Leave this to Soo-kwang.

704
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:37,870
Wait for me.

705
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,160
Hey.

706
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,140
Soo-kwang?

707
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,190
Just do as I say.

708
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:44,770
Soo-kwang.

709
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,030
I have to take care of the shop.

710
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,860
Soo-kwang, can you help me with this?

711
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:48,710
Me?

712
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,060
You're tall, Soo-kwang.

713
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,740
Try it.

714
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,360
But I sprained my back.

715
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,670
Hey.

716
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:56,980
You have to do it.

717
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,850
Go and try it.

718
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:58,670
Hurry up!

719
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,240
Yes, over there.

720
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,260
-Here? -Yes.

721
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,650
Harder.

722
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:05,370
Why won't it open?

723
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,000
By the way, what are they doing?

724
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,560
Hang in there.

725
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,950
May be it's not this?

726
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:14,870
What?

727
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,610
It's just that.

728
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:17,700
What is it?

729
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,620
Okay. Push it with your hand. Push.

730
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,550
-Okay. Okay. -Okay.

731
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:23,460
Yes, okay.

732
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,430
Okay.

733
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,220
It begins. The jinx!

734
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:34,940
Sekki!

735
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,280
What's going on?

736
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,120
What are you doing?

737
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,550
Min-soo.

738
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,690
-What's going on? -I'm sorry.

739
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:43,770
Are you okay?

740
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:44,570
Did you get hurt?

741
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,700
Are you okay?

742
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,920
-Are you okay? -Oh, my.

743
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,520
You should be careful.

744
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,170
What if you get hurt?

745
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:55,820
Thank you, Eun-jung.

746
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,590
You're a man. Don't just eat chicken.

747
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,210
Go and tell her how you feel.

748
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,130
Hey, Oh Eun-joo.

749
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,450
Why do you study here?

750
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:07,370
Darn it.

751
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:08,680
Go study in a reading room.

752
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,050
I can learn more here.

753
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:12,610
Mind your own business.

754
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:13,650
You...

755
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,710
-Are you tired of living? -It begins.

756
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:18,740
I have no flesh on me. It hurts.

757
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,600
Just let them fight.

758
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,540
Whom do I let fight?

759
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,620
-Director Park, you've gone too far. -What?

760
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,200
Last time you came home late because you were drunk. You asked me not tell your wife...

761
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,630
Shut up!

762
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,330
The two of them?

763
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,260
Did I drink alone?

764
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,190
You drank with me.

765
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,550
-What? -No?

766
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,070
What are you talking about?

767
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:39,830
You can't do that. You...

768
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,520
Or these two?

769
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:46,840
I should just leave them alone.

770
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,560
Hurry up.

771
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,820
Come here.

772
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:51,960
Gong Soo-kwang.

773
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,820
I need your help.

774
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:55,390
This is for you.

775
00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:00,210
There was a terrible incident in our market two days ago.

776
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,940
And it's for the security of the Seodong Market.

777
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,070
Several members of the Seodong Market Police Station decide to patrol the market

778
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,600
together with the merchants of Seodong Market in groups.

779
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,520
From now on, Soo-kwang will in charge of grouping us.

780
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,490
Why me?

781
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:16,000
Why do you ask him to group?

782
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,970
I told you to leave it to Soo-kwang.

783
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,220
Who said that?

784
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,790
It was Seul-bi...

785
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:23,650
Someone smart.
(Note: the first word is homophonic)

786
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,210
Well... The Chamber of Commerce knows this area well.

787
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:30,500
We'd love to accept your help.

788
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,100
Let's do that.

789
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,100
Right?

790
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:32,890
Here.

791
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:35,260
Take it. Start grouping now.

792
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,750
You have to group them.

793
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:37,350
Hurry up.

794
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,410
Go inside.

795
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:39,980
Hurry up.

796
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,920
-Please come in. -Go in.

797
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,360
Let's group.

798
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,680
(Mix it evenly)

799
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,810
Not bad.

800
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,000
Sis,

801
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,280
I might be quite talented in this.

802
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,270
You're being naughty again.

803
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:02,970
Go and study.

804
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,050
What talent?

805
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:17,270
Try it.

806
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:18,690
It's really good.

807
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,670
Really?

808
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,370
Why are you taking it?

809
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:29,610
-There are a lot of people here. -Soo-kwang.

810
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:32,520
Soo-kwang.

811
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,760
Hello, Eun-jung.

812
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,720
Eun-jung.

813
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,730
Okay.

814
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:37,750
Soo-kwang.

815
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,080
I heard your original name is Soo-kwang.

816
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,810
It sounds so cool.

817
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:46,740
This is our new dish.

818
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:51,140
I brought it here to let you try it first.

819
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,560
You want me to try it?

820
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,400
How is it? Can you try it for me?

821
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,090
I'm good at it.

822
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:59,940
My mom always asks me to try kimchi.

823
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,370
Am I your mom?

824
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:04,950
Come on. How is it?

825
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,070
Here.

826
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:07,150
Come on.

827
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,360
I can eat by myself.

828
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,180
Okay.

829
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,730
Why does it taste like this?

830
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,630
There's no need to eat pickled radish with it.

831
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:23,810
It's not greasy at all. Is it refreshing?

832
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:26,350
No, this fried chicken tastes like pickled radish.

833
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:27,930
It's sour.

834
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:30,440
I'm so curious. Pickled radish flavored fried chicken.

835
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,700
Do you want to try it, Mr. Kim?

836
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,750
Sure.

837
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,270
It's really delicious.

838
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,220
It's really good.

839
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:48,510
Next time, you'd better ask Mr. Kim to try it.

840
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,740
No.

841
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:56,360
She looks so pretty even when she glares.

842
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,560
Is it really good?

843
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,730
It's sour.

844
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,130
How is it?

845
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,150
Isn't it delicious?

846
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:06,280
Goodness.

847
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,260
Your taste is a disaster in the cooking industry.

848
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,130
Who told you to give the dish I developed to that man?

849
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:16,480
Don't eat it if you don't want to.

850
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,840
Who are you yelling at?

851
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,650
You don't even know how to make sauce.

852
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:24,320
How can I not know how to make sauce?

853
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,890
-You bastards... -Ouch.

854
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,810
Just let them fight.

855
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:30,150
Don't try to stop them.

856
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,460
Okay.

857
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,880
Keep fighting

858
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,520
until you're hurt.

859
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,090
I won't stop you. Keep fighting.

860
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:39,670
My hair.

861
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,400
But if I let them fight,

862
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,320
what will happen?

863
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,020
This is so annoying.

864
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,160
We have agreed that Geumhwa Biotech Company will participate in

865
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:59,590
the brain scientific research institute established by Jang Kyung's hospital.

866
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,370
I know that.

867
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,770
You and Jang Kyung should get married soon.

868
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:08,460
Jang Kyung and I have canceled our engagement.

869
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,380
Who made the decision?

870
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,990
Both of us.

871
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:15,850
Since we have a deal,

872
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:17,630
please don't force us.

873
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:22,310
The lawsuit and investment funds are giving me a headache.

874
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:24,160
Are you even thinking about the company?

875
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,180
How could you cancel the engagement at a time like this?

876
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:30,130
I promise I won't affect the cooperation between Jang Kyung's hospital and our company.

877
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:32,830
You can't be with Seul-bi.

878
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,140
Why are you always blaming Seul-bi?

879
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:42,520
The company is in a difficult situation. You only care about your feelings for her.

880
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,050
You can't solve the investment issue,

881
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:45,870
and if we mess up our partnership again...

882
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:47,240
The investment.

883
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,690
I'll get it.

884
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,160
I'll tear down all the doors here

885
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,320
and leave only the last door.

886
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,870
You can set the password and go freely.

887
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,360
Paint this wall

888
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,110
with colorful paint.

889
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,510
Put some plants here.

890
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:26,310
As long as you want,

891
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,560
you can do whatever you want.

892
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:40,220
The kitchen is equipped with gas stove and electromagnetic stove.

893
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,540
You can cook at any time.

894
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:50,400
I'll change this house to what you want.

895
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,810
After we renovate it, you'll feel better.

896
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,820
I'm not going to change here.

897
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,380
I want to stay the way it is.

898
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:02,350
Silver Line Investment Company.

899
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,830
It won't work.

900
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:07,470
Go find other investors.

901
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,070
Seul-bi.

902
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,770
I don't expect you to do this for me.

903
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:15,080
You don't have to do this for me.

904
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:19,480
You said you had something to show me.

905
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:31,650
It's so comfortable.

906
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,940
I can even taste the wind.

907
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,730
I want fried chicken and beer.

908
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:48,560
Fried chicken and beer?

909
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:54,420
Thank you, Min-joon.

910
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,670
Seul-bi. You don't have to do this.

911
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:08,690
I didn't bring you back to make you do this.

912
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,020
The ring...

913
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,390
Is it a gift from Soo-kwang?

914
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,010
I forgot to return it.

915
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,160
I'll ask Mi-soo to come cover and hang out here.

916
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:36,860
Okay.

917
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,110
-What's going on? -Is it power failure?

918
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:08,250
What kind of bad omen is this?

919
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,900
The cold dishes will go bad.

920
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,570
What should I do? I just made the pickled crab.

921
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:15,220
This is terrible. I haven't made the dough.

922
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,870
Is it a power failure?

923
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:19,990
Goodness. Mr. Park said he was going to fix the electricity with Soo-kwang.

924
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:22,490
Did he cause trouble again?

925
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,870
Is there anyone who can turn on the light?

926
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:29,950
Why did you ask me to fix this?

927
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:31,660
You should've called an electrician.

928
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:34,730
No, you must come.

929
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:35,920
Try it.

930
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,810
Try it.

931
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:45,690
The power failure just now is because of Myeong-seong, no, Soo-kwang?

932
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:46,650
The power is back on!

933
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:47,350
The power is back on.

934
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,930
Gosh, it's been a while.

935
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,160
The things could be worse.

936
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:51,520
Two tables of guests left.

937
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,700
(Lucky Fish Shop)
Two tables of guests left.

938
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,540
What's going on?
(Lucky Fish Shop)

939
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,030
What's going on?

940
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:56,750
-What's going on? -Oh, my.

941
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,880
-Oh my! -Brother-in-law!

942
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,490
You saved my husband.

943
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,380
Myeong... I mean, Soo-kwang.

944
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:03,390
Me?

945
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:03,910
Yes.

946
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:06,390
The power failure was because of Myeong-seong, no, Soo-kwang.

947
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:07,820
You did it, didn't you?

948
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:08,920
I'm sorry.

949
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,660
-No, no. -No, no.

950
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,730
That's why Mrs. Smile opened the fridge and found...

951
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,530
We got a big problem.

952
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,870
These fish will melt.

953
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:18,700
Oh my!

954
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,660
Honey! Honey! Kim Jung-tae!

955
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,750
Get up.

956
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,260
Open your eyes.

957
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,120
Her husband is drunk and fell asleep inside.

958
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,570
If the power didn't go out,

959
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:35,560
she would've closed the shop and went home.

960
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,080
My husband almost froze to death.

961
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,620
Is that what she meant?

962
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,680
What is it?

963
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,110
Nothing. Nothing.

964
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,670
Cut the crap.

965
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:49,530
Myeong-seong is so lucky.

966
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:52,940
Seul-bi has a good taste for men.

967
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,490
She chose Myeong-seong.

968
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:56,100
But why did you let her go?

969
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,390
I miss Seul-bi.

970
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:01,340
Shut your mouth. How can you mention Seul-bi in this situation?

971
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,140
Okay, I won't say it.

972
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:04,890
Take your husband home.

973
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:06,320
-Yes, go home. -Go.

974
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,490
-Bring Seul-bi back. -Go.

975
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:09,780
Go.

976
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:12,870
Did she mean this?

977
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:14,130
What is it?

978
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,420
Goodness.

979
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:50,370
(Boiled octopus)

980
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:01,810
(Call "Myeongse's girl" and get a gift!)

981
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,560
Excuse me.

982
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:07,460
Are you Gong Soo-kwang?

983
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,180
The woman is here for Gong Soo-kwang,

984
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,150
not Go Myeong-seong.

985
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:26,940
Do you know me?

986
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:31,070
Where is the prophet witch?

987
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:10,420
(Preview of the next episode)

988
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:12,740
It is said that if the witch hold a man's hand for the first time,

989
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:14,840
that man will get more luck.

990
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,350
It's useless to find her,

991
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:19,020
unless you kill that man.

992
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:20,860
You said she's your woman, right?

993
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,620
I'm asking about your relationship.

994
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:26,280
Since you can't answer, then you shouldn't have brought her out.

995
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,820
Let's go meet the witch.

996
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:31,750
Madam, Gong Soo-kwang is here.

997
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:34,930
This is the same as Seul-bi's necklace.

998
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:36,910
It used to be my necklace.

999
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:37,820
What?
