(Lucky Fish Shop)

3
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,460
He's here again.

4
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,530
The one who wears Louis Vuiddon.

5
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,850
Why did he come to that thoughtless Seul-bi again and again?

6
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,750
Yeah.

7
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,360
If one's completely obsessed with another,

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,960
even if she's ugly, she's still a beauty in his eyes.

9
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
By the way, is Myeong-seong out?

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,810
I don't know.

11
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,480
It's said that he and Seul-bi went on a trip in Busan.

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,080
A trip?

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,010
Oh, I envy them!

14
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,280
A trip? When?

15
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,050
Did Seul-bi and Myeong-seong go there alone?

16
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,570
You bad girl.

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,560
Since you come to the restaurant, either go and fry the chicken or go in to prepare for the exam.

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,730
How long will they stay? When will they come back?

19
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,920
Is our home a travel agency?

20
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,220
Go to fry chicken.

21
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,600
Nice to meet you.

22
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,510
Perfect. Look at his perfect back.

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,640
-What are you doing? -Well.

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,810
Darn it.

25
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,000
Min-joon, this way.

26
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,360
What are you doing? Come here right away.

27
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,050
We used to come here to eat often because of Soo-kwang.

28
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,420
Yeah, it's been a long time.

29
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,040
Yeah.

30
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,160
Shouldn't we hurry to see Soo-kwang?

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,700
Where does he live now?

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,970
I don't know either. I just met him by chance.

33
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,070
What's his phone number?

34
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,340
You should at least get his phone number.

35
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,470
Hey, you should've asked for his phone number.

36
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,760
If he's alive, why didn't he contact us?

37
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,579
Why?

38
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,280
Damn it! I can't hit the ball!

39
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,690
Damn it!

40
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,620
Darn it!

41
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,620
You bastards!

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,460
Are you ignoring what boss said?

43
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,740
The big shot is looking for her.

44
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,370
Must you find that woman as soon as possible and bring her here?

45
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,530
What are you waiting for?

46
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,540
Get out!

47
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,300
-Get out. -Yes.

48
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,700
Hey, Pi Dae Shik!

49
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,560
You little bastard. Well...

50
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,510
I told you to hide. You popped out so quickly.

51
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,090
I heard about it too.

52
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,500
The woman the big shot is looking for.

53
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,390
Could the woman be she who's beside Go Myeong-seong?

54
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,880
Brother, let me see her photo.

55
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,070
Hey, don't tell anyone.

56
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,329
If you do, I'll kill you.

57
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:35,620
Why?

58
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,220
Our section nearby is full of our people anyway.

59
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,740
We should tell the boss first, which is an advantage for us.

60
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,060
And we'll get a great reward.

61
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,640
No, absolutely not.

62
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,110
You've been acting strange lately, brother.

63
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,390
You are to hide for a while.

64
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,470
Hey,

65
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,940
I saw the woman you are looking for.

66
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,110
What?

67
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,410
Well... The exact place is...

68
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,560
It's delicious.

69
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,550
Do you want one more?

70
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:23,850
Let me finish it.

71
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,790
Go Myeong-seong.

72
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,760
Is Myeong-seong out?

73
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,790
He's hanging out with that girl.

74
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,230
Where did he go?

75
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,070
Busan.

76
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,770
Chief Wang said he saw that woman at Busan Station.

77
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,740
It seems you need to send the Seagull Gang.

78
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,130
He went to Busan.

79
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,159
Why would he go there?

80
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:49,210
(Twisted dougnhuts)
Why would he go there?

81
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,220
Why are you getting mad at me? I didn't ask them to go.
(Twisted dougnhuts)

82
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,540
They wanted to go.
(Twisted dougnhuts)

83
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,590
They wanted to go.

84
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,830
Darn it. I lied that I saw her in Busan.

85
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,900
Why would she go to Busan? Darn it.

86
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,170
(Lucky Fish Shop)

87
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,430
Kiss.

88
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,320
Should I kiss you too?

89
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,860
(Chief Wang)

90
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,730
Hello.

91
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,680
Hey, Go Myeong-seong.

92
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,620
Why do you keep ignoring my calls? Where are you now?

93
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,230
What? I'm driving.

94
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,720
Hey, don't go to Busan.

95
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,550
What?

96
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,820
You can't go to Busan.

97
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,090
Why?

98
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,980
No.

99
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,710
The big shot is looking for a woman.

100
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,270
Boss showed me her photo.

101
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,710
But she looks so much like Seul-bi.

102
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,409
What are you talking about?

103
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,550
Who's the big shot and who's the boss?

104
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,800
The boss is my boss.

105
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,110
I don't know who the big shot is.

106
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,659
Anyway, they are looking for someone in our section.

107
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:57,200
I lied that I saw her in Busan to cheat them. Darn it.

108
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,010
So don't go to Busan.

109
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,970
I don't know what you're talking about.

110
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,690
I need to check the GPS. Bye.

111
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,140
(Busan)

112
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:15,380
(Seonfire Hospital)

113
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,530
It seem you're having more nightmares recently.

114
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,140
That thing... Isn't is an amulet to prevent having nightmares.

115
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,690
I remember dad used to look for it,

116
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,260
though I don't need it anymore.

117
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,310
Mi-soo.

118
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,290
Mi Soo, put the gun down.

119
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,180
No.

120
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,680
He deserves to die. I'll kill him myself.

121
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,140
No.

122
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:14,500
Compared to the last time you came, he's not getting any better.

123
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,930
He can't have a daily conversation and extremely hates light,

124
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,870
so I turned off all the lights.

125
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:38,590
(V-01)

126
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:01,600
You're here.

127
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,260
Come to us as well.

128
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:12,470
In the end, you'll be the second us.

129
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,060
She ran away

130
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,070
just like 20 years ago.

131
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,010
It would come to us.

132
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,690
At that time... why did you do that?

133
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,580
That would come to you.

134
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,460
Busan!

135
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,500
Wow, the sea. Real sea.

136
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,320
Will it be salty if I try some seawater?

137
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,100
Probably.

138
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,360
Will there be mills rotating in the sea and producing a lot of sea salt?

139
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,800
-Mills? -Yes.

140
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,360
You mean the mill in the tarditional fairy tales?

141
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,550
Yes.

142
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,620
I don't think it's here.

143
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,720
Doesn't Young-woo's grandmother run a restaurant?

144
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,360
(Lucky Fish Shop)

145
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,650
Here.

146
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,070
Keep your phone with you.

147
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,900
Take it with you and become one with it.

148
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,290
Become one?

149
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,270
Yes.

150
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,670
I downloaded an app to prevent you from getting lost.

151
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,700
Whenever and wherever you are, I know it.

152
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,590
You can know whenever and wherever I am??

153
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,240
Can you find me even if I go to the Milky Way?

154
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,780
Why would you go there?

155
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,550
It's because you were careless and run around.

156
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,100
That's why I wanted to give this to you.

157
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,230
It's like a bell hanging on a cat's neck.

158
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,700
If it's like a cat bell, it'll be cool if I take this to the galaxy.

159
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,210
Right, Jeff?

160
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,470
Fine, you're a curious baby.

161
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,030
Have a look, hold this

162
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,070
and ask what you want to know.

163
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,040
Go Soo-kwang.

164
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,670
No, ask something else except me.

165
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,020
What should I do to make Soo-kwang like me?

166
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,920
If you ask that, will your phone give you the answer?

167
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,780
-Ask something else... - Please pay more attention to your clothes.

168
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,180
(Please pay more attention to your clothes. Although plain clothes are good, you need to dress sexy sometimes.
-Ask something else... - Please pay more attention to your clothes.

169
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,580
Although plain clothes are good,
(Please pay more attention to your clothes. Although plain clothes are good, you need to dress sexy sometimes.

170
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,740
you should dress sexy sometimes.

171
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,410
Wow, the world has changed so much. It should tell me this!

172
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,330
Right?

173
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,080
Thank you.

174
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,330
What did you mean by that?

175
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,190
Saying a big shoot is looking for Seul-bi.

176
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,320
We deployed many people from the gang to look for Seul-bi.

177
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,780
I'm sure gangs of Busan are acting too.

178
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,780
So be careful.

179
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,460
Do you think that big shot is Seul-bi's family?

180
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,590
If her family is looking for her, she must meet them.

181
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,960
If she's her family, they will turn to police.

182
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,070
Why would they trun to gangsters to look for her?

183
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,170
Okay.

184
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,240
Let's talk when I get back to Seoul.

185
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,600
What are you talking about?

186
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,180
That bastard.

187
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,070
I have to push their heads into rotten seafood cans

188
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,310
so that they can feel the pain of death out of suffocation to be awakened.

189
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,400
Forget it. I'll change for another shop for you.

190
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,460
Bye.

191
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,660
The boss is so cool.

192
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,950
He who is good at cursing is good at cooking as well, so eat up.

193
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,420
It tastes good too.

194
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,640
Boss, it's a woman.

195
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:05,920
(Representative)
Boss, it's a woman.

196
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,010
Yes.
(Representative)

197
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,960
Goodness.
(Representative)

198
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,580
Yes, boss.

199
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,770
Yes, we're eating.

200
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,180
Yes, sir.

201
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,040
Yes.

202
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,180
Granny.

203
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,570
Have you seen this woman?

204
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,400
You scumbag.

205
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,600
I haven't seen my own child for years.

206
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,150
Why are you here for this woman?

207
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,140
Right?

208
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,040
Sorry.

209
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,070
We eat well.

210
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,510
Wow, this place is huge.

211
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,270
Hey.

212
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,080
What?

213
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,090
No, I'm looking for someone.

214
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,610
Move.

215
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,610
Why are all women of this section like this?

216
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:19,970
Let's go.

217
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,240
Yes.

218
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,830
Is there something wrong with the water in this area?

219
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,310
Let's go.

220
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,090
Okay.

221
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:37,700
Didn't I tell you many times to change the shop in Seoul?

222
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,930
Those bastards just take money.

223
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,090
Let they do things. None does his job well.

224
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,040
Bye.

225
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,870
How could you bring a dog into a restaurant?

226
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,480
The girl looks familiar.

227
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,250
Are you Young-woo's grandmother?

228
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,730
Goodness, they're so cunning.

229
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,140
I thought if I sent them a puppy they would bring it back.

230
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,830
But they didn't come.

231
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,860
Jeff longs for home.

232
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,160
I don't want it. You either throw it away

233
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,420
or raise it on your own. It's none of my business.

234
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,560
Get out.

235
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,980
You're interrupting my business. Get out.

236
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,900
What's wrong? Get out.

237
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,780
I'm hungry.

238
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,720
What did you say?

239
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,910
I'm hungry.

240
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,200
We've driven for five hours.

241
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,720
You didn't even invite us to dinner.

242
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,130
We're hungry, grandma.

243
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,820
You smell delicious food too, right?

244
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,270
Yes, I'm hungry.

245
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,530
Treat us to a meal.

246
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,430
It's good.

247
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,200
Wow, it's really the best food in the world, grandma.

248
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,790
You're the best.

249
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,260
Young-woo said

250
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,700
your cooking is the best in the world.

251
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,580
Goodness, that's not true.

252
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,220
Take a look at this.

253
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,130
(My grandma's cooking is the best in the world. Young-woo wants to eat more of it.)

254
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,660
My mom used to run fish shops as well.

255
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,670
She often made me fish, but I can't eat it now.

256
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,290
Why not?

257
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,590
She passed away two years ago.

258
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,180
Did you run the fish shop?

259
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,090
Yes.

260
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,260
I lived in school before my mom died. That's why I can't see her often.

261
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,020
I still regret it.

262
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,480
I should've lived with my mom if I knew it.

263
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,130
Since Young-woo was born,

264
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,960
we lived here together

265
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,100
doing business and raising Young-woo together.

266
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,350
But as Young-woo grew up, I found...

267
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,500
He's a little abnormal.

268
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,960
I'm old. I don't know what disease that is.

269
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,260
I just said a word

270
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,370
and they got furious

271
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,160
and said they'd cut ties with me and went to Seoul.

272
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,120
What did you say?

273
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,280
I called him a loser.

274
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,100
They kept out of touch with me for years and treated me like a sinner.

275
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:57,850
Think about it. How can I feel good when seeing my grandson is afflicted with disease?

276
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,550
One word would be enough.

277
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,320
What?

278
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,750
Say sorry.

279
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,470
Do I have to say it to make them understand?

280
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,480
Why won't you say it?

281
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,980
What do you mean?

282
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,440
You're a good talker.

283
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,980
You're good at cursing and saying things that hurt people.

284
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,230
But why don't you say sorry, just this one word?

285
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,750
Sorry, this one word.

286
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,470
It's the same as "thank you and "thanks for your hard work".

287
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,880
Where does this rude brat come from?

288
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,110
Grandma.

289
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,350
If you can only apologize,

290
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,480
you can cook

291
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,590
for Young-woo the best food in the world.

292
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,840
Young-woo is longing for you. Is it so hard for you to say sorry?

293
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,530
You're young, but you're trying to lecture your elders.

294
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,120
You might as well eat more fish.

295
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,660
Grandma.

296
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,950
Say sorry.

297
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,240
Say sorry 100 times.

298
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,180
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,480
My daughter-in-law, I was wrong.

300
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,870
I'm sorry.

301
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,010
Didn't I just say that?

302
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,900
Anyway, I'm sorry.

303
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,000
What's wrong with me? Why do I say sorry all the time?

304
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,090
I'm sorry.

305
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,480
Hey. Why didn't you use the lodging volumes given by Yong-woo family

306
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,460
and came to a place like this?

307
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,550
I don't want to stay in a hotel.

308
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,160
Do you know this place?

309
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,060
I said I don't like hotels.

310
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,960
Go there. Over there.

311
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,920
Mosquitoes are everywhere.

312
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,660
Soo-kwang, come in.

313
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,540
We can hear the waves here,

314
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,430
and smell the sea.

315
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,320
Isn't it just fishy smell?

316
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,510
Look over there. Look at the seagulls.

317
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,470
Mumbling...

318
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,880
Mosquitoes are everywhere.

319
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,440
Soo-kwang, I want to sleep here tonight.

320
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,460
Sure.

321
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,390
But I won't take care of you if you get up tomorrow morning full of bumps.

322
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,260
Okay.

323
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,370
Who can challenge you?

324
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,620
Jeong-hun.

325
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:28,370
Can I get along with Mi-soo like I used to?

326
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,680
It's been decades.

327
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,140
No one else knows except us.

328
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,100
That's right, brother. Indeed.

329
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:55,530
So, forget it.

330
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,010
Okay.

331
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,300
Don't move.

332
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,510
What can you do?

333
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,970
Tell me. What else can you do if not getting a shot?

334
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,690
I've been putting up with you. Goodness...

335
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,030
Don't move. What can you do?

336
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,870
What are you doing?

337
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,640
Mi-soo always rejects needles

338
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,990
What's your job?

339
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,680
What?

340
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,840
I'm asking you what your job is.

341
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,130
I'm a nurse.

342
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,630
Take care of Miss Mi-soo's health and protect her.

343
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,790
That's right. I'm telling you to take care of her

344
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,300
instead of treating her like a criminal.

345
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,180
I'm sorry, chairman. Forgive me this time.

346
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,660
Get out.

347
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,690
Chairman, if you forgive me this time...

348
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,000
Get out!

349
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,070
Let go of me!

350
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,030
Secretary Cha!

351
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,880
No, Chairman!

352
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,920
Let go of me!

353
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,860
Let go of me!

354
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,330
This is for mosquitoes.

355
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,690
Don't take it off. You must wear it when sleeping.

356
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,620
Okay, so cute.

357
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,680
As long as you get out, you'll become mosquitoes' food.

358
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,150
Saying mosquitoes suck blood, it's only female mosquitoes.

359
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,860
Female mosquitoes suck blood

360
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,690
because they need protein to produce eggs.

361
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,300
It is said that the way to find the host

362
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,210
is to search through carbon dioxide emitted by animals.

363
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,750
So...

364
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,180
Wow, that's correct.

365
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,970
You're smart.

366
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,280
Seul-bi.

367
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,240
What?

368
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,210
Someone is looking for you.

369
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,420
Maybe your family is looking for you.

370
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,960
Do you want me to meet them?

371
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,640
No.

372
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,100
Why?

373
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,070
You can't stay by my side forever.

374
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,070
Soo-kwang.

375
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:12,160
Can I not look for my family and always stay by your side?

376
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,930
What are you talking about?

377
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,530
I want to be with you forever.

378
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,660
Hey. Those words are for the loved one.

379
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,430
I like you.

380
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,160
That's because other than me you have no one to rely on.

381
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,420
No, I really like you.

382
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,240
Fine. I'll see it as you like me as a friend.

383
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,370
It's not like that.

384
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,340
I like you.

385
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,140
I like you, I like you, I like you multiplying 100.

386
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,910
Fine. Why?

387
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,690
Why do you like me?

388
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,360
I liked you since we first met.

389
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,920
I liked you more when we met again after two years.

390
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,950
Since we were together,

391
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,180
I wanted to be with you forever.

392
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,330
I'm...

393
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:13,880
very poor.

394
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,530
I'll make you make a lot of money.

395
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,610
Everyone around me hates me.

396
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,250
Not anymore.

397
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,090
Mr. Wang and Mrs. Smile like you too.

398
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,520
If you stay by my side,

399
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,170
you'll become unlucky.

400
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,320
We'll be happy if we're together.

401
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:43,210
Soo-kwang... Don't you like me?

402
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:17,880
Forget it, Go Soo-kwang. Seul-bi will leave one day.

403
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,250
Don't make her stay.

404
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,230
I knew this would happen,

405
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,190
why am I always by your side?

406
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,930
It's okay. Come here.

407
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,270
What's wrong?

408
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,990
Dad.

409
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,230
Concerning the investment company's review of the Biology Department,

410
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,100
you take care of it for me.

411
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,200
Does my mom never know about Mi-soo?

412
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,530
Why are you curious about that?

413
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,990
I've never seen you do that to my mom.

414
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:38,860
Why do you keep bringing up the past?

415
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:42,830
Didn't you tell me not to have any feelings for Seul-bi?

416
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,890
That's enough.

417
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,260
Is Seul-bi my half-sister (Sharing the same father)?

418
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,900
Is that why you told me not to have any feelings for her?

419
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,010
No.

420
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,270
Seul-bi isn't my daughter.

421
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,420
Then who's Seul-bi's father?

422
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,510
What you need to worry about is the future of Geumhwa Group and you.

423
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,900
-Not her background. -Please tell me.

424
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,210
Mi-soo once ran away like Seul-bi as well.

425
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,450
She came back on her own after a few months,

426
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,210
but she was pregnant with Seul-bi.

427
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,660
Stop asking.

428
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,540
How's your trip?

429
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,380
Did you have a lot of delicious food?

430
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,100
How's your trip?

431
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,040
Hey, we are not opening yet.

432
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,560
This is for sale. Don't drink it.

433
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,150
I'll pay for it, okay?

434
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,800
How much is it? How much?

435
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
What's wrong with you?

436
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,580
If that's the case, don't come to the chicken restaurant.

437
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,270
Go prepare for the civil servant exam.

438
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,940
No. I like this place where I can see Myeong-seong every day.

439
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,610
You are insane.

440
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:08,440
He doesn't like you. Why are you so crazy about him?

441
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,990
Hurry up and fold these boxes. I need about one hundred of them.

442
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,570
-Thank you, Myeong-seong. -Thank you.

443
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:16,060
My mom has decided to come to Seoul.

444
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,480
-Really? -Yes.

445
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,060
Wait a moment.

446
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,080
Hello, mom?

447
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,960
How many times did you say you're sorry? Don't say that again.

448
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,010
What?

449
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,850
It's for you.

450
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,020
-Me? -Yes.

451
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,660
Hello?

452
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,660
I heard you run a fish shop, right?

453
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:44,120
Great. I have six chain restaurants in Seoul.

454
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,080
Sell me some fish.

455
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,750
Me?

456
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,790
You are an honest person.

457
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,450
So I think the fish you provide

458
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,600
should be good.

459
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,330
Codfish, frozen pollack, mackerel and hairtail.

460
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,700
These will do.

461
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,630
I appreciate your kindness,

462
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,790
but my shop isn't big enough.

463
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,500
What are you talking about?

464
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,890
If your stop is small, you can expand it.

465
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,969
Talk about the details with my employees.

466
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:13,989
-Give her phone. -Okay.

467
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,300
-Hello, Granny?

468
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:24,239
I'm sorry. I've said it 100 times.

469
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,880
Are you happy now?

470
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,630
You did well, granny. Okay.

471
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,929
Thank you.

472
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:38,090
Is there anything you want to eat?

473
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,460
-Sausage. -Sausage? Okay.

474
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,639
Give her more.

475
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:53,719
Let me tell you a secret. Actually, I'm the goddess of luck.

476
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,000
Fill it up.

477
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,560
(Superstar)

478
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,640
-Chief Wang. -You are here.

479
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,840
-Did you find out who that VIP is? -Yes.

480
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,350
I've asked all of my men.

481
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,360
They seem to be the investor of our loan company.

482
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,810
Investor?

483
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,070
Who is he?

484
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,770
I think he's very rich in the none-bank financial industry.

485
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,120
But I've never seen him before, so I don't know either.

486
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,580
Gosh.

487
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,510
I wanted to asked the girl to stay by your side

488
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,260
after you came out.

489
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,800
But she ran away.

490
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,200
I'll find her and tell her.

491
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,670
When you see her, talk to her.

492
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,120
Okay.

493
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,530
The compensation for 20 years...

494
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,310
You have to get that compensation.

495
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,800
Okay.

496
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:28,090
He's totally messed up.

497
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,080
The chairman went out.

498
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,310
I know. That's why I'm here.

499
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,540
Get out.

500
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:10,800
(Employment for suitable employees)

501
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,110
Employment?

502
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,750
You barely have any business.

503
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,980
Why do you hire employees?

504
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,350
Ah. I'm going to supply the chain restaurants for Young-woo's grandma.

505
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,520
So I want to hire a driver who can drive a truck in the early morning.

506
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,660
You're hiring an employee?

507
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,380
Myeong-seong is a real boss now.

508
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,530
Boss.

509
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,880
Brother-in-law. No, boss.

510
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,610
Tell me if you need fish.

511
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,710
I'll catch it if you need any.

512
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:43,090
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

513
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,630
I'll go to the chain restaurants

514
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,060
and go back later.

515
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,710
Okay.

516
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,480
I've called Chief Wang.

517
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,140
Don't go home alone. Let him send you home.

518
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,710
I'll take care of myself.

519
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,120
-Seul-bi. -You are here.

520
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,150
When are you getting off work?

521
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:10,000
-Please take care of Seul-bi. -Okay.

522
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,230
Don't worry and go.

523
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,110
-Okay. -Don't worry.

524
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,990
What's wrong, Seul-bi?

525
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,600
Soo-kwang doesn't like me.

526
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,730
-What? -What?

527
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,320
How dare Go Myeong-seong not like you?

528
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,230
What are you talking about?

529
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,560
Soo Gwang doesn't like me.

530
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:38,550
(Great taste with low price Fang's Chicken)

531
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,380
When I think of Eun-jung, I shouldn't have let you in.

532
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,870
But you raised my sales. How could I say no?

533
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,860
Eun-jung, bring the chicken.

534
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,670
No matter how much I think about it,

535
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,740
there's no reason for Myeong-seong to dislike you.

536
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:56,950
I said I like him, but he didn't say anything.

537
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,990
I showed him my love and got rejected.

538
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,460
Myeong-seong said he didn't like you?

539
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,080
That's great.

540
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,860
Are you making fun of her?

541
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,550
What's wrong?

542
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,430
Myeong-seong is the man I liked a year ago.

543
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,550
But he's Seul-bi's man now.

544
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:19,470
I'm speechless. It's not up to you.

545
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,820
Eun-jung, please leave.

546
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,660
The situation here is very serious.

547
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,600
I'm very serious too, okay? Everyday.

548
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,190
Then don't be so serious.

549
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,680
Myeong-seong and her are the salvation of your life.

550
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,950
Go away. Go away. Go.

551
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,810
Hey, Seul-bi. Did you buy a phone?

552
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,760
Soo-kwang bought it for me yesterday.

553
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,490
He bought her a phone because he like her.

554
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,460
That's right, Seul-bi.

555
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,260
Men don't spend money on women they don't like.

556
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,640
Really?

557
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:54,390
Of course. Myeong-seong likes you.

558
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:58,230
But Soo-kwang didn't say he likes me.

559
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,310
Then make him like you from now on.

560
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,180
How?

561
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:08,600
But you are too nice to Myeong-seong. That's a problem.

562
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,090
That's right. Women should be cold.
(Note: Cold means bouncy in Korean)

563
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,060
Cold? Bounce?

564
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,430
There's a generation gap.

565
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:22,420
It's not like that. Devoted love is popular these days.

566
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,270
Devoted love?

567
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:26,860
Don't listen to her. She is your rival.

568
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,840
Listen to me carefully.

569
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,950
There are three ways to get a man into you.

570
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,590
What are they?

571
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,530
I'm saying this because it's you.

572
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:44,130
If you use this method,

573
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:48,130
you can get ninety-nine percent of men.

574
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:53,510
First, blink three times when you look at a man.

575
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:58,050
One, two, three. Like this. One, two, three.

576
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,220
Good. One, two, three. Good.

577
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,710
Then open your lower lip.

578
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,170
This is the second one.

579
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,750
Stick it. Exhale. This is the third one.

580
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:15,400
Talk like that. Do something to me.

581
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,460
Darn it.

582
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:23,940
Let's try. One, two, three. Open your mouth.

583
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,390
Please do something to me.

584
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,860
Well done.

585
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,210
You're here.

586
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:37,990
Uncle, I heard my dad disbanded the search team.

587
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,070
-Is that true? -Yes.

588
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,190
Why is that?

589
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,380
I don't know.

590
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,060
Why did you do that?

591
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,280
If you want to develop Geumhwa on your own,

592
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,660
then do what you want.

593
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,100
I don't understand what you mean.

594
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,320
Are you saying you don't care about

595
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,690
where Seul-bi is with whom?

596
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,090
Stop looking for her.

597
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,130
Then why did you do that two years ago?

598
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,650
If you could give up so easily,

599
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,020
why did you do that?

600
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,630
Why did you do that to Soo-kwang?

601
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:46,350
If you want to be a manager, think about the future for the company.

602
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,370
Two years ago, six years ago...

603
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:52,010
Don't just stick to the past.

604
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,770
The past?

605
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,280
Such a big thing can become the past

606
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,320
in your heart.

607
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:08,040
I don't like you as my father,

608
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,860
but I respect you as an entrepreneur.

609
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,230
But now...

610
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,080
I feel so pathetic, dad.

611
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,440
I'll keep looking for Seul-bi.

612
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,180
I'll find her.

613
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,180
Soo-kwang, you're back.

614
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:13,480
Hello?

615
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,080
Soo-kwang, it's me.

616
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,420
(Lucky Fish Shop)

617
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,650
Go ahead.

618
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:32,730
Someone is waiting for me. I need to go home.

619
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,790
That lady?

620
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:46,400
Soo-kwang, the Geumhwa Group canceled your offer two years ago.

621
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,260
I think there was a misunderstanding.

622
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,090
So I want to say...

623
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:54,380
Would you like to work at our company again?

624
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:59,300
It's a pity to waste your talent in the fish shop.

625
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,350
What's wrong with the fish shop?

626
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,540
I'm used to it. It's okay.

627
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:10,410
I forgot how to run a business.

628
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,730
I'll make it up for you

629
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,630
for the past two years.

630
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:25,260
I'll get you a job, annual salary,

631
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,000
and a nice apartment.

632
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,590
Why?

633
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:35,740
Why did you do that?

634
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,630
You're my best friend.

635
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,590
Did you do something wrong to me?

636
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,240
I have something unsolved

637
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,660
without evidence.

638
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,660
Do you know what that is?

639
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:10,850
No.

640
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,530
What's that?

641
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,220
I'm leaving.

642
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,370
What are you doing?

643
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:14,510
What's wrong? You got something in your eyes?

644
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,420
It doesn't work.

645
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:26,660
What's wrong?

646
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,090
Don't you feel anything?

647
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:32,640
What feeling? What are you doing?

648
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,580
I'm going to wash up.

649
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:50,690
Should I try being cold?

650
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:52,750
What's wrong with her?

651
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,580
She's cute.

652
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,690
Cold Strategy. First stage.

653
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:11,330
You go first. I have something to do.

654
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,300
I'm busy. I'll go back later.

655
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,480
I'm going to sleep. Don't talk to me.

656
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,640
Okay. Good night.

657
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:39,850
Don't you miss Mi-soo?

658
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:43,150
I don't think you should wait.

659
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,150
I want you to go back alone,

660
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,360
but I'm afraid it'll be too late.

661
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,630
Let's go back together.

662
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:56,910
My mom wants me to live a happy life in the outside world.

663
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:02,450
I'll do it. Let you and Mi-soo live in the outside world.

You just need to go back.

Call me.

666
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,740
Sir, we have stopped looking for her.

667
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:39,840
But there are still a group of people looking for Seul-bi.

668

I think Yinsheng Capital is involved.

Hey, brother. How have you been?

670
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:06,850
Did you sleep well?

671
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:11,180
Of course. Thank you for asking.

672
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,280
You don't have nightmares?

673
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,710
I'm fine.

674
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,700
I'm just curious.

675
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:23,850
You must be very weak after that witch took all your spirits.

676
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,520
Is dad sick because he's weak?

677
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:32,320
You've been asking the street gang to do things for you lately.

678
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,450
Are you still hanging out with them?

679
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:38,560
Did you call me so early in the morning to lecture me?

680
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:45,650
Do you want to repeat father's mistake out of curiosity?

681
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,660
Are you worried about me?

682
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:52,860
I don't want that witch.

683
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,720
And I don't want her for my son.

684
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:01,880
Then you aren't looking for her to protect her, are you?

685
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,180
You're the one who called and you kept asking questions.

686
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:11,050
You seem to be nervous. Are you afriad she will be taken away?

687
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,100
If she's taken away,

688

Are you threatening me?

I'm your brother. What can you do to me?

691

Did she walk to lose weight?
