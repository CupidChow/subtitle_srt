1
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,860
It's the prince!

2
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,780
What are you doing?

3
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,640
(Episode 2)

4
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,010
Go away, bad dreams.

5
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,380
Whenever I dream about her,

6
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,340
bad things happen continuously.

7
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,390
I've got goosebumps.

8
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,300
Goose bumps

9
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,100
get away.

10
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,120
Get away!

11
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,769
What's going on?

12
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,310
Is there anything worse waiting for me today?

13
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:19,910
Myeong-seong.

14
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,130
Hello.

15
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,289
Don't come near me.

16
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:24,900
Are you going to the store?

17
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,660
I'm going to work part-time at my mom's shop starting today.

18
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,000
I told you not to talk to Myeong-seong.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,210
Why are you so disobedient?

20
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,500
Mom, we're neighbors.

21
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,430
Shouldn't we at least say hello to each other?

22
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,920
On the day you took the civil service exam,

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,920
you failed because you talked to him.

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,780
Mom, how could it be Myeong-seong's fault?

25
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,300
It's my fault for not studying hard.

26
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,870
You have the face to say it. Are you proud?

27
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,890
Anyway, don't talk to him and neither can you stand next to him.

28
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,770
Come in quickly, semlly girl!

29
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,650
Stop it.

30
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,240
I was going to avoid her if she got close.

31
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,509
Myeong-seong...

32
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,070
Why am I so upset?

33
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,780
He should avoid my daughter. Who does he think he is?

34
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,699
The tire won't go flat, will it?

35
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,060
The brake should be fine.

36
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,950
I feel something special is coming today.

37
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,820
Mom, are you okay?

38
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,340
Hurry up, Seul-bi.

39
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,960
Mom, should I...

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,280
You have to go, Seul-bi.

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,600
Don't worry and go.

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,190
Do it for me.

43
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,660
You can do it, right?

44
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,960
It's Seul-bi. Come here.

45
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,800
-Seul-bi is over there. -Hurry.

46
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,400
-I love you. -I love you too, mom.

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,410
Go.

48
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,030
Seul-bi.

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,470
Oh, no.

50
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,910
Mi Soo, are you okay?

51
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,470
Hold her.

52
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,670
Well...

53
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,210
Please get in.

54
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,980
Be careful.

55
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,700
Be careful.

56
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,829
Wait!

57
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,340
We have to catch her. She's running away.

58
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,120
Miss,

59
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,760
where are you going?

60
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,670
Gong Soo-kwang.

61
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,840
I've never heard of G-Gong Soo-kwang.

62
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,040
Oh, right. It's Lucky Fish Shop.

63
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,770
Oh, I see.

64
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,280
But where is it?

65
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,750
There's an amusement park nearby.

66
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,940
You can take a bus from here as well.

67
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,840
I see.

68
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,220
Let's leave for Lucky Fish Shop.

69
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,170
(Lucky Fish Shop)

70
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,270
Myeong-seong.

71
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,420
Yes, Boss Park.

72
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,910
What can I do for you?

73
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,040
I'm the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce of Seodong Market.

74
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,890
So I have the obligation

75
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,420
to listen to the needs of people from Seodong Market.

76
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,050
That's right.

77
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,000
Right.

78
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,880
When are you going to close the shop??

79
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,200
I am not going to close the shop.

80
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,649
Why not?

81
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,410
The landlord wants you to.

82
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,110
There's one year left before the contract expires.

83
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,290
That's true.

84
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,030
But those people keep bothering me.

85
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,300
I won't move out until the contract expires.

86
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,250
I'm going to stick right here.

87
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,260
What are you doing?

88
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,590
Are you determined to ruin our Seodong Market?

89
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,250
Since your arrival, nothing good happens in our market.

90
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,310
Doesn't it?

91
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,980
Yes, that's right.

92
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,770
Listen carefully.

93
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,110
After the power failure caused by you in the spring,

94
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,780
the food in every store was rotten

95
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,720
and the customers were reduced by half.

96
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,750
You know that, right?

97
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,860
-That commercial transformation. -Yes.

98
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,650
That business transformation was good initially,

99
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,040
but failed for no reason.

100
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,160
You sad sack. It's time to leave.

101
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,910
How is that...

102
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,490
On the one hand, it seems to be my fault,

103
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,020
but on the other hand,

104
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,070
it's obvious that there is not enough concrete evidence to prove it's my fault.

105
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,170
Wow, you're so shameless.

106
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,690
Well... Don't you feel sorry?

107
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,820
Speaking of the transformation project, the construction side isn't good.

108
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,800
Well... What are you doing?

109
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,790
Sorry.

110
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,640
I'll do my best from now on.

111
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,940
No, don't laugh.

112
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,580
If you smile out of blue, something worse will happen.

113
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,560
No, no. I'll do my best.

114
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,460
I said no.

115
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,100
-Hey! -Hey!

116
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,659
I said stop laughing.

117
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,540
Myeong-seong, you're indeed a sad sack.

118
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,630
Can I even summon rain?

119
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,820
Am I a goblin?

120
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,240
Let the sun come out.

121
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,810
(Lucky Fish Shop)

122
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,510
Nice to meet you, Gong Soo-kwang.

123
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,330
I knew something was coming today.

124
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,960
Did you know I was coming?

125
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,310
No.

126
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,710
Why are you here?

127
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,360
To see you.

128
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,780
So why?

129
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,130
If you have nothing to say, just go away.

130
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,150
I have nowhere to go.

131
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,610
I can't remember anything.

132
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,310
I came back to Korea after many years.

133
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,159
When I woke up after an accident,

134
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,920
I couldn't reach my mom.

135
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,440
In Korea, I can only think of you.

136
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,340
You can't remember anyone but me?

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,320
Is that possible?

138
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,850
Miss,

139
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,480
how can you leave without paying for the taxi?

140
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,510
The taxi fee?

141
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,950
Yes, give me the taxi fee.

142
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,540
I see.

143
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,300
No, I don't want this.

144
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,770
Do you have money or transportation card?

145
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,020
No.

146
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,210
No, well...

147
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,360
Hey, do you know each other?

148
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,230
How much is the taxi fee?

149
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,100
150,000 won.

150
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,190
150,000 won...

151
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,880
Hey, you. Are you kidding?

152
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,170
How did you trick her? That's 150,000 won.

153
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,990
Did you send her from Gangwon-do?

154
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,940
Why did you say I'm lying?

155
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,510
This lady is looking for the Lucky Fish Shop.

156
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,010
I've searched all over Seoul and the entire Gyeonggi Province.

157
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,990
This is 1 2 3 4...

158
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,210
This is the ninth place. The ninth.

159
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,310
Darn it.

160
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,720
Darn it.

161
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,680
I really...

162
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,140
Goodness.

163
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,470
Soo-kwang.

164
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,060
You mistook me for the wrong person.

165
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,160
My name is Myeong-seong.

166
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,870
We don't know each other.

167
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,310
Soo-kwang.

168
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,390
You're all I have.

169
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,200
Well... Myeong-seong has a woman?

170
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,760
So pretty.

171
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,940
I admit it.

172
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,460
Looking so noble, she is probably the daughter of a rich family.

173
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,550
How could she get involved with Myeong-seong??

174
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,560
At a time like this...

175
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,470
Why are you standing outside again?

176
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,040
Myeong-seong.

177
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,570
I won't close the shop, Boss Park.

178
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,720
Don't let her stand outside. Go inside to fight.

179
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,140
-Why can't you talk? - My goodness.

180
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,840
Well...

181
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,920
Three mackerel, please.

182
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,290
-Okay. Welcome. -Okay.

183
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,900
-Three mackerel. -Yes.

184
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,010
Okay.

185
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,180
Excuse me.

186
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,500
Buy Spanish mackerel instead of mackerel.

187
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,410
I'm allergic to mackerel.

188
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,310
What are you talking about?

189
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:22,640
How much is it?

190
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,340
20,000 won.

191
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,370
Here.

192
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,080
-You're using your card? -Yes.

193
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,980
Anthropods of Decapod Macroura. Shrimps, hello.

194
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,600
Sea fish of Perciformes Scombrida, mackerel.

195
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,400
Sea fish of Perciformes Scombrida, Spanish mackerel.

196
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,340
Where's the Sebastes schlegelii of Scorpaeniformes Scorpaenidae?

197
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,460
Where's the Sebastes schlegelii?

198
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,520
Sebastes schlegelii, where are you?

199
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,000
There's no Sebastes schlegelii?

200
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,910
It's big. Huge.

201
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,940
Ma'am.

202
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,380
Your umbrella.

203
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,610
Madam.

204
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,800
Madam.

205
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,910
She forgot this too.

206
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,900
Madam.

207
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,760
Madam!

208
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,730
Hey!

209
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,700
It's crazy! How can you be so pretty?

210
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,050
Wow, your skin is so bright.

211
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,920
Don't you think this hat will look good on you?

212
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,530
-It's so pretty. -Oh.

213
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,030
Try it on.

214
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,310
Gosh, it looks great on you.

215
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,900
10,000 won.

216
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,220
10,000 won?

217
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,250
10,000 won.

218
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,260
No.

219
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,550
You have a card?

220
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,910
Card?

221
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,940
This isn't mine.

222
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,200
Don't worry.

223
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,520
Ta-da.

224
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,380
(Everyone's card! Please feel free to use it!)

225
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,620
It's everyone's card.

226
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,880
Please feel free to use it!

227
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,560
I'm going to use it.

228
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,750
-Use your card. -Use your card.

229
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,170
Thank you.

230
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,800
Thank you.

231
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,110
-Thank you. -Please come again.

232
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,300
Wow.

233
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,300
Here.

234
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,830
Thank you.

235
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,160
Soo-kwang. Madam.

236
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,770
Thank you. I've done.

237
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,430
It's everyone's card.

238
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,200
I can't return it. I'll give you cash.

239
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,490
I'm sorry.

240
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,430
Take care of your girlfriend.

241
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,890
You'll be in big trouble.

242
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,520
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,370
Hi, sweetie.

244
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,910
Okay.

245
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,590
That's strange.

246
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,710
Give me some Spanish mackerel.

247
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,510
Okay, I'll give you some for free.

248
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,710
You asked me to buy some Spanish mackerel, right?

249
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,340
Yes.

250
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,650
Being allergic to mackerel.

251
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,470
She said our guest is allergic to mackerel.

252
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,920
and asked me to buy some Spanish mackerel.

253
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,020
Here you are.

254
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,180
Thank you.

255
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,650
-I'm sorry, ma'am. -Okay.

256
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,990
Ma'am!

257
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,430
Wait.

258
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,820
Isn't she a bit strange?

259
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,800
-I think she's a bit clumsy. - Yes.

260
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,240
But she's also quite different.

261
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,920
-Different. -Different.

262
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,100
Yes, she's different.

263
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,830
-Bye. -She seems to come from a rich family.

264
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,180
How did you hurt your head?

265
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,570
How do you know she comes from a rich family?

266
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,690
It's obvious.

267
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,410
Helmes, Chanel, Cardia.

268
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,710
I used to sell cheap copies, so I know.

269
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,890
They're all real. Real.

270
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,890
What's the use of wearing things over millions won?

271
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,230
Being so clumsy.

272
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,780
That's what I mean.

273
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,880
Did you see the gloves she was wearing?

274
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,790
It's so hot.

275
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,730
I thought she had mayonnaise on her hands.

276
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,290
So, brother.

277
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,120
Even rich people have their secret sorrows.

278
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,180
But how did that sad sack Go Myeong-seong

279
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,930
seduce the daughter of a rich family?

280
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,780
What?

281
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,120
He's handsome so that's probably the reason why he seduced a fool.

282
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,140
This pair.

283
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,260
This seemingly extraordinary pair.

284
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,040
Will our market have more bad luck

285
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,060
because of them?

286
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,750
-No! -Oh, that's true!

287
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,700
-We have to kick him out and let him close the shop. -That's right.

288
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,560
Why are you doing this to me?

289
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,680
He hasn't given up your attic yet, has he?.

290
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,030
It's all because of the damned contract duration.

291
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,220
Soo-kwang.

292
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,270
If you have amnesia,

293
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,440
how could you forget that stealing is wrong?

294
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,140
Because it says

295
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,590
it's shared by all of us and feel free to use it.

296
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,480
Get out.

297
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
Go straight to the left.

298
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,030
Turn right at the end of the bystreet and there is a police station.

299
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,850
Let them help you find your mom.

300
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,980
Soo-kwang.

301
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,000
Stop calling me that.

302
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,080
Leave.

303
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,580
I don't want to see you anymore.

304
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,900
We have all 160 CCTV footages.

305
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,890
We're still checking.

306
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,010
We have formed a search team.

307
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,670
We should find her soon, chairman.

308
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,320
Where did you send your daughter?

309
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,850
She must have gone somewhere she wanted to go.

310
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,450
Tell me. Where is your daughter?

311
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,330
I don't know.

312
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,180
Do you think your daughter

313
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,050
can adapt to this world after departure?

314
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,580
Over 20 years, she's been locked in this castle since she was born.

315
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:02,340
She'll be burned to death by the filthy air outside.

316
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,530
My daughter is not as weak as you think.

317
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,510
Absolutely not.

318
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,730
I heard you took her outside.

319
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,790
Are you crazy?

320
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,560
What's the point of going out?

321
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,870
You're not a criminal.

322
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,250
How can a person be locked up for over 20 years?

323
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,980
A criminal or a human?

324
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,900
They're not humans. They're just your lucky charms.

325
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,840
Don't regard Seul-bi as an object.

326
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,690
Don't pity her

327
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,080
and don't have any feelings.

328
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,800
They are witches who diminish human misfortunes and pity.

329
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,290
They're different from humans.

330
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,180
Enough, Dad.

331
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,690
Myeong-seong.

332
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,000
I heard a woman came to see you.

333
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,020
What's your relationship with her?

334
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,960
She's not your girlfriend, is she?

335
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,770
If you have time to talk nonsense,

336
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,200
you'd better come here and wrap up the chicken, bad girl.

337
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,730
Mom, how can you call your daughter smelly girl?

338
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,260
Don't talk to him.

339
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,620
How many times have I told you?

340
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,840
How many times?

341
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,200
Ma'am!

342
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,510
Please calm down.

343
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,540
Ma'am.

344
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
What is this?

345
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,850
Even though she's your daughter,

346
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,740
you'll be sued for domestic violence if you hit her like this.

347
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,040
And if you want to be protected by the police,

348
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,050
then...

349
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,230
I can protect you right away.

350
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,830
Are you crazy?

351
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,060
How dare you hit on my daughter?

352
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,030
Ma'am, violence shoud be restrained a little.

353
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,050
You two...

354
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,860
If you dare to hit on my daughter again,

355
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,740
I'll break your legs.

356
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,660
Hey, officer Kim.

357
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,300
Did you come to this market

358
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,420
just to see that girl?

359
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,070
Really?

360
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,690
Did you find him?

361
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,340
Not yet.

362
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,540
Min-joon.

363
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,460
Sincerity Pharmaceutical Company filed a patent claim against

364
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,760
Geumhwa Biotech Company.

365
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,680
That's their claim. What about the truth?

366
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,000
That's true too.

367
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,710
Tell the legal team to come.

368
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,850
Morisaka was so arrogant.

369
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,500
Look at him now.

370
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,980
All the media

371
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,040
are competing to report

372
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,610
Geumhwa's law suit and slipping stock prices.

373
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,850
I know.

374
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,220
They must be so busy to handle the lawsuit.

375
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,100
But I heard that Geumhwa is looking for a girl.

376
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,960
It's said that she ran away from a presidential suite.

377
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,350
She must be the hidden daughter of Marisaka's.

378
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,250
If she is uncle's daughter out-of-wedlock,

379
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,890
how could he hide her until now.

380
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,000
My aunt passed away a long time ago.

381
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,990
Should I ask around?

382
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,970
I...

383
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,360
I'm not interested in their family.

384
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,380
Dad, you're obviously curious.

385
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,200
Don't ask me when I know the truth.

386
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,250
Listen, Seul-bi.

387
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,340
We're not humans.

388
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,050
We're different from humans.

389
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,280
But a long time ago,

390
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,120
a witch once became a human.

391
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,050
How?

392
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,990
I don't know what she did,

393
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,630
but I heard she became an ordinary person

394
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,420
and lived lifelong with a man she truly loved.

395
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,980
I must find that way too.

396
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,160
I will.

397
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,760
I want to go out.

398
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,940
I'm going to look for Soo-kwang.

399
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,920
Oh my! You startled me! There...

400
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,640
Isn't she the different girl from earlier?

401
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,300
Oh, it's so late. She must be waiting for Go Myeong-seong.

402
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,510
He shouldn't leave a girl like her outside alone.

403
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,370
Goodness.

404
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,130
Miss.

405
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,450
Are you waiting for the boy from the fish shop?

406
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,640
Who are you?

407
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,080
The one who was asked if you were pretty when you wore the hat.

408
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,930
It's the 10,000 won.

409
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,940
I'm the owner of the fish shop,

410
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,410
and the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce of Seodung Market.

411
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,360
Chairman?

412
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,170
Of course.

413
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,180
Is he a powerful man?

414
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,880
Yes.

415
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,950
Very powerful.

416
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,150
Hello?

417
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,090
Kong Soo-kwang.

418
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,810
What are you doing here?

419
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,040
Take good care of your girlfriend.

420
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,610
It's late. You can't leave her outside alone.

421
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,930
She's not my girlfriend.

422
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:53,830
My gosh.

423
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:57,870
Fine. Why are you so angry?

424
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,430
-Let's go, chairman. -Okay.

425
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,400
He is the kind of man who

426
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,060
will do everything like kissing and hugging after we leave.

427
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,130
Goodness.

428
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,000
Don't fight.

429
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,050
Let's go.

430
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,090
Gong Soo-kwang.

431
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,370
Do you come because you are worried about me?

432
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,340
I'm not Gong Soo-kwang. I'm Go Myeong-seong.

433
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,700
Did you change your name?

434
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,630
Why?

435
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,610
Why?

436
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,080
I still like Gong Soo-kwang.

437
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,700
Wait for me.

438
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,740
Go find your mom there.

439
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,800
Here?

440
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,530
There, the police will be there.

441
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,530
Police?

442
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,290
I know what that is.

443
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,320
I read it in a book.

444
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,650
A police car.

445
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,560
That's good.

446
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,730
The police will help you find your mom.

447
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,780
What if they can't find her?

448
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,330
Should I sleep here?

449
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,300
If they can't find...

450
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,260
Let go of me!

451
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,910
Hey! You. Let go!

452
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,900
Let go of me! Damn it.

453
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,040
Do I have to sleep with those middle-aged guys?

454
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,270
Follow me.

455
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,450
(Lucky Fish Shop)

456
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,850
I'll only keep you for one night.

457
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,020
Go to the police station to look for your mom tomorrow.

458
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,900
Wow, it's beautiful.

459
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,740
It's sparkling.

460
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,770
I think I'm going to catch them.

461
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,830
Oh, I can't.

462
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,200
It's so pretty.

463
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,750
Hey, what are you doing?

464
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,380
Wow, this is Soo-kwang's home.

465
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,690
Gosh.

466
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,320
You sleep on the floor.

467
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,560
This is my home.

468
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,430
You just stay for a night. Be content.

469
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,600
I like this place. You live here too.

470
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,710
Stay away from me.

471
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:59,130
Wow, I've never seen a book like this.

472
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,250
Ta-da.

473
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,400
Hello?

474
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,750
What are you doing?

475
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,740
What's wrong?

476
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,370
Don't do this.

477
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,600
Hey. What if I'm a bad guy?

478
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,950
You're a good person.

479
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,600
Wow, I'm so happy.

480
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,670
It's soft.

481
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,140
Mom, why does the gem glow?

482
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,530
When female prophecy witches are born,

483
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,210
they'll tightly grasp the blue gem.

484
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,360
Me too?

485
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,850
Of course.

486
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:28,450
You held this gem with your tiny fist.

487
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,870
Does everyone hold a gem when they're born?

488
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,910
No, other people don't.

489
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,330
Seul-bi, we're different from them.

490
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,210
But I look just like them.

491
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,950
We're like mermaids on shore.

492
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,810
Mermaid?

493
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,740
This gem is connected to our lives.

494
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,540
When we make predictions, this gem will shine.

495
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,780
When our power disappears and life goes away,

496
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,040
the light of the gem will disappear too.

497
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,610
The female prophecy witches will die.

498
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,270
Seul-bi, you must succeed.

499
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,380
Mom, wait for me.

500
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,300
Mom!

501
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,140
Mom, wait for me!

502
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,610
Mom! Mom!

503
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,480
Is the floor too cold?

504
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,450
They're all dead. Black fish.

505
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,470
Scorpaeniformes Scorpaenidae...

506
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,150
Busan Front Sea is very happy.

507
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,250
Why does she talk like an ocean ecosystem researcher even in the dreams?

508
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,370

672
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,930
It's the son of that restaurant, Young-woo.

673
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:46,290
From Monday to Friday.

674
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,930
He'll show up at 4 p.m.

675
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:50,650
No matter it's snowing or raining, he won't be late.

676
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,280
That's why he is called Ticktock.

677
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,970
So he is a punctual person.

678
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:58,720
-But, he is a little... -Hello.

679
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,900
Hello. You're here.

680
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,500
Please give me some twisted dougnhuts.

681
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,110
Thank you.

682
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:13,470
This is as soft as a seaweed living in the ocean forest.

683
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,710
Oh, really?

684
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:17,350
Mangroves in marine forests are rapidly being destroyed.

685
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,610
Carbon emissions from mangrove loss account for

686
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:23,650
one fifth of the world's total carbon emissions from deforestation.

687
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:27,560
July 26 is the international day for the protection of mangrove ecosystems.

688
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,150
That's right.

689
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,400
The attack of sea urchins destroys the seaweed in the marine forest.

690
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,500
To stop sea urchins from eating seaweed,

691
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,340
we must protect sea otters, the core species of the ecosystem that prey on sea urchins.

692
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,200
That's right.

693
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,810
Ticktock.

694
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:46,020
It's the first time I've seen someone is talking to you.

695
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,240
My parents run a small restaurant and we have the set meal.

696
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:55,000
Set meal? Is that food?

697
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,390
Uncle, she looks a little stupid.

698
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,820
Yes, she is.

699
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,370
I'm not stupid. I'm adapting.

700
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,600
You are adapting?

701
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,610
I'm adapting to this world.

702
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:08,950
This world? Then are you from another world?

703
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:10,620
Yes.

704
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:13,380
Amazing! If you want to eat the food from this world,

705
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,280
come to my place.

706
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,390
Thank you.

707
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:18,320
-Bye. -Bye.

708
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,330
Bye.

709
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,500
-I want one more. -Okay.

710
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,690
Stop eating. You don't pay it.

711
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,350
Madam, this pancake is a bit salty.

712
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,010
What kind of fish is this?

713
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,050
Fried black rockfish.

714
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:39,000
-Well, it's delicious. -We've got the interest.

715
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,720
Go Myeong-seong doesn't give us.

716
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,580
It's him again?

717
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,180
He is really pissing me off.

718
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,410
He is killing me.

719
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:49,260
Only when his business is good can he have money.

720
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,430
We should've robbed the shop.

721
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,900
Hello, Mr. Shin.

722
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,800
I'll get the money ready and call you.

723
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,740
No, I'll get it ready for you today.

724
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:05,230
So please change the order for me.

725
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:07,290
Okay, thank you.

726
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,390
Hey, that girl...

727
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,220
That girl.

728
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,190
What about her?

729
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:21,980
She's Go Myeong-seong's girlfriend. It's widely rumored in this market.

730
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,310
It was a mess yesterday.

731
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:25,890
That girl was clinging on Go Myeong-seong.

732
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,210
And Go Myeong-seong kicked her out.

733
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:30,790
But seeing her spend money all the way, Go Myeong-seong paid her bills.

734
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,380
He seems to have feelings for her.

Hello.

740
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,340
The girl came this morning.

741
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,890
Did she find her home?

742
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,490
She is like this.

743
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,420
Oh.

744
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,210
That girl. She left.

745
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:09,150
She left? Did you find her family?

746
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,620
We asked her if she needed help,

747
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,590
but she didn't answer.

748
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:14,220
So we let her go.

749
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,950
How could you just let her go?

750
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:17,790
It's widely rumored in this market.

751
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:19,780
People said she ran away from home and came to see you.

752
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,910
It was you who kicked her out.

753
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:22,500
Why are you yelling at us?

754
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,720
We're public servants, not your punchbag.

755
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,350
Where could she go? She is not smart.

756
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,030
Could she go back to the shop?

757
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,110
Hello.

758
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:46,640
Hello.

759
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,150
What is happening?

760
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,060
What is going on between them?

761
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,560
Doesn't Chief Wang hate Myeong-seong?

762
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,160
Why is he with a girl who came to see Myeong-seong?

763
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,160
Should we tell Myeong-seong?

764
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,010
What?

765
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:22,030
Oh, I remember.

766
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:26,110
The taxi fare was 150,000 won. She got off without paying.

767
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:29,390
Wait. She got off at Seodong Market.

768
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:32,950
You have such a perfect figure.

769
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,910
You don't live nearby, do you?

770
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:36,990
How can I help you?

771
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:38,880
Have you seen this woman?

772
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,920
Oh, she was looking for Myeong-seong.

773
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,510
Turn this way and there's a shop called Lucky Fish Shop.

774
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:47,990
Go over there.

775
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,790
-Thank you. -It's called Lucky.

776
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,780

Did Soo Gwang say he'd come here to pick me up?

Yes, he said he was worried about you.

Just keep an eye on her?

802
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,100
Or what?

803
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,250
We have to let her go after Go Myeong-seong brings the money.

804

Will Go Myeong-seong bring the money?

805

She's pretty. We'd better sell her and make some money...

How many days do you want me to wait? It's been three months.

No. You're a nice man. Please give me more time.

824

826

Seul-bi or Bi-seul.

827
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,780
You dare to hurt her and you wiil be dead.

828
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:28,960
You don't seem to understand.

829

Are you threatening me right now?

830

No, Chief Wang.

831
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,610
I'll give you some interest today.

832

-Please let Seul-bi go. -Do you think I'm asking you for this?

833
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,220
Use your head.

834
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,200
Think about where you can get money.

835
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,380
There are loan sharks everywhere.

836
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:47,890
Go borrow some money and save up the money.

00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:51,150
Otherwise, you'll never see Seul-bi girl again.

838
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:53,090
Chief Wang...

839
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,130
Darn it.

840
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,880
Piggy, take her away.

841
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,670
She's a nice girl. She's just a little stupid.

842
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:07,630
If you bring money, Chief Wang will be happy too.

843
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:11,150
Piggy, hurry up.

844
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:23,970
I have a question.

845
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,750
Isn't it a bit sad to be with Myeong-seong?

846
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,920
People are always in bad luck being with him. He's like a jinx.

847
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,430
He ruins everything. Don't you feel it?

848
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:35,060
What do you mean by that?

849
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:38,200
Like I stepped on the gum I spit out.

850
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,330
I stepped on gum too.

851
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,380
It's sticky.

852
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,150
Did you feel that too?

853
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,180
Me?

854
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,750
I've always been stayed away from Myeong-seong.

855
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:56,720
Well, stay away. But you don't look good.

856
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:00,910
What? Me? Why?

857
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,510
Gong Soo-kwang.

858
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,750
Why is this car parked on a crosswalk?

859
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:33,820
Hey, mister.

860
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,860
Chief Wang, long time no see.

861
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:41,440
Is Pi Dae Shik crazy?

862
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,420
Let go of me!

863
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,300
Pretty, don't move.

864
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,780
You said Soo-kwang will come, you liar!

865
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,740
I said you will be in bad luck being with him.

866
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,350
You're in bad luck now.

867
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:55,900
Take it.

868
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,050
-Thank you. -Let's go.

869
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,390
What are you doing?

870
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,490
Mr. Wang, look at this.

871
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,270
It's a lot.

872
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,830
I told you I don't do human trafficking.

873
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:11,930
Let's forget about the deal.

874
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:13,540
Are you kidding me?

875
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,690
Are you crazy?

876
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:17,120
Do you really think Go Myeong-seong will bring the money?

877
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,690
Get out of my way.

878
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:25,670
Hey, Chief Wang, Pi Dae Shik. I don't care if you two fight or not.

879
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:30,410
If you try to fool me, both of you will die.

880
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:36,260
Those jerks really kill people.

881
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,330
-What are you doing? -Let's go.

882
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,950
What are you doing?

883
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,450
Chief Wang is such a fool.

884
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,540
How would I know a doctor?

885
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,060
That Hyeon-su. Poor kid.

886
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:10,970
Ah, seagulls. Seagulls are too noisy.

887
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,130
How do you know Hyeon-su?

888
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:16,240
Get her out of here.

889
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,160
Get out of here! Shit.

890
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,660
Don't trust him.

891
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,440
Hyeon-su needs me, not him.

892
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,410
Let's go.

893
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:25,470
I can help Hyeon-su.

894
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:31,980
-Hyeon-su needs surgery. -Come on. Let's go.

895
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,940
Yes. Hyeon-su's surgery.

896
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:34,390
Mr. Wang.

897
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,530
Hyeon-su's surgery... You said you wanted to change Hyeon-su's surgical order.

898
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,080
Let's take care of this first.

899
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,930
Wait. How could she know about Hyeon-su is having a surgery?

900
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,700
Sit down.

901
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:52,250
Don't move.

902
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:58,840
Don't move.

903
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:00,660
Soo-kwang!

904
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,890
What is she doing?

905
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,770
Give it to me.

906
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,430
It's Seul-bi.

907
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,020
Eun-joo! Eun-joo! Stop! Stop!

908
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:22,940
-What’s wrong? -Eun-joo.

909
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,680
Can I borrow your bike?

910
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,540
No.

911
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,530
I'm sorry.

912
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:29,450
Are you a thief?

913
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:32,130
Yes, call the police.

914
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:34,980
(The number you dialed is not answered...)

915
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,910
I must be out of my mind.

916
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:44,440
(Mr. Shin: I’m in a meeting with the surgery coordinator. Transfer the money and I’ll arrange it.)

917
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:55,330
Gong Soo-kwang, Soo-kwang, Gong Soo-kwang.

918
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:00,640
-Shit. -What?

919
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,630
Police!

920
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:03,280
-Shut up! -Police!

921
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,720
Stop it.

922
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,650
These seagulls are so noisy.

923
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:33,030
Honey, come here.

924
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:39,040
Mr. Wang is such a fool.

925
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,570
How would I know a doctor?

926
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:45,450
And that Hyeon-su. Poor kid.

927
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:48,080
How would I know a doctor?

928
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:52,200
And that Hyeon-su. Poor kid.

929
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,370
What is this?

930
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,550
I got a call. It's a strange number.

931
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:57,870
So I picked it up.

932
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,720
It's delicious.

933
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,460
-Hey. -Where are you?

934
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:05,140
How dare you mess with me about Hyeon-su?

935
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,090
You jerk.

936
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,240
Darn it.

937
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,200
Why are you picking up?

938
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,560
-I don't know. -Let's go.

939
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,630
Hyeon-su needs surgery.

940
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:32,000
Where are you going?

941
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:37,570
Who is this?

942
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,140
It's Soo-kwang.

943
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:46,120
-Soo-kwang. -Don't move. Run over him.

944
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,140
Okay.

945
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:53,940
Hey!

946
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,270
Who is this brat?

947
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:06,060
Seul-bi.

948
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,310
Why are you so late?

949
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:08,240
I'm sorry.

950
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,350
-What are you sorry for? -Go to hell.

951
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:19,920
What? Is it the iron palm?

952
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,820
No, it's a curse.

953
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:25,090
If you touch my hand, you will in a bad luck for three days.

954
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:29,500
A bastard like you may die. You bastards!

955
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:36,070
Self-defense spray.

956
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:38,020
Are you crazy?

957
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,490
Self-defense spray.

958
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,800
What are you waiting for? Run!

959
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:11,620
Hey, you weirdo. Don't forget what you just said.

960
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:14,370
Okay, I'll keep my promise.

961
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,090
What are you doing? Run!

962
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:19,890
Stop!

963
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:31,750
Soo-kwang.

964
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:32,530
What's wrong?

965
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:33,690
This way.

966
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:35,580
Run! Hurry!

967
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,270
Where are you going?

968
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:13,280
Why are you walking in the alleys instead of the road?

969
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,480
They're coming.

970
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:22,720
A dead end!

971
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:24,800
What should we do?

972
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,830
It's driving me crazy.

973
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:31,330
It's a dead end. What should we do? We are dead.

974
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:34,170
You rats.

975
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:39,380
It's all my fault. Let her go.

976
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,070
Soo-kwang.

977
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:59,200
Wait for me.

978
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:03,320
Wait for you?

979
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:38,780
(Preview of the next episode)

980
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,210
Stop him!

981
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:43,430
This is a rich woman who is about to marry a magnate.

982
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:44,870
They cross the gap of their identities

983
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:47,170
and eloped with love.

984
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:48,290
Soo-kwang

985
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:52,670
That kid can't live like an ordinary people.

986
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:53,400
Dad.

987
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,260
Then...

988
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:56,400
Is there a way to find Seul-bi's family?

989
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,930
There it is.

990
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:02,480
I want to fly far, but not now.

991
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,120
Because I came to you.
