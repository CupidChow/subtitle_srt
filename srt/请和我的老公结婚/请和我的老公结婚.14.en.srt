13
00:00:49,846 --> 00:00:50,930
Thank you.

14
00:00:56,978 --> 00:00:58,730
The floor's slippery. Careful.

15
00:00:58,813 --> 00:01:00,648
It's fine. You don't have to.

16
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:03,818
I told you not to move!

17
00:01:09,949 --> 00:01:11,451
What are you doing?

18
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:13,369
It's fine.

19
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:16,539
The doctors were just worried.
I don't need all that.

20
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:20,126
The smart doctors know what they're doing.
Listen to them.

21
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,005
Don't do anything
on your own from now on, okay?

22
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,342
You don't listen.

23
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:33,640
Are you hungry?

24
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:41,940
What are you doing?

25
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:46,569
Let's just stay like this.

26
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:05,755
When I thought it was the end,
I regretted it so much.

27
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:09,968
I was given another chance
but wasn't honest again.

28
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:18,226
You won't die.

29
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:23,439
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

30
00:02:31,114 --> 00:02:32,198
No, I'm sorry.

31
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:40,582
Yu-ra isn't an easy opponent.

32
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:45,378
Even after I saw
her unimaginable true colors,

33
00:02:45,461 --> 00:02:48,006
it took over three years
to end it with her.

34
00:02:49,757 --> 00:02:52,802
Someone being beyond your imagination...

35
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:54,804
I know what you mean.

36
00:02:57,515 --> 00:02:59,934
When you spend a long time with someone,

37
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:02,270
it's hard to see that person properly.

38
00:03:03,646 --> 00:03:06,149
You try not to believe it.

39
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:11,321
You only realize it after you see the end.

40
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,409
Your ex-fiancÃ©e is trying to kill me,

41
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,204
and Min-hwan and Su-min get paid if I die.

42
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:23,499
They joined forces.

43
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:31,507
Ms. Yang's husband's having an affair.

44
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:36,554
I think my fate moved to Ms. Yang.

45
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:40,141
It's not over with their marriage.

46
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:43,061
There's something more.
I have to find that out.

47
00:03:43,144 --> 00:03:45,063
To protect Ms. Yang.

48
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:50,443
Just stay by my side.

55
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:17,864
The police think
a drunk driver caused the accident.

56
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:21,367
They'll never catch her.

57
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:24,829
We put someone
on Yu-ra, Min-hwan, and Su-min.

58
00:05:24,912 --> 00:05:27,623
But we haven't caught anything yet.

59
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:32,211
We put people on them after the accident,
so there's no lead.

60
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,136
If you knew in advance,
you should've discussed it with me first.

61
00:05:48,186 --> 00:05:50,897
I wasn't sure that you were on my side.

62
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,865
I'm sorry, Seok-jun.

63
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,876
Don't. I'm not that angry.

64
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:18,716
The only way is
to find Jeong Man-sik and Bae Hui-suk.

65
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:21,594
They must be heading for Incheon.

66
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:23,721
And Oh Yu-ra must be looking for them.

67
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:25,264
I'm sure.

68
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:28,101
It's a matter of who's faster.

69
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:32,063
By the way, how long
do you have to wear the sling?

70
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:37,652
Until Ji-won tells me to stop wearing it.

71
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:39,737
Honestly, I can take it off now.

72
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,533
But she promised to take care of me
while I had it on.

73
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:05,221
Ji-hyuk.

74
00:07:05,304 --> 00:07:08,432
Do you remember anything more
from the accident?

75
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:14,897
Not really.

76
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:17,441
I went to the memorial hall to see you.

77
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:19,443
The car broke down there.

78
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,904
Is that all?

79
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:28,828
Maybe not,
but I can't think of anything right now.

80
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:34,959
-Ji-won?
-Yeah?

81
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:37,420
-Eggs.
-Okay.

82
00:07:42,258 --> 00:07:43,134
What else?

83
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:46,888
I should go. I'll see you tomorrow.

84
00:07:50,057 --> 00:07:51,184
Thanks for today.

85
00:07:56,981 --> 00:07:57,857
What's wrong?

86
00:07:58,774 --> 00:07:59,817
Ji-won.

87
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:01,235
Does it hurt again?

88
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:09,660
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:13,414
It's the only thing I could think of.

90
00:08:17,752 --> 00:08:20,838
I can't believe you.

91
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:23,966
Can you...

92
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:28,012
stay the night?

93
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:38,439
Good night.

94
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,399
I'll get the light.

95
00:08:51,786 --> 00:08:53,955
Mr. Yu, what are you doing?

96
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:57,375
I understand what you mean,
so I'll just hold you.

97
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:02,255
It still hurts. I swear.

98
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,515
Always be by my side.

99
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:17,311
No matter what you do,

100
00:09:20,189 --> 00:09:21,274
do it by my side.

101
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:27,071
That's all I need.

102
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:23,961
Are you up? I was going to wake you.

103
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:29,508
Do you want strawberries? It's so good.
It's the yummiest I've had...

104
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:35,890
What? Did you have a nightmare?

105
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:47,985
Wait. Does your arm not hurt?
Is it okay now?

106
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:51,322
It hurts.

107
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:54,533
No, you were just...

108
00:10:57,036 --> 00:10:59,997
Wow. You know how to lie now.

109
00:11:00,915 --> 00:11:01,832
It's true.

110
00:11:06,921 --> 00:11:08,464
What did you dream about?

111
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:10,841
It's a secret.

112
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:20,017
I know we're both assistant managers,
but I'm acting manager,

113
00:11:20,726 --> 00:11:23,020
so I have to say this.

114
00:11:23,104 --> 00:11:27,650
You take a day off too often,
as if you're part of the owner's family.

115
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:29,777
I had some issues at home.

116
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:35,533
You did? Is there anyone here
who doesn't have a home?

117
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:38,869
Is there anyone here
who doesn't have issues at home?

118
00:11:38,953 --> 00:11:42,873
Darn it. Why did the personnel decision
have to be made now?

119
00:11:42,957 --> 00:11:45,918
That jerk is just so lucky.

120
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:49,463
There's so much work
piling up around us...

121
00:11:51,882 --> 00:11:52,883
Unbelievable.

122
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:56,345
Shall I help?

123
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:00,266
-Ms. Yang!
-Ms. Yang!

124
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:04,979
Is it okay to work now?

125
00:12:06,522 --> 00:12:08,732
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

126
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,201
What?

127
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:22,163
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Why couldn't I reach you?</i>

128
00:12:22,246 --> 00:12:25,249
Kang Ji-won came to work
as if nothing happened.

129
00:12:25,332 --> 00:12:27,501
What the hell is going on?

130
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:30,504
Ji-hyuk's been discharged.
That must be why.

131
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:33,299
<i>I told you to act like nothing happened.</i>

132
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,426
What do you think she'll do?

133
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:40,306
<i>It's easy to pull her hair and yell</i>
<i>if you want to fight.</i>

134
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:43,767
Be patient
if you don't want to live like a bum.

135
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:47,104
Will you come to the gym later?

136
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:50,774
You'll feel better
after we talk while working out.

137
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:56,697
This brat is so rude.

138
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,992
I shouldn't get involved
with such low-standard people,

139
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:03,204
but nothing gets done
if I don't do it myself.

140
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:07,500
We found Man-sik and Hui-suk.
They were scared, so they tried to hide.

141
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:18,385
Hello, it's Jeong Man-sik.

142
00:13:18,469 --> 00:13:20,429
<i>It was hard to find you.</i>

143
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:24,266
Why did you hide? We're in the same boat.

144
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,187
No, it's not because
we couldn't trust you.

145
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,356
We can't trust my daughter.

146
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:32,399
Just trust me now.

147
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:35,277
I never abandon my family.

148
00:13:35,903 --> 00:13:39,156
<i>How about going to China for a while?</i>

149
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,950
<i>Shanghai is beautiful.</i>

150
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:45,746
You can also have some fun in the water
in Hangzhou and Suzhou.

151
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:05,766
<i>Aren't I pathetic?</i>

152
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:09,353
At this age, when I feel anxious,

153
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:11,730
I have nowhere to go but work.

154
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:15,276
Because you have friends here.

155
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,946
I was worried
and going to go see you anyway.

156
00:14:20,864 --> 00:14:24,535
No, I'm barging in tonight.

157
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:27,913
I reported it to the police for adultery.

158
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:31,500
<i>Right. This was</i>
<i>before the law was abolished.</i>

159
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:36,589
Whenever I was admitted to the hospital,

160
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:39,425
he brought her home.

161
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:43,512
So I told him I was being admitted today.

162
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:46,932
His car dashcam

163
00:14:47,558 --> 00:14:51,061
caught them doing dirty things in the car.

164
00:14:51,937 --> 00:14:54,732
But there's no video. I think it's broken.

165
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:58,277
And the police said
audio wasn't enough proof.

166
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:01,071
The dashcam video's not working?

167
00:15:01,947 --> 00:15:02,948
Ridiculous, right?

168
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:08,162
I really didn't want to go this far,

169
00:15:08,912 --> 00:15:13,500
but I made up my mind
and broke the door lock on my way out.

170
00:15:21,342 --> 00:15:22,384
Ms. Yang.

171
00:15:23,552 --> 00:15:24,845
Can I come with you?

172
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:33,604
Is that her?

173
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:34,897
Yes.

174
00:15:35,814 --> 00:15:39,276
Okay, your husband went in 30 minutes ago.

175
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,736
Let's go in 10 minutes.

176
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:09,306
Who are you people?

177
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,058
What? What is it?

178
00:16:11,642 --> 00:16:13,227
What's going on?

179
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:27,116
What?

180
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,325
Hey.

181
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:30,494
Why are you here at this hour?

182
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:35,249
What?

183
00:16:38,502 --> 00:16:43,173
He said you were in the hospital.
I came to give him some side dishes.

184
00:16:43,257 --> 00:16:45,175
Maybe I was out of line.

185
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:49,221
I see him at the restaurant often,
so I considered him family.

186
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:51,598
Hey.

187
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:54,351
Did you suspect me?

188
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:58,564
Do you look down on me
since I work for your dad?

189
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:06,155
-You two...
-What? What is it?

190
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:10,284
Whatever.

191
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:13,787
Forget it. Just leave, all of you.

192
00:17:13,871 --> 00:17:16,039
Get out. Hey, you too.

193
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:19,042
Don't bring anything here
saying you're worried.

194
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:21,253
Wow, you're making a joke of me.

195
00:17:21,336 --> 00:17:23,839
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

196
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:30,804
Get out.

197
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:38,479
You should go too. I'll talk to him.

198
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:44,818
You're not leaving?

199
00:17:57,748 --> 00:18:00,501
I'm leaving, but before I go...

200
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:04,213
What's she doing?

201
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:11,470
What? What are you doing?

202
00:18:11,553 --> 00:18:12,679
What?

203
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,916
No, don't hit me.

204
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:44,002
If you touch her, I'll make you pay!

205
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:49,383
You're crazy!

206
00:18:52,177 --> 00:18:54,513
I'm going to charge you for this!

207
00:18:54,596 --> 00:18:56,098
You came with the cops!

208
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:57,724
Sir, this...

209
00:18:57,808 --> 00:19:01,520
Isn't this property damage?
This woman used the golf club...

210
00:19:01,603 --> 00:19:02,813
Stop it!

211
00:19:16,076 --> 00:19:17,828
You're so shameless.

212
00:19:18,662 --> 00:19:20,831
Are you happy you weren't caught?

213
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,961
No, I know what you did in the car.

214
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:30,507
What? You wonder how much
insurance money you'll get if I die?

215
00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:34,094
You laughed about it.
Are you two even human?

216
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:37,472
What?

217
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:40,017
That's the car Yeon-ji rides.

218
00:19:40,934 --> 00:19:42,477
Aren't you ashamed?

219
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:45,939
You're a terrible person.

220
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:51,403
What are you saying?

221
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:53,572
You don't even have any proof.

222
00:19:53,655 --> 00:19:55,073
Hey, that's--

223
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:00,913
Why you...

224
00:20:18,096 --> 00:20:18,931
Are you okay?

225
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:25,395
No, don't.

226
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:26,980
You crazy bastard!

227
00:20:27,064 --> 00:20:29,483
No, wait! You can't do this.

228
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:32,402
-Hold her tight.
-Please calm down. Hold her.

229
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:35,614
Calm down. Please. You can't do this.

230
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:49,628
Are you okay, Ji-won?

231
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:02,599
I'll come back after work tomorrow.
Don't do anything until then.

232
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:06,478
Thanks, Ji-won.

233
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:10,732
But it's my business,
so I'll handle it by myself.

234
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:16,405
I realized earlier.
I don't think he'll break up that easily.

235
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:19,116
So I'll see a lawyer.

236
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:21,702
No...

237
00:21:21,785 --> 00:21:24,913
Don't ever meet him alone.

238
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:26,999
Just call me. I'll come.

239
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,378
Why are you saying such strange things?

240
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:34,047
You're acting weird.

241
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:37,676
I know that.

242
00:21:38,385 --> 00:21:42,222
But you would've gotten hurt badly
if it weren't for me earlier.

243
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,517
Just do as I say this once.

244
00:21:47,352 --> 00:21:49,062
I'll be by your side.

245
00:21:55,277 --> 00:21:58,697
You said you'd meet a lawyer.

246
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,532
You can talk with me.

247
00:22:20,135 --> 00:22:22,345
Ms. Yang can trust Mr. Lee.

248
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:24,473
He always does what he says.

249
00:22:29,686 --> 00:22:32,147
My fate going to someone else...

250
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:35,025
I don't think it's a coincidence.

251
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:41,656
If the stress from her indifferent husband
caused her cancer,

252
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:46,203
where did the fate of being killed by him
come from?

253
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,957
<i>The broken door lock.</i>

254
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,543
<i>The red high heels.</i>

255
00:22:54,377 --> 00:22:56,088
<i>And the candy tin.</i>

256
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:02,094
Husband having an affair
with someone close...

257
00:23:04,387 --> 00:23:08,809
Or are those scumbags
after the insurance money?

258
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:19,444
<i>I'll take care of you when my wife dies.</i>

259
00:23:25,575 --> 00:23:27,702
I know what I have to do.

260
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:30,622
Ji-hyuk,

261
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,959
I have to seduce Min-hwan.

262
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:46,221
<i>Because Min-hwan must have an affair</i>
<i>and not care if his wife dies.</i>

263
00:23:55,772 --> 00:23:58,775
JEONG SU-MIN, JI-WON'S FRIEND

264
00:24:09,244 --> 00:24:13,039
<i>No, I have to make him think</i>
<i>that he needs to kill her.</i>

265
00:24:27,762 --> 00:24:31,892
I know it'll upset you,
but I have to do it.

266
00:24:33,643 --> 00:24:37,898
If I don't give the fate of being killed
by a cheating husband to Su-min,

267
00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:41,443
Ms. Yang will die.

268
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:54,581
Can I do this?

269
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:08,053
Okay.

270
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:12,015
Do whatever you want.

271
00:25:18,313 --> 00:25:19,814
I'll help you.

272
00:26:02,023 --> 00:26:04,067
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, sir?

273
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,569
You take over the meal kit project.

274
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:10,615
Pardon? But the person in charge is...

275
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:13,952
You joined the team.
You need a project of your own.

276
00:26:14,577 --> 00:26:16,246
You can do it, right?

277
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:17,747
I want you all to help.

278
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,045
This isn't right, Mr. Yu!

279
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,258
You chose money over me.
Did you not see this coming?

280
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:30,427
You can't have it both ways, Ji-won.

281
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,725
Fine. I'll find a new job.

282
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:40,103
In return,
let me finish the meal kit project.

283
00:26:40,186 --> 00:26:42,731
This project belongs to Ms. Yang and me.

284
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:44,316
It belongs to the company.

285
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:48,069
Don't let personal matters--

286
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:51,948
I gave you the meal kit project
because of my personal feelings.

287
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:55,076
I don't want to see you. Take the day off.

288
00:26:56,036 --> 00:26:57,662
Resigning would be better.

289
00:27:15,078 --> 00:27:17,539
She took the money and broke up with him?

290
00:27:26,423 --> 00:27:29,384
OH YU-RA

291
00:27:32,554 --> 00:27:33,930
Forget it.

292
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:52,684
Why are you doing this alone?

293
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:55,145
What?

294
00:27:55,645 --> 00:27:58,482
My position turned to crap
because of someone.

295
00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:00,817
As I said before,

296
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:05,697
none of this would've happened
if you didn't see Su-min.

297
00:28:06,907 --> 00:28:08,617
Don't be ridiculous.

298
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,370
You screwed me over to switch to Mr. Yu.

299
00:28:18,418 --> 00:28:19,461
You're right.

300
00:28:21,463 --> 00:28:22,631
I am?

301
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:27,135
But the situation has changed.

302
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:40,065
Do you want to have a drink with me later?

303
00:28:42,984 --> 00:28:44,027
Eighty billion won?

304
00:28:48,657 --> 00:28:53,412
The chairman said he'd gladly pay me
that much if I broke up with him.

305
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:57,290
Of course, it's not all cash.

306
00:28:57,374 --> 00:28:58,917
There's real estate too.

307
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,755
He took care of all the taxes too.

308
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:06,716
So I don't even know how much I have.

309
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,886
An asset manager? I have that too.

310
00:29:12,848 --> 00:29:17,853
Mr. Yu is pretty angry with me
for taking money from the chairman.

311
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:20,021
But what else was I supposed to do?

312
00:29:25,318 --> 00:29:26,570
<i>It makes sense.</i>

313
00:29:26,653 --> 00:29:30,824
<i>No matter how rich he is, it'd be strange</i>
<i>to just give her that much.</i>

314
00:29:30,907 --> 00:29:34,453
<i>But if it's under the condition</i>
<i>that she stops seeing him,</i>

315
00:29:34,536 --> 00:29:35,871
<i>that makes more sense.</i>

316
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:39,332
<i>Still, that's a lot...</i>

317
00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:45,422
JEONG SU-MIN, JI-WON'S FRIEND

318
00:29:45,505 --> 00:29:47,299
Why does she have to call now?

319
00:30:00,395 --> 00:30:02,981
MIN-HWAN

320
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:11,072
What is it?

321
00:30:20,123 --> 00:30:22,417
Shouldn't you be at home at this hour?

322
00:30:26,546 --> 00:30:31,051
I know you're busy.
Thanks for making time for me.

323
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,679
I've wanted to see you.

324
00:30:36,264 --> 00:30:39,309
When I saw you last time,

325
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,646
I was reminded of working together.

326
00:30:53,949 --> 00:30:56,034
Bye, Su-min.

327
00:30:56,117 --> 00:30:57,869
I loved you.

328
00:31:00,288 --> 00:31:01,790
I die today.

329
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:08,964
You seem different
now that you're married.

330
00:31:11,258 --> 00:31:15,220
Women act like they won't change,
but they change after marriage.

331
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,348
Ji-won, who's not married, gets prettier.

332
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:20,934
Jeong Su-min.

333
00:31:21,017 --> 00:31:23,103
You should be alert.

334
00:31:23,186 --> 00:31:25,063
Min-hwan and Ji-won...

335
00:31:26,273 --> 00:31:29,276
They dated for seven years
since they're a good fit.

336
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:32,404
Besides, they see each other often
at work.

337
00:31:32,487 --> 00:31:34,698
Old feelings could come back, and...

338
00:31:49,921 --> 00:31:52,966
Do you remember
the all-you-can-eat restaurant

339
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:55,135
near my old place?

340
00:31:55,218 --> 00:31:56,636
We went there often.

341
00:31:57,304 --> 00:31:58,305
Yeah.

342
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,602
On days we went there,
you wouldn't let me eat breakfast

343
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:06,730
or drink water in case I'd feel full.

344
00:32:06,813 --> 00:32:09,899
Why would you remember
something so pathetic?

345
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:13,361
Why is that pathetic? It's cute.

346
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:18,867
Back then, everything felt
precious and priceless.

347
00:32:22,746 --> 00:32:26,333
Money wasn't that important to me
when I was with you.

348
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:30,128
You know I really liked you.

349
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:34,174
Well, there was no one like you.

350
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,010
You could put up with me too.

351
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:44,434
So...

352
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,729
you and Yu Ji-hyuk really broke up?

353
00:32:49,814 --> 00:32:51,232
I thought so, but...

354
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:57,906
Actually, I almost had
a big accident recently.

355
00:32:59,366 --> 00:33:00,825
Accident?

356
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:06,373
It was with a dump truck,
so I would've died.

357
00:33:06,456 --> 00:33:09,000
But Mr. Yu came out of nowhere and...

358
00:33:10,418 --> 00:33:12,796
Everything got complicated then.

359
00:33:14,923 --> 00:33:15,965
Complicated?

360
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:18,802
Yes, horribly complicated.

361
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:27,143
Do you know
who the driver of that truck was?

362
00:33:32,315 --> 00:33:34,234
No, how would I know that?

363
00:33:35,443 --> 00:33:36,778
It was Su-min's dad.

364
00:33:40,198 --> 00:33:41,741
<i>She knew everything.</i>

365
00:33:52,502 --> 00:33:53,920
Stop lying.

366
00:33:54,003 --> 00:33:55,964
You keep lying and lying!

367
00:33:56,798 --> 00:33:57,924
I want to.

368
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,178
I want to stop it too.

369
00:34:08,226 --> 00:34:11,938
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>Shouldn't you tell me what's going on?</i>

370
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:14,566
<i>I'm going crazy stuck at home.</i>

371
00:34:15,525 --> 00:34:17,193
<i>Why won't you come home?</i>

372
00:34:17,277 --> 00:34:18,987
<i>Are you with Kang Ji-won...</i>

373
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:28,246
<i>They dated for seven years</i>
<i>since they're a good fit.</i>

374
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:32,751
No.

375
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:34,502
No way.

376
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:36,713
He wanted to kill her...

377
00:34:36,796 --> 00:34:37,881
What's going on? Move!

378
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,258
Are you really my girlfriend?

379
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:41,342
Avocado!

380
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,344
Kang Ji-won.

381
00:34:44,596 --> 00:34:45,930
I love you.

382
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,356
You didn't know she'd stoop so low,
did you?

383
00:34:56,024 --> 00:34:57,192
I didn't either.

384
00:34:58,443 --> 00:35:01,780
I get she hates me,
but how could she try to kill me?

385
00:35:01,863 --> 00:35:03,323
She's crazy.

386
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:07,786
I didn't just see her true colors
with this accident.

387
00:35:08,286 --> 00:35:09,454
Mr. Yu...

388
00:35:09,954 --> 00:35:11,664
put someone on me.

389
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:18,296
If not, how could he have shown up?
We hadn't met since we broke up.

390
00:35:18,379 --> 00:35:19,714
It doesn't make sense.

391
00:35:23,051 --> 00:35:24,928
I think I'm going crazy.

392
00:35:25,011 --> 00:35:28,139
I feel like I'm being watched.
I'm so scared.

393
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:32,560
What do I do in this situation?

394
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:36,564
So you haven't come to work because...

395
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,276
It was because of me.
I couldn't just leave him.

396
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:44,113
Fortunately, he wasn't hurt that badly.

397
00:35:45,907 --> 00:35:47,450
So he's been discharged.

398
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,871
But when I told him we were through,

399
00:35:52,747 --> 00:35:54,374
he told me to resign.

400
00:35:58,002 --> 00:35:59,212
<i>She's telling the truth.</i>

401
00:36:08,596 --> 00:36:10,723
<i>Something felt off, and this was it.</i>

402
00:36:10,807 --> 00:36:14,853
<i>Yes, Yu Ji-hyuk is rich,</i>
<i>so she was right to switch over to him.</i>

403
00:36:14,936 --> 00:36:19,649
<i>And she was also right</i>
<i>to break up with him for 80 billion won.</i>

404
00:36:20,942 --> 00:36:23,862
<i>She wouldn't make a good wife</i>
<i>for a rich guy.</i>

405
00:36:24,571 --> 00:36:27,824
<i>If she has 80 billion won,</i>
<i>I shouldn't kill her.</i>

406
00:36:27,907 --> 00:36:31,744
<i>If she dies, her mom and the others</i>
<i>will split the money.</i>

407
00:36:31,828 --> 00:36:33,663
<i>Nothing will come to me.</i>

408
00:36:34,163 --> 00:36:38,001
<i>But if I seduce her again,</i>
<i>that 80 billion won will come to me.</i>

409
00:36:40,128 --> 00:36:41,838
Can you break up with Su-min?

410
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:43,464
What?

411
00:36:44,173 --> 00:36:47,176
You know how scary she is now.

412
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:49,262
Come back to me.

413
00:36:53,391 --> 00:36:54,893
I can't do this alone...

414
00:36:58,271 --> 00:37:00,523
Never mind, I should go.

415
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:03,067
Ji-won.

416
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:17,916
I'll call you.

417
00:37:39,729 --> 00:37:42,357
I'm sorry. I'm sure you hated to see that.

418
00:38:10,677 --> 00:38:12,011
What are you doing?

419
00:38:14,597 --> 00:38:15,932
Nothing.

420
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:21,104
If I don't do this,
I don't think I can keep sane.

421
00:38:27,276 --> 00:38:29,028
You like me a lot, don't you?

422
00:38:39,497 --> 00:38:40,873
No, well...

423
00:38:40,957 --> 00:38:44,293
Earlier, Min-hwan seemed
to be regretting what he did.

424
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:46,754
Min-hwan?

425
00:38:48,548 --> 00:38:51,676
He's probably crunching numbers
in his head right now.

426
00:39:02,979 --> 00:39:04,772
-Hey.
-<i>Are you coming today?</i>

427
00:39:04,856 --> 00:39:06,733
I was just about to call.

428
00:39:06,816 --> 00:39:09,444
I think things will get easier.

429
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:11,571
I just met with Kang Ji-won.

430
00:39:11,654 --> 00:39:13,740
She has no idea I was involved.

431
00:39:13,823 --> 00:39:16,951
<i>So you just have to take care</i>

432
00:39:17,035 --> 00:39:19,328
<i>of Ji-won's mom and Su-min's dad.</i>

433
00:39:19,412 --> 00:39:22,040
<i>Then she'll come to me</i>
<i>with 80 billion won.</i>

434
00:39:22,123 --> 00:39:25,877
And you can get U&K or Yu Ji-hyuk.
Do whatever you want.

435
00:39:26,377 --> 00:39:30,256
We'll become each other's support forever.

436
00:39:32,675 --> 00:39:35,094
Yeah, I see.

437
00:39:35,178 --> 00:39:36,846
That's nice and easy.

438
00:39:42,018 --> 00:39:44,854
He underestimates his ex-girlfriend.

439
00:39:44,937 --> 00:39:46,606
I told you, didn't I?

440
00:39:46,689 --> 00:39:49,776
Men aren't wary
of the women they've slept with.

441
00:39:53,613 --> 00:39:55,531
Where's Jeong Man-sik and Bae Hui-suk?

442
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:00,286
When you were younger,

443
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:02,747
you looked just like that actor.

444
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,457
I looked better.

445
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:06,501
You were handsome.

446
00:40:08,336 --> 00:40:10,630
What shall we do in China?

447
00:40:10,713 --> 00:40:11,839
Let's kill them.

448
00:40:12,965 --> 00:40:13,800
Pardon?

449
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:18,638
Is it because of what Min-hwan said?

450
00:40:18,721 --> 00:40:20,765
No, nothing bad can come from it.

451
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:24,477
If Ji-won wants to return to Min-hwan,

452
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,730
she shouldn't find out
that he tried to kill her.

453
00:40:27,814 --> 00:40:30,191
And even if she's up to something,

454
00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:33,277
she can't prove anything
with those two gone.

455
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:37,698
Also, it's easier than stowing them away.

456
00:40:39,534 --> 00:40:40,785
Let's get a divorce.

457
00:40:46,707 --> 00:40:48,459
We don't have kids.

458
00:40:48,543 --> 00:40:51,170
Honestly, I have no reason
to live with you.

459
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:54,298
Nothing good came from being with you.

460
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,051
Oh, right.

461
00:40:57,927 --> 00:41:00,805
You still can't reach your dad?

462
00:41:05,685 --> 00:41:06,686
Did you

463
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:09,647
meet Kang Ji-won?

464
00:41:13,192 --> 00:41:16,445
Yeah, I saw her at work.

465
00:41:17,238 --> 00:41:18,322
Why do you ask?

466
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,202
I thought about it.

467
00:41:24,412 --> 00:41:27,874
If you and Ji-won get back together...

468
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:37,383
then only I'll get screwed over.

469
00:41:45,975 --> 00:41:47,185
OUT OF BUSINESS

470
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,729
What's going on?

471
00:41:51,272 --> 00:41:52,773
Did you get a call?

472
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:56,068
He wouldn't do something like this.

473
00:41:56,152 --> 00:41:57,945
He could've told us.

474
00:41:58,029 --> 00:42:00,364
Are we fired? What's going on?

475
00:42:01,908 --> 00:42:04,785
<i>Eun-ho, I'm sorry.</i>

476
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:07,997
<i>I had to close Werther</i>
<i>for personal reasons.</i>

477
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,251
<i>It's been great working with you.</i>
<i>I hope we meet again one day.</i>

478
00:42:13,753 --> 00:42:15,421
He closed Werther?

479
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:16,964
Suddenly?

480
00:42:17,048 --> 00:42:19,050
-This is insane.
-What the hell?

481
00:42:22,428 --> 00:42:23,346
<i>Everyone,</i>

482
00:42:23,429 --> 00:42:27,725
<i>I had to close Werther.</i>
<i>Your severance pay has been wired.</i>

483
00:42:27,808 --> 00:42:29,477
-Closed?
-<i>I'm sorry.</i>

484
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,561
What did you get?

485
00:42:30,645 --> 00:42:32,438
He'll pay a month's salary...

486
00:42:32,521 --> 00:42:33,648
We're unemployed.

487
00:42:33,731 --> 00:42:35,733
What's going on?

488
00:42:35,816 --> 00:42:37,735
How did this happen?

489
00:42:37,818 --> 00:42:39,278
Someone's coming.

490
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,907
Why were they in there?

491
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:53,918
Chef? Come on in.

492
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:02,260
Double the pay.

493
00:43:03,511 --> 00:43:05,263
Your boss here suddenly

494
00:43:05,346 --> 00:43:08,307
decided to sell me the restaurant

495
00:43:08,975 --> 00:43:11,143
at double the market price.

496
00:43:13,312 --> 00:43:14,897
It was a good choice.

497
00:43:16,315 --> 00:43:18,484
It's a choice you can make too.

498
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:21,737
If you help me, this expensive restaurant

499
00:43:22,321 --> 00:43:23,698
will become yours.

500
00:43:29,245 --> 00:43:32,206
What do I have to do?

501
00:43:33,541 --> 00:43:35,293
You have two choices.

502
00:43:36,168 --> 00:43:38,963
One, take the restaurant.

503
00:43:39,797 --> 00:43:42,967
Two, lose your job.

504
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:51,017
Chef!

505
00:43:51,892 --> 00:43:53,978
My heart fluttered when you contacted me!

506
00:43:56,022 --> 00:43:58,274
When Ji-won turned me down,

507
00:43:59,066 --> 00:44:02,403
it was nice to get comforted by you.

508
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:07,158
Is something wrong?

509
00:44:09,452 --> 00:44:11,329
I'm unemployed now.

510
00:44:12,663 --> 00:44:13,831
Why?

511
00:44:18,794 --> 00:44:19,795
Just because.

512
00:44:22,214 --> 00:44:23,799
Come on!

513
00:44:23,883 --> 00:44:27,178
Still, you're famous and handsome...

514
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:29,930
Most importantly,
your food tastes so good!

515
00:44:30,014 --> 00:44:31,474
So...

516
00:44:31,557 --> 00:44:34,060
you may be unemployed for a second,

517
00:44:34,143 --> 00:44:36,187
-but you--
-This industry's small.

518
00:44:36,812 --> 00:44:39,148
The restaurant suddenly closed.

519
00:44:39,231 --> 00:44:41,275
So all the gossipers will

520
00:44:41,942 --> 00:44:43,319
talk about me.

521
00:44:44,362 --> 00:44:47,156
I know that. It's the same with me.

522
00:44:48,407 --> 00:44:52,078
People don't believe us
without even trying to know the story.

523
00:44:53,245 --> 00:44:56,082
If only a decent chef appeared...

524
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,641
Ms. Kang.

525
00:45:16,227 --> 00:45:18,229
-Hey!
-Hey.

526
00:45:18,312 --> 00:45:20,439
Why didn't I think of you?

527
00:45:21,315 --> 00:45:24,777
But I don't know if I can be of any help.

528
00:45:25,444 --> 00:45:27,196
What are you talking about?

529
00:45:30,282 --> 00:45:33,786
Can we talk privately for a second?

530
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,248
-Sure.
-Let's go.

531
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:44,672
So it was a woman?

532
00:45:44,755 --> 00:45:45,589
Yeah.

533
00:45:52,388 --> 00:45:54,432
Thanks for telling me.

534
00:45:54,515 --> 00:45:57,685
And I'm so sorry. No harm will go to you.

535
00:45:59,812 --> 00:46:01,355
That's not why I told you.

536
00:46:08,154 --> 00:46:11,991
Anyway, I didn't tell Hui-yeon.

537
00:46:14,994 --> 00:46:19,248
Oh Yu-ra bought Werther
and asked Eun-ho to help her.

538
00:46:19,331 --> 00:46:21,167
He said no, and she fired him.

539
00:46:21,709 --> 00:46:24,795
And she didn't tell him
what she needed help with.

540
00:46:26,005 --> 00:46:28,007
I know what it is. Don't worry.

541
00:46:29,175 --> 00:46:32,720
I'll call you back later.
I'm with someone right now.

542
00:46:48,986 --> 00:46:50,905
You have two choices.

543
00:46:52,114 --> 00:46:54,742
One, help me.

544
00:46:54,825 --> 00:46:57,786
Two, go down with Oh Yu-ra.

545
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:03,751
I'm sure you know which to choose
if you're not a fool.

546
00:47:12,051 --> 00:47:13,469
What do I have to do?

547
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:27,149
This is Kang Ji-won, Marketing Team 1.

548
00:47:27,233 --> 00:47:30,528
Hello, this is Park Min-hwan
from U&K Marketing Team 3.

549
00:47:36,242 --> 00:47:39,495
I was wondering
if you could meet me tonight.

550
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:42,498
For the mistakes I've made,

551
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:43,999
I want to treat you.

552
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,546
I'd be grateful.

553
00:47:48,629 --> 00:47:51,549
I'm always ready.

554
00:47:51,632 --> 00:47:55,427
I hope it marks a new beginning.
You can look forward to it.

555
00:47:59,348 --> 00:48:00,683
Okay.

556
00:48:01,433 --> 00:48:02,643
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

557
00:48:02,726 --> 00:48:04,103
-Just a moment.
-Sure.

558
00:48:06,522 --> 00:48:07,356
Yes?

559
00:48:07,439 --> 00:48:09,525
Park Min-hwan already has a woman.

560
00:48:11,735 --> 00:48:12,778
What?

561
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:16,365
You said you couldn't get them!

562
00:48:16,448 --> 00:48:19,034
You seemed down, so I asked around.

563
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:26,709
<i>So I sent limited-edition red high heels.</i>

564
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,214
<i>Along with the candy tin you spoke of.</i>

565
00:48:33,632 --> 00:48:35,509
What's this?

566
00:48:35,593 --> 00:48:39,221
Someone brought it today.
Shall I get rid of it?

567
00:48:45,436 --> 00:48:48,814
No, just leave it.
It reminds me of the old days.

568
00:48:53,235 --> 00:48:56,780
<i>Then I don't need to play</i>
<i>with Min-hwan anymore.</i>

569
00:49:03,412 --> 00:49:04,955
Thanks for waiting.

570
00:49:05,623 --> 00:49:08,042
But I don't think I can do dinner.

571
00:49:09,043 --> 00:49:11,587
If it's because of work, it can be helped.

572
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:14,131
I'm free tomorrow too.

573
00:49:14,214 --> 00:49:16,091
I'm even free on the weekends.

574
00:49:16,675 --> 00:49:18,927
I'm meeting with you after all.

575
00:49:19,011 --> 00:49:20,095
I'm free whenever.

576
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:21,597
No.

577
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,182
What I mean is...

578
00:49:23,807 --> 00:49:26,894
I'll never do business with you.

579
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,065
What?

580
00:49:31,148 --> 00:49:34,526
The only thing you know
how to do is sugarcoat things.

581
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:38,072
You ruin everything you touch,
and aim for insurance fraud.

582
00:49:38,155 --> 00:49:40,282
You're too incompetent to work with.

583
00:49:40,366 --> 00:49:43,285
What really surprised me
is your HR method.

584
00:49:43,869 --> 00:49:47,289
You especially excel
at recruiting female talent.

585
00:49:47,373 --> 00:49:50,000
I was surprised,
since you just got married.

586
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:52,670
You're amazing in many ways.

587
00:49:55,923 --> 00:49:58,050
Good luck in the future.

588
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:07,851
What client is such a scumbag?

589
00:50:28,669 --> 00:50:31,922
JI-WON. I'M SO ASHAMED OF MYSELF...

590
00:50:40,514 --> 00:50:43,392
What are you waiting for?
Shall I light the fire?

591
00:50:59,783 --> 00:51:02,035
It's my first time seeing someone die.

592
00:51:06,957 --> 00:51:08,583
But it's boring.

593
00:51:10,419 --> 00:51:13,422
Still, I feel better.

594
00:51:22,806 --> 00:51:25,183
I don't think I fit in Korea.

595
00:51:25,267 --> 00:51:26,810
Nothing goes right here.

596
00:51:28,228 --> 00:51:32,315
Right. About that restaurant,
what do I do with that?

597
00:51:32,399 --> 00:51:34,151
Shall I tear it down?

598
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:44,828
<i>Okay, fine. Let's divorce.</i>

599
00:51:56,882 --> 00:51:58,592
OH

600
00:51:58,675 --> 00:52:00,469
CALL

601
00:52:00,552 --> 00:52:02,137
OH

602
00:52:05,182 --> 00:52:07,517
<i>Hello, this is Oh Yu-ra.</i>

603
00:52:07,601 --> 00:52:10,812
Hello, my name's Jeong Su-min.

604
00:52:25,744 --> 00:52:26,870
There.

605
00:52:27,454 --> 00:52:28,830
It fits perfectly.

606
00:52:30,582 --> 00:52:33,168
Why is everything working out so well?

607
00:52:40,592 --> 00:52:44,554
<i>I'll be there in five minutes.</i>
<i>Finish up and come down.</i>

608
00:52:58,443 --> 00:53:01,071
Yes, this is Kang Ji-won
of Marketing Team 1.

609
00:53:04,407 --> 00:53:05,575
Hello?

610
00:53:17,796 --> 00:53:18,880
Who are you?

611
00:53:35,397 --> 00:53:36,481
Who are you?

612
00:53:43,822 --> 00:53:46,157
Why would you suddenly call here?

613
00:53:46,241 --> 00:53:48,785
<i>I'm sorry. You didn't pick up your phone.</i>

614
00:53:50,495 --> 00:53:52,831
It's in my purse. I didn't know. Sorry.

615
00:53:52,914 --> 00:53:55,250
<i>I'll get there in about 15 minutes.</i>

616
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,376
Okay.

617
00:54:47,594 --> 00:54:48,595
Kang Ji-won.

618
00:55:00,857 --> 00:55:02,067
Ji-won.

619
00:55:07,948 --> 00:55:08,949
Are you scared?

620
00:55:10,909 --> 00:55:12,619
We need to talk.

621
00:55:13,912 --> 00:55:14,913
Come out.

622
00:55:16,331 --> 00:55:17,457
Let's talk.

623
00:55:19,167 --> 00:55:20,043
Well?

624
00:55:22,128 --> 00:55:23,797
We have a lot to talk about.

625
00:55:39,562 --> 00:55:42,273
You should've known your place.

626
00:55:43,858 --> 00:55:45,485
This is the problem with women.

627
00:55:47,654 --> 00:55:51,408
Was it fun messing with me?

628
00:56:18,768 --> 00:56:21,187
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

629
00:56:21,771 --> 00:56:23,189
Hey, Ji-hyuk's calling.

630
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:26,651
Will you not pick up?

631
00:56:29,779 --> 00:56:31,031
Then I'll pick it up.

632
00:56:35,535 --> 00:56:36,536
Damn it...

633
00:56:38,121 --> 00:56:39,289
SLIDE TO POWER OFF

634
00:56:43,752 --> 00:56:45,879
You've got a strong stomach.

635
00:56:48,089 --> 00:56:49,799
I like money.

636
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:54,554
But aren't those rich people disgusting?

637
00:56:55,263 --> 00:56:57,182
They disgust me.

638
00:57:10,737 --> 00:57:11,863
What are you doing?

639
00:57:26,586 --> 00:57:28,463
How dare you mess with me?

640
00:57:28,546 --> 00:57:30,048
Let go of me! Let go!

641
00:57:30,131 --> 00:57:32,300
What? Are you scared?

642
00:57:32,383 --> 00:57:34,511
Why did you make a mockery of me?

643
00:57:36,012 --> 00:57:37,680
Ji-won.

644
00:57:37,764 --> 00:57:41,768
I really wanted to go back to you.
I wanted to try hard this time!

645
00:57:42,435 --> 00:57:43,895
You tried to kill me.

646
00:57:46,981 --> 00:57:48,108
You...

647
00:57:48,775 --> 00:57:50,777
tricked me.

648
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,113
You treated me like crap!

649
00:57:54,197 --> 00:57:57,367
You can kill others,
but your life's that precious?

650
00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:01,871
I thought about how to pay you back.

651
00:58:01,955 --> 00:58:05,959
I could just give Su-min to you,
but how do I send you to hell?

652
00:58:07,794 --> 00:58:08,795
What?

653
00:58:09,879 --> 00:58:11,005
Hell?

654
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,175
Do you want to die?

655
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:20,265
This was it.

656
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:22,600
Kill me.

657
00:58:23,476 --> 00:58:25,645
But kill me for sure this time.

658
00:58:25,728 --> 00:58:27,981
Or I'll kill you.

659
00:58:40,285 --> 00:58:41,327
Die.

660
00:58:41,911 --> 00:58:44,289
You want me to kill you, so I will.

661
00:58:46,249 --> 00:58:47,250
Are you laughing?

662
00:58:48,084 --> 00:58:49,085
Just die.

663
00:58:51,171 --> 00:58:52,547
Kill me.

664
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:31,836
Ji-won, are you okay?

665
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,588
Ji-won, wake up.

666
00:59:33,671 --> 00:59:34,714
Ji-won.

667
00:59:34,797 --> 00:59:36,299
Ji-won, wake up.

668
00:59:37,217 --> 00:59:38,384
Ji-won!

669
00:59:45,558 --> 00:59:47,310
