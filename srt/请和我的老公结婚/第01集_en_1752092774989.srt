Cold wind is not good

00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,070
My dear Ji Won

3
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,156
You are still beautiful

4
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,539
If you leave me, I won't forgive you

5
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,833
Don't forget that I am by your side

6
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,126
You want to live with me for a long time

7
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:09,839
Thank you

8
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,843
I don't have good luck with my husband, but luckily I have good luck with my friends.

9
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,932
How can you say that?

10
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,767
Min Hwan is a very good husband

11
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,980
- That guy has another woman
-What?

12
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:29,024
He sent me messages saying he loved me and missed me

13
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,069
Then deleted it immediately

14
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,072
It must have been sent to the wrong person.

15
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,326
Don't be so sensitive

16
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:50,754
Do you want me to go talk to Min-hwan?

17
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,050
No need, I have you and that's enough for me

18
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,721
I only have you.

19
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,851
Just think positively, okay? My significant other

20
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:11,233
Ms. Jiang Zhiyuan, it's time to go to the injection room

21
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,614
This time the medicine doesn't hurt at all

22
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,657
You'll feel better after the fight.

23
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:22,453
Don't give up, never

26
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,863
I can't remember the last time
When do you feel happy?

27
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,282
Why do I miss you so much?

28
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,995
If we hurry, there are only six months left.

29
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,706
If a miracle happens, there are still 12 months left.

30
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,378
There will be no next time now.

31
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,435
Thank you for your hard work. You look beautiful today.

32
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,358
You are really beautiful

33
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,112
The wedding dress I picked for you is really suitable

34
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:49,164
Forget it, now you are married into the Park family

35
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,374
You are my daughter.

36
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,586
A distressing little thing

37
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,340
It's not your fault that you don't have a tutor.

38
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,927
Now, mom, let me teach you

39
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,431
Poor little thing

40
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:14,857
Our Min-hwan is the only son of the third generation of the Jinhae Park family.

41
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,025
Three generations of only son

42
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,068
How dare you cut off our family line?

43
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,319
sorry

44
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:24,241
I took in your useless thing.
Why can’t I have children?

45
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:28,203
What exactly can you do?

46
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:33,083
-Mom, please bear with it.
-Let me go

47
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,047
What a waste, sit down, why are you so angry?

48
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,007
(Duga Holdings)

49
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,010
What? You quit?

50
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,095
I want to invest in stocks

51
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,097
You remember Roy Gentar back then?

52
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:51,143
A few more bucks can turn your life around

53
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,063
I can't earn anything I can in order to work in a company.

54
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,273
This won't work.

55
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,400
We have to pay so much loan every month

56
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,152
Shouldn't you at least discuss this with me first?

57
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,404
Hey, are you kidding me?

58
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,699
Why should I discuss my affairs with you?

59
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,660
Mother

60
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:12,581
Mom, will I be successful? Will I make a lot of money?

61
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:16,418
Of course, my son is good at everything.

62
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,505
Is there something going on at home? Is it just you who has a family?

63
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,840
Everyone here has a family.

64
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:24,927
No wonder people say married women shouldn't work

65
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,764
What are you doing

66
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,766
sorry

67
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,087
You said you would fix the door lock today

68
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,131
I'm not playing

69
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,885
You think you work overtime every day?

70
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,971
Does it look like you are good at doing things?

71
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,558
That's because you're bad at work.
I'll be so busy that I'll be dizzy

72
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,143
You need to be self-aware

73
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,311
Didn't you hear the washing machine?

74
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,604
I put the clothes down to wash

75
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,731
- You should at least take out the laundry...
-hateful

76

Hello!

77
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,944
I've been working all day and I've just sat down

78
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,779

The situation is not optimistic

81
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,511
So pitiful, what should I do?

82
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,430
My son

83
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,975
Why marry that kind of person?

84
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,478
So I can't recognize people clearly.

85
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:03,275
Now things are finally on track.
How could I be so unlucky?

86
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,903
Mom, Kang Ji-won has cancer

87
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,362
Who's going to cook for me?

88
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,325
Are you too kind?
Why worry about such a thing?

89
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,203
People need to work to overcome illness

90
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,206
Technology is so advanced now, nothing will happen.

91
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,625
Isn’t it?

92
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,378
Don't even think about telling the company, just work until you can't go anymore

93
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,133
Don't be so emotional over there, saying you are sick.

94
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,384
That's asking for trouble.

95
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,304
Can't we just cut it off?

96
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,224
Technology is advanced, nothing will happen.

97
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,268

Don't mind your husband having an affair.

101

I'm older, it's better to not have a husband

102
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,674
If you are not feeling well, stop thinking about bad things.

103
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,053
Don’t you have a good friend?

104
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,846
She is so pretty and kind

105
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:22,521
Yes, I have a good friend.

106
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,292
She is smart and capable

107
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,128
I am the section chief of U&K.

108
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,298

I haven't even calculated how much money I make to support my family.

128
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,168

141
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,010
That's not a bad word.

142
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,930
There's no benefit in living

143
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,890

149

So…

151
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:55,752
I wouldn't be unable to pay my medical bills and end up in debt.

Just think of it as your dad giving you pocket money.
Keep it as a souvenir.

167
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,350
Then you will immediately become lively

168

Then invest the rest of the money in stocks
I plan to buy you a better bag

184
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,953
It's so kind of you

185
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,789
When Ji-won dies, we'll buy a house.

186
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,374
Buying a house is good

187
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,460
But that woman lasted longer than I expected.

188
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:51,256
I'm just afraid that she will do this, even if she is insured
I didn't ask her to see a doctor.

189
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,301
She's pretty tenacious.

190
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:02,475
Do you want me to take her out for some fresh air?
Push her secretly?

191
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,230
No, what if you fall down too?

192
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,566
How can it not work? I just need to push it gently.

193
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,818
No one will find out

194
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:15,363
What on earth did she eat to make her so tenacious?

195
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,490
Then you should eat with her.

196
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,910
I am strong without eating.

197
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,050
You two crazy people!

198
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,306
Ji Won

199
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,099
Honey, are you okay?

200
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,475
Spit it out

201
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,066
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine

202
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,987
You're committing insurance fraud.

203
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,198
I want to report you

204
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,617
Hello!

205
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,868
What are you doing?

206
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,662
Honey, are you okay?

207
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,205
-I'm fine
-Are you really okay?

208
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,290
-Um
-good

209
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,168
If you leave me, I won't forgive you

211
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:29,437
I'm going to kill both of you today.

212

I'm going to kill both of you!

213
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,359
Hello, Hello, Hello

214
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,194
Have you had enough?

215
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,113
Don’t you feel bored?

216
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,282
Ouch

217

218
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,169
Hello

219
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,882
What else can you do now?

220
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,512
Let's go

221
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,055
Get out of the way

222
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,687
Hello!

223
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:21,781
You really are

224
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,199

226
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:44,512
sorry

227
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,310
sorry?

228
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,146
It's done.

229
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,029
What can I do now?

230
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,281
The living must continue to live

231
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,743
You're going to die anyway.

232
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,828
Why do you always think only of yourself?

233
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:25,928
You really have it.

234
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,479
Won't you die?

235
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,440
Do you think you won't die?

236
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,609
- You will die too
-That's enough!

237
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,402
- Really
-Stop fighting!

238
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,488
Honey!

239
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:44,447
Hello

240
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,992
If you want to die, just die obediently, get out of here!

241
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,814
The happiness I desire is out of reach

242
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,567
And the familiar misfortune is right in front of us

243
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:34,372
Honey

244
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,749
She seems dead

245
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,002
She'll die anyway.

246
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,754
Does it matter how you die?

247
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:42,964
What should we do?

248
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,090
You be quiet

249
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:47,844
Anyway, she is a cancer patient and often faints.

250
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,262
She slipped herself

251
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,889
We are only seeing it now
I don't know what happened

252
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,642
Will we not be able to receive the insurance money in this case?

253
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:55,810
-Will it?
-what to do?

254
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,271
In short, six months

255
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,606
If a miracle happens, 12 months

256
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:05,069
I won't live as long as the doctor said.

257
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,073
I am dead

00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:12,285
(April 12, 2023)

259
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,343
Honey, what are you doing?

260
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:34,932
Why do you look so distraught?

261
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,520
Why are you holding your glasses in your hand instead of putting them on?

262
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,454
Have you been to the doctor?

263
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,207
What did the doctor say?

264
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,679
Honey, what happened to you? It hurts.

265
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,139

266
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,858

What's going on?

278

I don't know

279

287

Come out, let's go eat something

366
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,137
Ji-won, what's wrong with you?

367
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:46,890
You haven't answered the phone since you rushed out of the company

368
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:48,767
I'm worried about you

369
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,560
I'm on my way to your house

370
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,896
I'm not feeling well

371
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,148
Don't come over. I'm with Min-hwan now.

372
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,656
Oh no

373
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:11,581
Hello, Hello, Hello

374
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,335
You are really ignorant.

375
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:19,631
Okay, you have mixed feelings, that's okay.

376
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:22,467
Although I don't quite understand

377
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,636
But other girls say that, okay, I know

378
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,763
I see

379
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,974
But why do you want to work in the company?
Is it so obvious?

380
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:30,642
Isn’t this quite right?

381
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:34,229
What good will it do you to make things difficult for me?

382
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,025
Can you explain it so that I can understand?

383
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:47,743
When exactly is it?

384
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:51,121
We haven't done it recently.

385
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,456
How did you get pregnant?

386
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,626
Is that my child?

387
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,130
What?

388
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,007
Didn't you say you seemed pregnant?

389
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,135
I remember

390
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:08,930
Because I can't eat these days.
So I thought I was pregnant

391
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:11,349
It's actually stress gastritis

392
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,185
Did it start from this time?

393
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,855
Not only does it keep putting pressure on me until I die

394
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,857
And I fucked with my friend

395
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:23,528
I'm kidding.

396
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,990
You don't have the ability to do anything with other men

397
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,243
Don't misunderstand me

398
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,663
I'm just saying you're not young anymore.

399
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:37,334
If you stop now
I can't work anymore.

400
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,753
That's a career interruption.

401
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,379
You love your work and you know how to do it

402
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:44,466
I don't want to become a yellow-faced woman, staying at home all day.

403
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,759
If you were to have a baby now

404
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:49,387
It's like cutting
The wings of the birds flying outside

405
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,975
If I didn't know you would quit your job and stay at home to rely on me

406
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,852
What you said seems to make sense.

407
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,105
Take it away

408
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:00,732
Surgery fee...

409
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:03,485
good

410
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:05,904
I pay half

411
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:09,533
-half?
- You're going to take it off anyway

412
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,868
Wouldn’t it be better for your health if you removed it early?

413
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:13,370
And I don't want kids

414
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:15,997
There is no benefit in raising children in this era

415
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,835
Our Min-hwan is the only son of the third generation of the Jinhae Park family.

416
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,920
How dare you cut off our family line?

417
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:34,766
I am not pregnant

418
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,061
It is gastritis

419
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,276
You are not pregnant?

420
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,238
Gastritis? It turns out it's gastritis.

421
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,452
Then why are you so sensitive?

422
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,624
Let's break up

423
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,335
-What?
-You have nothing to say?

424
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,681
Are you done?

425
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:19,477
You went crazy on me at work today
I thought you were pregnant, trying to understand you

426
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,062
But you said you want to break up?

427
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,189
Let me go

428
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:23,565
You guy

429
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,028
Hey, did I say something wrong?

430
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,863
Why are you mad at me?

431
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,448
-I forgot
-Are you crazy?

432
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:32,866
Park Min-hwan is a madman

433
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,326
It doesn't matter if I die

434
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,870
But you can't stand me saying I want to break up

435
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,998
Let me go.

436
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,834
Why do you want to break up with me? Why do you?

437
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:44,252
I'm going to kill you

438
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:47,005
Tell me, what right do you have? Why?

439
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:51,968
You say it

440
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:54,304
Do you think you can break up with me?

441
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,764
Why do you tell me you want to break up?

442
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,474
Tell me, why?

443
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,559
Tell me what you say!

444
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,647
Is anyone there? Help!

445
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,737
Help!

446
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,531
Please save me!

447
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:16,534
Miss

448
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:20,121
You can't call the police just because a couple quarrels.

449
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,374
It's not a couple's quarrel. He just said to me...

450
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,708
I know, I know very well

451
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,044
But most of the girls who call the police

452
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,588
Afterwards, I always ask why I did that to my boyfriend.

453
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:30,465
How helpless would we be then?

454
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,383
Mr. Police

455
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:34,594
Girls are always extra sensitive for a few days.

456
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,888
I apologize for her

457
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,474
You weren't interrupted anywhere.

458
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:42,394
I see your boyfriend is an employee of a large company

459
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:47,065
You can't just come to the police station because you're angry...

460
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:47,983
gentlemen

461
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,361
Is this the place where I need to break off to get here?

462
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:54,114
never mind

463
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,157
Can you at least take me home today?

464
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:09,045
This can't go on any longer.

465
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:16,553
(Balance: 718,916 KRW)

466
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,097
What to do?

467
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,266
(Balance: 718,916 KRW
Payee: Park Min-hwan)

468
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,560
At this time, I was already afraid of breaking up

469
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,395
Do everything according to his wishes.

470
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:28,023
I have given him a lot of money.

471
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,275
He also used the cash advance feature on my credit card

472
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:32,902
what to do?

473
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:34,112
Can't think of a solution

474
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,281
I have already received my retirement benefits.

475
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:39,034
I want to escape with 700,000 won

476
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,368
Can't even last a month

477
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:45,165
I'm sorry for yelling at you just now.

478
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,542
-But you're also very wrong
-What?

479
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,336
I really meant what I said just now.

480
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:51,087
So I plan to make a lot of money from the stock this time

481
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:53,006
I'm going to buy you a bag.

482
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,300
I got a tip that Roy Gentar was going to buy

483
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,177
madman

484
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,554
If this one goes up, we'll get married.

485
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:09,147
I want to invest in stocks
You remember Roy Gental back then, right?

486
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:10,315
Roy Gental?

487
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:13,610
Roy Gental?

488
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,362
How could I not have thought of that?

489
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:18,656
Roy Gental

490
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,867
The only successful thing in Park Min-hwan's life

491
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:23,244
I figured out a way.

492
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:27,248
Let's use this to get through this stage first.

493
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,459
Although I can't remember

494
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,960
Everything that has happened since 2013

495
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,634
But I know exactly what will succeed

496
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:38,843
Give it a try

497
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,390
This time I really want to live a good life

498
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,686
(Scanning progress)

499
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:56,653
You see

500
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:59,239
It is not necessary to take a photo

501
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:00,657
It's just gastritis

502
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,992
It's a little serious. You need to take medicine properly.

503
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:04,285
Don't be stressed

504
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,205
good

505
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,881
very good

506
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,467
I want to maintain my current health

507
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,972
(“If you want to quit your job, please read this book”)

508
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,205
(“If you want to quit your job, please read this book”)

509
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:53,835
minister

510
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,880
“There’s nothing wrong with retiring on stocks”

511
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,798
"You want to be a salaried worker until the end of your life?"

512
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:00,675
"If you want to quit your job, please read this book"

513
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:05,472
Are you planning to quit your job?

514
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:07,724
No

515
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,483
Is this

516
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:19,152
The injury you got yesterday?

517
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:22,030
Sorry, I didn't notice, what should I do?

518
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,493
If you feel sorry, buy me a meal.

519
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,077
I like to eat soup rice

520
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:42,884
What's wrong?

521
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:45,720
What?

522
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,973
You said you wanted to come to Tang Restaurant

523
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:52,227
I didn't expect it to be this kind of place

524
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:54,187
Are there any other kinds of soup restaurants?

525
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,775
No

526
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:01,861
I've never talked to him before, so I didn't notice.

527
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:04,489
He is very...

528
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:05,698
Thanks

529
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:08,743
Feels like a rich young master

530
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,704
Please use it

531
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:26,177
How about it?

532
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:33,685
Much better than I thought

533
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,855
You haven't eaten yet?

534
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,482
What are you doing?

535
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,905
I mean soup rice

536
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:51,411
Thanks

537
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:57,584
So he is this kind of person?

538
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:01,546
He is more handsome and considerate than I remembered, and...

539
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,008
Have you been to the doctor?

540
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:07,176
Yes, I just went to see it.

541
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,178
On the way back, I stopped by the bookstore.

542
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:13,600
Thank you so much for yesterday

543
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,978
You take me home

544
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,606
I also bought cup noodles and chamomile...

545
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,441
You feel very different from usual.

546
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:24,444
Do I have it?

547
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:26,738
Do you really want to quit your job?

548
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:31,367
I'm actually considering

549
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,746
I feel like I can't go on like this anymore

550
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:39,667
I feel like it's time to make some changes.

551
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,087
-Are you getting married?
-What?

552
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,674
Because you also bought the interior decoration book
I guess you might be planning to get married.

553
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:48,092
("Follow the experts to do interior decoration")

554
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:49,761
Oh, this is...

555
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:53,890
Indeed, this year I started preparing
Marry Park Min-hwan

556
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,479
I am also considering getting married

557
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,023
I would rather die than get married.

558
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:11,199
actually…

559
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,954
(Other half)

560
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:37,850
It doesn't matter

561
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,107
My dear Zhiyuan, please reply immediately when you see this

562
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:50,029
Why doesn't she answer the phone?

563
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:52,323
She caused such a commotion in the company yesterday

564
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,544
I only have you, Jiwon

565
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,926
Where is she and what is she doing?
Why don't you answer the phone?

566
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,314
The scars are exactly the same

567
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,074
sorry

568
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:38,870
I see you seem badly injured.

569
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:42,623
No

570
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:47,712
let's go

571
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:49,756
good

572
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:55,887
Thank you for the treat

573
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,138
Now you don't owe me anything.

574
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:58,931
One meal is enough

575
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:01,809
OK

576
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:04,979
besides

577
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,526
You are a very capable person.

578
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:13,863
Although marriage is good, family is also important

579
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:15,823
But it's a shame you left.

580
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:19,452
As a boss, I think so

581
00:51:27,335 --> 00:51:28,336
Thanks

582
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,465
Then I'll take my leave first.

583
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,634
good

584
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:59,534
(Work, instant meal kits, skyrocketing stocks)

585
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,160
(quick cooking meal package)

586
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,712
You are a very capable person.

587
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:13,798
(Chamomile tea)

588
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:18,094
Because he always had a stern face before.
I'm afraid of him.

589
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:21,222
I didn't expect him to be such a nice guy.

590
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:25,852
How does he know that I am capable?

591
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:29,730
I forgot all

592
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:34,151
I am good at doing things

593
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:37,071
I have a lot of things I want to do in the company.

594
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:40,366
Things that no longer belong to me after marriage

595
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:44,245
Since I can't be stronger than Park Min-hwan
So the things that have never been fought for

596
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,539
What Kang Ji-won wants to do

597
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:57,717
(Kang Ji-won)

598
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,220
She really is

599
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:02,930
It makes me unhappy again

600
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,864
Why should I suffer like this for Park Min-hwan?

601
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,212
Let's start working quickly.

602
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:38,299
Ten minutes before work
You should be ready to start working.

603
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:39,717
I see it all

604
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,802
Work hard, you know?

605
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:44,347
Kang Ji-won

606
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:48,434
Kang Ji-won

607
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:03,240
(Roy Gental)

608
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,327
(Quantity: Full amount)

609
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:09,538
(Cash purchase)

610
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:11,999
(Are you sure you want to buy?)

611
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:14,251
Oh my god, it's up again.

612
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,087
How much will it increase?

613
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:18,881
Ji Won

614
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:28,516
I thought you were going to call me last night

615
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:32,853
What were you doing yesterday?

616
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,275
Me yesterday?

617
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,278
Do you know the MODU community?

618
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:45,032
I'm looking at that website.
Marriage, husband's family, wife's family

619
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:46,367
I forgot the time when I saw it.

620
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:49,578
So that's it

621
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:54,792
There is a girl who is in the terminal stage of cancer

622
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,963
She saw her husband having sex with her bestie

623
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:03,050
Oh my god, really? That's crazy.

624
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:05,428
Crazy, right?

625
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:10,307
I think her bestie is more disgusting than her husband.

626
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,810
How could she do this to her best friend?

627
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:14,562
That is to say

628
00:55:17,273 --> 00:55:20,401
She probably meant that her best friend would die anyway.
So it doesn't matter.

629
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:29,660
If I die, you can take everything I have.

630
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:31,787
But if you die, I will die with you

631
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:38,961
-Kang Ji-won
-exist!

632
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:52,266
When will your runaway brain come back?

633
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:57,021
Is my proposal that bad?

634
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,440
Is it bad?

635
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:02,568
It's too good to say that this is bad.

636
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,361
The whole mess

637
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:10,576
(Proposal for quick-cooking meal kits in the one-person household era)

638
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:15,414
This proposal was rejected at this time.

639
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:16,957
However

640
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:21,128
Zheng Xiumin handed over the proposal without changing a word
But the section chief praised it and implemented it.

641
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:22,213
Ji Won

642
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:25,800
This is really good.

643
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:29,053
How about I make some minor revisions and submit it again?

644
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:33,349
Zheng Xiumin thus became a full-time employee and was promoted step by step

645
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:35,851
Is this reasonable?

646
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:37,561
One-person household? Homemade meal kits?

647
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,897
Living alone, who can cook for themselves?

648
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,942
It's troublesome to fill water and turn on the fire.

649
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:46,028
But you want to vacuum pack the green onions?

650
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:47,988
Freeze dried squid?

651
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:51,492
It takes until midnight just to unpack the packages one by one.

652
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:53,327
Do you think this makes sense?

653
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,831
The development team will definitely say
"Be yourself and do it"

654
00:56:58,207 --> 00:57:00,459
-What should I do then?
- Section Chief Kim Kyung-wook

655
00:57:00,543 --> 00:57:02,878
He is a rude and incompetent scoundrel.

656
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:04,547
He's also a relationship expert.

657
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,132
Who is that?

658
00:57:06,215 --> 00:57:08,926
He has a connection with a very famous high-ranking person.

659
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:10,219
Who am I talking to now?

660
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:12,847
Agent Jiang

661
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,598
what's on your mind?

662
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:19,270
Please tell me if there is anything wrong, I will modify it immediately

663
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:23,065
Women have this problem, they are so dependent

664
00:57:23,149 --> 00:57:25,484
Do your own thing

665
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:29,071
When you come to work
We should also consider other people's eyes.

666
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:31,448
How can a girl dress like this?

667
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:34,702
Agent Yang is a married woman.

668
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,036
You are still a lady.

669
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,664
How can we men survive like this?

670
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:41,709
This is all because women didn't join the army

671
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:45,337
Our country should also allow women to serve in the military

672
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:46,881
Right? Agent Park

673
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:48,799
Yes, that's right, I will push it forward

674
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:50,384
Right?

675
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,303
You do it again

676
00:58:17,036 --> 00:58:20,581
Although she is Jin Jingxu's right-hand man
So we hardly talked.

677
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,958
But she's a very capable person.

678
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:26,795
Because Jin Jingxu blocked her promotion
She was just a permanent agent until she left.

679
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:30,090
But as usual
She is more than qualified to be a section chief now.

680
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:33,886
-that…
-Agent Yang

681
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:36,680
Section Chief Jin is looking for you

682
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,017
Very good

683
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:28,857
- Let's talk
- I have nothing to say

684
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:29,942
I have…

685
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:32,444
hateful

686
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:43,831
Oh my god

687
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:46,250
careful

688
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,836
Are you okay? You suddenly ran out

689
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,130
What's going on? Just now it seemed...

690
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:52,965
I'm fine, I'm sorry.

691
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,550
sorry

692
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:10,357
I'm sure I feel the same

693
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:14,403
And it's the same place

694
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:18,032
No

695
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,492
This is impossible, what am I thinking?

696
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:24,872
Hello

697
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,082
Hello

698
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:29,752
Hello, Kang Ji-won, hey!

699
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:31,879
Hello, Kang Ji-won

700
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:36,550
How are you?

701
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,312
I was still injured after all

702
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:50,606
Injury in the same area

703
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,235
Although I avoided it, I still couldn't avoid it

704
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:02,117
Then I won't...

705
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:09,917
don't want

706
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:14,129
But my scars are gone.

707
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:18,592
I used to be afraid that I was pregnant and I was shaking with worry.

708
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,637
I knocked over the coffee pot and got burned.

709
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:25,140
What does this mean? I should be able to figure it out.

710
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:45,494
(Marketing Team 1, Park Min-hwan

711
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:58,298

01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,017
You sold Roy Gental?

Let's Talk

716
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:12,563
Are you ignoring me?

717
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:14,440
What kind of demeanor is this?

718
01:02:15,983 --> 01:02:19,319
Hey, I sold my stock.

719
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,988
To pay you back

720
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:22,614
I have transferred the money to you, please confirm it

721
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:24,741
If TKU Technology surges

722
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:27,244
I will make more money, so I don't regret it.

723
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,080
But you have to remember that I sold the skyrocketing stocks for you

724
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:33,000
You are that kind of person

725

727
01:02:39,298 --> 01:02:42,593
Even I, who don’t know much about stocks, know about TKU Technology

728
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,470
It is a famous hype stock.

729
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:47,014
After the company boss hyped up the stock

730
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:48,765
Flee abroad, stocks are delisted

731
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:50,642
He actually sold Roy Gental, which was skyrocketing

732
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:52,436
Bought TKU which will plummet?

733
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:55,063
Because I bought Roy Gental

734
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:56,857
So Park Min-hwan sold it

735
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:59,568
Marketing team came to the meeting

736
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:03,030
Remember to bring your new product survey information

737
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:04,615
good

738
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:24,301
Oh my god, it's up again.

739
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,470
Hey, I sold my stock.

740
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,440
What is supposed to happen will eventually happen

741
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:48,408
How is your injury?

742
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:54,831
But just let it happen.
No matter who it happens to

743
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:56,583
You're always getting hurt and that makes me worried.

744
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:58,919
I almost had a heart attack.

745
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,838
Are you listening to me?

746
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:11,056
Xiumin

747
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,520
I have trash to throw away

748
01:04:17,396 --> 01:04:18,730
Can you help me throw it away?

749
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:21,567
What are you talking about?

750
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:24,486
Please

751
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:27,030
You are my other half

752
01:04:30,242 --> 01:04:31,535
Okay

753
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,996
You're going to date me this weekend.

754
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:39,751
I found a delicious barbecue restaurant.
Guse Pavilion

755
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,178
OK, let's go

756
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,102
As long as you help me take out the trash

757
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:00,564
good

758
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,653
Agent Jiang Zhiyuan, clerk Zheng Xiumin, please come over quickly

759
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:08,155
good

760
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:26,798
You covet my garbage

761
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:35,932
Then you handle it.

762
01:05:42,356 --> 01:05:44,316
Marry my husband.

763
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:03,168
I need someone to steal my destiny

764
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:06,463
If anyone stole my destiny, it should be you

765
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,298
Kang Ji-won is so boring

766
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:09,341
So annoying

767
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:11,134
It's not that I don't know

768
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:13,470
As long as it doesn't suit your taste, you will be scheming

769
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,263
Because you are very capable, Agent Park

770
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:17,974
What perfume do you use?

771
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:18,934
You're dead today.

772
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:20,936
You two love each other to death

773
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:22,479
I will help you get results quickly.

774
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:24,398
Do you have any dates this weekend?

775
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:25,524
You are the priority

776
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:27,442
Just remember that you owe me a favor.

777
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:31,071
You are here because of Liu Zhihe
Are you saying you want to break up with me? That crazy old man

778
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,448
I won't be bullied anymore.

779
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,082
