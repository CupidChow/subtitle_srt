JUNGRIMCHEON BEWARE OF RAPIDS

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,510
Your necklace.

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,840
It's really pretty.

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,970
Let's go.

5
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,860
The flag is just down here.

6
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,650
Flag one.

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,900
What?

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,450
- What's that?
- What?

9
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,000
I think someone already got it.

10
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,600
Goodness.

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,650
You're incredible.

12
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,560
I wondered who'd
dare go in there.

13
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,820
It was you?

14
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,240
You're incredible.

15
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,820
I want to be solid land.

16
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,620
- Hui-yeon.
- Yeah?

17
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,790
What does it mean when
someone wants to be land?

18
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,250
Like when asked what you want
to become or do in the future.

19
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,550
Maybe they meant lamb?

20
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,760
Oh, man. Now I'm hungry.

21
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,260
Maybe it was something else.

22
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,890
Who said it? You
should just ask them.

23
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,810
Well...

24
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,150
It's hard to ask them.

25
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,940
Is it Mr. Park?

26
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,360
You shouldn't be like that.

27
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:59,910
My husband said things I never
understood, and I couldn't ask him too.

28
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,910
Especially between lovers,

29
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,750
you should share future
goals or bucket lists!

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,250
You won the camper today.

31
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,130
Sneak him into your
car and ask him.

32
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,760
What are you saying? So dirty!

33
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,090
Married women are so...

34
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,970
<i>I can't do that.</i>

35
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,140
<i>Min-hwan can't be
with me tonight.</i>

36
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,730
<i>In the past, I got number four
which was the single tent,</i>

37
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,070
<i>and Su-min got number
one, the camper.</i>

38
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,030
<i>And that night...</i>

39
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,870
Hey, I can't sleep
in a sleeping bag.

40
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,990
Let's go sleep somewhere else.

41
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,540
<i>We left and came back at dawn.</i>

42
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,410
I'll die if I sleep here.

43
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,080
<i>We drank so we were
overheated. It was horrifying.</i>

44
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,590
Hey.

45
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,260
- Hey!
<i>- If I'm in the camper,</i>

46
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,010
<i>Su-min will be in
the single tent.</i>

47
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,850
<i>If so...</i>

48
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,770
Today could be D-Day.

49
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,850
What?

50
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,310
Nothing.

51
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,940
I should go out.

52
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,490
You're going out again?

53
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,360
You found the number
one. Just rest.

54
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,410
We still have time. I
have to follow the rules.

55
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,540
Goodness.

56
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,200
She's so inflexible.

57
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,630
That was dangerous and reckless.

58
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,600
I know I won't
die from drowning.

59
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,640
What scares me the most

60
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,230
is living the same life as
before with this second chance.

61
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,610
In order to not do
that, I can do anything.

62
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,840
So since you have
the number one flag,

63
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,130
has fate changed?

64
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,050
Or is there a chance that Su-min will
take it before you sleep in the camper?

65
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,220
I don't know.

66
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,140
Then...

67
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,520
But there's one
thing that's certain.

68
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,400
Park Min-hwan borrowed
money from me,

69
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,150
and he bought a necklace
before coming here.

70
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,070
He's simple-minded.

71
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,280
It's his killer move to
get into a woman's pants.

72
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,450
I got it too.

73
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,960
It's so pretty, babe.

74
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,500
It's nothing much.

75
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,630
Are you saying he bought
the same necklace?

76
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,220
No, it's a bit
different. This one...

77
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,100
It looked quite expensive.

78
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,850
I must've been easier to him.

79
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,730
It's okay.

80
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,650
I'm doing all this to
escape someone like him.

81
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,780
I'll only take what's good.

82
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,910
You should.

83
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,290
That's how you'll
make today D-Day?

84
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,080
Yes. First, I'll make sure
Su-min gets number four.

85
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,340
Then I'll get Min-hwan wasted.

86
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,010
Okay, I'll be rooting for you.

87
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,300
As much as I can.

88
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,470
Okay, I'll root for...

89
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,520
By the way, what did you say
you wanted to be earlier?

90
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,230
Lamb? Lamp?

91
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,520
What was it? Or maybe champ?

92
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,440
Was that it?

93
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,240
Not me! Get someone else!

94
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,070
Can't you get someone else?

95
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,570
Someone else!

96
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,870
You're out.

97
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,550
Who the heck has number one?

98
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,760
No one here would
go in the water.

99
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,180
Except for Ji-won.

100
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,650
I've never had nice things before,
so protecting this is so hard.

101
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,850
Sorry, Ji-won!

102
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,770
Let go!

103
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,280
You scared me!

104
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,700
My bracelet's stuck!

105
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,950
Be still. Don't move.

106
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,620
That hurts!

107
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,670
Are you mad?

108
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,420
This is just a game.

109
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,930
And this wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't tried to get me.

110
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,750
What's wrong with me?

111
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,630
Why am I worried?

112
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,620
Ji-won, you're out!

113
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,920
I knew you'd come back.

114
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,130
Did you really go
into the water?

115
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,800
So this is why you
impress everyone.

116
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,600
Find someone who's glamping.

117
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,220
Thanks for this.

118
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,980
Hello, everyone.

119
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,900
I hope you're having fun.

120
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,780
Anyway, I didn't know you'd all
participate so enthusiastically.

121
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,070
You're all so great.

122
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,820
Now,

123
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,160
which female employee will
get to sleep in the camper?

124
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,950
Number one, come out!

125
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,900
BASED ON THE NAVER SERIES WEBNOVEL
<i>MARRY MY HUSBAND</i> BY SUNGSOJAK

126
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,720
Who is it?

127
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,810
What? Really?

128
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,900
It's me!

129
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,030
Please come forward.

130
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,290
I'll give you the
key to your camper!

131
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,120
Congratulations!

132
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,670
Find someone who's glamping.

133
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,250
Thanks for this!

134
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,730
Isn't sleeping in a camper
better than glamping?

135
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,730
The camper is right
in front of me,

136
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,360
so why would I
consider glamping?

137
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,130
Congratulations, Ms. Kang
Ji-won from Marketing Team 1!

138
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,590
Let's give her a
round of applause!

139
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,260
Congratulations!

140
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,680
Next, let's see which male
employee won the camper.

141
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,810
Who found the number one flag?

142
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,770
Please come to the front!

143
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,900
Come on up!

144
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,950
Happy you beat me?

145
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,620
You know I can't
just sleep anywhere.

146
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,420
Same goes for me.

147
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,090
Really?

148
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,970
Then why did I think you could
sleep just about anywhere?

149
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,470
Because I did so for you.

150
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
What?

151
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,140
Nothing, I'm going.

152
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,530
Why are you like this to me?

153
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,570
What do you mean?

154
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,110
You won't let me win.

155
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,330
How much longer will
you keep this up?

156
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,500
I feel like I've become
a bad person now.

157
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,420
You're too harsh to me lately.

158
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,350
I don't...

159
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,440
like you anymore.

160
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,820
I tried not to show it, but
I failed. I'll just tell you.

161
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,570
I just started to hate you.

162
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,820
You whine and try to act cute.

163
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,580
You think my things are
yours. It's annoying.

164
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,160
You yielded them to me!

165
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,340
Is it bad I took
that for granted?

166
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,880
You made me this way. What
am I supposed to do now?

167
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,300
You're right. I always yielded

168
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,180
and let you whine.

169
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,430
So I'm going to stop now.

170
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,980
I'm marrying Min-hwan.

171
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,980
I'll start a new family.

172
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,610
I can't be tied to you forever.

173
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,290
Thanks for bringing
it up first. Bye.

174
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,140
I feel like a bad person.

175
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,980
She's the one that was wrong.

176
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,360
She's the bad one. I only
said what I should say, but...

177
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,770
You're just too good.

178
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,530
You're not bad enough
to hurt others.

179
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,250
But I know better than anyone.

180
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,920
You did what you had to.

181
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,140
Good job.

182
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,820
<i>Su-min must want to punish me.</i>

183
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,580
<i>If she thinks I'm being like
this because of Min-hwan,</i>

184
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,790
<i>it's obvious how she'll
try to punish me.</i>

185
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,330
- I can't drink anymore.
- What? You have to finish your shot.

186
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,420
- Gosh, I...
- Drink it.

187
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,620
What are you doing here?

188
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,880
Shall we talk?

189
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,100
How did you know
that I wanted...

190
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,900
to talk to you?

191
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,530
I can tell by your face.

192
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,120
Did you drink a lot?

193
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,080
Do you have a lot on your mind?

194
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,920
Just a little.

195
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,670
I feel uneasy.

196
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,720
Just a little.

197
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,530
Do you want...

198
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,070
to sleep with me?

199
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,120
Will it change anything?

200
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,250
You're Ji-won's boyfriend,
and I'm her other half.

201
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,550
Is it the alcohol?

202
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,720
I only care about
who's in front of me.

203
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,780
Me too.

204
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,790
I drank a lot.

205
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,400
I only need you too.

206
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,450
Maybe I'll push
her off somewhere.

207
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,500
You can't check your wounds

208
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,880
or your opponent's on the mat.

209
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,090
Focus only on two things.

210
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,840
"I decided to fight."

211
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,470
"And I will win."

212
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,730
I decided to fight.

213
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,740
And I will win...

214
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,860
The entire company is excited

215
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,740
about our marketing team lately!

216
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,790
Of course, since the
project's going so well.

217
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,750
We could go down in U&K
history at this rate!

218
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,830
I'm sorry, Hui-yeon.

219
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,170
Why would you be sorry?

220
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,460
The original sin
is with Mr. Kim.

221
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,130
And the boomer is Mr. Yu.

222
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,630
No wonder this is so fun!

223
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,220
Mr. Kim isn't here!

224
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,900
I hear aroused elks always
appear during workshops.

225
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,610
I finally get to see it!

226
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,020
Are you insane?

227
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,610
- What? I want to...
- Let's go.

228
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,110
Seriously! Just once!

229
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,110
No, let's go.

230
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,460
I think I found
Su-min so pretty.

231
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,250
When I first met her at 15,

232
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,380
I couldn't believe someone so
pretty and nice was my friend.

233
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,010
I was so proud. It was nice.

234
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,480
So I wanted to protect her.

235
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,650
And Min-hwan...

236
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,030
He was such a jerk.

237
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,120
But I needed someone
to trust and lean on.

238
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,410
And after we got married,

239
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,170
I put up with him even more.

240
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,590
Aren't I such a fool?

241
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,880
It's all over now.

242
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,850
Stop thinking about them.

243
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,430
Think about one thing today.

244
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,600
Kang Ji-won won.

245
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,570
I haven't...

246
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,330
had someone touch my
hand this affectionately

247
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,330
in a long time.

248
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Since I came back to 2013,

249
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,600
I've felt so lonely
since I was alone.

250
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,150
So I'm glad I have you.

251
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,650
Thank you.

252
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,030
To be honest,

253
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,410
my life is like a
well-written novel.

254
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,130
A life without any
worries or obstacles.

255
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,340
Just well-written.

256
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,430
So I'm glad I came back,

257
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,060
and I'm happy I get to
talk to you like this.

258
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,940
I should thank you.

259
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,790
You never keep it simple.

260
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,380
Is that so?

261
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,010
What did you say earlier?
What do you want to be?

262
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,510
I'll help you for
helping me too.

263
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,100
I told you, I don't want
anything from you in return.

264
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,020
I'm being honest,
but you're not.

265
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,980
Then I won't let you help me.

266
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,570
Let's say I said champ.

267
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,780
No, you didn't.

268
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,200
Are you lying?

269
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,780
It's true.

270
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,750
Ji-won.

271
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,430
Did you sleep well when your boyfriend
was sleeping in a sleeping bag?

272
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,850
You're so cold-hearted.

273
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,600
Did you really sleep there?

274
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,020
Where else, then?

275
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,440
My selfish girlfriend
slept in the camper.

276
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:31,230
Weren't you even worried your
boyfriend might be too cold overnight?

277
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,700
I was, so I went to you with hand
warmers, but you weren't there.

278
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,740
I guess I was in
the bathroom then.

279
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,000
Yes.

280
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,210
You could've just
left them there.

281
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,080
Where's your common sense?

282
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Where's Su-min?

283
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,880
How should I know
where your friend is?

284
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,390
Where did she sleep?

285
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,510
I don't know.

286
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,850
Something happened between us
yesterday, and it's uncomfortable.

287
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,770
Uncomfortable?

288
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,820
Did you fight?

289
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,110
Women are always fighting
and making up. Goodness.

290
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,790
What?

291
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,080
Let's go eat breakfast.

292
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,810
Su-min.

293
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,190
This isn't your tent.

294
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,980
Where were you last night?

295
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,150
I was drunk, so I slept over
there. I just left my stuff here.

296
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,490
Did you drink a lot too?

297
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,990
I was able to sober up a bit after
a walk with Hui-yeon last night.

298
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,740
I see.

299
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,540
Let's not tell Ji-won.

300
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
What?

301
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,300
It's not like she'll break up
with me. She'll only get hurt.

302
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,010
You're close friends.
It's unnecessary.

303
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,150
Let's just be realistic.

304
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:35,780
As you said, things are
too complicated between us.

305
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,910
Instead of rolling around
in a messy reality,

306
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,660
let's keep it as a
beautiful memory.

307
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,700
Is it too greedy of me?

308
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,500
Let's go eat.

309
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,960
I'm so hungover.

310
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,790
Okay.

311
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,050
Why can I never get the best?

312
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,140
What?

313
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,640
The workshop sucked.

314
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,770
I wanted to sleep in a
camper or a glamping tent.

315
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,900
You'll have other chances.

316
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,070
Failure is the
mother of success.

317
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,070
You're right.
Nothing's impossible.

318
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,080
This is so nice!

319
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,710
Babe!

320
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,670
Here.

321
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,300
I'm so hungry.

322
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,760
Let's see the food
over here first.

323
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,220
Babe, here. You like this.

324
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,150
Wow! It's been so long
since I had an orange!

325
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,320
Here's a melon!

326
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,860
Avocado! Wow!

327
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,490
Let's see.

328
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,120
Can this help digestion?

329
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,030
<i>I don't think it
went as expected.</i>

330
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,780
<i>I've been with Su-min for 26
years, and 17 years with Min-hwan.</i>

331
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,990
<i>I'm sure something happened.</i>

332
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,070
<i>Then...</i>

333
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:55,040
<i>When I felt something was off, all my
ex-boyfriends broke up with me right away.</i>

334
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,130
<i>Min-hwan was the first
to do it behind my back.</i>

335
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,340
<i>I thought it was
because of marriage.</i>

336
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,050
<i>But if Min-hwan is more of
a scumbag than I thought...</i>

337
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,690
<i>It means</i>

338
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,350
<i>it's not over yet.</i>

339
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,540
Why are you so full of energy?

340
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,040
I hit a homerun!

341
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,000
What? With your
girlfriend's friend?

342
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,380
Shut up!

343
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,550
Wow! Seriously?

344
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,850
But she's her best friend.

345
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,760
I'll tell you in one sentence.

346
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,730
Autumn was coming,

347
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,770
and the night air was sexy!

348
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,070
What the... Okay,
let's try again.

349
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:58,200
Can you handle the consequences?
You work in the same office.

350
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,840
OUT ON BUSINESS LOG

351
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,260
PARK MIN-HWAN, JEONG SU-MIN

352
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,180
ACTIVITIES: JOMART TASTING EVENT

353
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,260
What's this?

354
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,640
You're going to Jomart.

355
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,930
It'll be tiring.

356
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,020
Why me?

357
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,480
Shouldn't you go instead?

358
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,440
Right, you guys fought.

359
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,360
Don't talk nonsense. I
have a presentation today.

360
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,530
A presentation? The slides
must be all ready, right?

361
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,700
I'll do it.

362
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,700
Is there a problem?

363
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,710
No, not at all, sir.

364
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,670
Mr. Park, shall we go?

365
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,300
Yes.

366
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,270
I'll get going, Ms. Kang.

367
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,330
Su-min's so smart.

368
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,410
She's working so hard. I hope
she becomes a full-time employee.

369
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,920
<i>To my other half, Ji-won.</i>

370
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,470
<i>I'm sorry I didn't
know how you felt.</i>

371
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,510
<i>You're everything to me,</i>

372
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,350
<i>and I think it made me
blind to your feelings.</i>

373
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:45,440
<i>I just blindly
believed you loved me.</i>

374
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,690
<i>I didn't think about whether
I deserved your love.</i>

375
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:54,110
<i>So everything you said and
everything you feel towards me...</i>

376
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,700
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

377
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:02,580
<i>Still, can't you forgive me?</i>

378
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,830
<i>You're too precious to me.
I can't live without you.</i>

379
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,750
<i>I'm going to wait
until you feel better.</i>

380
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,630
<i>If I knock and you ever want to
reopen your closed heart to me,</i>

381
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,340
<i>will you smile as
if nothing happened?</i>

382
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,100
<i>You're my other half.</i>

383
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,430
<i>We can't just end
things like this.</i>

384
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,070
If I hadn't seen the end,

385
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,120
would I have been able

386
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,370
to not be swayed
after reading this?

387
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,550
She's a good writer.

388
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,430
Maybe she really means it.

389
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,790
- You're doing well. Hurry up.
- Yes, Chef.

390
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,860
I don't want to see you face.

391
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,780
I'm jealous.

392
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,040
My life is like a
well-written novel.

393
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,420
But if Kang Ji-won is the
one wrong sentence in it...

394
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,800
How would you feel?

395
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,840
Don't talk nonsense. Get up.

396
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,350
It's short and crooked.

397
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,190
The content and
writing is a mess too.

398
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,940
So it keeps catching my
eye and bothering me.

399
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,860
It opens to her
page when thrown.

400
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,410
There's nothing special to
find or remember in my life.

401
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,870
But only that part is so clear.

402
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,710
Nevertheless...

403
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,880
You're more qualified.

404
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,970
Because you'll be
alive after ten years.

00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,000
ALLERGEN LABELING

U&K FOOD UDAM'S

00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,990
The rosé goes there.
Make sure it's seen well.

TASTING EVENT

410
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,250
I'll try it.

411
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,260
What the hell?

412
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,730
It's so good. I
think it'll be a hit.

413
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,150
This is our new product,

414
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,440
so try and make people
taste all three products.

415
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,900
- Okay?
- Okay!

416
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,110
Also...

417
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,120
I'll get the allergy sign.

418
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,890
Let's do two groups.
Those who shop after work

419
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,050
and housewives.

420
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,180
We have to check
preference too. So...

421
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,390
I need to go pee.

422
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,560
Mr. Park!

423
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,310
Why haven't you started?

424
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,330
What are you doing?

425
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,580
Can you check this?

426
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,210
Yeah, sure.

427
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,840
What the...

428
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,300
What is this?

429
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,560
What do you think?

430
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:58,810
What?

431
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,650
We'll start the brief
on Chef's Table,

432
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:06,400
the meal kit project
set to launch next year.

433
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,400
CHEF AND MENU INTRODUCTION

434
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,320
The winner of <i>One Dinner,</i>

435
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,370
Lee Gwang-min's chicken dish
will be the pilot product.

436
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:19,160
Production will begin in the 1st quarter,
and it'll launch in the 2nd quarter.

437
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,540
Then we have Daniel
Kim, a traditional chef.

438
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:27,840
Along with Park Ji-ho who's popular
with those in their 20s and 30s...

439
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,890
Sir!

440
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,560
Well...

441
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,350
Thank you for trusting and
letting me take over this project.

442
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,030
Sure, you didn't trust me.

443
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:54,160
You just had no other choice
given the circumstances.

444
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,750
I'm sure that's why you suggested
it. Still, I was very thankful...

445
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,790
I just wanted to thank you...

446
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,960
That's not why.

447
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,970
I thought you would be
capable of doing it.

448
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,010
Pardon?

449
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,010
And finish your sentences.

450
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,680
Don't trail off
whenever you speak.

451
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,100
Just say, "Thank you."

452
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,480
Yes, sir.

453
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:32,650
And when you get both good and bad
feedback, remember the good one too.

454
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,110
Pardon?

455
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,780
I said you would be
capable of doing it.

456
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,540
Right.

457
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,000
Thank you.

458
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,170
Well, then.

00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,770
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

460
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,790

461
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,750
Wait.

462
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,250
What? Why?

463
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,210
What will you do?

464
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,630
What? You wanted to
do it! Let's do it!

465
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,090
What about us?

466
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,680
Are you toying with me?

467
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,480
I'll live with you both!

468
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,190
What?

469
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,270
Aren't you two like sisters?

470
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,070
In the old days, competent men
lived with sisters. It's nothing.

471
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,320
Damn it!

472
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,410
- Let go of me!
- Come on...

473
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:01,490
Just a second.

474
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,210
Excuse me.

475
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,800
I'm the one in charge.

476
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,260
What's wrong?

477
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,970
My husband's allergic
to pine nuts!

478
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:21,720
But there wasn't
any allergy sign!

479
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,430
- What?
- What do we do?

480
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:24,930
Honey.

481
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,520
I'll get the allergy sign.

482
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,560
ALLERGEN LABELING: PINE NUTS

483
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,730
He should go to the hospital.

484
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:43,160
You must've been so scared, and
it's impossible to make up for it,

485
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,450
but we apologize!

486
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,580
How could a big company like
U&K make such a mistake?

487
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,540
I just don't understand.

488
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:54,750
We're very sorry.

489
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:00,180
Let it go. Nothing happened.

490
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,890
Things like this can
happen while you work.

491
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,390
Yes, sir.

492
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,600
Since it's just us,
we'll let it go.

493
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,350
If my daughter were here...

494
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,350
We apologize one more time.

495
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,820
Toss the receipt.

496
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,000
The ambulance fees
and hospital bills.

497
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,830
But compensation too?

498
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:40,170
If he had such a dangerous allergy,
shouldn't he have been more careful?

499
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,840
Everyone likes money.

500
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:44,430
If the company finds
out about this,

501
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:46,430
it'll be bad for us.

502
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,810
Paying them off is the easiest.

503
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:55,480
Still, you spent so
much of your own money.

504
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,730
It's okay. It's me!

505
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,070
I've gotten a good
return on stocks.

506
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,610
<i>- The CEO of TKU,</i>
- So... What?

507
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,450
<i>Oh Chang-gyu, fled overseas,
and it's been revealed only now.</i>

508
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,700
<i>A political emergency
is happening.</i>

509
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:12,330
<i>Oh was once investigated for his
relationship with politician Choi.</i>

510
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:15,290
<i>He claimed he was
innocent, expressing his...</i>

511
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,210
<i>According to TMB's coverage,</i>

512
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:20,090
<i>it's been 27 days since
he fled the country.</i>

513
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,800
<i>It has been revealed
that TKU employees</i>

514
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,590
<i>haven't been paid
wages for two months.</i>

515
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,720
What do I do?
Seriously? Damn it!

516
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,020
How about selling
everything now?

517
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,190
Who will buy it?

518
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,730
I already put it up for sale.

519
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,990
But everyone's
trying to sell now.

520
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,160
Then what do you have to do?

521
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,040
The transaction will be...

522
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,160
Why are you asking? So annoying!

523
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,790
Then you can't get a cent?

524
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:04,970
Ji-won.

525
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:09,430
The situation is much more
serious than you think.

526
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,100
I used credit.

527
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,350
Credit? What do you mean?

528
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,350
Then what do you have to do?

529
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:23,360
What's the point
of talking to you?

530
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:29,450
Yes, Ms. Yang.

531
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,580
Yes, I'm in the bathroom.

532
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,080
You dummy. The credit
isn't important.

533
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:42,130
I even took out a private loan.

534
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,050
He didn't mention
the private loan.

535
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,510
He didn't before too.

536
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:50,510
He never says things to hurt
his pride. He's not the type.

537
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,720
Just in case, keep
an eye on him.

538
00:46:57,850 --> 00:46:58,980
I loved you.

539
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,190
What are you doing?

540
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,070
Was it our fate

541
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,070
to be a threesome,
not just two of us?

542
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,620
Are you possessed? I
don't understand you.

543
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:23,130
I'm going to marry Ji-won.

544
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,920
If we had more time,

545
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,090
I would've fallen
for you completely.

546
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,260
But this fate puts
the brake down.

547
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,220
Then...

548
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:37,850
Goodbye.

549
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:42,940
So keep my mouth shut?

550
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:46,570
What?

551
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,070
I won't...

552
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,410
say anything,
Min-hwan. Don't worry.

553
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,170
I just want you to be happy.

554
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,380
What?

555
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,760
Happy?

556
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,030
Why does life suck so bad?

557
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,320
Drink slowly.

558
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,410
Hey.

559
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:37,290
Do you like me?

560
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,630
Of course, I do.

561
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:49,760
Thank you for liking
someone like me.

562
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:59,310
You said to drink
slowly, so I should.

563
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,980
I'm sorry.

564
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,190
I wanted to marry you next year,

565
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,980
but what's left...

566
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,660
is the Han River for me.

567
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:17,280
<i>He's asking for money
in such a literary way.</i>

568
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,250
Damn it!

569
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:28,380
You're young. You can earn
it again. I'm in no rush.

570
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,800
You can't say that.

571
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,890
Think of your age.
What about kids?

572
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:39,640
You don't want any kids.

573
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,020
You're more important to me.

574
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:44,350
<i>That's true.</i>

575
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,610
I'm a third-generation only son.

576
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,690
How can I only think of myself?

577
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:51,530
That's true.

578
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,360
Then what should we do?

579
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:03,330
Ji-won?

580
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:07,130
Shall we get married?

581
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,090
I can't give you a
glamorous life as I planned.

582
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:19,600
But we'll be a better family
tomorrow than we are now.

583
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,180
I promise.

584
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:29,360
Family?

585
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:31,190
Family.

586
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:35,700
<i>I know you get weak
when I mention family.</i>

587
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:41,330
<i>What a crappy way to say you'll sponge
off me for life. You call that family?</i>

588
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,710
It took courage for me to
say that. What's with you?

589
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,420
Is it because I'm broke now?

590
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,630
You're not that type of snob.

591
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:01,970
<i>How funny, right?</i>

592
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:05,020
He wants to marry
without a penny.

593
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,440
No, he must want to marry
me now that he's broke.

594
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,530
This is the same as before.

595
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:18,320
He proposed to me, saying he'd
invest with his parents' money.

596
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:26,120
My debt started to get
bigger when that went south.

597
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,330
But he was the person I chose, so I
thought we'd work it out together.

598
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,210
He was selfish.

599
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,010
Anyway, all my choices
were backwards.

600
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,610
You'll get fat if
you eat like that.

601
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:08,540
I used to give a stray
cat food in college.

602
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:13,210
I wanted to bring him home,

603
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:17,010
but I was scared I couldn't
raise him properly.

604
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,920
Then...

605
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,340
the cat disappeared one day.

606
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:24,970
It was a cold winter.

607
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,390
I regretted it so much then.

608
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:34,730
He was so tiny. Like this big.

609
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,480
He had such a temper.

610
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:42,780
He got chased away after
trying to fight other cats.

611
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,200
He hated people, so I don't
think anyone took him.

612
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:01,550
To tell the truth,

613
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,010
I was discharged early.

614
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,470
It was similar to
a car accident.

615
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,480
Similar to a car accident?

616
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:35,790
Are you okay?

617
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,920
Yeah, I'm fine.

618
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,140
Are you okay?

619
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:57,860
<i>I ruptured my knee ligaments.</i>

620
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,860
I jumped in front of
a car to save a cat.

621
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,530
I didn't get hit, though.

622
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,290
Then...

623
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:19,790
the cat you're raising now...

624
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,800
It was the winter of 2005.

625
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,640
A cheese tabby
with a bad temper.

626
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,100
Doesn't like people.

627
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,570
Are you going to work out?

628
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,780
Hello?

629
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,410
Where'd they go?

630
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,870
Was it you? It
was you all along!

631
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,960
I thought you looked
similar. It was really you!

632
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,170
It's 20130419.

633
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,800
My passcode.

634
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,090
Come anytime.

635
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,180
Really? Can I?

636
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,890
Let's see each other more often!

637
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:15,980
You're so cute!

638
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,610
Either way, Mr. Park
must get married now.

639
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,030
Yes. Since he needs to
get money from his family.

640
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:38,870
His debts are probably about
half a billion won in total.

641
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,080
Maybe more.

642
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,340
It was worthwhile lending him

643
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:47,380
my money to make him
go all in with TKU.

644
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,970
But at this rate, I don't think
he'll give up marrying you.

645
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,220
So I came up with this plan.

646
00:55:58,430 --> 00:55:59,480
Although,

647
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,770
I'll have to get
his crappy proposal.

648
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,780
It must be so annoying
for me, right?

649
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:13,410
But if I want to live a
long life, I must work hard.

650
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,200
He proposed on my birthday.

651
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:23,080
Everything he did was
tolerable back then.

652
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:24,750
But I hated it.

653
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:27,300
One, two, three.

654
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,710
I have to see that again?

655
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:09,420
Terrible, right?

656
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:13,340
It's my first birthday
after being reborn.

657
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:24,350
Ji-hyuk did?

658
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,020
Yes, sir.

659
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,610
Oh, right. Also...

660
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,370
NECESSITY OF R&D

661
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:38,450
TEST FLIGHT RESULTS

662
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:41,120
Wait, so this
technology is possible?

663
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,000
Apparently, the development
team says we can finally try it.

664
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,130
As you can see, those are
the test flight results.

665
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:53,300
U&K Aerobotics.

666
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,050
Shall I secure more stocks?

667
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:57,260
If this is possible, of course.

668
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:59,350
That's that. About
Ji-hyuk again.

669
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,560
What on earth is he
thinking right now?

670
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,190
Ji-won?

671
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,780
Min-hwan, what is all...

672
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,530
Don't say anything.

673
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,040
Tonight's for you.

674
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:08,420
My princess.

675
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,260
Kang Ji-won.

676
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:26,930
I love you.

677
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,340
Let me.

678
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:17,110
<i>I'll do everything I
can for you, Ji-won.</i>

679
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:19,570
<i>She won't know this
is cubic, right?</i>

680
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,860
<i>But it's not like
she'll toss it.</i>

681
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:25,950
<i>I won't let them marry.</i>

682
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,000
<i>You'd hate to see me happy.</i>

683
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:40,800
<i>Yes.</i>

684
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:44,220
<i>Please use whatever
means necessary</i>

685
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:48,680
<i>to marry my husband.</i>

686
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:07,120
<i>Ji-won jumped in
the water for me.</i>

687
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,290
Ji-won.

688
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,750
It's your turn to make me happy.

689
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,790
It was the best first birthday.

690
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,760
I'm engaged!

691
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:24,260
<i>I'm going to milk him for
the first and last time.</i>

692
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,800
She bought all this?

693
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,140
My mother-in-law
has high standards.

694
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:30,020
<i>Why are you here?</i>

695
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,560
Isn't the family meeting today?

696
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,890
I'm happy with now.

697
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:39,320
It's obvious what kind of
family she'll marry into.

698
