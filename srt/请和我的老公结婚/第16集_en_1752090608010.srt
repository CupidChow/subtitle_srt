1
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,760
This place sucks whenever I come here.

2
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,980
I'm Prosecutor Choi Tae-su from Criminal Division 3.

3
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:04,030
You were born with a silver spoon. You're pretty and probably well-mannered.

4
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,450
Everyone treats you nicely, so nothing's hard for you.

5
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,920
But things are different now.

6
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,920
Everyone thinks this is just a formality, but...

7
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,090
It is. This investigation is just a formality.

8
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,470
Look here, Ms. Oh Yu-ra!

9
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,060
Look here, Prosecutor!

10
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,190
It's not the time for a mere prosecutor to act up.

11
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:36,900
Do I look like a fool who'd be scared after seeing you rush in here?

12
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,360
You're not sure about anything.

13
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,330
Would it be faster for me to say what you want to hear out of fear,

14
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,170
or to get out of here on my own?

15
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,760
Do you want to bet?

16
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,110
-Goodbye, ma'am! -Goodbye, ma'am!

17
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,290
The world must be going crazy.

18
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,460
Everyone keeps crossing the line.

19
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,670
This is for the best. They can't do anything with that file.

20
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,650
You didn't have to come here.

21
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,820
There was a misunderstanding.

22
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,530
I guess I'm not a great judge of character.

23
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,660
Oh Yu-ra.

24
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,790
You crossed the line this time.

25
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,210
Turn in your resignation.

26
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,210
Don't think about exercising your rights over the airline and tour company shares.

27
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,920
Soon,

28
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,840
U&K Foundation will send a volunteer group to Africa. Join them.

29
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,390
Go and volunteer and volunteer some more.

30
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,770
And once you've built character, you can return then.

31
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,730
I gave you the position, and it ruined you.

32
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,360
Still, it's a big privilege to have another chance.

33
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,200
Keep that in mind.

34
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,290
No.

35
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,130
Why would I resign? Why should I volunteer?

36
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,710
Africa?

37
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,090
Right. You must like her. Don't you?

38
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,060
Ji-hyuk is family after all, so you want to let him do what he wants.

39
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,900
Do it, then.

40
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,870
But don't touch me.

41
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,780
What did I do wrong?

42
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,080
You're pretending to be fair.

43
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,460
But you're not.

44
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,600
I told him it'd be no use, but he didn't know you at all.

45
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,560
What the hell are you saying?

46
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,980
I'm exhausted. Let's talk tomorrow.

47
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,160
You shouldn't have messed with Ji-won.

48
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,910
What?

49
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,790
What did I do?

50
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,250
No. Even if I did do something, do you have proof?

51
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,590
Yes.

52
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,420
I do.

53
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,330
What's wrong? Did you see a ghost?

54
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,250
What do I have to do?

55
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,790
Tell me what I don't know.

56
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,890
-Are you crazy? -Hurry!

57
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,120
Pay for what you did.

58
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,330
Your problem is thinking you can do anything you want.

59
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,120
Stop trying to get away with it.

60
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,960
Pay properly.

61
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,710
Jeong Man-sik, Bae Hui-suk.

62
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,750
You're under arrest for attempted murder.

63
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,050
Yeah, yeah. I'll tell you everything. Everything.

64
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,940
Now that Jeong Man-sik's showed up, I'd like to talk to you again, Ms. Oh.

65
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,260
Mom!

66
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,470
-Ju-ran. -Princess.

67
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,150
Goodness.

68
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,320
Jeong Su-min did something like that?

69
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,200
Mr. Park's funeral was held just downstairs, but I had no idea.

70
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,410
It feels strange.

71
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,000
If I had known, I would have--

72
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,880
You still shouldn't have.

73
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,840
You can't go to a funeral before a major surgery.

74
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,510
You're nagging again.

75
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,430
The surgery went well.

76
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,600
Because the surgery went well.

77
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,140
You got scared and cried before. Shall I keep going?

78
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,820
Anyway, since the SD card's data was recovered,

79
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,280
things got easier.

80
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,660
The court will take recent threats into account seriously as well.

81
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,370
It'll all work out.

82
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,540
You might be able to get both parental rights and custody.

83
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,830
Well, let's make him lose visitation rights as well.

84
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,380
Then Yeon-ji will lose his father for good.

85
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,060
You don't have to if you don't want to.

86
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,900
The choice is yours.

87
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,860
I'm happy about it.

88
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,240
When I got the surgery,

89
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,410
it felt like I was dying once.

90
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,040
Do I look like a bum?

91
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,380
Do I play all day?

92
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,590
I couldn't see the end, so it was so hard.

93
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,260
Stop it!

94
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,020
I was even betrayed.

95
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,520
But...

96
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,610
I got a new chance.

97
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,240
Lee Jae-won, that bastard.

98
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,040
He'll probably try to milk Yeon-ji later.

99
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,710
He'll never be helpful for her.

100
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,420
I can't let her suffer like that.

101
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,720
He's nothing but a birth father.

102
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,760
I...

103
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,600
will stay strong.

104
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,650
I'll try a little harder too.

105
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,040
FINAL EPISODE

106
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,150
God, you scared me.

107
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,530
I'm sorry. I was just happy to see you.

108
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,580
Well, Ji-won wanted to finalize the factory manufacturing recipe today.

109
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,080
She wanted to discuss that. That's why I came.

110
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,080
Did she go somewhere?

111
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,170
Ms. Kang's meeting with the development team is running late.

112
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,760
Sorry to disappoint you, but I'll explain. Follow me this way.

113
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,060
The spinach pasta with sea snails, the perilla cream pasta,

114
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,810
and the sweet pumpkin soup. Please check the recipes again.

115
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,480
Also...

116
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:48,780
By the way, did I do something wrong to you?

117
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,700
What?

118
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,280
I mean, you weren't here when I came last time.

119
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,620
And you're being kind of unfriendly today.

120
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,580
I'm happy to see you.

121
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,920
I'm clueless, so I wouldn't know if you don't tell me.

122
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,600
So if I did something wrong, I'm sorry.

123
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,060
Even if didn't, I'm sorry.

124
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,060
Did you notice I was away?

125
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,350
Of course.

126
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,150
I looked for you.

127
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,360
Why would you?

128
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,650
What?

129
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,570
Well...

130
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,830
Right. I brought a Basque cake I made last time and the time before.

131
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,660
Because...

132
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,460
I remembered how you loved it.

133
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,340
Who's the person that sent such a great cake?

134
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,550
This is love itself!

135
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,140
I bought a new oven, and it's insanely good, you know.

136
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,100
So whatever dish I make, it tastes three times as good.

137
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,730
I guess it's why I kept cooking.

138
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,610
By the way, your ears...

139
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,990
are so big and pretty.

140
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,320
What are you doing?

141
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,870
You can't touch someone's ear like that.

142
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,330
Why not?

143
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,120
What? I don't know.

144
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,210
But you can't do it.

145
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,420
Can I touch your hands, then?

146
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,260
Of course. You can touch my hands, but my ears are sensitive...

147
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,900
I think I like you.

148
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,190
What?

149
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,510
When it comes to life,

150
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,100
you can't have both.

151
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,230
What I mean is,

152
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,810
as long as he inherits U&K,

153
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,320
it won't be easy to harmonize

154
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,400
your personal happiness and his social responsibilities.

155
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,500
What?

156
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,080
It's just that...

157
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:52,380
The way you speak is very similar to the way Ji-hyuk does.

158
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,680
He does talk kind of like Grandfather.

159
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,850
See! Look at that!

160
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,310
See! They have the same tastes! Look at their pick.

161
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,400
I'm disappointed in you, Grandfather.

162
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,780
I'll try very hard.

163
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,030
I know I was given a precious opportunity.

164
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,250
I'll make sure to be less greedy and more generous in life.

165
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,420
Do you think it's that easy?

166
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,880
If it doesn't work...

167
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,390
I'll try harder!

168
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,860
Can I continue eating now?

169
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,860
Sure, eat up. I guess I spoke for too long.

170
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,280
I'm sorry. I talked too much.

171
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,840
Thank you.

172
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,260
Now, let's toast to Chef Eun-ho's success!

173
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,220
And to a successful divorce!

174
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,810
And to successful love! Let's go!

175
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,270
Cheers!

176
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,320
Beer tastes the best this way.

177
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,910
Don't be surprised. This must be his first time eating food like this.

178
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:48,290
What are you talking about? He eats pork gukbap with tons of jeongguji.

179
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,670
Tons of what? What's that?

180
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,840
She doesn't know what it is. It's no use talking to her.

181
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,260
You're right.

182
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,640
I really feel like I came back from the dead.

183
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,850
I'm surprised by you two, but how are you two siblings?

184
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,230
They don't look alike at all.

185
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,980
What? You said we did!

186
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,530
-I did? -Yeah.

187
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,610
-When? -You don't remember?

188
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,120
It's strange that you're here too, Mr. Lee.

189
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,620
Let me be clear. I'm not here for you, Ms. Yang.

190
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,460
-I work for the U&K family-- -Yes. That's what I meant.

191
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,880
You're an incredible person to the U&K family.

192
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,640
But Mr. Yu is a member of the family,

193
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,770
thus you're here. That's very surprising.

194
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,110
Wait, am I being too comfortable now?

195
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:04,280
I'm part of the owner's family too.

196
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,660
Also, Mr. Lee wouldn't come to an occasion like this even if the owner told him to--

197
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,500
It's part of my job to make sure the owner's family watch what they say.

198
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,340
Is he always like that?

199
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,480
It's so good.

200
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,100
We ordered everything in.

201
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,650
-Bye. -Get home safe.

202
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,770
It's raining.

203
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,820
What do we do?

204
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,160
We only have two umbrellas.

205
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,330
I drove here, so I'm good.

206
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,250
It's on my way...

207
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,460
What's on your way?

208
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,010
If you mean my home, you could give me a ride.

209
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,180
I can just run and catch the bus.

210
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,470
Why don't I give you a ride? If that's okay with you.

211
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,350
It's the opposite direction.

212
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,360
Shall I?

213
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
That works out.

214
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,070
The elevator's here.

215
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,360
Thanks for coming today.

216
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,530
Get home safe.

217
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,280
Have a good rest, Ms. Kang.

218
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,290
And Ji-hyuk, you rest or whatever.

219
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,920
But why are Eun-ho and Hui-yeon going together?

220
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,720
And toasted for successful love. What was that about?

221
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,050
My goodness, you're so clueless.

222
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,390
I'm going in.

223
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,730
Eun-ho likes Hui-yeon? Why?

224
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,480
I don't understand.

225
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,050
Be careful.

226
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,050
What are you doing?

227
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,010
Are you up?

228
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,560
It would've been better to stay unconscious.

229
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,780
Fire spreads more because of curtains.

230
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,450
Sturdy buildings are insulated...

231
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,460
You need to study to do anything.

232
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,810
Ji-won.

233
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,890
I'm sorry.

234
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,770
I'm sorry.

235
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,060
We can't do anything about it now.

236
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,650
We can't do anything about it now.

237
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,400
You always think only about yourself.

238
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,320
You always think only about yourself.

239
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,210
You really do live up to my expectations.

240
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,840
What?

241
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,930
I was worried that you'd be a little smarter.

242
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,140
But...

243
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,020
I overestimated you.

244
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,400
This is the best you can do.

245
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,900
Seeing you hit rock bottom like this...

246
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,860
It suits you more than anything.

247
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,870
Stop acting tough.

248
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,540
You're the worst here.

249
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,340
You dumped Min-hwan on me knowing he was trash.

250
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,550
Look at you now.

251
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,260
You threw me in the garbage and took everything good for yourself.

252
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,510
Is that why you killed Min-hwan?

253
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,770
Why shouldn't I?

254
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,440
He tried to kill me first.

255
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,320
It doesn't matter. There's no proof.

256
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,200
I'll turn myself in. I'll say it was an accident and I ran out of fear.

257
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,700
If I pretend to regret it so much,

258
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,920
as always, people will take pity on me.

259
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,840
Right.

260
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,010
You're good at playing the victim.

261
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,270
I did it.

262
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,850
I won.

263
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,200
No, I won.

264
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,390
I learned so many things because of you.

265
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,350
You knew I was coming?

266
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,280
You dragged me around and took everything from me.

267
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,070
I felt so sorry for myself.

268
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,280
So I decided to face you this time instead of running.

269
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:55,920
Don't hide behind me or anyone else anymore.

270
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,960
You face the consequences

271
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,050
of your actions now.

272
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,510
Face the consequences?

273
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,140
I'll get manslaughter.

274
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,350
Just you wait.

275
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,520
It's not manslaughter anymore.

276
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,860
You...

277
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,280
just made the evidence with your own mouth.

278
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,100
PENSION MURDER CASE

279
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,140
MURDER SUSPECT ON THE LOOSE

280
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,270
I first met her in the bathroom at work.

281
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,440
When I got out of the stall, she covered me with her cardigan.

282
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,650
I thought,

283
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,740
"I found my sister."

284
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,570
-Stop it. -It was that moment.

285
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,990
But my brother said he liked her, so...

286
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,290
Jeong Su-min bought thinner?

287
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,620
Yes, the police are strengthening their search around there.

288
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,130
I asked them to watch the house too.

289
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,050
We'll add more security as well.

290
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,340
It's better you don't.

291
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,510
She's coming for me. Let her.

292
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,850
I'm against this.

293
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,810
When I said I'd do everything you wanted,

294
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,560
I didn't mean I'd let dangerous things happen.

295
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,860
I'm not saying to stand aside.

296
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,110
She bought thinner. That means she'll set a fire.

297
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,450
What's the use of stopping her from coming?

298
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,990
-Ji-won. -How long will you block her?

299
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,740
How long will we run away?

300
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,790
When I got another chance at life,

301
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,170
I promised not to run away anymore.

302
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,380
Then I'll do it.

303
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,760
I'll lure her and...

304
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,260
Do you think she'll show herself to you?

305
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,890
She's trying to ruin me.

306
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,850
I have to deal with her.

307
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,870
I'll go crazy because of you.

308
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,310
You want me to practice this?

309
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,980
-Now, one! -One!

310
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,780
We did what you wanted. Let me do what I want this time.

311
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,450
-One. -Two.

312
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,080
Next, one!

313
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,620
Two!

314
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,710
It's okay. One more time. Shout properly.

315
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,750
-One! -One!

316
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,920
Two!

317
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,020
This is the price for your sins and hell I made for you.

318
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,240
Take it.

319
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,370
Ms. Jeong Su-min.

320
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,710
You're under arrest for murder and attempted arson.

321
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,920
You have the right to an attorney, to defend yourself,

322
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,170
to file a false arrest suit, and to remail silent.

323
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,430
What are you doing? Take her.

324
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,340
No.

325
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,550
It wasn't me.

326
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,350
Kang Ji-won set this up!

327
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,640
It wasn't me!

328
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,600
It was her! It was Kang Ji-won!

329
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,270
It wasn't me!

330
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,480
We'll call you.

331
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,740
It's all over now.

332
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,760
Only good things will happen from now on.

333
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,890
I'll make sure of that.

334
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,820
I'll protect you forever.

335
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,410
So don't think about it anymore.

336
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,920
You took back what was rightfully yours.

337
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,840
And I got an opportunity that wasn't mine.

338
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,140
That's why I have you in my arms.

339
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,060
So you have to be better to me.

340
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,020
How can I do that?

341
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,570
Like this?

342
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,330
Or...

343
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,160
like this?

344
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:44,070
Prosecutor Choi applied for your travel ban.

345
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,540
You must leave the country today.

346
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,950
What time's the flight?

347
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,330
Flights three and four hours from now. I booked each one. Let's hurry.

348
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,960
You can't do anything right.

349
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,010
You're fired.

350
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,300
Give me the tickets.

351
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,360
DAD

352
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,630
Ji-won.

353
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,260
What is it? Is something wrong?

354
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,140
It's gone.

355
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,330
Former Vice President Oh Yu-ra of Cloud Air

356
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:39,420
was in a car accident near Incheon Airport.

357
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,960
She was transferred to the hospital but ended up dead.

358
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,710
She was being investigated by the prosecution

359
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,680
for the dump truck attempted murder case.

360
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,720
She denied the charges and pled not guilty,

361
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,810
but the prosecution secured the evidence and applied for Oh's travel ban.

362
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:01,560
After the accident, her family accused the prosecution of unreasonable methods.

363
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:05,860
The prosecution has expressed their regret over Oh's death

364
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,150
but said they'd get to the bottom of the accident.

365
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:21,080
SEOUL ADMINISTRATIVE COURT

366
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,550
Congratulations on your divorce.

367
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,430
Hooray!

368
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,150
Thank you. It was all thanks to you.

369
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,500
It's hot outside. Do you want a ride?

370
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,960
No, I'm spending my first day as a single with my friends.

371
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,420
I should go.

372
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,400
I'll buy you a meal.

373
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
Nothing too expensive.

374
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,240
A moderately expensive meal.

375
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,610
Can I do that?

376
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,450
Thanks.

377
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,250
CAMELLIA GRAND OPEN

378
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,960
-Hi. -Ms. Yang!

379
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,800
Come on.

380
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,050
-This is nice. -Right?

381
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,430
Okay, since my precious friend

382
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:58,220
opened a new restaurant, I'll buy the most expensive dish!

383
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,140
Are you sure?

384
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,270
Then, to all the special people who helped me make

385
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,520
the most successful and best meal kit I could,

386
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,650
I'll give you the most expensive dish on the house!

387
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:14,820
If Eun-ho's paying, what shall we pick?

388
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,280
No.

389
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:21,200
To celebrate my divorce, I'm paying. So let's have the most expensive dish.

390
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,000
Good days deserve good food.

391
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,790
It's so beautiful here.

392
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,790
It's the best.

393
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,590
-I'll get you good wine. -Okay, thanks.

394
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,200
The turkey looks too full. Isn't that too much?

395
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,660
It's not.

396
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,660
Just wait.

397
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,830
I have my own method for this.

398
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,340
My father taught it to me.

399
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:14,510
And when I have kids later, I'll teach them too.

400
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,090
That's right.

401
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,550
Have you thought of cute baby names?

402
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,370
I'm not saying we should have kids right away.

403
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,620
Well... I just thought

404
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:49,330
it'd be nice to take our time thinking of good names together.

405
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,590
I know,

406
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:56,010
but we don't know what will happen.

407
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,890
And thinking about baby names beforehand is a little...

408
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,390
It's so significant...

409
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:10,020
You don't know what will happen?

410
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,200
Look at us right now.

411
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,210
We do this.

412
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,210
We do this too.

413
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,760
We even do this.

414
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,470
You really don't know?

415
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,180
Shall I tell you?

416
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,430
Shall I teach you?

417
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,020
Dad, I'm so happy now.

418
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,190
BAEK EUN-HO SELLS 5 MILLION MEAL KITS

419
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,480
10TH SUPPLY BATCH SOLD OUT

420
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,820
Marketing Team 1. Let's go taste the new products.

421
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,530
It's not that I've become someone great.

422
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:07,700
I'm still just Kang Ji-won.

423
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,840
This should be had with beer.

424
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,420
It's good.

425
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,140
This is salty and spicy.

426
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:27,220
I think it'll be good with makgeolli. Right?

427
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,720
-Yeah. -Right?

428
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:31,390
I think we can use storytelling

429
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,980
as the marketing point for this product.

430
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,570
The story of the sisters who developed it is interesting.

431
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,660
I'll look into it.

432
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,500
This is delicious.

433
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,420
Aren't we working right now?

434
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:59,000
But Ms. Yang told me to bring beer.

435
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,430
Ms. Kang.

436
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,140
I...

437
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,350
Thanks for entrusting me with the snack.

438
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,690
You work hard lately.

439
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:21,280
No, wait.

440
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,280
About the meal kit project...

441
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,530
I interfered in the middle and...

442
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,620
I wanted to say sorry.

443
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:37,960
I knew.

444
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:42,710
But we gained better results from it, so I decided to let it go.

445
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,100
But you're incredible. I didn't think you'd admit to it.

446
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,470
I misjudged you.

447
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,270
When it comes to people,

448
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,690
they change for sure with age.

449
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,860
I believed in love, but it failed me.

450
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:06,030
After everything that happened,

451
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,870
I reflected on myself...

452
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:14,660
I pondered who I was as a person,

453
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:17,580
and figured it out.

454
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,790
Mr. Kim. Shall we go to your seat?

455
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,050
-Shall we? -Sure.

456
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,010
Shall we smoke first?

457
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:26,550
But a lot of things have changed.

458
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,970
Here we go.

459
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,390
It's hot.

460
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:35,730
-Thank you for the meal! -Wait.

461
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,860
You need to add a lot of jeongguji.

462
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:46,780
Well?

463
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,410
You don't know how to eat pork gukbap.

464
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:54,830
I'll try it.

465
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,920
I know this taste.

466
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,350
Is this from the restaurant we went to?

467
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,980
Nothing gets past your tastebuds.

468
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,190
After the restaurant was gone,

469
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:24,400
I looked for restaurants that made it like them.

470
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,990
I couldn't find anything similar.

471
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:30,910
I was like, "It's Busan! Why can't these restaurants make it?"

472
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:36,370
"Why are they all different?" And...

473
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:43,840
You don't have to gobble it up. You can eat it whenever you want now.

474
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,760
They opened a branch in Seoul. Just five minutes from here.

475
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:56,760
No way...

476
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:02,560
I thought of stopping the redevelopment. But this method was much easier.

477
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,270
That's okay, right?

478
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,160
Aren't you so impressed?

479
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:16,450
No, I was thinking about telling you what I want to eat next.

480
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:17,540
What?

481
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,500
I was just kidding.

482
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:22,170
Thank you so much.

483
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,540
Eat slowly.

484
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,080
I'll eat it every day.

485
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:26,840
It's so good.

486
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:30,470
Right, Ji-hyuk.

487
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,340
What are you doing this weekend?

488
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:36,600
I want to go somewhere with you.

489
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:08,000
When I was young, I always felt anxious and lonely.

490
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,380
But...

491
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,100
I'm not anxious or lonely anymore.

492
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:23,270
Since I have you beside me.

493
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,360
It's no surprise.

494
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,440
I'm the best allowance your dad picked to give you.

495
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,740
This...

496
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,710
is where we started.

497
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,550
I want to start our new start here too.

498
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:01,350
Ji-hyuk.

499
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:09,770
Will you marry me?

500
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,170
I can't believe you.

501
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,090
No, I mean...

502
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:40,050
That's just how I feel now.

503
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:43,640
You don't have to give me an answer now.

504
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,600
How could you just leave like that?

505
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:51,610
I thought everything was back, but he's still himself.

506
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,950
You can do whatever you want

507
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,580
but not a proposal.

508
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,060
I've been carrying it for so long.

509
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,520
I wanted to propose all this time.

510
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:45,330
Wil you...

511
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:51,420
marry me?

512
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:43,050
Of course, there are things that didn't change.

513
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:45,300
A BETTER TOMORROW, CORRECTION OF HOPE

514
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,100
I don't know why.

515
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,430
Why Ji-won wants

516
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:57,060
to take everything I have. Why she wants me to be miserable.

517
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,780
It's because you're too nice.

518
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,530
People like her only go after nice people.

519
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:04,860
You have to nip them

520
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:06,820
in the bud.

521
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,240
How could a person do that?

522
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,250
I could endure all of that.

523
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,920
However...

524
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:19,800
Do you remember

525
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:25,300
when I told you about Ji-won being delusional?

526
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,970
She kept saying I was gaslighting her.

527
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:32,180
That I was harassing her and ruining her life.

528
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,310
She acted like a victim,

529
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:36,480
and that's why I ended up here.

530
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,570
Goodness, not only is she crazy,

531
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,570
she's also so pathetic.

532
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,610
I know, right?

533
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,360
But what can I do?

534
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:49,330
I'm her only friend.

535
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,410
I'll talk to her when I get out.

536
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,210
Inmate 2574, visitor.

537
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:06,220
Why are you so surprised?

538
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,640
You...

539
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:22,820
You didn't die?

540
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,610
I did. That's why I'm here.

541
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:30,990
One billion won.

542
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,210
Now that I'm dead, the benefit of one billion won will be paid.

543
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:40,840
Can you...

544
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,090
give this to Ji-won?

545
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:48,630
What?

546
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,600
No.

547
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:56,060
Why is it Ji-won again?

548
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,640
-I'll kill her! -Executive Director Yu Ji-hyuk,

549
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:01,110
the grandson of U&K Group's Chairman Yu,

550
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:04,360
-is getting married at Winton Hotel. -I only had Ji-won!

551
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,440
She felt the same!

552
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:09,450
I only had Ji-won!

553
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:10,740
Quiet!

554
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,700
Ma'am, please let me go! Please!

555
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:16,160
Let me out of here! Please!

556
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,500
Ji-won can't be happy.

557
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,710
She can't be happy without me!

558
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,340
She can't!

559
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:41,150
WEDDING YU JI-HYUK, KANG JI-WON

560
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,850
Here come the bride and groom.

561
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:20,140
Everything got a little better.

562
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:22,680
I believe that.

563
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:01,600
I wish you were here.

564
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:08,350
You would be so happy to see me this happy.

565
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:14,650
Hey. You all came too.

566
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:18,070
No, we didn't come.

567
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:22,450
I paid a lot for her congratulatory gift.

568
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:23,910
I applauded a lot too.

569
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:26,290
But I didn't eat anything.

570
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:34,250
The more I think about it, the sorrier I feel.

571
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,590
And I truly hope she's happy.

572
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:41,590
But that's the only thing I can do.

573
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,470
You truly regret it.

574
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,270
One, two, three.

575
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:52,020
Dad, are you watching?

576
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:56,980
Let's go!

577
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:03,950
-Let's go! -Let's go!

578
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:26,600
APRIL 2016

579
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:37,940
Hello, I'm Kang Ji-won, the director of U&K's Second Chance Foundation.

580
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,700
Our foundation's planning to gradually contribute

581
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:47,790
20 billion won through major affiliated companies by next year.

582
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:49,910
From there,

583
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,670
U&K plans to initiate systematic and continuous donations to the society

584
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:58,380
as a company that understands the meaning of sharing.

585
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:05,890
Even in moments when everything seems to be over,

586
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:08,890
I believe there's another path.

587
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:11,930
That path could even be better.

588
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,020
There must be a second chance.

589
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:20,440
No, it must be given.

590
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:24,320
To those suffering because of one wrong choice they made,

591
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:28,910
I hope our foundation can be of help.

592
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:31,700
Thank you.

593
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:46,640
I'm doing well this time, right?

594
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:49,430
But...

595
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:53,850
OCTOBER 2017

596
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,460
Do babies really not sleep like this?

597
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:21,880
Ji-won.

598
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,050
Seeing the baby cry like this,

599
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:28,300
I think he's sick. Let's take him to the hospital.

600
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,220
Let me see.

601
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:36,270
He's fine.

602
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,150
He pooped.

603
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,200
-Number two. -He pooped a lot.

604
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:54,200
Hurry.

605
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,670
Why won't you sleep?

606
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,590
Did you poop?

607
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:06,220
Daddy will change your diaper.

608
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,640
I've never done this before, so it's not easy.

609
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,800
But I think I'm doing a good job.

610
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:33,120
I am definitely moving forward little by little now.

611
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:40,250
I'm not walking in place. I'm walking forward.

612
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:48,760
I want to be land.

613
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,050
I want to be land.

614
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:54,430
-What are they saying? -What? Land? Lamb?

615
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:57,890
But why does it sound familiar?

616
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,020
Where are our mom and dad?

617
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:04,400
I don't know. They said it was their anniversary.

618
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,070
A super important and once-only anniversary.

619
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:09,570
Grandfather.

620
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:14,450
So you can play with your aunt!

621
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:21,210
Come here!

622
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:22,830
This way!

623
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:25,750
Grandfather, save us!

624
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,960
Help us!

625
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:29,970
OUR FAMILY MOTTO: BECOME EACH OTHER'S STURDY LAND!

626
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,470
I WANT TO BE LAND!

627
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:38,020
APRIL 12, 2023

628
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:54,490
And today is the day that all the seasons I have spent before ended.

629
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:01,120
I can't believe I can spend the same season so differently like this.

630
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:12,800
This is the middle of spring.

631
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,310
It's beautiful.

632
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,100
I've always liked this artist.

633
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:25,100
But I think the painting style has changed a bit.

634
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:29,650
The painter worked so hard until the work was acknowledged.

635
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:34,610
Thanks to our foundation, the painter could work at ease.

636
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,030
It's back to normal now.

637
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,990
This was how it should've been.

638
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:46,290
It could've been this beautiful.

639
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:52,300
I'm living properly now, Dad.

640
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:01,350
Thank you.

641
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,440
For making April 12, 2023

642
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:11,190
a completely different day.

643
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:18,910
Thank you...

644
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,250
for making me look forward to tomorrow.

645
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:55,320
I'm so happy.

646
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,400
