1
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,126
I used to...

2
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,044
Like you!

3
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:17,495
So

4
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,122
I…

5
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:22,666
Feel sorry

6
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,877
(Minister Liu Zhihe)

7
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:28,255
- Hello? Minister?
- Sorry for calling you on a weekend night

8
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,925
But I think I need your help

9
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,011
Do you have time to help?

10
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:38,057
It is about the group's publicity budget
I'm at the Winton Hotel

11
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,064
Hello? Agent Jiang?

12
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,818
Oh, okay

13
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,072
I should be there in 30 minutes.

14
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,243
OK, see you later.

15
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:58,953
good

16
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,384
Sorry, I really have to go.

17
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,638
Oh, okay

18
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,182
Can that

19
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,602
Can you tell me your phone number?

20
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:30,985
Wait

21
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,005
I'm leaving first

22
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,179
goodbye

23
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,213
Episode 4

24
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:38,385
The minister never seemed to come to me unexpectedly on weekends.

25
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,315
Sorry, I'm late

26
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,859
I'm not late, thank you for coming.

27
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,446
I'm sure this has never happened before

28
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,864
We walked and talked

29
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,077
Winner Planning is currently holding an exhibition

30
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,664
They proposed to convert the group's marketing expenses into
A considerable amount of money has been transferred to online marketing

31
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,209
- There will be a big change in the promotion strategy
- A very bold proposal

32
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,629
This means that the proportion of online marketing will increase.

33
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:17,216
However, the group's conservative
Many people think it's too early

34
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,885
How can I help?

35
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,514
Support my opinion

36
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,873
This is NurTV, it's amazing

37
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,210
This will become a
A platform used by all age groups

38
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,300
Wow, this...

39
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,136
I sensed an opportunity

40
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,483
But someone may have a different idea

41
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,862
Minister Liu, you are here.

42
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,907
Sorry, I'm late.
This is Agent Jiang Zhiyuan from the Marketing Team.

43
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:29,329
So at this time
U&K's whack-a-mole bully is still in the company?

44
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,497
Don't you know who I am?

45
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:34,752
Known as the whack-a-mole manager
Video of violence against flight attendant on plane

46
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,838
The post went viral on social media, causing quite a stir

47
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,631
What are you looking at? Is there anything good to see?

48
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,846
Good morning

49
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,557
It's amazing to see you here...

50
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,686
I mean it's an honor.

51
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,233
Minister Liu, you really understand

52
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,994
Hire such a beautiful female employee

53
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:11,455
It's fun to work, right?

54
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,833
I remember

55
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:18,462
Jin Jingxu's backer is the general manager of whack-a-mole
They really look alike.

56
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,131
For you, work would be boring.

57
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,981
I want you to be nicer to Ji Won.

58
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,944
Hello, are you really a contract employee of U&K?

59
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,365
Who said that? Ji-won?

60
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:50,744
Yes, Ji-won said you were a contract employee.
She is an agent

61
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,372
While we're on this subject, show us your business card.

62
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,166
Kang Ji-won is an agent, so what are you?

63
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,502
I'm just an ordinary employee.

64
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,337
Ji-won gets promoted quickly

65
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,256
- I will soon...
- Are you kidding?

66
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,968
You put her in the company.
How could she be promoted faster than you?

67
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,680
You were introduced to the company by someone you know.

68
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,517
But he taught me autobiography and interview skills
How about asking me to treat you to a meal?

69
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,979
You said that big companies have to go through
First, second and third round interviews

70
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,857
Each one has to deal with it differently

71
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,527
Even if these
But what about your past relationship with Eun-ho?

72
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:29,283
Eun-ho cannot be contacted
Why on earth did you come to the class reunion?

73
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,081
You guys are still talking about this?

74
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,042
That was when I was a kid.
We are both 31 years old now.

75
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,837
-Don't mention it again
- Are you kidding?

76
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:45,340
We have been fooled by your lies.

77
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,719
Did you really give Ji-won a fake item?

78
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,929
That's not Jiwon learning from you.

79
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,640
You gave her that
It's obviously fake stuff.

80
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,853
How come she even said something like that?

81
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,065
Have you been trying to frame her all along?

82
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,865
Why would I do that?

83
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,283
I'm Jiwon's friend.

84
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,911
indeed

85
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,247
Jiang Zhiyuan was scolded throughout high school
It's all because of you.

86
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:21,293
You said he coveted your man and imitated your dressing style
I want everything from you

87
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,794
You are the one who is whining there all day long!

88
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,131
I didn't ask you to scold her.

89
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:29,009
You guys bullied her yourselves, why are you blaming me?

90
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,685
Really creative.

91
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,146
Crazy Woman

92
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,567
I'm going to the toilet

93
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,364
- Really
-Oh my god

94
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,540
When did I ask them to scold her?

95
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,042
Why blame me?

96
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,753
A bunch of rotten people

97
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,891
(Other half)

98
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,195
The number you dialed cannot be answered...

99
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,405
hateful

100
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,283
Why did Bai Enhao show up now?

101
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,566
Ouch

102
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,943
Is this a joke?

103
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,446
Why should I pay you?

104
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,741
Do I have to see it before I can decide?

105
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,410
sorry

106
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,787
But this is quite…

107
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:22,748
Pretty good...

108
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,126
I haven't been to this site before.

109
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,796
What's good about it? It's all pornographic stuff

110
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:43,393
It seems that the target audience is set very accurately
That's called an algorithm

111
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:47,064
It's probably because this is your first time visiting that website.

112
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,940
What?

113
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,902
When I first visited the site

114
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,863
There was also "That Guy is Delicious"

115
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,740
I think it was to attract attention at the beginning.

116
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,327
That’s why I recommend more sensational content first.

117
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,745
After using it for a long time

118
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,332
We will recommend content that interests you.

119
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,958
That function is very useful.

120
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:10,170
You don't have to see things that you are not interested in.

121
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,963
Hello

122
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,591
You just need to stand there and smile, just be a vase

123
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,177
Why are you so arrogant and talkative?

124
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,806
Her name is not "Hey", she is Agent Kang Ji-won

125
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,059
What? Minister Liu

126
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,729
I want to hear from this promising employee
So I bring her here even on weekends

127
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,565
No, I...

128
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,238
Minister Liu is praising you

129
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,367
Yeah, this is the first time I heard him say that.

130
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,701
Minister Liu...

131
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,871
It's hard to get close to people, and I won't keep people around.

132
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,125
Of course, good people who can do things should be kept around

133
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,715
Were you laughing? Are you crazy?

134
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,969
Do you have a brain?

135
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,149
minister

136
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,069
Thank you for speaking well for me just now

137
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,158
Because you are a nice person

138
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,955
If it's not good, I won't say that.

139
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,840
You said you can get girls by going camping

140
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,633
sure

141
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,636
You can't even get your girlfriend.

142
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,724
After failing to seek love, Park Min went home and changed

143
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,896
What else? Is your wife any different?

144
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,107
My wife only thinks about me.

145
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,942
As long as I leave home

146
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,361
She would keep calling and texting me

147
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,238
Say something like "I miss you so much, what are you doing?"

148
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:03,825
"Have you eaten yet?" I'm so annoyed

149
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,118
Once upon a time

150
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,163
I really can't understand

151
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,873
I was only out for five minutes.

152
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,001
- She called me right away
- What is this? It's delicious.

153
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,794
-Isn't that delicious?
-Um

154
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,922
My wife prepared it for me.

155
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,759
She told me to stop drinking coffee and use delicious food to wake me up

156
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:21,843
very nice

157
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,095
It's different from your girlfriend who doesn't look for you.

158
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,180
hateful

159
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,184
I think your girlfriend has another man.

160
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,895
And keep you for marriage

161
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,481
You're not the only one who can do this.

162
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,150
You don't understand at all

163
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,069
She doesn't have that ability.

164
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,403
You figure it out...

165
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,406
Damn

166
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,327
You lunatic, why did you take them all?

167
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,704
Because it tastes good, I want to use this to pick up girls

168
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,581
-parking
- Really

169
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,876
Get in the car

170
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,836
No, it's okay.

171
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,463
It matters to me

172
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:01,550
You come to work on weekends
I heard nonsense that I didn't need to hear.

173
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,843
I even thought I should treat you to a meal.

174
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,660
If you keep looking at my face
We're going to have dinner.

175
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,081
What's wrong?

176
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,962
Because that's all you're sorry about.

177
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:44,843
Someone who is really mean to me.
But I don't feel sorry for me at all

178
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,221
Don't be too used to cooperating with others

179
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,433
good

180
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:55,854
I learned not to be nice to people who are mean to me.

181
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,858
But I will be twice as good to good people

182
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,569
Good idea

183
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,531
Now you just need
Just be able to recognize the eyes of a good person.

184
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,994
How do you know I don't judge people?

185
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,541
I thought I had, but I didn't.

186
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,126
It looks like that.

187
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,171
So what do you think I am?

188
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,220
Good Guy

189
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,723
It seems that I am not completely blind.

190
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,394
But

191
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,190
Is “That Guy is Delicious” good?

192
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:45,904
no

193
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:50,283
I just wanted to save face for the general manager.

194
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,202
But what you said feels very real

195
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,496
Tell me, should I watch it?

196
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,622
It's not like that, really.

197
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,499
I didn't watch it either.

198
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,126
So unfair

199
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,672
I think you should watch it carefully.

200
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,757
I'm really wronged.

201
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,884
I really haven't seen it

202
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,764
(Other half)

203
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,101
(Remind me later, one hour later)

204
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,686
(Reject call)

205
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,316
If you have an appointment, I can take you there.

206
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,736
No

207
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,038
Sorry, I said I would wait.
But I contacted you again.

208
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:40,250
Because I haven't seen you for a long time, I can't calm down

209
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,714
Looks like someone said something interesting.

210
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,340
A friend of mine

211
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,175
who?

212
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:50,969
He is my classmate

213
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,722
I went to a class reunion today.

214
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,307
We exchanged phone numbers after a long separation.

215
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,979
Seeing childhood friends I haven't seen for a long time
It will be fun for a while indeed.

216
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,815
Even though it's all in the past

217
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,818
I used to like him very much

218
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,988
He is my first love

219
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,121
that…

220
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:22,459
Seeing your first love again may bring back old feelings

221
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,668
But people say it's dangerous

222
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:27,505
So let the past feelings go...

223
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,299
Not that kind of feeling

224
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,344
I have a boyfriend now

225
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,279
(Park Min-hwan)

226
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,447
(Remind me later, one hour later)

227
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,364
(Reject call)

228
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,040
Agent Jiang

229
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,124
Um?

230
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,448
Recently, even cats and dogs are driving good cars

231
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:37,450
You shouldn't be able to see inside the car from outside.

232
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:38,743
No

233
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,829
I'm not because of that

234
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:45,041
-Don't you want to be seen?
-No, why wouldn't I want to?

235
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,400
Xiumin?

236
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,076
Park Agent

237
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,496
What's going on? Why are you here?

238
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:25,957
that…

239
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,045
What?

240
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,381
That...

241
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:35,717
What's wrong?

242
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,358
Um?

243
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,569
There seems to be something wrong

244
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,367
The password is the date when Ji-won and I started dating

245
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,827
0622

246
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,287
Isn’t it?

247
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,747
June 22, yes

248
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,334
I'll call Ji-won to check.

249
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,629
She doesn't answer the phone

250
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:17,967
The number you dialed cannot be answered...

251
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,260
She's not usually like this.

252
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,472
It doesn't matter

253
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,016
I'll continue waiting outside

254
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,853
Don't be like this. I'm here to see Ji Won, too.

255
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:29,979
But this...

256
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,482
This is really...

257
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,868
Let's go get something hot nearby and chat.

258
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,745
Tell me what's going on.

259
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,833
Stop crying

260
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,172
So shall we go out?

261
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,256
good

262
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,650
The minister noticed that I was behaving strangely.

263
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:16,943
How should I explain this?

264
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,160
Thanks

265
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,920
Really delicious, and warm

266
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:49,559
Since I and Park Min-hwan are agents
They are recognized as office lovers

267
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,394
You probably have a lot of questions.

268
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,732
But this is my private life, I don't want to explain

269
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,276
That's it

270
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,822
Although I want to ask, but if you don't want to say it, don't say it

271
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:07,785
As long as you're making a decision that's good for you

272
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,912
That's enough

273
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,834
I can be sure of this.

274
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,628
I've recently realized something

275
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,300
I have always been cooperating with others

276
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,135
So I don’t know myself very well

277
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,639
So you know something about yourself?

278
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,643
I'm learning

279
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,106
I am also writing a project for a quick-cooking meal package

280
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,275
Quick cooking meal kit?

281
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,360
right

282
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,615
Show me when you finish writing.

283
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,575
No

284
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,453
I'm looking forward to it, better sooner rather than later

285
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,124
If that's the case

286
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:56,834
good

287
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,712
What else do you want to do?

288
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,590
I also want to...

289
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,343
I also want to do interior decoration

290
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:09,263
I also want to learn self-defense

291
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,975
Self-defense? You want me to teach you?

292
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,398
Do you want me to learn self-defense?

293
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,442
Why do you react this way?

294
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,236
No

295
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,697
It feels very different from your image.

296
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,408
Is it a long way off? I used to be a sports person.

297
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:34,038
Judo, Aikido, Special Martial Arts
Taekwondo, Muay Thai, Kickboxing…

298
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,462
Really

299
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:48,886
I've had this feeling since last time.

300
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,102
Would you consider wearing contact lenses?

301
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:12,910
(Dried pollack, grilled pollack)

302
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,707
Drink slowly, or you'll get drunk.

303
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:22,628
I don't know why things have become so complicated.

304
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:26,090
I'm so afraid that Jiwon will misunderstand

305
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,675
No

306
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:30,178
You also know Ji Won is not that kind of person

307
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,430
She's been a little weird lately.

308
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:36,976
I feel like she's getting farther and farther away from me

309
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:42,315
Our relationship isn't like that. It shouldn't be like that.

310
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,359
She is indeed a little strange

311
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,697
Wait, is there really something going on between her and Yoo Ji Hyuk?

312
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,449
Impossible

313
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,284
Kang Ji Won will like me

314
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,120
She understands a man's appearance and style

315
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,750
She must be busy with work recently.

316
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,376
She is a deadbeat.

317
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,378
Only think about one thing at a time

318
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,423
-Is that really the case?
-Of course

319
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,967
No one doesn't know

320
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,302
What's your relationship with her?

321
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:14,972
Should that be the case?

322
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:16,724
right

323
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:23,898
Fortunately, I met you, Agent Park

324
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:29,570
If it weren't for you, I would definitely be very sad today

325
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,076
Thank you so much

326
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,372
You are the best, so handsome

327
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,752
No

328
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,380
Not handsome

329
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,182
this…

330
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:19,787
arrive

331
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,335
Thank you for driving me back

332
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,213
- I'm in
-Do you want me to walk you to your door?

333
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:30,756
What?

334
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,384
No

335
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,929
Ms. Kang Ji-won

336
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,351
I think before getting married

337
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:45,604
Try to get in touch with more people.

338
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,820
You're more open than I thought.

339
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:54,655
I wasn't originally, but now I'm starting to...

340
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:58,409
wrong

341
00:26:58,492 --> 00:26:59,910
I won't do this from now on.

342
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:04,415
I don't think you have to get married anyway.

343
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,878
You seem to be a non-marriageist.

344
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,505
No, I want to get married.

345
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:15,801
So what I want to say is...

346
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,471
that…

347
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:20,890
oops

348
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,479
Really

349
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:33,736
minister

350
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,741
It's nice to see you smile

351
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:04,058
Interior decoration proposal for the happiness of benefactors

352
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,565
She's so cute

353
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:34,171
If you want to do all of this, I recommend moving.

354
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,006
move place

355
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,261
This is also a good idea

356
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:57,695
(Other half)

357
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,034
(missed call)

358
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,833
I can't contact you

359
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,253
I really don't know about the class reunion
Why do students behave like that?

360
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,299
I know if I told you in advance that it was a class reunion
You won't come

361
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,509
I just want to find a way to solve it.

362
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:26,015
I think this matter should not be discussed via text message or phone call

363
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:28,267
We'll talk tomorrow

364
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:36,901
(Park Min-hwan)

365
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:46,619
Ji Won

366
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,628
Xiumin is crying now

367
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,631
It sounds like you guys have a misunderstanding.
Where are you?

368
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:04,303
Fortunately, you are with her.

369
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,722
Please take care of her and send her home.

370
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:09,767
I have mixed feelings and need time to think

371
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:16,732
-Are you okay?
-And you?

372
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,942
Well, I'm fine.

373
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:23,906
After all, I can't do this for a long time.

374
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:29,411
So you two should get married soon, please!

375
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,812
-Hello?
-oh

376
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:58,816
I'm not an impatient person.

377
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,818
But I still called you

378
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:04,697
Sorry, I got home late and couldn't call you.

379
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,032
Oh, no, it won't be late.

380
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:11,745
I'm a little anxious.

381
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:16,875
But it feels a bit strange to talk to you on the phone like this

382
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,795
Is that so?

383
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,673
Have we never talked on the phone?

384
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:25,426
Yes, you want me to stop following you...

385
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:29,263
fine

386
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:30,848
What's up?

387
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:34,852
No...No

388
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,270
Don't say

389
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,191
How many times are you going to say no?

390
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,402
Okay

391
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:48,240
You asked me not to talk to you anymore.

392
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:49,742
That's why it's like this

393
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:53,120
Hello! Kang Ji-won

394
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,474
Hello! Kang Ji-won

395
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:17,978
What happened to me?

396
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,399
You really shouldn't do that.

397
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,280
Don't talk to me anymore.

398
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,878
What happened to him? I didn't say anything.

399
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,215
Sorry, Ji-won.

400
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:50,928
I told him you were interested in him.

401
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:58,560
Did I like him making him so unhappy?

402
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:14,493
That's because you rejected me harshly

403
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,329
I reject you?

404
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:18,831
yes

405
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:22,960
I still have that letter.

406
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,714
-letter?
-right

407
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,173
Your reply

408
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,969
I wanted to throw it away, but I couldn't.

409
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:35,472
So you wrote to me and confessed

410
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,224
And did I reply?

411
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,144
Have you forgotten?

412
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,606
I wrote a letter to confess to you

413
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,818
Stayed up late

414
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:50,904
Oh, forget it.

415
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:54,032
- Eun Ho
-Um?

416
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,910
Should we meet?

417
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,496
You can bring

418
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,916
Is my reply coming?

419
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:18,432
Why hasn't she come yet? She usually comes early.

420
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:41,997
Agent Jiang, what's going on?

421
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,665
I thought you were an artist.

422
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,083
What day is today?

423
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,127
No, that's not the case.

424
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:49,755
Wow, you are so beautiful

425
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:54,593
Actually, Xiyan and I went shopping on Sunday

426
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,136
So by the way...

427
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,388
well done

428
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,057
Right? You're so beautiful.

429
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,976
-Ji Won
- What's going on? Get out of the way.

430
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:05,270
Honey

431
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,023
Are you really my girlfriend?

432
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,566
I can hardly recognize it.

433
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,486
I want to give you a surprise

434
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,404
It scares me

435
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,198
Honey

436
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:21,495
You look like a different person without glasses, very beautiful

437
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:26,208
You talk like you've never seen it.
She doesn't wear glasses.

438
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,584
Ouch

439
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:29,127
How could I not have seen it?

440
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,963
It just looks different.

441
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,297
It's really different

442
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,477
What?

443
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:50,649
Feel sorry

444
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,611
Feel sorry

445
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:01,285
Minister, I'll clean up.

446
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:03,453
I'll leave it to you.

447
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,290
Hmm? But...

448
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:10,836
Today you...

449
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:14,089
I don't look like I'm dressed for work.

450
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:16,550
What?

451
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:17,634
Oh, I...

452
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:19,928
Looks perfect for work, why...

453
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,806
Are you going to blame her?

454
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:29,813
Maybe I haven't seen her without glasses.
That's the feeling

455
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:30,731
Then I'm sorry.

456
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,441
Did you watch it yesterday?

457
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:34,902
What?

458
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,492
Yesterday was the weekend, and it was the first time I saw it at work.

459
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,079
What?

460
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,250
I noticed you were wearing contact lenses too.

461
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,465
Oh, yeah

462
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,258
minister

463
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:00,093
That's much more handsome.

464
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:07,768
No wonder it feels a little different

465
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,019
Looks good…

466
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,151
that…

467
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,656
Do you guys go get contact lenses together?

468
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,199
What are you talking about?

469
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,659
Why…

470
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,743
Aren't you going back to your seat?

471
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:29,873
No

472
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,291
Don't do this

473
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:35,587
Agent Park, you are awesome.

474
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:39,049
We are discussing Agent Jiang

475
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:43,428
Agent Park, you have a really good eye.

476
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:47,307
No one knew that Agent Jiang was such a beautiful woman

477
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:50,352
You don't know, she is a beauty.

478
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,941
- I think you need to defend well.
-What?

479
00:37:56,024 --> 00:38:00,028
Many people in our group said
Having a goalkeeper doesn't mean there won't be goals

480
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:01,488
Seo Jin-su

481
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,157
He has been talking about Agent Jiang all day today

482
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:05,659
That's right

483
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:07,869
Oh, no.

484
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,830
The ball doesn't like this.

485
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,082
That ball only has me in its eyes...

486
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:21,675
here

487
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:26,263
What's the matter?

488
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,223
I'm going out on a business trip later.

489
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,017
It doesn't matter for a while.

490
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,436
This is for you. Have some coffee.

491
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,730
Thanks

492
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:38,859
Did you take a break?

493
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,903
How are you feeling?

494
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,865
I was not good on Friday.

495
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,910
Attending the class reunion
Are you feeling better?

496
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:54,833
that…

497
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,128
Speaking of which…

498
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:03,550
What happened to you meeting with Liu Zhihe yesterday?

499
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:06,678
Oh, that one

500
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:12,059
I'm sorry for always taking advantage of the minister.

501
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,811
He has something urgent to ask me to come over

502
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:17,564
That's why I left the class reunion in a hurry.

503
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:20,108
That guy is such a jerk.

504
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:24,321
I see Liu Zhihe

505
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,990
Seems to be interested in you

506
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,537
That's not the case.

507
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:34,956
No, as a man I know

508
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,167
This is male instinct.

509
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,420
Regardless of whether it is urgent or not, why should he look for you?

510
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:44,800
He also had an issue with your outfit this morning.

511
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,427
Because you are so beautiful

512
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,971
It made him crazy

513
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,349
It's so annoying

514
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:57,687
Say

515
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,609
You are so beautiful today

516
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:08,865
You are so beautiful, a bunch of flies are staring at you
Makes me so angry

517
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:10,951
I should be the only one who can see it.

518
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:12,577
You are mine, right?

519
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,166
What's this?

520
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:20,794
There's something here

521
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:27,551
Oh my God, what should I do?

522
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,761
What should I do? Go to the toilet immediately.

523
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:31,721
Go to the toilet quickly.

524
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:34,015
My underwear is wet

525
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:36,977
Borrow

526
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:47,154
Ji Won

527
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:56,037
You wouldn't misunderstand me, would you?

528
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:00,667
I really don't know why they do that.

529
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,170
That was more than ten years ago. How naive!

530
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,636
How could I not believe you?

531
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:16,224
If I hadn't seen the ending, I might

532
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,019
Don't believe you?

533
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,648
I might have misspoken.

534
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,401
You know I often make mistakes.

535
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,243
Well, I was a little angry yesterday.

536
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:36,745
But after I thought about it, I found it strange

537
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,664
You have no reason to lie

538
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:42,876
Pretend you're dating Eunho
And I want you to break up with Eun-ho

539
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,797
Unless you want to bully me
Makes me look like a freak

540
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:51,676
But

541
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,845
It's crazy for anyone to do that.

542
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,892
Yeah, I can't do that.

543
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:06,399
Xia Ruizhi and his gang
In the past, he often bullied me with strange excuses.

544
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:07,609
Now it seems it's your turn.

545
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,569
Um

546
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:13,448
But I won't let it go.
We are not in high school anymore.

547
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,369
I want to meet with Enhao and ask him clearly

548
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,830
Are you going to meet Eun-ho?

549
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,292
Yes, he gave me his phone number yesterday and said he wanted to meet

550
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,171
Don't worry, my significant other.

551
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,591
this time

552
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:33,468
I really won't let it go.

553
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:37,347
good

554
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,772
But will Min-hwan be unhappy?

555
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,274
If you meet another man

556
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:49,734
Min Hwan is not that kind of person

557
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,739
He said I'm happy.

558
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,741
besides

559
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:01,288
The stock market has soared recently and he has made a lot of money.

560
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:09,129
Are stocks rising sharply?

561
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:11,881
He wants me to look forward to our new home.

562
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:14,926
very nice

563
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:29,524
It's been a while since you got off work on time, right?

564
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,906
Isn't that right? Agent Jiang

565
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,620
I haven't gotten off work early in a long time.

566
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:45,081
Anyone want to go eat fried chicken?

567
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,711
I have to pick up the kids.

568
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:51,796
I have to meet a client.

569
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,923
-I can…
- Really

570
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:56,343
The company should give Jiwon a bonus

571
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:58,386
You're the one doing the work

572
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:27,582
Excuse me

573
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,003
Feel sorry

574
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,807
This hairstyle really suits you

575
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:47,185
Everyone is talking about you today

576
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,896
Everyone said they envied Agent Park

577
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:51,981
No

578
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:55,735
Agent Jiang, you and Agent Park are a perfect match.

579
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,445
So envious

580
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,045
Agent Jiang

581
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,839
Yes, Minister.

582
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:28,351
Why are you dressed like this for work today?

583
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,650
Do I look weird today?

584
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:37,944
No, that's not the case.

585
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:43,700
It's ok, I shouldn't ask

586
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:50,748
Because you are considering wearing contact lenses
So I wore it today.

587
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,301
So I want to know if you are doing this for someone too

588
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,803
Or because of someone's relationship?

589
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,389
This makes me feel good.

590
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:12,437
This is the first time I dress like this, and I feel very happy.

591
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:17,400
And because I dress like this
Other people's attitudes toward me have also changed.

592
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,571
It's not that you shouldn't dress like that.

593
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:24,741
Has the attitude towards you changed?

594
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:26,618
That's right

595
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:30,121
But there are people like this

596
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:37,337
I want to deal with people like this
This is how it should be done

597
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:39,380
Start now

598
00:46:40,048 --> 00:46:43,510
I won't be so foolish as to stick to just one form anymore

599
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:45,261
For myself

600
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:48,139
For yourself?

601
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,600
right

602
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,317
But you look really different when you smile

603
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,278
I hope you can smile more often in the future

604
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:08,785
besides

605
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:11,371
Although I still don't quite understand

606
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:16,417
But make some changes in clothing style

607
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,461
It should be better

608
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,005
I recommend you do this, then I'll take my leave.

609
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:27,887
right

610
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:30,390
Don't be so foolish as to stick to just one form

611
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:39,357
Hello? Where are you?

612
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:44,654
I'll leave it to you, Agent Jiang.

613
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:47,323
You can take the bus in front of the shopping mall

614
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:49,409
OK, thank you for your hard work.

615
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:01,754
Because you are considering wearing contact lenses
So I wore it today.

616
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:03,631
Liu Zhihe seems to be interested in you

617
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,474
Oh yeah, I bought it!

618
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:15,476
This is mine!

619
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,231
It's Hee Yeon

620
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,192
Oh yeah!

621
00:48:23,276 --> 00:48:24,277
What's wrong with her?

622
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:26,070
Hee Yeon…

623
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:27,530
What are you doing?

624
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:29,490
-How did you do that?
- I'm very happy

625
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:32,410
Oh yeah, this is mine.

626
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:35,204
Okay, I know you are happy, stop making trouble

627
00:48:37,457 --> 00:48:38,458
Thanks

628
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:42,253
I will never forget
You gave me this limited edition favor

629
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:45,506
I would also appreciate it if you could calm down.

630
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,925
-Please
-Wait a minute

631
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,605
Rumor has it that the Minister and Hee-yeon had an affair

632
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,899
(Personnel changes, staff Liu Xiyan)

633
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:12,241
Kim Kyung-wook claimed that they had an improper relationship

634
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:13,951
So she was transferred.

635
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,621
No wonder

636
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:21,501
That's why we always meet
Because Xiyan and I became familiar with each other

637
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,254
I didn't expect this.

638
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:27,256
Oh my god

639
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:29,759
It almost happened.

640
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:34,055
Park Min-hwan is a useless guy

641
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,182
What is male intuition?

642
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,274
Minister Hee Yeon

643
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:48,653
Are boyfriend and girlfriend

644
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:59,914
Sure enough, the heirs of U&K are different.

645
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,083
I always have to queue up to get in.

646
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,585
I went straight to the VIP room.

647
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:08,047
"What did you say you wanted?
Give her everything she wants."

648
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:09,799
That's what he said

649
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:14,554
- You are excited
-I haven't been this happy in a long time.

650
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:17,598
And he pretended to be uninterested in brand names

651
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:19,350
Really handsome, grandpa

652
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:21,394
There are always a lot of things I want to buy

653
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:25,606
I looked at clothes, bags and shoes
I want my brother to buy them all for me

654
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:29,527
I bought clothes, bags, shoes and coats.
Anyway, it's my brother who swipes the card

655
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,405
He bought them all for me, which is really cool.

656
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,243
I want to stay longer.
I'm sorry to leave so early.

657
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:38,870
It doesn't matter

658
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:44,709
-Hello, Director Lee
-Um

659
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:48,880
You stay with grandpa all day.
What should the Strategic Planning Office do?

660
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,339
Because he is my right-hand man.

661
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:53,134
No, I am grandpa's right-hand man.

662
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:57,847
Grandpa, please take care of your health.
I'll see you again

663
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,099
OK, come play again.

664
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:01,476
-The same to you
-good

665
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:07,523
-Brother, will you take me back?
- We're going in opposite directions

666
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:10,401
What are you talking about? Of course you have to give her a ride

667
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:12,737
It’s so late, you want her to go back by herself?

668
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:14,781
- Get in the car now
- Grandpa, I'm leaving.

669
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:15,698
good

670
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,037
good

671
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,421
Goodbye Grandpa

672
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:42,016
Have you asked about that woman?

673
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:45,311
I put the information in your study.

674
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:54,028
(Bomb me)

675
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,248
Brother Zhihe?

676
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:08,376
Hello?

677
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:13,881
Now?

678
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:55,256
If you want to teach girls self-defense

679
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,091
Is judo really the best?

680
00:52:58,968 --> 00:53:00,803
You treat him like this

681
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:04,181
Is it to teach others self-defense?

682
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,559
Wait, that hurts.

683
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,520
You've worked hard

684
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:14,942
He's so ruthless

685
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:34,337
Every time my dad gives me pocket money
Draw a love heart

686
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,359
Yes, I know

687
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:58,444
I didn't expect it to be so difficult

688
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:01,906
But I can't tell the truth
Makes everything complicated

689
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:06,452
What would you do?

690
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:11,874
Should I tell Ji-won everything?

691
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:15,252
Tell her that Park Min Hwan will have an affair with Jung Soo Min
Then hurt her

692
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:22,009
No, if I were to say

693
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:25,554
I had to tell her
I'm living my second life

694
00:54:31,811 --> 00:54:34,355
Will she believe it? I can't believe it myself.

695
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,821
I still haven't figured out what's going on.

696
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:10,349
(April 13, 2023)

697
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:34,999
Mr. Park Min-hwan, you are suspected of murdering Kang Ji-won
We're going to arrest you.

698
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,211
Ms. Zheng Xiumin, please come with us

699
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:40,713
What?

700
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,339
hateful

701
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,633
stop!

702
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:48,012
Why?

703
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,930
Why are you taking me away?

704
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:52,058
Why do you have to do this? Let me go

705
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:53,934
You can exercise your right to remain silent

706
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:57,897
Everything you say will be used as evidence in court

707
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,901
-Did you hear that clearly?
-What do you mean by murder? How could I have killed anyone?

708
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:04,403
How could I kill someone?

709
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:08,282
It was an accident, at most it was manslaughter!

710
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,450
Okay?

711
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:12,870
Anyway, if I leave her alone, she will die.

712
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,497
Anyway, you have this suspicion

713
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,541
Zheng Xiumin was also arrested as an accomplice

714
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:20,544
If you have something to say, please go to the police station.

715
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:21,837
-What?
-take away

716
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:23,297
Why are you taking me away?

717
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,549
I didn't, it wasn't me

718
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:26,884
Take it away

719
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:30,471
-I didn't, I didn't kill him!
-Let me go!

720
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:31,555
Let me go!

721
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,151
What's going on?

722
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:49,240
So Zheng Xiumin
Are you having an affair with Kang Ji-won’s husband?

723
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:51,200
It's really exaggerated.

724
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:53,786
But how dare she

725
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,830
You suddenly want us to come over?

726
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:59,583
To be honest, I came here because I felt bad.
Was that ten years ago?

727
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:01,627
We held a class reunion at Guse Pavilion

728
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:04,630
At that time, it seemed that we were too harsh on her.

729
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:10,970
Yes, Ji-won really wants Xiu-min
Break up with Bai Enhao?

730
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:14,014
- I don't know
-Ji Won

731
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:15,850
say what?

732
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,561
Eun-ho? Why are you here?

733
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,856
Hey, come here quickly, it's a mess here

734
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,946
What were you talking about?

735
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:31,574
Don't mention your ex-girlfriend Zheng Xiumin

736
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,743
-She conspired with Ji-won’s husband…
-etc

737
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:37,037
I have never dated Zheng Xiumin

738
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,873
Really?

739
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,791
You really haven't dated?

740
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:42,251
Really?

741
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:49,383
What I heard about Kang Ji-won's life that day
Leave me speechless

742
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:51,886
then

743
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,972
I regret everything madly

744
00:57:57,433 --> 00:57:58,475
But…

745
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,229
I got a second chance

746
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:47,983
(April 19, 2013)

747
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:08,212
Looking back, I had a few chances.

748
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:10,506
But this time it's different

749
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:11,632
I am in a good mood indeed.

750
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:13,717
Ji-won, I tell you, men

751
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:15,261
All will cheat

752
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:18,472
Min-hwan, you need to take care of Ji-won

753
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,015
If something has changed

754
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:23,185
Things that weren't a problem before
It may become a problem

755
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:26,188
Where did you go after get off work? Tell me the truth.

756
00:59:26,272 --> 00:59:29,316
I'm worried that Park Min-hwan will hurt you

757
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,818
Are you crazy?

758
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:31,735
minister!

759
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,325
