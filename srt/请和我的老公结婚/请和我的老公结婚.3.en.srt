Heave...

15
00:00:58,675 --> 00:00:59,510
ho!

16
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:02,346
It's a delivery!

17
00:01:05,974 --> 00:01:06,809
Who...

18
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:07,726
FRY ME

19
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:10,145
Hi! Did you order hot fried chicken,

20
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:11,313
spicy chicken,

21
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:13,148
and salty soy sauce chicken?

22
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:15,359
No.

23
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:16,777
Did you order chicken?

24
00:01:17,528 --> 00:01:18,529
How could I?

25
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:19,738
Come. Let's start over.

26
00:01:19,822 --> 00:01:21,031
I got it wrong.

27
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,535
You got fried, spicy,
and soy sauce chicken.

28
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:27,329
And the large fries
and cola are on the house.

29
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,791
- I'm sorry, but--
- Mister.

30
00:01:30,874 --> 00:01:32,960
We didn't order it. Okay? Just go.

31
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,379
Just a second.

32
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:38,048
Was it a cider, not cola?

33
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:40,884
Mister, we didn't order anything.

34
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,553
So just go.

35
00:01:43,095 --> 00:01:44,596
You didn't order chicken?

36
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,932
But this is the address. Apartment 401.

37
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:48,559
I don't care. Just go.

38
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,769
I have to check first.

39
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:51,895
What's with you?

40
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:54,439
You're really pissing me off.

41
00:01:54,898 --> 00:01:57,025
What do you want to do? Well?

42
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:01,613
I'm sure this is it.

43
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:03,699
I'll check, so just wait here.

44
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:08,203
Don't check, and don't come back!

45
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:10,873
- I'll be right back.
- Don't come back!

46
00:02:10,956 --> 00:02:12,249
Go! Hey!

47
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,542
Wait...

48
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,546
Hey, Ji-won. Hey!

49
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:21,675
What the heck?

50
00:02:24,136 --> 00:02:26,805
Ji-won? Open the door.

51
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,601
I don't think we should be doing this.

52
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,188
What? What are you talking about? Hey!

53
00:02:36,231 --> 00:02:39,067
I'm not the delivery man!
It's me. Open the door!

54
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:43,572
Come on. Hey!

55
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:49,745
<i>I'm flustered by how you're acting.</i>

56
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:52,164
<i>What do you think of our relationship?</i>

57
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,334
What is she talking about?

58
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:57,586
Are you sick or something?

59
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:59,922
This isn't like you. Hey!

60
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:02,007
Open the door. What's with you?

61
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:06,428
<i>I think I need some time.
Tell me if it's hard for you.</i>

62
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:08,597
<i>I'll accept whatever you say.</i>

63
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:13,477
Is she kidding?

64
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,078
<i>I'm leaving! You're being so mean.</i>

65
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:56,478
Ji-won?

66
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,563
You can hear me, right?

67
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:02,818
I don't think you're easy.

68
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,154
I love your soul more.

69
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:11,243
Honestly, you're all skin and bones.
There's nothing to see.

70
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,038
Don't get me wrong.

71
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:16,873
Anyway...

72
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:19,876
Sorry about tonight.

73
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:22,504
Good night.

74
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:41,398
That could've been bad.

75
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:46,069
This little...

76
00:04:53,952 --> 00:04:54,953
Damn it.

77
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:05,881
Goodness.

78
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:08,759
I was going to go back up
if he didn't come out.

79
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:11,678
Did I do a good job?

80
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:13,388
Yeah. Good job.

81
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:15,265
I felt like a spy. It was fun.

82
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:17,309
But what's going on?

83
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,191
So...

84
00:05:24,274 --> 00:05:25,192
Shall I go now?

85
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:33,241
EPISODE 3

86
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:37,662
Hey!

87
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:39,372
I swear...

88
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:41,583
Where'd you go with all the chicken?

89
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,419
I had to do all the works alone until now!

90
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:46,379
Ji-hyuk urgently needed me.

91
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,381
You little...

92
00:05:49,591 --> 00:05:50,675
Well...

93
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,718
Come on. Try me.

94
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:53,678
- You should've been faster!
- Do it!

95
00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:56,014
- Try it!
- I thought you ran away.

96
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:57,099
Why you...

97
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,143
But why, all of a sudden?

98
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:02,145
I don't know.

99
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,606
He asked me to fake a misdelivery.

100
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:08,443
I think something's going on.

101
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:09,528
What do you mean?

102
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:12,405
This morning,
he suddenly asked me to find someone,

103
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:13,990
so I made over 100 calls.

104
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:16,076
- To find someone?
- Yeah.

105
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:18,286
- Why?
- I don't know.

106
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,914
He had this look on his face.

107
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,835
So I couldn't ask.

108
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:43,728
You should've been a celebrity instead.

109
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,148
I'm not good in front of people.

110
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:48,441
That's your problem.

111
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:49,693
You're too timid...

112
00:06:50,986 --> 00:06:52,070
I mean, scrupulous.

113
00:06:52,654 --> 00:06:55,740
We could've been huge
if you were a little shameless.

114
00:06:55,824 --> 00:06:57,784
If you appear on TV and do...

115
00:06:57,868 --> 00:06:59,286
a little of this

116
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:00,620
and a little of that,

117
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:03,748
our sales would be through the roof!

118
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,334
I almost forgot.

119
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:10,213
I can't come in this Sunday.
I already told the sous-chef.

120
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,132
What's up? Do you have a blind date?

121
00:07:12,757 --> 00:07:15,844
Are you ready to start dating now?

122
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:17,846
No, it's not that.

123
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,682
I have a high school reunion.

124
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,017
What?

125
00:07:22,726 --> 00:07:23,977
You're going?

126
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:28,440
Don't you avoid these events
since your first love broke your heart?

127
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:30,609
She turned you down harshly, right?

128
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:35,739
You're not the type
to be turned down that easily.

129
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,240
Come on.

130
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,619
By the way,
how did you know about the reunion?

131
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:43,079
You don't keep in touch.

132
00:07:44,372 --> 00:07:45,457
Well...

133
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,049
U&K FOOD MARKETING
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

134
00:07:54,549 --> 00:07:56,218
By any chance,

135
00:07:58,136 --> 00:07:59,638
are you free this Sunday?

136
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,482
You seem like a decent person,

137
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:12,400
but I have a girlfriend.

138
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:14,319
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me?

139
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,948
That's not what I mean.
What are you thinking?

140
00:08:18,657 --> 00:08:20,367
It's not like that. Never.

141
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,830
There's a high school reunion.

142
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:28,959
A man showed up and told me about it.

143
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,878
But I don't know who he is.

144
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,464
He's not from my school.

145
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,217
That sounds suspicious.

146
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,761
It's best not to get involved.

147
00:08:39,844 --> 00:08:42,764
Unless you want to see your first love,
don't go.

148
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:47,769
What did I do?

149
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:50,981
You shouldn't be like that.

150
00:08:52,857 --> 00:08:55,735
I never want to speak to you again.

151
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:58,530
Do you miss her?

152
00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:02,534
Since that traumatic event,
you didn't want to date anyone.

153
00:09:02,617 --> 00:09:04,577
You even wear the fake ring around.

154
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:09,291
Right? I shouldn't go, should I?

155
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:14,170
If you're going to go,

156
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,588
dress to the nines.

157
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,119
No.

158
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,900
<i>To be honest, I was really upset today.</i>

159
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,153
<i>You'll pay the price for it
on Sunday at Goseuljung.</i>

160
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:21,279
<i>Don't be late.</i>

161
00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:24,783
I can't make myself pretty overnight.

162
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:36,795
SUNDAY

163
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:47,764
<i>My other half, are you coming?
Our date's today!</i>

164
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:51,267
<i>Don't be late. Make yourself pretty!</i>

165
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:55,897
I don't know
how pretty you can get overnight,

166
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,067
but as long as you're pretty to me.

167
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:06,324
GOSEULJUNG

168
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:10,787
BUSAN TAEHA HIGH SCHOOL'S 37TH REUNION

169
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:14,791
Jeong Su-min, is that you?

170
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:20,755
You look so pretty!

171
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:22,424
She was always pretty.

172
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,510
You're so cute.
You haven't changed at all.

173
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:27,971
Everyone, Su-min's here. Let's drink!

174
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,055
Let's drink now!

175
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:30,140
Sit down.

176
00:11:31,015 --> 00:11:34,060
Cheers to Busan Taeha High School!

177
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:44,487
Since you got the job at the big company,
your vibe feels a bit changed.

178
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,781
You feel like a classy city lady now.

179
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,576
I got lucky.

180
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:51,619
Ji-won supported me a lot.

181
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:53,997
Do you still see her?

182
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,125
She's my other half.

183
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,503
You're too soft. You're still a pushover.

184
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,005
What's she up to?

185
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,382
Does she still sponge off of you?

186
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:05,884
She's modest.

187
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:08,052
Still, she's gotten a lot prettier.

188
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:10,555
She's coming later actually. I called her.

189
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,349
Wait, she's coming here?

190
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,519
Be nice to her when she shows up.

191
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:19,481
She's going through a hard time.

192
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:20,857
Why is that?

193
00:12:23,985 --> 00:12:28,990
Remember how I put in a referral
and got her a contract job at U&K?

194
00:12:29,073 --> 00:12:31,659
Now, she has a crush on Mr. Park Min-hwan.

195
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:34,120
Park Min-hwan?
Isn't he the one you're into?

196
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:35,663
Is he the same person?

197
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:39,250
What?

198
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,378
Well...

199
00:12:43,671 --> 00:12:46,132
No. It's not what you think.

200
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,302
Don't bring it up to her.

201
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:51,262
- Please, don't.
- Why not?

202
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:55,141
She's at it again!

203
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:58,019
OTHER HALF

204
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:02,065
Hey, Ji-won.

205
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,650
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

206
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,659
I'll get you if you can't find your way.

207
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,670
I'm here. I'm behind you.

208
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:36,474
Ji-won...

209
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:37,809
What's going on?

210
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:39,602
It wasn't just us for dinner?

211
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,024
It's been a long time.

212
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:58,498
MARRY MY HUSBAND

213
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,042
I can't make myself pretty overnight.

214
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,012
Ms. Kang!

215
00:14:14,095 --> 00:14:16,389
You said you had plans on Sunday,

216
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:18,349
so how about we hang out tomorrow?

217
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:29,277
SATURDAY

218
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,744
STOCK BALANCE: 1,403,000 WON

219
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:39,996
It went up to 1.4 million won.

220
00:14:40,496 --> 00:14:43,750
I invested 3 million,
so this means it's 6 million now.

221
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:47,003
Once my next paycheck comes in,

222
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,463
I'll invest it all.

223
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:20,495
What the heck?

224
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,998
It's a lot more different than I thought.

225
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:34,759
<i>That's why the general manager
told me to not wear it.</i>

226
00:15:36,386 --> 00:15:37,887
I'm such a fool.

227
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,943
So pretty.

228
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,618
Ji-won!

229
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,915
Sorry I'm late!

230
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,166
No, it's fine.

231
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:12,213
You look so pretty today!
You wore the clothes I bought you.

232
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:15,383
For today, ta-da!

233
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,593
Matching hats.

234
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:23,599
Here's yours.

235
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,061
It looks so great on you!

236
00:16:27,603 --> 00:16:28,604
Thanks.

237
00:16:29,397 --> 00:16:31,858
I wish glasses looked good on me too.

238
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,445
You'd look prettier without them.

239
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:40,074
Again with your lack of confidence.
You're pretty! So pretty!

240
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:42,660
Where's Min-hwan?

241
00:16:43,286 --> 00:16:44,912
He'll be here soon.

242
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,585
The weather's great today. It's hot.

243
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:53,087
Give me the candy.

244
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:01,512
Sorry. I forgot to buy some more
since we finished it.

245
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:07,268
What? You know how much I like that candy.

246
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:11,147
Sorry.

247
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:16,402
What's up? Did Ji-won upset Su-min again?

248
00:17:16,486 --> 00:17:21,324
Hi, Min-hwan.
She doesn't have my favorite candy today.

249
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,410
If she cared about me,
she would've prepared them.

250
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:25,661
I'm so upset.

251
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:28,873
Why did you do that?

252
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:32,376
That's why I bought some!

253
00:17:33,294 --> 00:17:34,504
My favorite!

254
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,215
- You're the best!
- Great job!

255
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:41,803
- Shall we go see the flowers?
- Sounds good! Bring our stuff!

256
00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:46,390
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

257
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:50,728
Wait!

258
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:57,527
Wow, it's so pretty.

259
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,446
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

260
00:18:01,364 --> 00:18:03,825
- Look over there. Isn't it pretty?
- Yeah.

261
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:09,789
My long-awaited date with you!

262
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:11,624
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

263
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,377
No, that's okay.

264
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,047
Authentique...

265
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:24,387
Su-min gave it to me as a gift.

266
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,013
But this one's a knockoff.

267
00:18:26,097 --> 00:18:27,723
I just learned that.

268
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:35,606
These are real, right?

269
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,316
Yes, they're real.

270
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:41,320
The shine's different, right?

271
00:18:41,404 --> 00:18:43,155
They're beautiful.

272
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:45,241
Thank you. They're pretty, right?

273
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:52,248
Why haven't you been drinking?

274
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,208
It's so nice drinking together.

275
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,336
What do you mean? I drink a lot.

276
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,213
You said you didn't drink.

277
00:18:59,297 --> 00:19:01,674
You said you quit drinking

278
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:04,468
since one big drunken mistake
you made before.

279
00:19:04,552 --> 00:19:06,679
Me? A drunken mistake?

280
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:08,139
<i>Are you okay?</i>

281
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,651
I did quit drinking for a while.

282
00:19:20,735 --> 00:19:23,571
But I started drinking again
because of Min-hwan...

283
00:19:24,822 --> 00:19:26,282
Say what?

284
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,619
You started drinking again
because of Mr. Park?

285
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:33,497
<i>Not now, but five years from now.</i>

286
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:39,128
Drinking in moderation is fine.

287
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:43,299
Being scared of another mistake
seemed like a dumb idea to quit drinking.

288
00:19:44,342 --> 00:19:47,136
- Do you want fried dumplings?
- Yeah!

289
00:19:48,638 --> 00:19:51,307
- Can we get six more fried dumplings?
- Okay.

290
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,977
<i>Back then, the drunken mistake
felt like a huge deal to me.</i>

291
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,812
<i>I had completely forgotten.</i>

292
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,942
<i>Why did I reflect so much
and become so withdrawn?</i>

293
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,443
Here are your dumplings.

294
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:03,903
Thank you.

295
00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:06,030
I really like you.

296
00:20:06,697 --> 00:20:08,658
You're bright and healthy.

297
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,243
Is that where your name comes from?

298
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:12,620
That's right.

299
00:20:12,703 --> 00:20:15,081
My name means "joyous connection."

300
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:17,416
"Be a joyous connection to anyone."

301
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,876
That's my motto.

302
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:21,003
I knew it.

303
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,672
Let's make a toast!

304
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,591
- To a joyous...
- Connection!

305
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,642
Try it. It's so good!

306
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:36,602
- Like right now?
- Yeah!

307
00:20:36,686 --> 00:20:37,853
Eat it right now?

308
00:20:39,522 --> 00:20:41,691
Isn't it good? It's so good!

309
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,651
Isn't it so good?

310
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:45,403
To be honest with you,

311
00:20:45,486 --> 00:20:47,279
I'm glad we met today instead.

312
00:20:47,697 --> 00:20:50,950
On Sundays, we can't drink so much
because we work the next day.

313
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:52,118
You're right.

314
00:20:53,536 --> 00:20:55,454
Isn't your reunion tomorrow?

315
00:20:55,538 --> 00:20:57,999
- Shall we drink in moderation?
- Oh, that.

316
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,335
I haven't decided to go yet.

317
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:08,009
To be honest,
I wasn't just an unpopular girl.

318
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:09,218
I've been bullied.

319
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:12,138
What? You were bullied?

320
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:14,348
But why?

321
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,851
I don't know.

322
00:21:16,934 --> 00:21:19,020
Everyone suddenly hated me.

323
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:23,232
So that made me feel small

324
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,192
and make more mistakes.

325
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:28,487
And everyone hated me more for that.

326
00:21:29,697 --> 00:21:31,407
You should've asked them why.

327
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,617
How could I?

328
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:36,871
How will you know if you don't ask?

329
00:21:36,954 --> 00:21:41,250
Honestly, I'm the type to run away
when things get too hard,

330
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,961
but you should try
all you can before that.

331
00:21:45,296 --> 00:21:48,507
I need to know
if these people are simply crazy

332
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:51,177
or have good reasons

333
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,179
so I won't have regrets later.

334
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:55,765
No regrets?

335
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,433
Yeah.

336
00:21:57,933 --> 00:22:01,062
<i>It makes so much sense.
Why hasn't this occurred to me?</i>

337
00:22:02,772 --> 00:22:05,983
Su-min is just too nice.

338
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:09,070
Ever since high school, Ji-won--

339
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:10,571
Ye-ji, wait.

340
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:13,657
Ji-won wasn't at her seat earlier.

341
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:18,913
<i>I need to hear the rest.</i>

342
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:19,997
You're right.

343
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:24,043
I should go if I don't want to regret it.

344
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,634
What is it?

345
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,720
Turning a shameful past into history...

346
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:36,013
It sounds easy,

347
00:22:36,597 --> 00:22:39,642
but it can't be done overnight
for someone like me.

348
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,477
That may be true.

349
00:22:41,977 --> 00:22:43,854
But you can try.

350
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:47,983
- I can?
- A stitch in time saves nine!

351
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,570
Those who are prepared will not fail!

352
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,708
What are you doing?

353
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:06,168
I love dumplings.

354
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,213
I want to eat them at home later.

355
00:23:13,717 --> 00:23:16,929
It's finally time for me
to repay your kindness!

356
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,243
Hello!

357
00:23:39,326 --> 00:23:41,078
It's been a while, Hui-yeon.

358
00:23:41,162 --> 00:23:44,582
This is my favorite superior at work.

359
00:23:44,665 --> 00:23:45,708
Hello.

360
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,751
Hello, I'm Designer Song Jae-min.

361
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:49,503
Shall we go now?

362
00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:51,380
Yeah, let's go.

363
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:59,847
I'm going to pay with my membership here.

364
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,266
- No, Hui-yeon.
- Hush!

365
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:03,350
My savior.

366
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:05,477
Focus.

367
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:07,771
The membership that expires today?

368
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:09,773
That's great news.

369
00:24:09,857 --> 00:24:12,568
What would you have done
without her, Hui-yeon?

370
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,613
Your hair's so healthy.
Any style would look great.

371
00:24:15,696 --> 00:24:17,448
Shall we do an S-curl perm?

372
00:24:17,531 --> 00:24:18,949
How about a wavy perm?

373
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:22,745
A too radical change might make you

374
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,623
feel like
you're a completely different person.

375
00:24:25,915 --> 00:24:29,585
Let's do a soft wavy perm.
She needs an eyelash perm too.

376
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,046
- Let's trim her eyebrows--
- Wait.

377
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,927
I do want to be a different person.

378
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:44,183
Okay, got it.

379
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:48,020
Then you'll be reborn today.

380
00:24:49,897 --> 00:24:52,107
Also, grab a new hair part for her.

381
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,234
And...

382
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:54,401
Her makeup!

383
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:55,319
Is Ms. Nam here?

384
00:24:55,402 --> 00:24:56,612
Yes. I'll call her.

385
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:01,408
I'm going to introduce you to a new you.

386
00:25:01,492 --> 00:25:03,744
You'll meet her in front of a mirror.

387
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:26,350
<i>Those who aren't mentally mature like you</i>

388
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:28,894
<i>judge others by their looks.</i>

389
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,564
<i>If you want something, dress accordingly.</i>

390
00:25:32,648 --> 00:25:33,941
<i>That's the start.</i>

391
00:26:12,229 --> 00:26:14,898
Perfect!

392
00:26:14,982 --> 00:26:16,775
You look incredible!

393
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:18,110
It looks good on you!

394
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,946
You're so pretty. Do you like it?

395
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:28,097
How's this?

396
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:33,310
So nice!

397
00:27:33,394 --> 00:27:35,771
Classic is timeless!

398
00:27:43,654 --> 00:27:45,739
No, maybe next time.

399
00:27:46,323 --> 00:27:48,367
Why? It's great!

400
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,538
This needs to go to someone else.

401
00:27:59,628 --> 00:28:02,214
Dude, you're spitting all over the meat.

402
00:28:02,297 --> 00:28:03,507
Is it a cold?

403
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,093
It's from the smoke! I'm not sick.

404
00:28:08,762 --> 00:28:11,557
What? Your girl didn't pick up
or call you back?

405
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,434
I don't call Ji-won.

406
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,229
Real players just let it be.

407
00:28:17,771 --> 00:28:20,065
RECENT CALLS
KANG JI-WON

408
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:22,776
CALL FAILED

409
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,320
You let them be, and they start to think.

410
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:28,115
Once they start thinking, they'll give in.

411
00:28:28,824 --> 00:28:31,452
- You don't know anything.
- Help me with this.

412
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:33,495
Watch.

413
00:28:34,037 --> 00:28:35,414
Do you want some help?

414
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,625
The hammock!

415
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:40,419
I'm great with this.

416
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:42,546
Shall we open it? One, two, three.

417
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,179
Come by and have some BBQ later.

418
00:29:03,192 --> 00:29:06,195
But this bitch is holding out longer
than I thought.

419
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:08,947
You're going to die anyway.

420
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,741
Get lost!

421
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,160
The dumplings are cold now.

422
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,163
Excuse me. More dumplings...

423
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:08,799
Thanks, Hui-yeon.

424
00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:19,893
<i>About the meal kit.</i>

425
00:30:19,977 --> 00:30:21,812
<i>I'll look at your proposal.</i>

426
00:30:21,895 --> 00:30:23,772
<i>Ju-ran and Su-min will be on the team.</i>

427
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,108
<i>They'll make up for what you lack.</i>

428
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:29,111
Did he read my proposal?

429
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,864
Jeong Su-min will be on the team?

430
00:30:35,617 --> 00:30:36,618
Wait.

431
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:43,125
<i>You didn't forget about tomorrow, right?
Goseuljung, 5:30 p.m.</i>

432
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,587
OKAY

433
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,801
Hello?

434
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,678
Ji-won, it's me.

435
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:57,639
What did you do today?

436
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,935
I had <i>tteokbokki </i>with Hui-yeon today.

437
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:04,271
She's sleeping right now.

438
00:31:05,272 --> 00:31:07,858
Yu Hui-yeon is
at your house right now? Why?

439
00:31:07,941 --> 00:31:10,152
We were talking, and she fell asleep.

440
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:12,154
We had some drinks too.

441
00:31:17,284 --> 00:31:18,535
Hello?

442
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:20,037
You should've called me.

443
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:25,667
Did I do something to upset you?

444
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:29,254
No. Did you do something
that might upset me?

445
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:30,589
No, nothing.

446
00:31:34,051 --> 00:31:36,845
I called to ask for a favor.

447
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:41,058
What is it?

448
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:45,771
I was wondering...

449
00:31:46,396 --> 00:31:47,439
This...

450
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:49,024
It's about your proposal.

451
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,734
...is great!

452
00:31:50,817 --> 00:31:52,110
It's really great.

453
00:31:52,194 --> 00:31:53,987
Can I fix it a little
and propose it again?

454
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:56,657
Can I fix it a little
and propose it again?

455
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,033
What do you think?

456
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,999
No, you can't. It's my proposal.

457
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:10,087
Why not? Yours was rejected.
I got a good feeling.

458
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,214
<i>I want to be a full-time employee.</i>

459
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,007
Let's succeed together, pal!

460
00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:17,177
You should've told me.

461
00:32:17,886 --> 00:32:19,346
<i>If I had known,</i>

462
00:32:19,429 --> 00:32:21,223
I wouldn't have fixed it.

463
00:32:23,016 --> 00:32:25,769
Sorry, I'll give you my next good idea.

464
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,522
<i>Also...</i>

465
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,319
Stop calling me by my name at work.

466
00:32:34,903 --> 00:32:37,614
<i>We're friends,
but we have different positions</i>

467
00:32:37,698 --> 00:32:41,993
and I'm more experienced. You're crossing
the line by making me run coffee errands

468
00:32:42,077 --> 00:32:43,328
and ordering me around.

469
00:32:44,538 --> 00:32:47,624
Let's not mix business
with pleasure, okay?

470
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,379
- What?
- I've got to go. See you tomorrow.

471
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:01,680
What was that?

472
00:33:04,307 --> 00:33:07,144
Ji-won, how dare you do this to me?

473
00:33:11,606 --> 00:33:15,110
<i>I changed my reservations for you
to go to the reunion.</i>

474
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,195
<i>See you tomorrow, girl.</i>

475
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,407
<i>I love you. See you tomorrow.</i>

476
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,909
<i>I bought new earrings to show you, Ye-ji!</i>

477
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,914
I swear.

478
00:33:27,998 --> 00:33:31,710
Just when I put my guard down,
she forgets what a loser she is.

479
00:33:33,086 --> 00:33:34,296
It's okay.

480
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,548
I'll just have to teach her again.

481
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:39,968
<i>Make sure to wear the earrings I got you.</i>

482
00:33:44,097 --> 00:33:46,391
MEAL KIT PROPOSAL FOR SINGLE HOUSEHOLDS

483
00:33:49,686 --> 00:33:52,147
Over here! The chicken came out. Come on.

484
00:33:53,607 --> 00:33:54,941
What did your mom say?

485
00:33:55,942 --> 00:33:57,986
I said I'd be with you, so she's okay.

486
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:01,656
My mom is so silly.

487
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,075
I'm 31. Why do I still have a curfew?

488
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,953
It's because you're so pretty.

489
00:34:07,037 --> 00:34:08,163
She's just worried.

490
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,707
Let me tell you about women.

491
00:34:14,294 --> 00:34:16,171
They should grow up sheltered.

492
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:18,632
Here.

493
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,552
So what if my mom raised me like this?

494
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:26,640
I need to meet a reliable man like you
to continue a life like this.

495
00:34:35,482 --> 00:34:36,608
That's right. Yeah.

496
00:34:37,526 --> 00:34:39,444
We're done talking about work,

497
00:34:39,528 --> 00:34:42,280
- so I can call you Gyeong-uk, right?
- Wait.

498
00:34:44,324 --> 00:34:45,951
Of course.

499
00:34:46,034 --> 00:34:47,744
From now on,

500
00:34:48,537 --> 00:34:50,288
we're more than just coworkers.

501
00:34:52,374 --> 00:34:54,292
PREPARED: ASSISTANT MANAGER KANG JI-WON

502
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:58,547
Here.

503
00:35:25,031 --> 00:35:27,993
GOSEULJUNG

504
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:41,584
<i>Hey, Ji-won.</i>

505
00:35:42,126 --> 00:35:43,628
Hey, where are you?

506
00:35:50,218 --> 00:35:52,595
I'll get you if you can't find your way.

507
00:35:55,348 --> 00:35:56,850
I'm here. I'm behind you.

508
00:36:06,442 --> 00:36:08,111
Ji-won...

509
00:36:10,321 --> 00:36:13,199
What's going on?
It wasn't just us for dinner?

510
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:24,127
It's been a long time.

511
00:36:29,966 --> 00:36:31,634
Wow, what happened?

512
00:36:31,718 --> 00:36:34,345
How did the loser Kang Ji-won
get so pretty?

513
00:36:35,847 --> 00:36:39,350
I don't remember you,
so you're pretty much a stranger.

514
00:36:39,434 --> 00:36:40,435
You're very rude.

515
00:36:41,936 --> 00:36:43,187
Was I? Sorry.

516
00:36:43,271 --> 00:36:45,315
I'm so clueless.

517
00:36:46,149 --> 00:36:47,650
He hasn't changed.

518
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:49,068
He was clueless then.

519
00:36:49,152 --> 00:36:51,070
- He's still clueless now.
- Wow.

520
00:36:52,071 --> 00:36:54,490
You even copied Su-min's earrings.

521
00:36:55,116 --> 00:36:56,951
And you want to talk about manners?

522
00:37:00,538 --> 00:37:01,581
Earrings?

523
00:37:02,832 --> 00:37:04,459
No, they're not the same.

524
00:37:05,043 --> 00:37:07,587
These look really nice.

525
00:37:10,423 --> 00:37:13,509
Those look a little cheap.

526
00:37:14,135 --> 00:37:15,762
Are those knockoffs?

527
00:37:15,845 --> 00:37:17,805
Wow, did you copy her?

528
00:37:17,889 --> 00:37:20,642
Su-min,
you should've bought authentic ones.

529
00:37:20,725 --> 00:37:22,769
There are so many great knockoffs.

530
00:37:22,852 --> 00:37:25,688
Forget it. It can happen if you're broke.

531
00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:30,151
FIVE HOURS AGO

532
00:37:38,618 --> 00:37:41,412
Makeup is a skill.
You get better with practice.

533
00:37:55,635 --> 00:37:57,595
When it comes to knockoffs...

534
00:37:58,346 --> 00:37:59,347
No.

535
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,932
For copies,

536
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:04,310
there are different grades.
S grade, A grade, B grade.

537
00:38:04,394 --> 00:38:06,896
Anyone can tell
these are super fake dupes.

538
00:38:07,772 --> 00:38:09,065
They are?

539
00:38:09,148 --> 00:38:13,403
They're knockoffs that don't have
the decency to pretend to look real.

540
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:19,367
There's only one reason
for a gift like this.

541
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:23,538
Humiliation.

542
00:38:28,126 --> 00:38:29,877
- I...
- Let's have a drink.

543
00:38:29,961 --> 00:38:31,587
<i>I'm sure you had one more.</i>

544
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,339
<i>To show that I copied you</i>

545
00:38:33,423 --> 00:38:37,051
<i>so yours look real compared to mine.</i>

546
00:38:38,177 --> 00:38:39,554
- I...
<i>- But...</i>

547
00:38:39,637 --> 00:38:41,139
<i>too bad.</i>

548
00:38:41,222 --> 00:38:42,932
Wear mine to dinner!

549
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:47,020
<i>I think I found a real friend.</i>

550
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:48,646
Excuse me.

551
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:25,892
Kang Ji-won is incredible.

552
00:39:25,975 --> 00:39:28,269
Why did she come? She has no friends here.

553
00:39:28,352 --> 00:39:30,021
She must be here to eat.

554
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:32,315
Did you see her? She looks so poor.

555
00:39:37,862 --> 00:39:39,822
Kang Ji-won is incredible.

556
00:39:39,906 --> 00:39:41,991
Why did she come? She has no friends here.

557
00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:43,576
She must be here to brag.

558
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:45,912
Did you see her? Everything looked new.

559
00:39:45,995 --> 00:39:49,332
Why are you talking like
you're from Seoul? It's weird.

560
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,335
Still, how is she still hanging out
with Su-min?

561
00:39:52,418 --> 00:39:53,544
Isn't it obvious?

562
00:39:53,628 --> 00:39:57,131
Su-min, that softie is
just too nice to her.

563
00:39:57,215 --> 00:39:59,550
She stays by her and steals everything!

564
00:39:59,634 --> 00:40:01,511
I hate her.

565
00:40:01,594 --> 00:40:03,221
She really is incredible.

566
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,725
Su-min is just too nice.

567
00:40:08,184 --> 00:40:09,811
We should take care of her.

568
00:40:09,894 --> 00:40:12,980
Ever since high school, Ji-won--

569
00:40:13,064 --> 00:40:14,440
Ye-ji, wait.

570
00:40:15,483 --> 00:40:16,567
What?

571
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:18,694
Ji-won wasn't at her seat earlier.

572
00:41:00,778 --> 00:41:02,446
Were you here all this time?

573
00:41:03,197 --> 00:41:05,908
- Why did you pretend like you weren't? I--
- Then...

574
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:07,994
I came in here first.

575
00:41:08,077 --> 00:41:10,329
Do I have to come out to greet you?

576
00:41:21,716 --> 00:41:23,718
Don't mind me and keep talking.

577
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:25,052
I'm curious too.

578
00:41:25,136 --> 00:41:28,014
What did I do to Su-min in high school?

579
00:41:29,515 --> 00:41:30,516
You don't know?

580
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,102
You coveted and copied everything of hers.

581
00:41:33,352 --> 00:41:35,938
Didn't you copy Su-min
with those earrings?

582
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:40,860
These?

583
00:41:41,527 --> 00:41:43,696
Su-min gave these to me as a gift.

584
00:41:51,412 --> 00:41:52,538
But they were fake.

585
00:41:53,122 --> 00:41:54,248
It was too obvious.

586
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:57,460
So I bought the authentic ones.

587
00:41:57,543 --> 00:42:00,129
Still, they're matching earrings, right?

588
00:42:01,923 --> 00:42:03,132
I'm still curious.

589
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,053
What else did I covet of hers?

590
00:42:07,803 --> 00:42:09,347
A guy!

591
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:13,559
What's his name? Park Min-hwan!
I heard you were interested in her guy.

592
00:42:13,976 --> 00:42:15,561
People don't change.

593
00:42:15,645 --> 00:42:19,440
Su-min dated Eun-ho in high school,
and you made them break up.

594
00:42:21,484 --> 00:42:24,111
I told Su-min to break up with Eun-ho?

595
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:26,405
They were dating?

596
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:29,867
And Su-min has something going on
with Min-hwan?

597
00:42:30,409 --> 00:42:32,119
She recommended you for a job

598
00:42:32,203 --> 00:42:35,164
at a company like U&K,
and you stole her man.

599
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:36,749
That's crossing the line.

600
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:40,419
I can't even deal with this.

601
00:42:42,046 --> 00:42:43,631
- What did you say?
- Hey.

602
00:42:44,757 --> 00:42:48,511
If you're going to be mean
after hearing one side of the story,

603
00:42:48,594 --> 00:42:51,305
at least try to fact-check first.

604
00:42:54,934 --> 00:42:55,935
Listen up.

605
00:42:58,062 --> 00:42:59,772
U&K FOOD MARKETING
ASSISTANT MANAGER KANG JI-WON

606
00:42:59,855 --> 00:43:01,732
I'm an assistant manager at U&K.

607
00:43:02,858 --> 00:43:04,944
I hear contract workers get cards too.

608
00:43:05,027 --> 00:43:06,988
What's this? How can we trust you?

609
00:43:07,071 --> 00:43:10,491
I joined the company seven years ago.
When did Su-min join?

610
00:43:11,784 --> 00:43:15,746
I remember recommending her
in my second year as assistant manager.

611
00:43:16,122 --> 00:43:18,666
- About last year?
- That's right.

612
00:43:18,749 --> 00:43:22,211
I asked about her cover letter,
so it was early last year.

613
00:43:24,005 --> 00:43:25,381
The strangest thing

614
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:27,258
is about Park Min-hwan.

615
00:43:27,717 --> 00:43:29,552
He's my boyfriend.

616
00:43:34,598 --> 00:43:35,975
PARK MIN-HWAN

617
00:43:36,058 --> 00:43:36,892
SPEAKER

618
00:43:43,566 --> 00:43:44,942
<i>Hey, babe.</i>

619
00:43:45,026 --> 00:43:47,320
I'm at my school reunion. Did you call?

620
00:43:48,237 --> 00:43:49,530
What?

621
00:43:49,613 --> 00:43:52,366
I wanted you to have fun,
so I didn't call.

622
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:53,784
<i>I must've butt-dialed.</i>

623
00:43:55,244 --> 00:43:58,122
I see. That's great.

624
00:43:58,205 --> 00:44:00,583
Say hi to my friends.

625
00:44:02,418 --> 00:44:03,419
Friends?

626
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:08,174
Hello.

627
00:44:08,257 --> 00:44:12,261
Hi, we're Ji-won's friends.

628
00:44:12,345 --> 00:44:15,097
Are you really Ji-won's boyfriend?

629
00:44:15,181 --> 00:44:18,434
Hello, I'm Ji-won's boyfriend.
Park Min-hwan.

630
00:44:18,517 --> 00:44:21,479
I didn't know Ji-won had friends
other than Su-min.

631
00:44:21,896 --> 00:44:23,898
Take care of Ji-won for me.

632
00:44:23,981 --> 00:44:25,066
I should've said--

633
00:44:25,149 --> 00:44:26,567
Hello? Hey?

634
00:44:29,403 --> 00:44:30,404
What was that?

635
00:44:34,158 --> 00:44:35,368
Good enough?

636
00:44:53,177 --> 00:44:55,388
Ji-won!

637
00:44:57,681 --> 00:44:59,642
- Where are you going?
- You...

638
00:44:59,725 --> 00:45:00,976
Hey, Kang Ji-won!

639
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,107
Yeah, fine.

640
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:07,650
But back in high school,

641
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:10,236
why did you tell her
to dump her boyfriend?

642
00:45:22,415 --> 00:45:24,125
Stop it, guys!

643
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:27,795
You shouldn't torment your friends. Don't!

644
00:45:27,878 --> 00:45:28,879
So dirty!

645
00:45:31,132 --> 00:45:33,300
I almost forgot.

646
00:45:34,635 --> 00:45:36,095
That's so strange.

647
00:45:37,012 --> 00:45:39,598
I did have feelings for Eun-ho.

648
00:45:39,682 --> 00:45:41,767
Su-min never dated him.

649
00:45:45,479 --> 00:45:46,689
Did you date Eun-ho?

650
00:45:56,115 --> 00:45:57,116
Well...

651
00:46:02,621 --> 00:46:05,916
I'm sorry, Ji-won.
I couldn't tell you back then.

652
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,210
I knew you liked Eun-ho.

653
00:46:08,794 --> 00:46:10,921
How could I tell you we were dating?

654
00:46:15,468 --> 00:46:19,013
What are you talking about?
You said I told you to dump him.

655
00:46:19,096 --> 00:46:20,764
Then shouldn't I have known?

656
00:46:24,643 --> 00:46:26,729
I made a mistake.

657
00:46:26,812 --> 00:46:29,773
It was a secret relationship,
so I didn't tell you.

658
00:46:29,899 --> 00:46:32,193
Did I know or not?

659
00:46:35,654 --> 00:46:38,157
How terrifying. Ji-won, you're scary!

660
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,743
You have no friends
because of your temper.

661
00:46:40,826 --> 00:46:44,246
- Why are you nitpicking?
- You did the same, so I did too.

662
00:46:45,748 --> 00:46:47,708
I didn't ask questions back then.

663
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:50,794
Did you forget how you tormented me
for three years?

664
00:46:52,046 --> 00:46:55,299
Even now, I showed you my card
and explained everything.

665
00:46:55,382 --> 00:46:57,343
And now you don't like my temper.

666
00:46:57,885 --> 00:46:59,637
What if your card is fake?

667
00:47:00,221 --> 00:47:02,473
Like the fake bag you brought tonight?

668
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:06,018
What the hell are you saying?

669
00:47:06,101 --> 00:47:08,229
I went to the department store

670
00:47:08,312 --> 00:47:11,815
and bought this in 12 monthly installments
with my first paycheck!

671
00:47:12,233 --> 00:47:13,275
Or not.

672
00:47:14,276 --> 00:47:16,403
You're a funny one.

673
00:47:16,987 --> 00:47:19,365
You call it fake based on an assumption

674
00:47:19,448 --> 00:47:21,534
and now what? "Or not?"

675
00:47:22,117 --> 00:47:23,911
Then what more should I say?

676
00:47:24,453 --> 00:47:26,956
You should apologize and say you're sorry!

677
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:28,791
You should apologize to me!

678
00:47:32,253 --> 00:47:33,462
You believed Su-min

679
00:47:33,546 --> 00:47:35,631
and bullied me for three years.

680
00:47:36,674 --> 00:47:39,635
Do you still want to do this
at a high school reunion?

681
00:47:43,389 --> 00:47:44,640
I understand.

682
00:47:44,723 --> 00:47:48,852
You don't want to apologize because
you just wanted to bully me. Right?

683
00:47:48,978 --> 00:47:50,479
What are you saying?

684
00:47:51,188 --> 00:47:54,441
I'm a very honest person.

685
00:47:54,984 --> 00:47:58,612
So you're saying
Su-min and Eun-ho didn't date, right?

686
00:47:58,946 --> 00:48:02,449
The parties involved said they did.
Who are you to say that?

687
00:48:05,327 --> 00:48:07,413
I don't know about anything else...

688
00:48:23,929 --> 00:48:25,639
But I can tell you one thing.

689
00:48:30,769 --> 00:48:32,271
Su-min and I

690
00:48:35,566 --> 00:48:36,609
never dated.

691
00:48:52,916 --> 00:48:55,461
It's been a long time, Ji-won.

692
00:49:01,036 --> 00:49:02,663
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

693
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,792
No need.

694
00:49:10,671 --> 00:49:12,881
- I'm sorry.
- Explain yourself.

695
00:49:13,507 --> 00:49:14,758
This is a promise.

696
00:49:14,841 --> 00:49:16,051
When you break it,

697
00:49:16,134 --> 00:49:19,596
you must give a suitable reason.
I can't understand it,

698
00:49:20,806 --> 00:49:22,891
so how can I ask for understanding?

699
00:49:23,308 --> 00:49:25,102
I can't explain.

700
00:49:25,977 --> 00:49:27,104
It's not right,

701
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,856
so I can't do it.

702
00:49:32,192 --> 00:49:33,652
Ji-hyuk,

703
00:49:33,735 --> 00:49:37,072
you will inherit U&K Group.

704
00:49:37,155 --> 00:49:40,117
As the CEO,
is that what you're going to say to people

705
00:49:40,701 --> 00:49:42,911
when you make important decisions?

706
00:49:42,994 --> 00:49:45,080
Is that how you'll run the company?

707
00:49:45,497 --> 00:49:48,834
If I take over,
I'm sure no one will ask me to explain.

708
00:49:53,422 --> 00:49:56,633
No matter how good you are,

709
00:49:57,509 --> 00:50:01,054
you can't beat someone
who works hand-in-hand with another.

710
00:50:01,138 --> 00:50:03,014
Traditionally, a great man

711
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,726
must have a partner.

712
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:07,769
A great partner.

713
00:50:09,479 --> 00:50:10,522
Do you think so?

714
00:50:10,605 --> 00:50:12,149
Yes, even your father...

715
00:50:18,071 --> 00:50:20,157
Young people these days

716
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,493
talk nonsense about
how it's better not to get married.

717
00:50:23,577 --> 00:50:24,828
Do you feel that way too?

718
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:26,580
Marriage...

719
00:50:28,165 --> 00:50:29,207
is what I want.

720
00:50:31,209 --> 00:50:32,878
There's someone I like.

721
00:50:34,921 --> 00:50:36,173
Anyway.

722
00:50:37,924 --> 00:50:38,925
That's that.

723
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:46,933
Do I know her?

724
00:50:48,894 --> 00:50:51,480
Which family is she from? What's her name?

725
00:50:54,775 --> 00:50:56,067
It's one-sided.

726
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,615
What?

727
00:51:02,908 --> 00:51:05,285
I studied business as told.

728
00:51:05,368 --> 00:51:07,287
I went to the US branch as told.

729
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:10,707
I joined the marketing team
after you asked me to return.

730
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:13,168
I did everything you asked, Grandfather.

731
00:51:13,668 --> 00:51:14,878
This time,

732
00:51:16,463 --> 00:51:17,631
just trust me.

733
00:51:17,714 --> 00:51:19,633
How dare you?

734
00:51:19,716 --> 00:51:21,593
Did you think I wouldn't know?

735
00:51:21,676 --> 00:51:22,677
When have you

736
00:51:22,761 --> 00:51:26,097
ever done anything you didn't want to?

737
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:29,559
You listened to me
because you didn't have your own dreams.

738
00:51:29,643 --> 00:51:31,061
It was always like that.

739
00:51:32,145 --> 00:51:35,023
Then you should know
I'll go my way this time too.

740
00:51:35,106 --> 00:51:36,358
What? You little...

741
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,914
I'm letting you know.

742
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,085
I like someone.

743
00:51:58,505 --> 00:52:00,924
I don't want any issues with women.

744
00:52:26,157 --> 00:52:29,286
Who is this woman he's fallen for?

745
00:52:29,995 --> 00:52:31,204
Look into it.

746
00:52:31,788 --> 00:52:35,417
He's never made a mistake before.

747
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,544
That's what scares me more.

748
00:52:37,627 --> 00:52:41,381
People don't just turn over
a new leaf like that.

749
00:52:41,965 --> 00:52:45,802
True. He's not the kind of man
who would be persistent

750
00:52:46,553 --> 00:52:47,679
about women issues.

751
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:50,140
Then...

752
00:52:51,308 --> 00:52:52,726
What about Chairman Oh?

753
00:52:53,226 --> 00:52:54,895
I can't control my own son.

754
00:52:54,978 --> 00:52:57,188
How can I control my grandson?

755
00:52:58,481 --> 00:53:00,817
Apart from that, if he can't, he can't.

756
00:53:02,611 --> 00:53:04,654
After his mother died,

757
00:53:05,739 --> 00:53:07,407
he never spoke for long.

758
00:53:09,367 --> 00:53:11,411
Why is he suddenly like this?

759
00:53:13,121 --> 00:53:15,081
- Then...
- Look into it.

760
00:53:16,124 --> 00:53:18,668
The sooner we nip it in the bud,
the better.

761
00:53:31,306 --> 00:53:32,474
This is hard.

762
00:53:33,308 --> 00:53:35,101
<i>There's a high school reunion.</i>

763
00:53:35,185 --> 00:53:36,519
A high school reunion?

764
00:53:38,605 --> 00:53:40,607
By chance, do I know you?

765
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:43,610
No, I just thought
you should know about it.

766
00:53:44,986 --> 00:53:46,237
Why would you tell me?

767
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:47,822
Do you remember Kang Ji-won?

768
00:53:50,367 --> 00:53:53,078
I know there was
a misunderstanding back then.

769
00:53:53,161 --> 00:53:56,414
If it's okay with you,
it'd be good to clear the air.

770
00:53:56,498 --> 00:53:57,916
Misunderstanding?

771
00:53:57,999 --> 00:54:01,378
No, wait. Who would it be good for?

772
00:54:03,254 --> 00:54:05,090
It will benefit Kang Ji-won.

773
00:54:06,424 --> 00:54:07,592
Please.

774
00:54:19,896 --> 00:54:21,940
GOSEULJUNG

775
00:54:29,656 --> 00:54:31,658
- Yes.
- <i>Sir, where are you?</i>

776
00:54:31,741 --> 00:54:33,910
<i>- Are you on your way?</i>
<i>- </i>I'm on my way.

777
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:43,378
Isn't that Baek Eun-ho?

778
00:54:43,461 --> 00:54:46,214
- It is him!
- He's completely fine.

779
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:48,758
Why didn't you answer my calls?

780
00:54:48,842 --> 00:54:50,969
Wait, what are you doing here?

781
00:54:51,052 --> 00:54:52,429
Actually, never mind.

782
00:54:53,013 --> 00:54:54,014
Did you just say

783
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,434
you and Su-min never dated?

784
00:55:01,646 --> 00:55:02,689
By the way,

785
00:55:04,482 --> 00:55:06,401
did you like me?

786
00:55:08,361 --> 00:55:10,905
Then why did you do that back then?

787
00:55:24,461 --> 00:55:27,505
GOSEULJUNG

788
00:56:03,374 --> 00:56:04,793
She dressed up like that

789
00:56:05,585 --> 00:56:07,212
to go to the reunion?

790
00:56:29,818 --> 00:56:30,902
Wait.

791
00:56:33,738 --> 00:56:34,989
Stop.

792
00:56:35,073 --> 00:56:36,908
What I mean to say is...

793
00:56:42,705 --> 00:56:45,041
Sorry about that.

794
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,294
Let me wipe your hand.

795
00:56:57,345 --> 00:56:58,513
What am I doing?

796
00:57:04,936 --> 00:57:06,187
I have to go now.

797
00:57:08,815 --> 00:57:11,067
Yeah. Okay.

798
00:57:12,277 --> 00:57:14,737
No.

799
00:57:14,821 --> 00:57:17,991
I want to say something.

800
00:57:18,074 --> 00:57:19,492
I never liked you.

801
00:57:21,244 --> 00:57:22,245
That was

802
00:57:23,621 --> 00:57:25,039
just a slip of a tongue.

803
00:57:32,046 --> 00:57:33,047
I...

804
00:57:34,966 --> 00:57:36,301
had a crush on you!

805
00:58:14,484 --> 00:58:17,484

<i>From now on, I won't just foolishly
stick to formalities anymore.</i>

807
00:58:35,276 --> 00:58:36,819
<i>You're so pretty.</i>

808
00:58:36,903 --> 00:58:38,696
- I'm sorry.
- It made him crazy.

809
00:58:38,821 --> 00:58:40,240
You look really pretty.

810
00:58:40,323 --> 00:58:43,117
You bullied her on your own,
don't come at me!

<i>Don't worry, my other half.
This time, I really won't let it slide.</i>

<i>Mr. Yu. It's nice to see you smile.</i>

813
00:58:51,042 --> 00:58:53,503
I think Yu Ji-hyuk likes you.

814
00:58:54,337 --> 00:58:56,589
Right. There was a scandal about them.
