1
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,048
JI-WON

2
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:56,140
Kill me.

3
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:12,948
Was I destined to die in
Park Min-hwan's hands?

4
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:18,829
Ji-won.

5
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:21,916
Ji-won.

6
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,834
Ji-won!

7
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,726
Wait. Hold on...

8
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,336
Tell me again.

9
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:15,010
I won't answer Lee
Jae-won's calls.

10
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:18,097
If he comes to the house,
I won't open the door,

11
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,182
and call you right away.

12
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,144
Mr. Lee.

13
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:29,066
Thank you for driving me to the
hospital every time like this

14
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:32,194
and giving me
divorce advice, but--

15
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:34,613
You don't have to
thank me for that.

16
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,781
It's work for me.

17
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,452
I get paid a lot
of money from U&K.

18
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,539
I do what my employer wants.

19
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,211
Okay.

20
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:00,973
But you said you cared about me.

21
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,443
You just have to say your piece.

22
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,572
Just a moment.

23
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,784
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

24
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,829
Hey, what is it at this hour?

25
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:25,497
I'm at the police station.

26
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:26,707
The police station?

27
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:30,502
I'll be right there.

28
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,088
No, go to the hospital instead.

29
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,633
YUIL MEDICAL CENTER

30
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,926
EPISODE 15

31
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,641
Excuse me.

32
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:47,686
Kang Ji-won, 32, transferred from
U&K in Gangnam. Where is she?

33
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,023
Ji-won.

34
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,860
Her breathing and
pulse are stable now.

35
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:58,739
But she has a fever, so we'll
check her once she wakes up.

36
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:03,369
It was an assault, so she came with
the police. I'll get you her record.

37
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,543
Hey.

38
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,171
I'm going to ruin your life,

39
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,048
so brace yourself.

40
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,927
I'll tell the media a
third-generation tycoon assaulted me.

41
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,889
You can't cover
things up these days.

42
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,309
I have nothing to lose now.

43
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:29,895
Thanks to you.

44
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,359
But isn't Ji-won too inferior
to ruin your life over?

45
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,445
She's nothing but
skin and bones.

46
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,618
Mr. Yu.

47
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,162
Do you want some advice?

48
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,540
Don't trust her.

49
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,793
Do you know why I went mad?

50
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,921
Ji-won makes people
lose their minds.

51
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,758
Ji-won and I aren't the
ones that ruined you.

52
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,677
It's your trashy personality.

53
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:08,142
Look how you beat me. Is
your personality any better?

54
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,520
You can't do this
because you fight better.

55
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:16,900
That's a bit rich, considering what
you did to a woman half your size.

56
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:18,902
What?

57
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,160
You seek equality when
at a disadvantage,

58
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,412
and strength when
at an advantage.

59
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,293
I hate using my strength.

60
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,589
But not to you.

61
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,552
Mr. Yu, you can come out.

62
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:47,639
Let's go.

63
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,060
What about me?

64
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,895
Why can't I come out?

65
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,315
What about me?

66
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,860
Do you really think
you can't go any lower?

67
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,449
You're wrong.

68
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,499
No, wait. Is it
because he's rich?

69
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,375
I work at U&K too!

70
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,336
What about me?

71
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,049
One law for the rich and
another for the poor!

72
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,513
Min-hwan is fired as of today

73
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,599
for assaulting a colleague
and violating the rules.

74
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:31,809
Find anything else.

75
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,852
I checked during
his affair incident.

76
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,730
AWOL and unclear
corporate card statements.

77
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,774
And he illegally
treated clients.

78
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,735
Good. Doesn't he
have a company loan?

79
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,404
I'll ask the bank for
a repayment request.

80
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,407
I'll add assault, injury,
and anything else.

81
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,326
And Ms. Kang is...

82
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:52,996
She's at home.

83
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,707
It's what she wanted.

84
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,085
I happened to be with Ms. Yang.

85
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:02,047
So I left Ms. Kang with her,
but she didn't look good.

86
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,890
You said there was a debt that
Min-hwan hadn't paid off, right?

87
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,144
Put some pressure on that.

88
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,937
Or buy the bonds.

89
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,106
I'll look into it.

90
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,071
Mr. Yu.

91
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,074
How's Ji-won?

92
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,869
She's not good.

93
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:36,498
I think she'll be better if she
sleeps, so I'll get her some milk.

94
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,375
There's nothing in her house.

95
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,420
Are you okay?

96
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,339
Well, yes.

97
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:49,178
Thank you. I'll take it from
here. You should go home and rest.

98
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,629
Ji-hyuk.

99
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,308
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,437
I'm sorry for everything.

101
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,489
Were you hurt?

102
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,574
What's this?

103
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,038
Hello.

104
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,209
Is that all?

105
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,670
It can't be.

106
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:33,675
Considering you called because
your husband's in my care,

107
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,302
there should be more.

108
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,688
How about going to
China for a while?

109
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:52,319
Oh, my. We would be so thankful
if you could do that for us.

110
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,738
It'll be a rough ride
on the ship though.

111
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:59,576
That's nothing at all. We
couldn't even get the job done.

112
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,079
If you give us another chance,

113
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,040
I'll hit the accelerator
and crush her.

114
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,792
So just let me know.

115
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:07,918
Yeah, thank you.

116
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,923
Poor people always
try to keep a record.

117
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,344
As insurance.

118
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,555
What do you want?

119
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:26,395
Do you hate that I'm
taking care of your father?

120
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:31,441
Now that crushing Kang Ji-won
isn't so simple anymore,

121
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,569
you suddenly say,
"Don't do anything."

122
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:39,449
Then Park Min-hwan suddenly
asks me for a divorce,

123
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,078
and my dad won't pick
up, so I realize,

124
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,748
"I'll get screwed over."

125
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:52,212
Judging by the
look on your face,

126
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,258
you're nothing special.

127
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:01,638
Darn it. Why have I been
cooped up at home like that?

128
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,308
I ask the questions now.

129
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,144
What can you do for me?

130
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:19,448
Are the shrimps in Korea poisonous?
Why don't they know their place?

131
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:28,206
Have the bodies of Jeong Man-sik
and Bae Hui-suk been found?

132
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll check the police report.

133
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,840
Make sure there's
no news about it.

134
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:41,219
Jeong Su-min shouldn't
feel threatened now.

135
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,764
Park Min-hwan and Jeong Su-min.

136
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,517
Can we take care of
them both at once?

137
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,443
PARK MIN-HWAN

138
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:00,906
Hello?

139
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,991
I'm at the police
station right now.

140
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,952
I'm sorry, but can
I ask for a favor?

141
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,705
What? The police station?

142
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,748
SUNGSAM POLICE STATION

143
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,167
We got you out, but
it's pretty serious.

144
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,794
We may not be able to cover it.

145
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,172
What? What are you saying?

146
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,175
It wasn't what we agreed on.

147
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:25,055
If we have to fight U&K head-on,
the burden on Ms. Oh will be big.

148
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,139
Hey!

149
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,143
What's with the attitude?
Who do you think you are?

150
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,395
You're not the VP of Cloud Air!

151
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,528
Hey.

152
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:40,946
You're not either.

153
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:42,906
So don't be rude.

154
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:46,993
Damn it.

155
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,873
You only know how to fight in
the ring. Watch your mouth.

156
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,708
You're just Yu-ra's henchman.

157
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,253
Don't act like you're my boss.

158
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,837
Bastard.

159
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,551
Mister, wait!

160
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,930
Why would you give
him a nosebleed?

161
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,974
Is there a reason I can't?

162
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,268
He gave me attitude!

163
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,103
Damn it...

164
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,021
He's just worried about me.

165
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:18,149
Since your wife came
and threatened me today.

166
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:21,194
It was scary.

167
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,822
What? About what?

168
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:27,200
She said you asked for a
divorce. She won't go down alone.

169
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,620
She won't let you
get away alone.

170
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,040
Is she out of her mind? Damn it.

171
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,167
Hold on.

172
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,752
U&K HR DEPARTMENT

173
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,673
Work's calling me. Hang up.
I'll call you back later.

174
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,135
Hello?

175
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,513
Mr. Park, I called to say
you're fired as of today.

176
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,724
You didn't come to work today,

177
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:55,562
so the legal team has sent someone
to deliver your written dismissal.

178
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,609
Where are you?

179
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:04,321
Someone from your workplace
is here. You're fired?

180
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,948
What on earth have
you been doing?

181
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,909
I am calling to inform

182
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:14,497
your obligation to repay the U&K
guaranteed loan is effective as of today.

183
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:15,415
Damn it!

184
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,840
Why does he keep calling?

185
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,676
SNAKE LOANS

186
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,011
-Sir.
-What?

187
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,097
Why won't you pick up?

188
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,353
When the trust is gone,

189
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:40,023
we get a physical rights
waiver signed, you see.

190
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,610
For those who don't
pay back money,

191
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,571
which hole should we
poke to get it back?

192
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,157
Hole? What hole?

193
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,371
Those damn thugs.

194
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,290
Please.

195
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,708
Su-min.

196
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:00,835
Crap.

197
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,089
Damn it...

198
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,049
I did stocks.

199
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,135
I earned quite a lot.

200
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,845
Please, Su-min!

201
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,890
Have some money. Please!

202
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:20,397
I need her certificate...

203
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,399
Please, be there.

204
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,025
It's there!

205
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,860
Her certificate's here!

206
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:29,072
What's her password?

207
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,704
Su-min, please have some money.

208
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,624
Please!

209
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,837
80,230,537 WON

210
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,755
She has 80 million won?

211
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,424
80,230,537 WON

212
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,050
Why does she have so much?

213
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,039
She stole the money for her dad?

214
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,139
She's really something.

215
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,903
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

216
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,404
Mr. Yu?

217
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,699
YUIL MEDICAL CENTER

218
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:55,992
Sue me for adultery?

219
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,660
You?

220
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,663
Damn...

221
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,124
I mean...

222
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,502
-Call security.
-How could you?

223
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,337
Sir, you can't do this here.

224
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,713
Doctor.

225
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,298
-Doctor.
-Are you drunk?

226
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,259
I'm her husband.

227
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:17,096
But she was hiding here
and ignoring my calls.

228
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,934
And she sued me for adultery.

229
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,228
Without evidence.

230
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,188
I have it.

231
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,483
Do you really want
to do this here?

232
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,901
At the hospital?

233
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,528
What do you have?

234
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,947
The dashcam recording?

235
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,241
There's no video.

236
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:40,370
Ju-ran.

237
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,873
Ju-ran!

238
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,295
You can't divorce me with that!

239
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,173
You must have the
video. Hard evidence.

240
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,092
-Let's get you outside.
-Come on.

241
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,595
Yeon-ji will be
fatherless because of you.

242
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,687
Who are you? What's
going on? Let go!

243
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,898
Did you even read
the divorce papers?

244
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:11,609
Lee Seok-jun.

245
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,362
I'm Ms. Yang Ju-ran's lawyer.

246
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,573
Lawyer?

247
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,533
I'll apply for a
restraining order.

248
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,122
Never come back.

249
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,252
Are you okay?

250
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:30,920
Yes.

251
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:36,175
The doctor is good and
confident about the surgery,

252
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,052
-so don't worry.
-Right.

253
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,721
Is Ji-won okay?

254
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,060
As far as I know, yes.

255
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:52,692
But you should worry
about yourself.

256
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,331
It's been a while.

257
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:11,127
I was so surprised
to get your call.

258
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:15,548
It's nice to see
you after so long.

259
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:17,842
Can I take your order?

260
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,428
Have you been well?

261
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,640
Yes, I have.

262
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:33,149
To be honest, I'm
not doing that well.

263
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:39,155
Min-hwan and I are
getting a divorce.

264
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,492
I left the house yesterday.
I'm staying upstairs.

265
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,243
I'm going to rest for now.

266
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:49,832
It must be karma.

267
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,422
Blinded by love, I betrayed

268
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,008
my only best friend.

269
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,887
In the end...

270
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,977
Anyway, I'm all alone now.

271
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,898
The divorce makes
this easier to say.

272
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,446
Did you try to kill Ji-won?

273
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,459
I would've done the same.

274
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,131
I'm saying I know
Ji-won and Min-hwan are

275
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,259
seeing each other again.

276
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:44,429
Are they really...

277
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,557
seeing each other again?

278
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,355
Let's charge them with adultery.

279
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:59,027
I'll let you know
when and where to go.

280
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,779
If you want, I'll get
you the best lawyer too.

281
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:07,326
You just fulfill your
role as his legal spouse.

282
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,084
Why?

283
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,587
Because it's not fair.

284
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,466
Isn't your life ruined
because of Min-hwan?

285
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,390
If you divorce, you won't be rewarded
for your work at the company.

286
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:31,851
You'll be left with nothing.

287
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:33,853
That's true...

288
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,397
for me.

289
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,277
But what do you gain?

290
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,832
I want to get Kang Ji-won back.

291
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,921
I like Ji-won.

292
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,883
So I hate that she's with him.

293
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,763
I'm going to make
her come back to me.

294
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:12,683
So help me.

295
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:27,990
Can I ask you something?

296
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,206
Why do you hate me?

297
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:41,796
Because you're selfish.

298
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,967
There are those who gnaw
at people around them.

299
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:50,805
You are that type,
so I hate you.

300
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,309
You don't know me that well.

301
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:57,228
You don't trust anyone, do you?

302
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,481
That's because you're
not trustworthy.

303
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:06,779
You think everyone's like you,
so you can't trust anyone.

304
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,742
How can you work with
me thinking like that?

305
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,205
Didn't you ask me
why I hated you?

306
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:18,958
I never said I
couldn't work with you.

307
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,337
Let me know when you decide.

308
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,474
It went well.

309
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:39,061
As you said, she asked
me why I was helping her.

310
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:44,984
I didn't think she'd believe me if
I lied, so I mixed in some truth.

311
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:54,493
Except that it'll be Oh Yu-ra
and Park Min-hwan instead,

312
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,370
everything I said was true.

313
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,247
Also...

314
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:03,419
There's an insurance policy
provided to company employees.

315
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,629
A family insurance.

316
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,008
It compensates yourself,
spouse, and immediate family.

317
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,136
You can decide to
keep it when you quit.

318
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,346
SECOND HAND MARKET

319
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,224
A notice will go to
Park Min-hwan soon.

320
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:25,024
I can take care of the more
urgent debt if this gets sold.

321
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,487
He doesn't know such
insurance existed,

322
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,113
but he will soon.

323
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,075
The stage is being set.

324
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:04,021
Shall I just die?

325
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:08,150
Though it's useless if
Min-hwan doesn't decide to die.

326
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:09,485
If I die...

327
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,616
my mom and dad can get my
life insurance benefit.

328
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:23,124
Min-hwan could've stopped
several times on his way here,

329
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,793
but he didn't.

330
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,588
He'll go all the way.

331
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,216
Then there's no problem.

332
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,261
Jeong Su-min will
go all the way too.

333
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,393
Why is everyone

334
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,270
looking for Kang Ji-won?

335
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:49,608
I think Jeong Su-min is more
obsessed with you right now.

336
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,990
It's that moment now.

337
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,747
All that's left is for
her to experience it.

338
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,145
How about returning to Japan?

339
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,400
Yu Ji-hyuk is moving more
actively than before.

340
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,486
He's pressuring Park Min-hwan

341
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,697
with his debt and private
loans. He won't last long.

342
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:39,950
And he hasn't given up
on Man-sik and Hui-suk.

343
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:43,287
He got all the CCTV footage
from the abandoned factory.

344
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:44,830
He won't find anything,

345
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:48,042
but nothing good can come
from fighting U&K head-on.

346
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,260
You must not be confident.

347
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,097
Seeing how you're
telling me to run away.

348
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,267
It's okay.

349
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:09,480
His grandfather is different.

350
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:13,901
Unlike Ji-hyuk, who's like
a flower in a green house,

351
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,569
he's realistic.

352
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:20,366
He knows how much of a
nuisance Cinderella can be.

353
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,095
Checkmate.

354
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:46,016
I can never beat you.

355
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,395
You want everything, so
I can read your hand.

356
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:54,442
A good leader should know how to
give up something that's not theirs.

357
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,819
Okay.

358
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,198
Hey!

359
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:04,827
Hi.

360
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,912
We were just playing janggi.

361
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,747
And I lost again.

362
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,461
But I think I can beat
you. Do you want to play?

363
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:16,547
Grandfather.

364
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,924
You asked me to bring
the woman I like.

365
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,136
I will introduce her to you.

366
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,140
So don't let Yu-ra
into the house anymore.

367
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,269
You said it was one-sided and
weren't going to make it work.

368
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,854
Did you change your mind?

369
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,064
Yes, I'm going to pursue it.

370
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,569
So I can't have my ex-fiancée
frequenting my house.

371
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,201
I was so indifferent
during our engagement.

372
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,496
I didn't know he
was so impatient.

373
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,498
People like us

374
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:53,334
can't marry for love, can we?

375
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,338
Get permission from your
grandfather before you--

376
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,255
I will.

377
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:00,799
I'll introduce her now.

378
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,111
Hello, I'm Kang Ji-won.

379
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:35,376
Let's get rid of Kang Ji-won.

380
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:38,212
You're not going back to Japan?

381
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,381
I can't live with
myself if I lose.

382
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:44,426
Why do I have to feel this
way over those cockroaches?

383
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,597
Yeah, I should've
done it myself.

384
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:51,350
It's a headache
having others do it.

385
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:12,663
I've decided to face the obstacles
that are bound to happen.

386
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:24,174
When I met you last time,

387
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:28,095
there's something
I didn't tell you.

388
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,767
Powering through isn't a
solution to everything.

389
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,315
I'm aware he gave you a
lot for seeing him briefly.

390
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,985
So what are you going
to do from now on?

391
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,864
I'll look back and
reflect on my faults.

392
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,450
I'll correct what I can.

393
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,160
And the rest...

394
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,039
I guess it is what it is.

395
00:31:56,123 --> 00:32:02,087
It's time for you to step back
and say, "It is what it is."

396
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,260
So you knew.

397
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,309
I gave him hell for that.

398
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:18,604
That won't ever happen again.

399
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,734
He lacks so much.

400
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,446
You spoiled him.

401
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,866
He only knows how to work.
He has no concept of money.

402
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:35,871
Honestly, I was flustered
because he was like a rich boy.

403
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,083
What are you trying to say?

404
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:46,507
But I liked that about him.

405
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,261
To tell you the truth,
I lack a lot too.

406
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,558
When I thought he was a perfect
third-generation chaebol,

407
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:59,061
he seemed unreachable.

408
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:05,192
But he can be foolish,
get angry, and messy.

409
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:08,278
He gets embarrassed,
and sometimes...

410
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:12,616
he acts like a baby.
Seeing those sides of him,

411
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,956
I thought we could
do well together.

412
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:28,465
I want to be happy with him.

413
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:33,512
Sir.

414
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:39,643
Please, give Yu Ji-hyuk to me.

415
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,533
Park Min-hwan's termination
will be finalized by tomorrow.

416
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:59,955
By the way, why did you ask about
the insurance for employees?

417
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,790
They don't usually keep it.

418
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:05,043
It's just a company perk.
Most don't know about it.

419
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:08,045
Park Min-hwan will do it.

420
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,157
That looks good.

421
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:36,867
Three.

422
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,619
How's the taste and texture?

423
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:46,418
As you predicted, the spinach pasta
with sea snails was most popular.

424
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:48,045
It'll be the main product.

425
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,922
That's good.

426
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:54,467
Sea snails and spinach aren't common
ingredients for pasta in Korea...

427
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,428
Oh, right.

428
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:57,805
Look at the camera.

429
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:58,972
Okay.

430
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,434
Yes, that's good.

431
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:04,019
Just be comfortable.

432
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,271
He's going to get
a natural look.

433
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:12,820
YU HUI-YEON

434
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,538
Great job today.

435
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:27,167
It was nothing. You saved me from
being unemployed. I appreciate it.

436
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,629
I'll send you the
recipe revisions soon.

437
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,089
-It's hard.
-Yeah.

438
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:35,342
I'll send you the draft
and factory schedule too.

439
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:36,677
Okay.

440
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:38,804
By the way,

441
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:44,685
I didn't see Yu Hui-yeon
and Yu Ji-hyuk today.

442
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,605
Mr. Yu was there all day.

443
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,483
I haven't seen Hui-yeon either.

444
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:52,818
Where did she go?

445
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,447
I should get going.

446
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:00,242
-Goodbye!
-Bye!

447
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:10,586
JEONG SU-MIN

448
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:14,590
CALL DECLINED

449
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,180
JEONG SU-MIN

450
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:23,098
CALL DECLINED

451
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,698
Why not pick up my calls?

452
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:42,284
Why won't you pick up?

453
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:46,121
Why do I have to
pick up your calls?

454
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,086
Yeah, I get it.

455
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:57,049
You were with him for seven
years, but he chose me over you.

456
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,926
I'm sure it was hard to accept.

457
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,677
But still,

458
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:06,558
how could you seduce a married man? I'm
about to get divorced because of you.

459
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,026
Is this security?

460
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,028
This is the 16th floor.

461
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,113
An outsider is here.

462
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:21,907
Take care of her.

463
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,786
What are you doing?

464
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,246
Do you think I'd let it slide?

465
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:30,457
Hey.

466
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:35,629
Why would I sleep with someone
else's man? I'm not you.

467
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:42,803
Right, you seduced Min-hwan this
way, so I'm sure you know best.

468
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:49,643
But if he betrayed his
girlfriend of seven years,

469
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,397
why didn't you know he
could do the same to you?

470
00:37:55,774 --> 00:38:00,821
I'll put posters up here to make
you two too ashamed to work here.

471
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,322
I won't stand for it.

472
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,203
That's too bad.

473
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:13,083
Your husband was fired.

474
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:21,466
So stop suspecting me, and
go be a good wife. Oh, wait.

475
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,260
You two are divorcing.

476
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:26,680
That's too bad.

477
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,225
But...

478
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,228
thinking about it
is pissing me off.

479
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,649
Only you would covet
trash like Min-hwan.

480
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:39,651
Why would I?

481
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:45,365
Unless I was a fool.

482
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:58,336
Let go. I'm going. Let me go!

483
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:09,848
Min-hwan, Jeong Su-min just came
and caused a fuss. It scared me.

484
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:16,688
But rumors won't spread here since
everyone thinks Su-min's crazy.

485
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,860
Oh, no. I sent it to
the wrong person. Sorry.

486
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:25,030
Is she out of her mind?

487
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:30,160
I won't stand for this.

488
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,211
Jeong Su-min will call me soon.

489
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:50,889
JEONG SU-MIN

490
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,475
I'm going to ruin Kang Ji-won.

491
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,018
Have her.

492
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:59,022
In return, she has to
hit rock bottom first.

493
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,566
I'll make her beg.

494
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,443
I won't cooperate before that.

495
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,453
We have Su-min in our hands.

496
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:15,288
I'll try to move Min-hwan.

497
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:19,459
I think he's gotten it by now.

498
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,341
HAEYEONG VILLA

499
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:30,011
What would U&K send me?

500
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,351
U&K LIFE INSURANCE POLICY

501
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,145
What the heck?

502
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:41,106
I was fired. I have no
money to pay for this.

503
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:59,666
SPOUSE'S DEATH AFTER
INJURY 500 MILLION WON

504
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:36,995
You may not have a
reason to cover for me,

505
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,372
but we can make a deal.

506
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:43,960
I'll take care of Su-min
so she won't bother you.

507
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,465
Tell them to bring
one more meal.

508
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:51,134
Let's eat first.

509
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:07,317
So how will you take
care of your wife?

510
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,949
I'm broke, so I was
going to kill myself.

511
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,243
But there's a way to live.

512
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:19,871
And I think that
might help you too.

513
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,836
SPOUSE'S DEATH AFTER
INJURY 500 MILLION WON

514
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,339
You can only get
this after death.

515
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,508
If Su-min disappears,

516
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,552
there won't be anyone
to threaten you.

517
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,392
It won't be easy. We have
to get our story straight.

518
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,436
But can't you help me?

519
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47,232
You want me to clean
up your mess? Again?

520
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,818
Not just that.

521
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,987
Set it up for me too.

522
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:57,158
Money and connections are everything,
but I don't have any of them.

523
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,496
You've got guts.

524
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,085
If you don't have anything,
you should at least have guts.

525
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:11,172
But isn't that all you have?

526
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,427
You think it was easy to decide?

527
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,555
This is my last resort.

528
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,473
I'll risk my life.

529
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:25,645
This is your last chance.

530
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:42,454
Park Min-hwan is at Oh
Yu-ra's suite right now.

531
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,376
So it's today.

532
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:56,509
JEONG SU-MIN

533
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:06,728
Park Min-hwan and Kang Ji-won
are in room 1355 at Winton Hotel.

534
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,150
Room 1355.

535
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,234
Room 1355.

536
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,334
Move.

537
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:21,029
But I think you're
really smart, babe.

538
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:24,991
But that is pretty genius.

539
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:28,077
Going after your wife's
life insurance benefit?

540
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:30,371
How did you think
of cancer insurance?

541
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:36,085
Once I get paid, I'll treat
you to something nice.

542
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,134
Don't worry.

543
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:46,262
I know how to return
the favor properly.

544
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:52,602
Oh, my God!

545
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,822
Damn...

546
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,203
Whoever it is,
this is ridiculous.

547
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:12,497
Hey, Min-hwan.

548
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:18,169
You're a piece of trash
that can't be handled.

549
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:23,925
What are you going
to do about it?

550
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,053
Right?

551
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:32,183
I'm going to send the voice
recording to the police.

552
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,270
Where's my dad?
Did you kill him?

553
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:39,774
Kill him?

554
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,694
I thought you were trying
to get Ji-won back.

555
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,737
What are you doing
here with her?

556
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,656
I heard you were fired.

557
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:50,034
Since you have a lot of
free time, spend it in jail.

558
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:53,329
Are you insane?

559
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,003
Get lost!

560
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:03,131
Let go of me!

561
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:04,215
Let go!

562
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:06,175
Damn it...

563
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:09,679
What do I do now?

564
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,223
What do you mean?

565
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:14,350
We'll go forward with your plan.

566
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,644
But not here.

567
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:19,022
I'll set it up for you.

568
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:22,275
Ms. Oh.

569
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,373
If Park Min-hwan
kills Jeong Su-min,

570
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:42,503
set it up as murder
for the insurance claim

571
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:45,548
and distribute it to the media.

572
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:50,553
I'll get it ready, but...

573
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:54,849
Make sure whatever he
says about me is nonsense.

574
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,894
Get rid of all the
evidence, got it?

575
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:32,303
What do you think you're doing?

576
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,315
So why did you do
something like that?

577
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:49,404
You're great, but you
don't know your place.

578
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:56,077
I have money. I'll
give it all to you.

579
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,504
If you kill me,

580
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:09,716
do you think she'll
leave you alone?

581
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:20,184
Su-min.

582
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:23,563
I'll give it to you.

583
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,275
You really have hard
evidence on Oh Yu-ra.

584
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,446
But too bad for you.

585
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:35,783
She erased it when
you passed out.

586
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:38,327
What?

587
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:41,414
You dummy.

588
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:46,127
People like us shouldn't

589
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:49,130
go against people with power.

590
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,091
What can we do?

591
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:54,260
And...

592
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:57,388
you have no money.

593
00:50:57,472 --> 00:50:58,931
0 WON

594
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,977
What's that?

595
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,021
It wasn't your money anyway!

596
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,774
You stole it when
you had the chance.

597
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:12,278
Oh, right.

598
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,532
You had the bag I
bought for Ji-won.

599
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:19,952
I sold that.

600
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,372
To take care of
urgent matters for me.

601
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,419
Don't be too upset.

602
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,134
You said you wouldn't
go down alone.

603
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,349
One of us has to die.

604
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:44,602
So...

605
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:50,024
I have to take care
of you to start over.

606
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:57,073
Just wait.

607
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,953
Hey! Let me go!

608
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:03,996
Let me go!

609
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:07,208
Let me go!

610
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,377
Let me go!

611
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,920
Let me...

612
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:13,673
Let me go!

613
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:14,841
Hey!

614
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:41,993
The gas...

615
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,214
Where did she go?

616
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,018
Hey!

617
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:11,272
Are you crazy?

618
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,734
Leave the car key
and move aside.

619
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,322
Okay. Just calm down.

620
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:22,825
Put the knife down! Calm down!

621
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,286
I won't die.

622
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:26,829
I'll never die!

623
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,501
Here.

624
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:35,588
Here's the key.

625
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,968
Here it is. Put the knife down.

626
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:43,137
Just take it!

627
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,516
Take it. Here.

628
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,775
You little...

629
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:00,821
Come here.

630
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:02,782
Come here!

631
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,288
Damn it...

632
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:17,213
My lovely wife's going to

633
00:54:17,797 --> 00:54:20,591
die from carbon
monoxide poisoning

634
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:24,762
from a boiler malfunction while
I'm away to get groceries.

635
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:29,308
So stop ruining my life.

636
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:32,019
Just die already.

637
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:34,563
Hey! If you're going to
die, just die already.

638
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:42,446
This is what the
insurance was about?

639
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:45,658
You think it'll go your way?

640
00:54:48,995 --> 00:54:50,246
I think it will.

641
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:54,875
Damn it!

642
00:55:01,424 --> 00:55:04,218
My husband shouldn't
lose his manhood.

643
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:07,263
Damn it...

644
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,142
You little...

645
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,226
No.

646
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:14,895
Kang Ji-won told me

647
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,356
that you were sterile.

648
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,067
What are you talking about?

649
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:23,529
You're shooting blanks!

650
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,948
Want me to spell it out?

651
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:28,993
I didn't miscarry.

652
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,162
I was never pregnant.

653
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:33,748
Do you get it now?

654
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:39,670
I don't think so.

655
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:42,840
-You little...
-Let go, you bastard!

656
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:44,508
-Come here!
-Let go!

657
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:45,634
Let go of me!

658
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:52,099
-Get lost!
-Get lost!

659
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:13,848
I think Ms. Yang's divorce
suit will get easier.

660
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:19,270
The evidence of the affair on the SD card,
I don't know why, but it's been restored.

661
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,106
-Suddenly?
-Yes.

662
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:25,651
The video didn't
work for no reason.

663
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:27,987
It suddenly worked
for no reason too.

664
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,658
I guess they're just
meant to get a divorce.

665
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:53,053
THE LATE PARK MIN-HWAN'S FUNERAL
YUIL MEDICAL CENTER FUNERAL HALL

666
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:19,538
I checked the police report.

667
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:23,792
He fell over a glass table and
died after hitting his head.

668
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:31,258
With the evidence, the police are looking
for Jeong Su-min as the prime suspect.

669
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,762
But the security
cameras didn't work,

670
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:37,306
so they must find
out what happened.

671
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,523
Are you going...

672
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:50,194
to the funeral?

673
00:59:06,252 --> 00:59:09,964
I thought about how nice
it would be if you died.

674
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:12,091
I thought I'd burst
of anger then.

675
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:17,596
Back when those
disappointing times

676
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:21,183
were confirmed with
despair and betrayal.

677
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:24,520
You look so beautiful today.

678
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,230
This little...

679
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,690
Get lost!

680
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:28,774
Just die.

681
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:37,574
I spent all night wondering
why you were like that to me.

682
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:40,411
But it ended like this.

683
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,101
How dare you come here?

684
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:12,860
If you didn't betray Min-hwan,

685
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:17,781
he never would've
married Su-min.

686
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,827
She killed my son.

687
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:25,706
That wench.

688
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:29,793
How could this...

689
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:36,467
She ruined my
precious son's life!

690
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:39,345
My poor boy!

691
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,569
At a pension in Gyeonggi
Province on the 24th,

692
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,447
Park, a man in his
thirties, was found dead.

693
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:02,076
The police confirmed his wife,
Jeong, is the prime suspect.

694
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,162
Isn't this Jeong
Su-min from marketing?

695
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:06,705
Don't you remember?

696
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:08,749
No, they just look alike.

697
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,127
Are you saying Min-hwan's dead?

698
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:13,962
What? Keep it down.

699
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,090
I hear it's him.

700
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:17,049
Hey...

701
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:24,723
What's this?

702
01:01:28,644 --> 01:01:33,357
Park Min-hwan's parents reported a theft.
A thief came in while they were away.

703
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:35,859
It was Jeong Su-min.

704
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,333
That means she's in Seoul.

705
01:01:53,419 --> 01:01:56,672
It's been a day since
the police put out an APB

706
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:58,924
on Jeong Su-min,
the prime suspect,

707
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:02,052
but her exact whereabouts
are still unknown.

708
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,430
-The police -It's fine.

709
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:07,141
assume she's off the
grid and on the run

710
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:11,437
and ask for the citizens'
active cooperation for the case.

711
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:18,610
The suspect is 160 cm
tall with a lean physique

712
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:22,698
and under suspicion of killing
her husband at a pension.

713
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:31,373
But I feel uneasy.

714
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:36,044
You're too nice, so
you wouldn't know.

715
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,802
Some people don't
know when to stop.

716
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:49,641
Unless you stomp
on them completely,

717
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:53,145
they don't stop.

718
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:04,406
You can't be the only
one who's happy, Ji-won.

719
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:08,952
Never.

720
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:44,279
What did I do?

721
01:03:44,363 --> 01:03:46,073
-Do you have proof?
-Pay for what you did.

722
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:49,117
I will stay strong.

723
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:52,162
I'll try a little harder too.

724
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:55,123
She bought thinner. That
means she'll set a fire.

725
01:03:55,207 --> 01:03:57,459
What's the use of
stopping her from coming?

726
01:03:57,543 --> 01:04:00,921
We did what you wanted. Let
me do what I want this time.

727
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:04,258
We can't do anything
about it now.

728
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:06,176
You always think
only about yourself.

729
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:09,304
I learned so many
things because of you.

730
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:11,139
I'm going to kill you!

731
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:13,850
This is the price for your
sins and hell I made for you.

732
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:14,893
Take it.

733
