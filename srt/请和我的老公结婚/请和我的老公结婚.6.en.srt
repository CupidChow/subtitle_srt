Thanks for bringing me home.

13
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:01,824
Ji-won.

14
00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:05,077
Are you not feeling well?

15
00:01:06,495 --> 00:01:09,748
To be honest, my stomach has been hurting
since earlier.

16
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:11,250
Your stomach...

17
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:33,355
Mr. Yu...

18
00:01:34,982 --> 00:01:35,816
Mr. Yu.

19
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:37,067
Mr. Yu!

20
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:38,652
Mr. Yu!

21
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:06,847
Welcome. Where can I take you?

22
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,349
Sir, do you see that man sitting there?

23
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:12,436
- Go over there.
- What? Right up there?

24
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:21,653
Min-hwan?

25
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:27,743
Are you hurt?

26
00:02:28,952 --> 00:02:30,162
Goodness!

27
00:02:31,413 --> 00:02:32,956
Did you get into a fight?

28
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,862
Mr. Yu.

29
00:03:10,577 --> 00:03:13,872
You passed out,
so I brought you to the hospital.

30
00:03:15,832 --> 00:03:18,168
You woke up. Your results just came out.

31
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:25,801
Yu Ji-hyuk, 30, type A blood.
Is that correct?

32
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:26,927
Yes.

33
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,929
You must've lacked sleep lately.

34
00:03:29,846 --> 00:03:31,098
A little.

35
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:32,766
You eat irregular meals.

36
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,518
You must've drank a lot too.

37
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:37,813
Has something been stressing you out?

38
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:45,070
You pushed yourself too hard,
so your brain decided to shut down.

39
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:49,866
Your autonomic nervous system has issues.
We should run more tests.

40
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,785
How's your digestion?

41
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:54,204
I'm sure you had stomach problems.

42
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:56,540
Oh, right. Does your stomach hurt?

43
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,542
Me?

44
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:01,712
She has stomach issues. Can you run tests?

45
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:02,879
Excuse me?

46
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:06,758
Your guardian?
Do you have a medical history?

47
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:09,678
No, it's just gastritis.
I don't need tests.

48
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:12,681
No, you looked like
you were in pain earlier.

49
00:04:12,764 --> 00:04:15,308
It might feel okay because you're shocked.

50
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:17,269
Let's have her tested.

51
00:04:17,352 --> 00:04:19,604
No, I had CT scans done recently.

52
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:20,897
It's just gastritis.

53
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,192
You had CT scans done?

54
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:26,611
Why?

55
00:04:31,116 --> 00:04:33,326
Well, just because.

56
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,120
Just because? CT scans?

57
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,709
But how did you know I had a bad stomach?

58
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:43,211
Because...

59
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:47,215
I saw you take medicine often at work.

60
00:04:50,218 --> 00:04:53,513
Then to be fair,
why don't we run tests on both of you?

61
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:17,788
Min-hwan...

62
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,851
No, stop.

63
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:43,355
I can't hurt Ji-won.

64
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:45,398
I would rather die...

65
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:49,319
I...

66
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:52,072
will leave.

67
00:05:54,783 --> 00:05:56,618
Well, I...

68
00:05:57,911 --> 00:05:59,913
<i>Not so easily.</i>

69
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:11,258
Don't cry, you dummy.

70
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,218
What do we do?

71
00:06:16,346 --> 00:06:17,931
Ji-won...

72
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:21,101
What do we do?

73
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:17,532
- You can keep the change. Yes.
- Are you sure?

74
00:07:17,616 --> 00:07:19,701
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

75
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:28,126
<i>So he got out of the cab here?</i>

76
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:34,591
Get home safely, then.

77
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:39,387
I'll take you home.
My car's near there anyway.

78
00:07:40,096 --> 00:07:41,097
Right...

79
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:52,525
I'm a good person.

80
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,576
<i>He is a good person.</i>

81
00:08:02,911 --> 00:08:06,414
<i>But is it possible for me to trust someone</i>

82
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:08,291
<i>and start over?</i>

83
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,086
I have a boyfriend.

84
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:14,506
He's your subordinate.

85
00:08:15,048 --> 00:08:18,885
And I'm in an awkward situation
because of what happened today.

86
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:24,224
I bet he's thinking about this
a lot right now, so...

87
00:08:24,307 --> 00:08:26,434
Then tell him to be more thoughtful.

88
00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:31,147
Tell him to always treat you

89
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:35,110
more thoughtfully and carefully.

90
00:08:41,783 --> 00:08:43,326
You'll take a cab, right?

91
00:08:54,254 --> 00:08:55,547
I like you.

92
00:09:00,218 --> 00:09:03,138
But I won't do anything
if you don't want me to

93
00:09:03,221 --> 00:09:04,764
or put you in a fix.

94
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:10,812
You just need to say,

95
00:09:11,646 --> 00:09:12,689
"No."

96
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:18,862
I...

97
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:21,072
But not right now.

98
00:09:22,073 --> 00:09:23,283
Think about it first.

99
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,332
I won't do anything if you say no.
So before then...

100
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,877
Mr. Park should be a little...

101
00:09:34,377 --> 00:09:37,380
No, I hope he'll be a lot more thoughtful.

102
00:09:39,257 --> 00:09:40,467
And as for you,

103
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:45,847
I hope you take your time
thinking about it positively.

104
00:09:51,186 --> 00:09:53,855
I promise choosing me
will be a good choice.

105
00:09:55,774 --> 00:09:57,984
I know it's difficult to prove,

106
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,695
but I'm a really good person.

107
00:10:09,537 --> 00:10:11,623
I won't get in, so don't worry.

108
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:08,720
MARRY MY HUSBAND

109
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:07,614
Wow, I seriously couldn't sleep a wink.

110
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:51,616
<i>Good morning. I'm bringing you coffee
on my way to the restaurant.</i>

111
00:12:58,831 --> 00:13:00,792
You were waiting outside.

112
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:04,837
But traffic is bad.
Did you come all the way to give me this?

113
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:06,506
Well, yes.

114
00:13:07,423 --> 00:13:09,092
- Thanks.
- Sure.

115
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:12,428
I had business here.

116
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:31,406
<i>Emergency!
Mr. Yu's in a terrible mood today!</i>

117
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:32,824
<i>Don't stand out today.</i>

118
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:38,663
<i>He seems the same.</i>

119
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:41,874
<i>No, he's not happy and not feeling well.</i>

120
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:47,630
<i>How do you know, Hui-yeon?</i>

121
00:13:48,673 --> 00:13:50,216
<i>Because they're siblings.</i>

122
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:53,845
<i>But they don't resemble each other at all.</i>

123
00:13:53,928 --> 00:13:55,597
<i>I would never have guessed it.</i>

124
00:14:00,602 --> 00:14:03,771
You're the one who doesn't look well.
Are you not well?

125
00:14:05,481 --> 00:14:08,109
Hello. Good morning!

126
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:12,989
Did you sleep well?

127
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:14,490
Yeah.

128
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:23,791
Hello, good...

129
00:14:38,848 --> 00:14:39,682
What? Why?

130
00:14:57,408 --> 00:15:00,286
Why act up if she was going
to walk on eggshells?

131
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,665
This is why women need to be stomped on
every three days.

132
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,584
This is a no smoking area.

133
00:15:07,377 --> 00:15:08,503
Right. Sure, sir!

134
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:10,755
No, wait.

135
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:14,425
What was yesterday about?

136
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,387
Office relationships are banned at U&K.

137
00:15:19,347 --> 00:15:20,765
A dating ban?

138
00:15:20,848 --> 00:15:24,102
In this day and age? That's so outdated.

139
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:26,729
That's why
it hasn't been applied for long.

140
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:29,482
So most people don't know,
but it still exists.

141
00:15:30,316 --> 00:15:32,151
- I mean--
- It exists

142
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:34,112
because it affects work.

143
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:37,699
Like how you acted today, Mr. Park.

144
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,499
Enough with the stupid company rules.
Let's talk about common sense.

145
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,670
Explain yesterday.
Are you stalking my girlfriend?

146
00:15:50,753 --> 00:15:52,004
Or is it mutual?

147
00:15:56,843 --> 00:15:58,344
Right behind that alley,

148
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:01,806
there's our company's warehouse.

149
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:02,849
What?

150
00:16:04,016 --> 00:16:05,685
U&K WAREHOUSE

151
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:08,730
So there is. Yes.

152
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:11,858
On my way there,
I saw a staff's safety compromised.

153
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,611
But before she's your subordinate,

154
00:16:15,695 --> 00:16:18,489
she's my girlfriend.
That's our private lives.

155
00:16:18,573 --> 00:16:20,408
It's affecting work.

156
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:23,703
Like how you acted when you came to work.

157
00:16:27,331 --> 00:16:30,084
Not everyone becomes an adult with age.

158
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:31,753
Or become a man.

159
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:35,590
Women are unhappy when they date a boy
instead of a man.

160
00:16:36,716 --> 00:16:40,178
So for Ji-won's sake, you should break up.

161
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:44,640
Break up...

162
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,395
Don't you think you're out of line?

163
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:52,273
Then let's say it's because I like her.

164
00:16:52,982 --> 00:16:53,983
You like her?

165
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,485
What are you...

166
00:16:58,488 --> 00:16:59,655
Either way.

167
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:03,618
Don't lay a finger on her again.

168
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:11,292
You don't know her that well...

169
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,377
- What time is it?
- What?

170
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:17,548
What are you doing?

171
00:17:18,132 --> 00:17:19,217
It's 11:30 a.m.

172
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:20,968
What are you doing?

173
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:24,847
You didn't hit her, right?

174
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,641
Excuse me? What?

175
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:29,644
You didn't hit her, right?

176
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:31,729
No, I didn't!

177
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:35,983
And will you not threaten her again?

178
00:17:39,403 --> 00:17:40,947
I won't!

179
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,157
And about what happened yesterday?

180
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:47,119
Fine, I'll let it go!

181
00:18:00,424 --> 00:18:01,634
What was that?

182
00:18:01,717 --> 00:18:02,885
What's his problem?

183
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:05,763
Damn it.

184
00:18:09,684 --> 00:18:10,852
- Min-hwan!
- Oh, God!

185
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:13,855
Why would you sneak up on me?

186
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:17,817
You're getting on my nerves more and more.

187
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:20,570
Are you angry about yesterday?

188
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:24,532
I thought about it, and maybe we should...

189
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:27,743
<i>If we break up now,
will something happen with Su-min?</i>

190
00:18:28,244 --> 00:18:29,912
<i>It think it's progressing.</i>

191
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:36,627
Did it hurt yesterday?

192
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:39,797
I'm sorry I grabbed you.

193
00:18:41,841 --> 00:18:44,218
But you know you were wrong too, right?

194
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:47,555
If you hadn't overreacted,
he never would've stepped in!

195
00:18:47,638 --> 00:18:50,558
I'm not a piece of trash
that would hurt women!

196
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:52,393
Violence is a crime. A crime!

197
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:54,437
You treated me like a criminal.

198
00:18:57,273 --> 00:18:59,901
You're so dumb that it drives me crazy.

199
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:04,697
I've held back all this time
since you were so nice to me, but...

200
00:19:09,368 --> 00:19:11,078
I should discipline you now.

201
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:13,831
Let's go.

202
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,962
<i>He let it go so easily.</i>

203
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,506
<i>Will we not break up over this?</i>

204
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,467
<i>Or is something changed?</i>

205
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:27,845
<i>I have nothing solid against Yu Ji-hyuk.</i>

206
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:31,474
<i>He claims he saw us
on his way to the warehouse.</i>

207
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:33,851
<i>And I didn't do anything praiseworthy.</i>

208
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:36,687
Hurry up.

209
00:19:36,771 --> 00:19:37,813
Okay...

210
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:41,317
- Did you go straight home last night?
- What?

211
00:19:48,783 --> 00:19:50,117
I'll go inside now.

212
00:19:51,827 --> 00:19:53,204
Yeah, sure. Of course.

213
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:54,664
I should go too.

214
00:19:55,331 --> 00:19:57,708
So this is where you live.

215
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:00,962
The neighborhood is so pretty and nice.

216
00:20:01,045 --> 00:20:02,755
I like being with you.

217
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,424
What?

218
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:10,221
But...

219
00:20:12,556 --> 00:20:14,225
it's too complicated, right?

220
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,521
Yeah, it is.

221
00:20:27,863 --> 00:20:31,409
But just for tonight,
I want to be honest to myself.

222
00:20:44,505 --> 00:20:47,675
Thanks for taking me home. Get home safe!

223
00:20:52,722 --> 00:20:54,765
Of course. Where else would I go?

224
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:04,275
<i>Something's up.
Or he wouldn't let it go like this.</i>

225
00:21:04,775 --> 00:21:08,154
<i>It's hard to find
better marriage material than her.</i>

226
00:21:08,237 --> 00:21:10,239
<i>Yu Ji-hyuk is the problem.</i>

227
00:21:10,322 --> 00:21:12,366
<i>She only has eyes for me.</i>

228
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,828
<i>- I have to get it together.</i>
- You'd better get it together.

229
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:27,715
<i>I like you.</i>

230
00:21:29,842 --> 00:21:32,636
<i>But I won't do anything
if you don't want me to</i>

231
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,430
<i>or put you in a fix.</i>

232
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:50,613
Kang Ji-won.

233
00:21:52,698 --> 00:21:53,866
Let's have lunch.

234
00:21:54,992 --> 00:21:58,537
Ms. Yang, you know where it is, right?
Meet me there.

235
00:22:06,212 --> 00:22:07,213
You saw it.

236
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:09,507
Let's pass on lunch today.

237
00:22:10,132 --> 00:22:11,133
Then...

238
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:14,303
Su-min's by herself.

239
00:22:15,888 --> 00:22:17,473
I'm not hungry.

240
00:22:17,556 --> 00:22:20,643
I'll just drink some coffee
in the lounge alone.

241
00:22:21,143 --> 00:22:22,770
No, you shouldn't...

242
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:26,732
<i>Something really has started.</i>

243
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:33,030
Okay...

244
00:22:33,114 --> 00:22:34,490
You shouldn't do that.

245
00:22:34,573 --> 00:22:37,785
You can't skip a meal.
You're already too skinny.

246
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:42,498
Don't do that.
Take her out and get her something good.

247
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,419
- Something good?
- I'd treat you,

248
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:49,713
but because of Mr. Kim...

249
00:22:49,797 --> 00:22:51,507
Oh, right.

250
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,302
Do this for me.
You can pay for it with my credit card.

251
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:57,638
- Can I really?
- Go somewhere nice.

252
00:22:58,139 --> 00:22:59,223
Okay.

253
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:06,355
Steak?

254
00:23:14,113 --> 00:23:17,616
Sorry I'm late. I'm just so busy.

255
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,118
Did you wait long?

256
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,416
Do you know Director Wang Heung-in?
The marketing director.

257
00:23:25,499 --> 00:23:27,960
Do I have to see this for you to decide?

258
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:31,922
He's my father-in-law's cousin.

259
00:23:32,006 --> 00:23:33,757
So I have to help a lot.

260
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:39,346
You have no idea how comfortable it is
to get paid without knowing anything.

261
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,441
I'm not a fan of soy sauce.

262
00:23:50,524 --> 00:23:53,277
This goes better with <i>chojang</i>, right?

263
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:57,531
Why aren't you eating? Eat up.

264
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:10,002
You don't know how to eat this.

265
00:24:10,628 --> 00:24:13,130
Who eats sushi with chopsticks?

266
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:19,386
I guess you're just lucky to be here.
Where can you find a boss like me?

267
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:24,183
All you did was bring me an idea,
and I give you the hardworking Ms. Yang

268
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:25,643
and the pretty Su-min.

269
00:24:25,726 --> 00:24:28,437
I'm even having the director help you.

270
00:24:30,064 --> 00:24:33,609
The proposal's a little sloppy,
but we need to make it work.

271
00:24:35,027 --> 00:24:36,237
I'll work hard.

272
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,782
Goodness. That's not the problem.

273
00:24:39,865 --> 00:24:42,576
It's not something
an assistant manager can do.

274
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:46,163
I don't plan on interrupting your work.

275
00:24:46,247 --> 00:24:50,000
However, I'm lending you my name.

276
00:24:50,084 --> 00:24:54,213
I want to make sure this works out.
Why else would I do this?

277
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:59,260
<i>So he's saying he'll have me do
all the work and he'll take the credit?</i>

278
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,098
Come to think of it, that's unrealistic.

279
00:25:04,181 --> 00:25:05,766
It won't progress.

280
00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:08,644
It'll take forever to make the meal kits.

281
00:25:08,727 --> 00:25:11,647
Let's change the wrapping and ingredients.

282
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,982
What's that called?

283
00:25:13,065 --> 00:25:17,403
Right. Borrow a famous chef's name
and turn it into a brand.

284
00:25:17,486 --> 00:25:19,905
We can use our company's distribution.

285
00:25:20,489 --> 00:25:24,285
If we push this well,
we can launch it by this summer.

286
00:25:24,994 --> 00:25:25,995
But...

287
00:25:26,078 --> 00:25:28,455
Package three-minute meatball well

288
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:31,375
and put a chef's name on it.
It's luxurious steak.

289
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:32,626
We can't do that.

290
00:25:34,837 --> 00:25:35,671
What?

291
00:25:35,754 --> 00:25:40,634
The point is to cook famous restaurants'
food conveniently at home.

292
00:25:40,718 --> 00:25:42,177
What logic is that?

293
00:25:43,012 --> 00:25:46,932
That's your point!
My point is to get promoted with this!

294
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:49,852
Ms. Yang will get promoted too.

295
00:25:49,935 --> 00:25:52,479
That's how your future will open.

296
00:25:52,563 --> 00:25:55,816
Someone in your position
should just do what she's told.

297
00:25:57,776 --> 00:25:59,903
You're hopeless.

298
00:25:59,987 --> 00:26:02,489
You're too stubborn and foolish to work.

299
00:26:03,282 --> 00:26:04,283
However,

300
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:05,993
- this proposal--
- Forget it.

301
00:26:06,493 --> 00:26:07,619
You're out.

302
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,332
Mr. Kim.

303
00:26:11,415 --> 00:26:13,250
This is my proposal.

304
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:17,463
You're funny.

305
00:26:17,546 --> 00:26:18,881
Why is this yours?

306
00:26:19,965 --> 00:26:22,718
Technically, it belongs to the company.

307
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:24,928
I approved it to be developed.

308
00:26:25,012 --> 00:26:26,764
Ms. Yang also helped. Right?

309
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:28,474
What about Ms. Yang's idea?

310
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:34,563
Ji-won, we all worked together.
Why do you try to do it your way?

311
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:36,065
Are you not invested?

312
00:26:37,441 --> 00:26:39,026
You're off the team.

313
00:26:39,985 --> 00:26:42,988
Hand it over to Ms. Yang and Su-min.

314
00:27:02,883 --> 00:27:05,719
Isn't this a really nice place?

315
00:27:06,428 --> 00:27:09,014
I wish I could take you somewhere nicer.

316
00:27:10,182 --> 00:27:11,266
Really?

317
00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:13,727
I'm so happy.

318
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,856
You know that lunch?

319
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,233
Bring me my usual.

320
00:27:20,317 --> 00:27:22,111
What about wine, sir?

321
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,407
Keep my bottle.

322
00:27:27,157 --> 00:27:29,034
Is there any good wine today?

323
00:27:29,118 --> 00:27:32,079
I recommend Henri Brion 2008

324
00:27:32,162 --> 00:27:34,873
to pair with today's course.

325
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:38,210
The flavors are deep
with the French oak aging method...

326
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:40,754
<i>He really is a decent guy.</i>

327
00:27:40,838 --> 00:27:45,092
<i>He's got great manners, and he's smart.
He works for a conglomerate too.</i>

328
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:48,846
<i>He's the most decent man
Ji-won has ever met.</i>

329
00:27:58,147 --> 00:28:01,024
<i>You pretty thing.
Has she fallen for me yet?</i>

330
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:03,485
You can really feel the flavors.

331
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:05,654
Which wine shall I prepare?

332
00:28:08,115 --> 00:28:11,869
- The last one with the flavors.
- Yes, sir. I'll prepare it.

333
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:20,294
Did you rest well last night?

334
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,632
I couldn't sleep at all.

335
00:28:34,892 --> 00:28:35,851
<i>What about you?</i>

336
00:28:37,853 --> 00:28:40,147
Do you think I could sleep?

337
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,671
Flavorful.

338
00:29:12,888 --> 00:29:13,764
Mr. Kim.

339
00:29:14,848 --> 00:29:17,017
Are you really going to take her out?

340
00:29:18,268 --> 00:29:20,771
Why? You can't do it without her?

341
00:29:22,147 --> 00:29:24,233
She proposed it. Taking her out is...

342
00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:27,152
She wasn't wrong either.

343
00:29:27,236 --> 00:29:29,404
Even in my humble opinion,

344
00:29:29,488 --> 00:29:32,950
we shouldn't just change the packaging.

345
00:29:33,033 --> 00:29:35,118
- Who says we'll do that?
- Pardon?

346
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:39,998
We'll have to simplify the process,
but we can't do that.

347
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,584
It'll be a proper meal kit.

348
00:29:43,502 --> 00:29:47,130
Pick out good restaurants first.
Places people know of.

349
00:29:50,342 --> 00:29:51,385
But earlier--

350
00:29:51,468 --> 00:29:53,762
Director Wang will support this.

351
00:29:53,845 --> 00:29:55,931
But there are too many names on it.

352
00:29:56,014 --> 00:29:58,392
The director's name has to be added too.

353
00:30:02,187 --> 00:30:03,397
So that was intentional?

354
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,649
Yes, it was.

355
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:12,906
Meals are all similar anyway, so find
restaurants that know the business.

356
00:30:13,574 --> 00:30:16,076
Find those with pretty faces if you could.

357
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:25,460
Focus. Shall I take you out instead?

358
00:30:26,795 --> 00:30:28,422
If it weren't for me,

359
00:30:29,715 --> 00:30:33,260
who would get promoted for this?
You or Kang Ji-won?

360
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:48,400
<i>I'm determined to fight, but how?</i>

361
00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:54,615
CREDIT CARD APPROVED
340,000 WON

362
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:57,993
340,000 WON

363
00:30:58,076 --> 00:31:00,078
They spent 340,000 won?

364
00:31:00,621 --> 00:31:02,080
What...

365
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:03,332
Is he crazy?

366
00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:10,631
<i>I lived a terrible life
because I didn't know how to fight.</i>

367
00:31:10,714 --> 00:31:12,382
<i>I can just learn how.</i>

368
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:16,845
<i>I have to stop letting shameless people
take things from me.</i>

369
00:31:16,928 --> 00:31:17,971
No.

370
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:23,810
<i>I won't let anyone take anything
from me this time.</i>

371
00:31:27,773 --> 00:31:32,152
He didn't go behind your back
and come straight to me.

372
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:35,739
Mr. Kim is a distant cousin.

373
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,618
He's a good worker,
but he's been so unlucky.

374
00:31:41,662 --> 00:31:45,082
But he told me a good idea this time.

375
00:31:45,165 --> 00:31:47,334
I'm planning a meal kit proposal.

376
00:31:48,293 --> 00:31:51,755
I'm not supporting him
because he's a cousin.

377
00:31:51,838 --> 00:31:55,092
I checked with the development team,
and it's good.

378
00:31:55,175 --> 00:31:56,718
Proceed with it.

379
00:31:56,802 --> 00:31:59,137
Speaking of which,

380
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:01,973
you're so tight
with performance evaluation.

381
00:32:02,057 --> 00:32:06,853
A leader should know
how to nurture subordinates.

382
00:32:06,937 --> 00:32:10,148
If water is too clear, fish can't live.

383
00:32:10,649 --> 00:32:14,528
He's been in that position for too long.

384
00:32:14,611 --> 00:32:15,779
Think of his age.

385
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:20,283
I'll look into it.

386
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:21,910
Yeah, okay. Do that.

387
00:32:23,412 --> 00:32:24,579
Work hard.

388
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,043
Why is he so stiff all the time?

389
00:32:30,127 --> 00:32:33,630
So what if he's a Yu?
Is he related to the chairman or what?

390
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:46,935
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

391
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,108
<i>What happened
to the proposal you told me about?</i>

392
00:32:57,154 --> 00:32:59,489
I'M WORKING HARD ON IT. THANK YOU.

393
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:06,371
<i>He's more keen than he looks.</i>

394
00:33:07,456 --> 00:33:08,498
I like you a lot.

395
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:13,378
<i>But I have to do it on my own.</i>

396
00:33:17,215 --> 00:33:18,800
<i>Do you have plans tonight?</i>

397
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:30,896
I HAVE TO WORK UNTIL LATE TONIGHT.

398
00:33:33,857 --> 00:33:36,318
<i>It's more important, so make time.</i>

399
00:33:43,408 --> 00:33:45,285
<i>This isn't a date. Don't worry.</i>

400
00:34:01,802 --> 00:34:03,720
Can you tell me what it's about?

401
00:34:03,804 --> 00:34:05,806
I don't think you'll ask for help.

402
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:08,892
I just want to be helpful.

403
00:34:10,227 --> 00:34:12,604
- Mr. Yu, I--
- There's no price.

404
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:18,944
It's uncomfortable when you act this way.

405
00:34:19,027 --> 00:34:21,321
Why? Do you want there to be a price?

406
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,702
How about just accepting it? A free favor.

407
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,581
I don't want to be repaid
for what I do willingly.

408
00:34:32,332 --> 00:34:35,126
It's not easy to meet someone like me.

409
00:34:35,877 --> 00:34:38,088
- However--
- If that's uncomfortable too,

410
00:34:39,172 --> 00:34:40,423
this is as your boss.

411
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:13,123
Hey, Ji-hyuk!

412
00:35:13,957 --> 00:35:15,125
Hello!

413
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:17,711
You're still so beautiful.

414
00:35:18,628 --> 00:35:20,338
Have we met before?

415
00:35:22,215 --> 00:35:26,761
He's like this with any pretty woman.
Hi, I'm Kim Sin-u. This is Jo Dong-suk.

416
00:35:26,845 --> 00:35:28,096
Yes, hello.

417
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:29,264
Hello.

418
00:35:31,057 --> 00:35:32,309
Friends from college.

419
00:35:32,726 --> 00:35:34,227
By any chance, do you like judo?

420
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,939
I was on the national team as a reserve.

421
00:35:38,023 --> 00:35:40,859
For Taekwondo, I mean.
But I'm good at judo too.

422
00:35:40,942 --> 00:35:42,152
I see.

423
00:35:44,654 --> 00:35:46,406
- What's going on?
- Here.

424
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:47,324
KANG JI-WON

425
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,120
What is this?

426
00:35:52,954 --> 00:35:53,955
Go change.

427
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,710
Into this?

428
00:36:04,187 --> 00:36:07,190
Just as you saw,
flip your opponent with one go.

429
00:36:07,274 --> 00:36:10,527
Judo is all about physics.
Think of it as a lever.

430
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,987
Grab and flip.

431
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,530
- Grab and flip.
- Yes.

432
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,615
Do you want to try?

433
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:16,992
Oh, right.

434
00:36:19,286 --> 00:36:20,620
Grab.

435
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:22,622
- Grab. That's good.
- Grab.

436
00:36:22,706 --> 00:36:24,291
Position your foot.

437
00:36:24,374 --> 00:36:25,750
Flip!

438
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,837
- Flip!
- Flip...

439
00:36:31,965 --> 00:36:33,758
- Why won't you flip?
- And flip!

440
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,429
Now, scream louder.

441
00:36:40,473 --> 00:36:41,308
Again!

442
00:36:42,726 --> 00:36:44,019
One more time!

443
00:37:02,537 --> 00:37:03,997
With all your strength!

444
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,592
You did it! You really did it!

445
00:37:15,675 --> 00:37:18,053
- You did it!
- I flipped you!

446
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:20,388
You really did it! You did it.

447
00:37:21,598 --> 00:37:24,935
That covers the basics.
Let's do the practical part.

448
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,229
Practical part?

449
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:34,194
The first step to win

450
00:37:34,694 --> 00:37:37,280
is to get on the mat
and face your opponent.

451
00:37:39,366 --> 00:37:40,825
<i>This is how to fight.</i>

452
00:37:43,203 --> 00:37:44,204
Grab me.

453
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,836
It's not easy to grab someone.

454
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:53,713
However,

455
00:37:56,424 --> 00:37:57,634
at times they yield.

456
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,310
They know you can't flip them.

457
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,280
I will flip you.

458
00:38:19,948 --> 00:38:22,951
If you're not sure, don't get on the mat.

459
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,829
Once you're on the mat,
focus on one thing only.

460
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:28,832
"I will flip."

461
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,751
I will flip.

462
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,045
Grab him properly!

463
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:39,968
- Shout!
- Shout!

464
00:39:00,363 --> 00:39:02,282
Judo is all about push and pull.

465
00:39:02,824 --> 00:39:06,619
Use your opponent's strength
when you're not strong enough.

466
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,457
Of course,

467
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,917
I think it's okay to not fight directly.

468
00:39:14,461 --> 00:39:15,795
Ask for help.

469
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:20,800
Ask someone who can fight for you.
Someone like me.

470
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:50,413
I did it! I really did it!

471
00:39:50,497 --> 00:39:51,748
I did it!

472
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,417
I did it!

473
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:59,005
You doubted me, didn't you?

474
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,509
You had your guard down a little, right?

475
00:40:25,615 --> 00:40:26,866
Good job.

476
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:52,851
Didn't he tell me not to go easy on her?

477
00:40:53,768 --> 00:40:56,396
- Didn't he flip too easily just now?
- Yes.

478
00:40:56,479 --> 00:40:58,148
He even jumped in the air.

479
00:40:58,231 --> 00:40:59,816
He jumped so high.

480
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:17,542
Thank you for tonight.

481
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:19,002
Don't forget to shout.

482
00:41:19,085 --> 00:41:21,296
You're capable of fighting well.

483
00:41:23,006 --> 00:41:24,257
Like a gamecock?

484
00:41:25,592 --> 00:41:28,011
The most righteous gamecock in the world.

485
00:41:30,847 --> 00:41:33,641
<i>Once you're on the mat,
focus on one thing only.</i>

486
00:41:39,314 --> 00:41:43,234
What are you doing, Ms. Kim?
How's your performance?

487
00:41:46,196 --> 00:41:48,281
You can get fired over performance.

488
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,993
First, get on the mat
and face my opponent.

489
00:42:02,212 --> 00:42:04,672
I reflected on the points you made,

490
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:06,424
and I redid the proposal.

491
00:42:14,641 --> 00:42:15,975
Also, about yesterday,

492
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,519
I apologize.

493
00:42:36,204 --> 00:42:37,121
This is mine.

494
00:42:37,664 --> 00:42:42,126
I'm giving you this because you seem
to think no one else thought of it.

495
00:42:44,337 --> 00:42:47,257
PROPOSERS:
KIM GYEONG-UK, YANG JU-RAN, JEONG SU-MIN

496
00:42:49,008 --> 00:42:51,135
What? Is it because your name's missing?

497
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:53,179
Isn't it natural?

498
00:42:53,263 --> 00:42:54,681
It was originally mine,

499
00:42:54,764 --> 00:42:59,560
but now the director will move it forward.
There's no room for your name.

500
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:07,694
Mr. Kim, can you give me a chance?

501
00:43:10,363 --> 00:43:11,239
Really?

502
00:43:12,782 --> 00:43:14,200
Then...

503
00:43:15,451 --> 00:43:17,996
Integrate what you edited
and bring it back.

504
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,790
Whether I'll add your name or not,

505
00:43:20,873 --> 00:43:22,667
I'll decide then.

506
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,003
Yes, sir.

507
00:43:31,968 --> 00:43:33,261
I'm sorry

508
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:37,307
You helped me a lot,
but the situation is bad.

509
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:38,474
I'm really sorry.

510
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:43,688
So Jeong Su-min's name has to be on it?

511
00:43:45,148 --> 00:43:48,985
He's even threatening
to take your name out of it.

512
00:43:49,068 --> 00:43:50,611
Thanks for thinking of me.

513
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,531
Eat up.

514
00:44:05,251 --> 00:44:06,252
How is it?

515
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:09,047
It's as if...

516
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:10,882
this Basque cheesecake is made

517
00:44:10,965 --> 00:44:16,012
with the fresh milk from a mountain goat
in New Zealand that just gave birth.

518
00:44:16,095 --> 00:44:17,096
What?

519
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,598
Where did you buy this?

520
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,393
Werther?

521
00:44:22,477 --> 00:44:25,480
My friend runs the restaurant.

522
00:44:27,315 --> 00:44:28,649
Speak of the devil.

523
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:31,110
- Shall I take it?
- Yeah.

524
00:44:35,156 --> 00:44:35,990
Hello?

525
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,659
Did you get the cake?

526
00:44:39,452 --> 00:44:42,789
<i>Yeah, I'm eating it with a coworker.</i>

527
00:44:42,872 --> 00:44:45,708
Who's the person
that sent such a great cake?

528
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:48,127
This is love itself!

529
00:44:48,211 --> 00:44:50,546
What?

530
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,632
- It means it's good.
- <i>Really?</i>

531
00:44:52,715 --> 00:44:55,760
I'm glad. I made it myself.

532
00:44:56,719 --> 00:44:57,720
You did?

533
00:44:57,804 --> 00:45:00,139
- You bake too?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

534
00:45:00,223 --> 00:45:03,851
I make the desserts
for important people myself.

535
00:45:05,561 --> 00:45:06,771
Enjoy it.

536
00:45:06,854 --> 00:45:08,231
Thanks, I'll enjoy it.

537
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:13,778
My savior.

538
00:45:14,862 --> 00:45:16,948
Are you dating him?

539
00:45:18,157 --> 00:45:19,075
No.

540
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:23,413
What are you talking about?
I have a boyfriend.

541
00:45:24,414 --> 00:45:26,207
That's right.

542
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,586
Then I'm positive this friend likes you.

543
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:34,173
It's not easy to send a cake like this
if he doesn't.

544
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:40,012
Speaking of which,
will you proceed it as Mr. Kim said?

545
00:45:42,432 --> 00:45:45,309
I was a fool for losing my temper.

546
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:48,688
He never planned on doing as he said.

547
00:45:49,564 --> 00:45:51,023
What?

548
00:45:51,107 --> 00:45:56,028
The proposal he gave me
only had a few words different from mine.

549
00:45:56,112 --> 00:45:57,822
Unbelievable.

550
00:45:58,573 --> 00:46:01,492
So he was just trying
to get you off of it?

551
00:46:02,034 --> 00:46:07,999
Wow, he's the worst.
How can he work with that terrible mind?

552
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:10,710
How can you stand looking at him?

553
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,754
Did you know judo is about push and pull?

554
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:19,218
Mr. Kim underestimated me.

555
00:46:19,302 --> 00:46:21,554
So he yielded his sleeve to me.

556
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:25,141
He didn't think I could flip him.

557
00:46:26,809 --> 00:46:28,728
Judo? All of a sudden?

558
00:46:35,067 --> 00:46:37,737
I don't want to imagine him in a uniform.

559
00:46:40,573 --> 00:46:45,870
Judo seems like a good sport.
You feel different when you shout too.

560
00:46:46,496 --> 00:46:49,916
Shouting? I know it all too well!

561
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:52,543
It's nothing, but things change after it.

562
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,592
Sorry about that! I'm sorry!

563
00:46:59,675 --> 00:47:01,219
- Sorry.
- Sorry about that.

564
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:07,099
But where's Ms. Yang?

565
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:18,653
This must be uncomfortable for you.

566
00:47:18,736 --> 00:47:22,782
You didn't do it on purpose,
but because of Mr. Kim's decision...

567
00:47:25,117 --> 00:47:28,579
Being a good worker
can be a headache sometimes, right?

568
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,165
It's not because I'm a good worker.

569
00:47:31,249 --> 00:47:33,793
I really love Ji-won so much,

570
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:38,089
but a person should be reasonable at work.

571
00:47:39,298 --> 00:47:42,760
Don't worry about it.
You didn't do anything wrong.

572
00:47:44,845 --> 00:47:46,430
Ji-won is great,

573
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:49,642
but she's not flexible and so upright.

574
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:54,313
What can we do about it?
That's why she got into Hankuk University.

575
00:47:54,397 --> 00:47:56,357
We should just accept her for it.

576
00:47:57,525 --> 00:48:00,027
You really are a good friend.

577
00:48:03,906 --> 00:48:07,410
I can be a good friend
to you too, Ms. Yang.

578
00:48:09,745 --> 00:48:14,000
I'm not as smart as Ji-won. I'm a dummy.

579
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:18,796
If you do well, I'll do well too.

580
00:48:18,879 --> 00:48:20,840
That's what I think.

581
00:48:23,175 --> 00:48:25,428
You're not a dummy.

582
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:27,513
You're good at work and so clever.

583
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,934
And that's the right way.
Work should be done together.

584
00:48:32,018 --> 00:48:34,478
- Especially company work.
- Right?

585
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:38,858
Let's work really hard on this project.

586
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:58,127
MEAL KIT PROPOSAL FOR SINGLE HOUSEHOLDS

587
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,963
SUPERVISOR: WANG HEUNG-IN

588
00:49:01,714 --> 00:49:03,633
<i>I'm standing here.</i>

589
00:49:03,716 --> 00:49:06,344
<i>You bumped into me! Didn't you?</i>

590
00:49:07,345 --> 00:49:08,971
<i>How dare you?</i>

591
00:49:09,055 --> 00:49:13,225
<i>Let go of me! I'm warning you! Let go!</i>

592
00:49:14,477 --> 00:49:17,146
<i>I've grabbed Mr. Kim's sleeve.</i>

593
00:49:17,229 --> 00:49:20,232
<i>The problem is, how do I flip him?</i>

594
00:49:21,442 --> 00:49:22,485
Ji-won?

595
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:23,819
We bought snacks.

596
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:40,670
The flower is just for Ji-won.
You're the flower of our team.

597
00:49:41,629 --> 00:49:43,172
And for Hui-yeon and Min-hwan.

598
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:44,924
Thanks.

599
00:49:46,342 --> 00:49:49,428
Su-min really looks after you a lot.

600
00:49:49,512 --> 00:49:50,846
Yeah.

601
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:56,310
Well...

602
00:49:56,811 --> 00:49:59,522
When will you be done with the proposal?

603
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:03,150
Before it's shown to Mr. Kim,

604
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:05,111
it'd be nice if you share it.

605
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,446
With me...

606
00:50:09,615 --> 00:50:10,658
and Su-min.

607
00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:17,331
Well, if there's anything new. You know?

608
00:50:22,211 --> 00:50:25,214
Actually, I thought about
the marketing strategy.

609
00:50:27,007 --> 00:50:28,676
I'll share them right away.

610
00:50:29,343 --> 00:50:33,097
It'd be good to use
Director Wang's name to promote it.

611
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:43,149

WANG HEUNG-IN'S DAD'S RESTAURANT
THE TASTE DADS CHOOSE AFTER WORK

616
00:51:16,557 --> 00:51:18,893
This is Wang Heung-in's special proposal.

617
00:51:18,976 --> 00:51:20,561
Thirty years in the food industry.

618
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:24,106
Wang Heung-in's Dad's Restaurant delivers

619
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:26,734
<i>the best food in the country
to your table.</i>

620
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:29,737
Wang Heung-in will represent
the heart of all dads.

621
00:51:35,618 --> 00:51:37,203
<i>Thirty years in the food industry.</i>

622
00:51:37,703 --> 00:51:39,622
WANG HEUNG-IN'S DAD'S RESTAURANT

623
00:51:39,705 --> 00:51:42,458
I, Wang Heung-in, guarantee it!

624
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,128
Now, eat up!

625
00:51:46,212 --> 00:51:48,214
Eat as much as you want. Enjoy.

626
00:51:48,756 --> 00:51:49,673
CHOOSE YOUR FAVORITE

627
00:51:49,757 --> 00:51:56,222
THE UNIQUE TASTE OF KOREA
BECOMES A WORLD-CLASS TASTE

628
00:52:03,145 --> 00:52:04,480
Good!

629
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,361
Director Wang!

630
00:52:13,781 --> 00:52:14,824
Did you call me?

631
00:52:14,907 --> 00:52:16,909
Who is this?

632
00:52:16,992 --> 00:52:19,537
Manager Kim... No.

633
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,956
Deputy General Manager Kim!

634
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,708
Director Wang!

635
00:52:24,792 --> 00:52:27,002
I'm so proud of you!

636
00:52:27,086 --> 00:52:30,548
Who thought of putting my name
on it like that?

637
00:52:32,216 --> 00:52:34,969
For marketing, we need a star
to gain attention fast.

638
00:52:35,052 --> 00:52:38,931
Instead of using a celebrity,
we need a trustworthy expert.

639
00:52:39,014 --> 00:52:43,602
And I think Director Wang Heung-in
will be a trustworthy face.

640
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,856
Of course, it was my idea!

641
00:52:46,939 --> 00:52:50,150
You're handsome and competent!
You're U&K's icon!

642
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:52,403
There's no one better than you!

643
00:52:53,445 --> 00:52:54,530
Great job!

644
00:52:54,613 --> 00:52:55,865
Make this big.

645
00:52:56,657 --> 00:52:58,826
I leave the country tomorrow.

646
00:52:59,451 --> 00:53:00,286
You are?

647
00:53:00,369 --> 00:53:03,831
Ji-hyuk got his position
because of his work in the States.

648
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:06,625
I was going to try next year,

649
00:53:06,709 --> 00:53:08,878
but I got a good feeling about this.

650
00:53:09,628 --> 00:53:13,340
Don't be satisfied with being the first.
We must keep pushing.

651
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:15,551
Until we're the only one left!

652
00:53:15,634 --> 00:53:17,887
I'll push ruthlessly!

653
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:19,930
Do a good job.

654
00:53:20,014 --> 00:53:22,433
I'll be supporting you. Do what you want.

655
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:24,184
Yes, sir.

656
00:53:25,144 --> 00:53:27,563
Good. This is great!

657
00:53:40,242 --> 00:53:42,202
U&K EXECUTIVE BUSINESS TRIP NOTICE

658
00:53:42,286 --> 00:53:45,664
<i>Finally, Wang Heung-in goes
on his business trip tomorrow.</i>

659
00:53:50,544 --> 00:53:51,754
What are you doing?

660
00:53:52,671 --> 00:53:54,131
You haven't left yet?

661
00:53:56,383 --> 00:53:57,968
We bought chicken.

662
00:54:02,014 --> 00:54:06,727
You work so hard lately.
It's been so long since we all hung out.

663
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,021
It's hard for me to see her too.

664
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:13,484
You should just let it go.

665
00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:16,779
It's a bus that has already left.
Stop chasing it.

666
00:54:18,113 --> 00:54:21,200
Min-hwan, she's just working hard.

667
00:54:22,117 --> 00:54:26,497
It might not be now,
but I'm sure it'll be helpful one day.

668
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:28,040
Lately,

669
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,250
I've come to hate it.

670
00:54:30,876 --> 00:54:31,877
What?

671
00:54:33,128 --> 00:54:35,422
That it might be good for me one day.

672
00:54:36,423 --> 00:54:39,802
I want to be rewarded
for the work I do now.

673
00:54:42,137 --> 00:54:43,180
What the hell?

674
00:54:44,932 --> 00:54:46,934
You sound like you're possessed.

675
00:54:47,601 --> 00:54:48,978
Did you understand her?

676
00:54:50,562 --> 00:54:52,064
Let's just eat chicken.

677
00:54:53,107 --> 00:54:55,943
Min-hwan bought this,
so I'll buy the next round!

678
00:54:59,989 --> 00:55:02,449
It's soy sauce chicken. Your favorite.

679
00:55:03,575 --> 00:55:04,952
You're right.

680
00:55:06,745 --> 00:55:09,873
It's such a shame.
I have a meeting outside today.

681
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,376
You should've told me.

682
00:55:12,459 --> 00:55:14,962
Then you should've told us sooner.

683
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:16,505
Come on.

684
00:55:18,298 --> 00:55:19,925
It's such a shame.

685
00:55:20,009 --> 00:55:22,511
I love eating chicken at night.

686
00:55:22,594 --> 00:55:26,724
Min-hwan, do you remember? We ate chicken
while seeing the night view.

687
00:55:26,807 --> 00:55:28,225
The mood was great then.

688
00:55:28,726 --> 00:55:30,269
That was nice.

689
00:55:30,352 --> 00:55:31,687
It tasted so good!

690
00:55:32,938 --> 00:55:34,148
Really?

691
00:55:35,691 --> 00:55:37,943
- I want to try it too.
- Yeah, sure.

692
00:55:38,027 --> 00:55:42,031
You should do that tonight.
I'm late, so I'll get going now.

693
00:55:42,531 --> 00:55:44,658
I'm so disappointed, but enjoy!

694
00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:47,077
But... Wait, Ji-won.

695
00:55:47,161 --> 00:55:48,954
- Are you really going?
- Ji-won?

696
00:56:11,877 --> 00:56:12,878
Who is it?

697
00:56:12,961 --> 00:56:14,588
<i>Hello, Director Wang.</i>

698
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:17,925
We met at the NurTV Showcase.

699
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:19,343
I'm Kang Ji-won.

700
00:56:19,426 --> 00:56:20,385
What?

701
00:56:21,637 --> 00:56:23,806
Wait, is she insane?

702
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,975
How did someone like you get my number?

703
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:31,480
As you know, the meal kit business
you're doing was originally mine.

704
00:56:32,439 --> 00:56:35,609
And I'm going to complain
about being left out of it.

705
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:39,905
Hey, hang up!

706
00:56:44,952 --> 00:56:47,121
<i>I did my best to flip them over.</i>

707
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:51,917
<i>So flip!</i>

708
00:56:53,168 --> 00:56:56,380
<i>You're going to go down anyway,
so go down now! Please!</i>

709
00:57:04,346 --> 00:57:06,223
Hey, come here.

710
00:57:12,271 --> 00:57:14,273
I'm pissed as it is. What is this?

711
00:57:14,773 --> 00:57:17,985
Why is there someone sitting beside me?

712
00:57:19,444 --> 00:57:23,407
This is the seat you booked.
Is there a problem?

713
00:57:24,283 --> 00:57:26,618
Do you not know who I am?

714
00:57:26,702 --> 00:57:30,789
Why is there someone sitting beside me?

715
00:57:33,542 --> 00:57:35,419
Are you ignoring me now?

716
00:57:35,502 --> 00:57:37,671
I don't believe this. Seriously?

717
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:42,676
This evil little assistant manager thinks
the proposal is hers because she wrote it.

718
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:45,345
Now a mere flight attendant
is ignoring me?

719
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:50,350
Think about why you get paid.

720
00:57:50,976 --> 00:57:53,562
Then you'd know what you should say.

721
00:57:56,064 --> 00:57:58,233
Shall I check if there's an empty seat?

722
00:57:58,901 --> 00:58:02,112
No one does their job properly.

723
00:58:02,196 --> 00:58:04,198
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

724
00:58:06,408 --> 00:58:07,576
MANAGER KIM GYEONG-UK

725
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:12,789
Mr. Kim?

726
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:17,461
Did you not take care of Kang Ji-won,
who wrote the proposal?

727
00:58:18,503 --> 00:58:21,506
What? She's still working on it?

728
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:28,055
So that's why she went on about
making a complaint about it.

729
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:30,140
<i>What? She called you?</i>

730
00:58:30,224 --> 00:58:33,560
Yes, she said she'd make an issue
of leaving her out.

731
00:58:33,644 --> 00:58:36,438
Tear that clueless thing to pieces!

732
00:58:36,521 --> 00:58:38,315
God, it's pissing me off.

733
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:42,319
What on earth is he doing on a plane?

734
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:44,947
What's wrong with him?

735
00:58:52,955 --> 00:58:55,290
Hey, you. Come here.

736
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:02,339
- Did you laugh earlier?
- Excuse me?

737
00:59:02,422 --> 00:59:06,301
You laughed while I was on the phone.
Are you looking down on me?

738
00:59:07,344 --> 00:59:10,055
I'm sorry, Director.
I'll educate her again.

739
00:59:10,138 --> 00:59:12,057
And I'll serve you myself.

740
00:59:18,063 --> 00:59:19,898
You should've done so earlier.

741
00:59:19,982 --> 00:59:24,152
Director? Your seat must be upright
for takeoff.

742
00:59:24,236 --> 00:59:26,071
Please put your seatbelt on...

743
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:29,574
Are you joking?

744
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:32,327
This won't do.

745
00:59:32,411 --> 00:59:33,662
Hey.

746
00:59:34,579 --> 00:59:36,415
Bring someone higher than you.

747
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,671
I'm the manager of business class.
And assaulting a crew member is illegal--

748
00:59:43,922 --> 00:59:47,009
Assault? What do you mean?
I just tapped you.

749
00:59:47,592 --> 00:59:49,428
Sir, assaulting a crew member...

750
00:59:49,511 --> 00:59:51,054
Why you...

751
00:59:51,638 --> 00:59:54,766
I was just holding this,
and you bumped into it.

752
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:56,393
Right?

753
00:59:56,476 --> 00:59:59,730
How dare you do this to me?

754
00:59:59,813 --> 01:00:01,898
What are you looking at?

755
01:00:02,482 --> 01:00:05,736
He's assaulting a crew member?
Unbelievable.

756
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:07,529
He's famous for being nice.

757
01:00:08,697 --> 01:00:12,117
<i>Executive A of U&K Food,

<i>He had appeared on a variety show

761
01:00:22,169 --> 01:00:26,423
<i>The action was taken a week after

PROPOSERS:
KIM GYEONG-UK, YANG JU-RAN, JEONG SU-MIN

770

<i>Executive A was the model
of U&K's meal kit product commercial.</i>

771
01:01:06,838 --> 01:01:10,092
<i>As many people are
boycotting the products,</i>

772
01:01:10,175 --> 01:01:13,470
<i>U&K Group has posted an apology</i>

773
01:01:13,553 --> 01:01:16,348
<i>and announced
they'd dispose of all products</i>

774
01:01:16,431 --> 01:01:18,517
<i>with the executive's face on them.</i>

775
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:22,145
<i>Did you not take care of Kang Ji-won,
who wrote the proposal?</i>

776
01:01:22,229 --> 01:01:23,271
<i>Let go of me!</i>

777
01:01:23,772 --> 01:01:27,359
<i>Let go of me! I'm warning you! Let go!</i>

778
01:01:27,442 --> 01:01:30,779
<i>Hey! How dare you touch me?</i>

779
01:01:30,862 --> 01:01:32,030
<i>Let go of me!</i>

780
01:01:32,114 --> 01:01:35,659
<i>So this is when U&K's power-tripping mole
was still here.</i>

781
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:40,414
It'd be good to use
Director Wang's name to promote it.

782
01:01:40,956 --> 01:01:42,499
<i>You'll all get fired!</i>

783
01:02:14,406 --> 01:02:15,532
Oh, my God!

784
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:21,913
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

785
01:02:23,415 --> 01:02:25,375
No, it's fine.

786
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:27,961
I came to tell you something.

787
01:02:29,463 --> 01:02:32,257
Director Wang will be dismissed.

788
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:36,887
And Mr. Kim will be disciplined
for stealing your proposal.

789
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:42,184
Great job.

790
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:54,446
Well, then.

791
01:02:55,947 --> 01:02:57,115
Wait, Mr. Yu!

792
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:14,299
BTS? I like them too.

793
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:18,887
To be honest,
I want to listen to "Dynamite" right now,

794
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:20,555
but I can't find it.

795
01:03:21,515 --> 01:03:24,309
"Dynamite" is great.
I like "Spring Day," though.

796
01:03:24,392 --> 01:03:26,269
I like "Spring Day" too.

797
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:38,323
<i>That's...</i>

798
01:03:39,491 --> 01:03:40,992
a replica brand.

799
01:03:41,785 --> 01:03:43,537
People who know can tell.

800
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,622
But just try it this time. You can go.

801
01:03:45,705 --> 01:03:48,375
<i>He's the one that told me
about the reunion.</i>

802
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:51,336
Oh, right. Does your stomach hurt?

803
01:03:51,419 --> 01:03:54,589
I'm worried Mr. Park might hurt you.

804
01:03:54,673 --> 01:03:56,341
<i>People don't change.</i>

805
01:03:58,051 --> 01:03:59,594
They repeat their actions.

806
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:12,399
"Spring Day"?

807
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,448
Did you say "Dynamite"?

808
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:33,128

Was that overtime?

I'll help with everything.

818
01:05:25,472 --> 01:05:27,974
