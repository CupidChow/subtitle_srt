1
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,580
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

2
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,300
I just wanted to talk about Agent Jiang's birthday party
How can it be so grand?

3
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,340
So it was a proposal?

4
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,180
I hope today is Ji Won
The best birthday gift I've ever received

5
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,260
How do you like it?

6
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,890
Jiwon, I envy you.

7
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,560
It's really amazing

8
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,730
How did you come up with the idea of doing this?

9
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,660
Drones and fireworks really scare me a bit.

10
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,160
Oh, that's nothing, everyone does it

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,960
Even if it's just a proposal package for 39,000 won
I will be happy too

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,880
Thank you

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,710
(Second-hand market)

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,300
Proposal…

15
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,840
(Proposal props)

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,720
Thirty-nine thousand won?

17
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,390
Fifty thousand won? That's crazy.

18
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,310
Oh, hello, Minister.

19
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,820
Regarding recent events
The company wants to reward Agent Jiang

20
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,700
Will provide her with a villa on her birthday

21
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,365
Comfort?

22
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,033
About Section Chief Kim Kyung-wook

23
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:57,701
oh

24
00:01:58,953 --> 00:01:59,995
Because of that thing

25
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,000
Providing a villa to comfort her?

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,500
Usually provides apartments
But this time it was more generous.

27
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,420
This guy really loves her.

28
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,840
A pure man

29
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,680
What should I do? It seems you don't understand women.

30
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,640
Jiang Zhiyuan only loves me

31
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,100
Oh my god, are you crazy?

32
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,860
Sorry, Minister.

33
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,820
This is a great opportunity

34
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,070
Do you want to find all the members of the marketing team?
How about having a birthday party together?

35
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,660
She thought it was a birthday party, but there was a surprise

36
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,580
I'm going to propose to her as a surprise.

37
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,960
I'm going to marry Kang Ji Won

38
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,630
Come and join us, and be sad, you little brat.

39
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,380
You're such a nasty guy.

40
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,590
The minister will come to congratulate us, right?

41
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,350
certainly

42
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,770
I can also provide other support

43
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,900
Ouch

44
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,590
congratulations

45
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,090
You still...

46
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,970
Can't you forgive me?

47
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,110
Ji-won, I'm sorry, calm down.

48
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,520
Okay?

49
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,820
sorry

50
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,910
Don't be angry

51
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,700
Let's be good friends like before, okay?

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,250
I don't understand you

53
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,340
But the point is

54
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,970
I don't want to understand

55
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,100
I'm leaving

56
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,770
Ji Won…

57
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,730
Kang Ji Won!

58
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,920
You know I can't swim, right?

59
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,350
Do you know what they say?

60
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,720
How to say it?

61
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,180
Carbonara

62
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,900
spaghetti

63
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,710
Ji Won

64
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Will you be cold?

65
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,900
Agent Jiang, are you okay?

66
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,900
I'm fine

67
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,780
Xiumin is sleeping. She must have been frightened.

68
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,620
It's really dangerous near the water at night. I'm so glad.

69
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,000
How could Xiumin fall?

70
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,830
Didn't she jump down by herself?

71
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,290
She slipped

72
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,710
She seems a little drunk

73
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,050
Is that so?

74
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,430
Fortunately, no one was injured.

75
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,300
Xiumin will thank you for the rest of her life

76
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,680
You are her savior.

77
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,350
Luckily there is hot cocoa here

78
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,100
Very hot

79
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,820
Yes, you drink something hot.

80
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,860
Let the body temperature rise,

81
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,610
It seems you will have a good life in the future

82
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,910
More things need to happen so that there will be more memories

83
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,040
The proposal was indeed brilliant.

84
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,040
Of course

85
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,420
-Do you want to collect it?
-What?

86
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,800
It's only 11 o'clock now

87
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,430
We still have a lot to say
I still need to drink some more wine, this night is still long

88
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,930
I've been frightened too much today, and I'm tired

89
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,890
Have a good rest everyone

90
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,680
Thank you today

91
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,850
Let's go

92
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,100
Honey, shall we go upstairs too?

93
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,690
You go up first, I'll finish this drink and then go up

94
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,610
OK, that's it.

95
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,680
I showed you a great example of how to propose today

96
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,350
I can't do it a second time. I can't do it.

97
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,310
Oh my God, I'm so scared, what's going on?

98
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,430
Um?

99
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,900
You came in late.

100
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,070
what are you doing here?

101
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,780
Come on in

102
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,830
I just proposed today

103
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,290
And Kang Ji-won is in the next room

104
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,040
This is more exciting.

105
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,630
Don't you want it?

106
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,680
Are you drunk?

107
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,470
You seem to be in a good mood

108
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,430
Ji Won…

109
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,730
Jump into the water for me

110
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,290
Now

111
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,330
You made me happy.

112
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,340
Come

113
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,860
How are you?

114
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,700
She jumped down

115
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,910
Not a slip

116
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,660
She jumped down by herself.

117
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,620
Right in front of me

118
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,800
Maybe I don't understand Zheng Xiumin at all

119
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,850
I think it's simple

120
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,980
Park Min-hwan is trash, Jung Soo-min covets my things

121
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,940
So just let them get married
I'll be happy.

122
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,700
But that's not the case

123
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,620
She pulled me down

124
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,710
She grabbed my arm
Pull me deeper

125
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,460
and…

126
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,920
She was still smiling, I saw

127
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,600
Is this my hallucination?

128
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,560
I really hope so.

129
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,810
But not

130
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,350
She really intends to die

131
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,190
It's like she doesn't care even if she dies in the water.

132
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,950
As long as I die with you
She seems like she doesn't care about anything

133
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,020
I want to show you something

134
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,380
Whenever I feel lost
When you don't know what you are doing

135
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,960
I will come here

136
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,260
After quietly clearing my mind

137
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,430
You will gain the strength to take another step

138
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,190
No one knows what the future holds

139
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,310
However

140
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,280
We are the ones who know the most

141
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,030
So don't be afraid

142
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,740
You have made a lot of progress now.

143
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:40,120
You found out
The unknown side of someone I've been with for 26 years

144
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,960
If Jung Soo-min shows
It has never been like this before

145
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:51,800
That means you are not so easy to deal with now.

146
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,650
I sincerely wish you a happy birthday

147
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,820
Thank you for the proposal

148
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,960
This was the best first birthday ever

149
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,690
Episode 9

150
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,360
Agent Jiang

151
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,240
-Hello
-Hello

152
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,870
Oh my god, what is that?

153
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,240
Agent Jiang, you wouldn't...

154
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,290
I'm engaged

155
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,210
Oh my god, is this a one carat?

156
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,630
Wow, Agent Park is really good.

157
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,090
So beautiful

158
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,760
So envious

159
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,880
-It really suits her, right?
-yes

160
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,010
Are you planning to regret your marriage?
Can we announce this to the world?

161
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,640
I did this because I wanted to break up.

162
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,600
When everything is revealed, Park Min-hwan's working life

163
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,600
There will be a severe blow

164
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,320
I have improved a lot and become very difficult to mess with.

165
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,990
So, what are you going to do this weekend?

166
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,030
Are you coming to Yu Han Department Store?

167
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,990
This is my first and last time
To hollow out Park Min-hwan

168
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,120
Unfortunately, I had to go to Japan on a business trip that day.

169
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,290
You really missed a good show.

170
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,290
Park Min-hwan's expression will definitely be interesting to watch

171
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,090
I will cheer for you

172
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,220
Just find time to meet the parents on the weekend.

173
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,770
My mom is going to take a cooking class at the cultural center
There is no space

174
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,730
Are you going to eat something delicious? I want to eat too.

175
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,530
Ouch

176
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,530
You greedy ghost, so greedy

177
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,650
-I…
-Scare me to death, what is that?

178
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,320
It seems that the printer is jealous

179
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,830
It's jealous

180
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,040
Oh, are you two planning another surprise?

181
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,750
I really envy Agent Jiang

182
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,340
Of course I have to do this for her.

183
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,510
Now all that's left is meeting the parents.

184
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,970
What will you bring then?
What about the classic legend, Agent Park?

185
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,850
Even I am looking forward to it

186
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,310
yes

187
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,350
I didn't know Min Hwan had this side

188
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,520
I shouldn't have any higher expectations.

189
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,520
expect?

190
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,990
What do you expect me to do?

191
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,070
Don’t people say

192
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:45,780
Good men will help girls before meeting their parents
Buy a whole set of clothes, shoes and bags, right?

193
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,870
By the way, giving shoes as a gift will make girls run away

194
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,080
Then just have a good friend deliver it!

195
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,500
Oh, is there such a thing?

196
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,590
Isn't that great? I'm going to spread the word

197
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,510
Oh, yes.

198
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,520
I want to sell it on the second-hand market...

199
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,400
Just sell the bed frame.
The rest should be thrown away, they are too old

200
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,740
besides…

201
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,700
Who could it be?

202
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,330
Ji Won

203
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,300
I'll give this to you and leave.

204
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,010
This is your birthday present.

205
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,940
This pair

206
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,030
Isn't this a beautiful pair? Buy it for me

207
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,990
Bought this for me as a birthday gift

208
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,370
Um…

209
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,370
besides…

210
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,010
I want to give you something else as a wedding gift

211
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,010
May I?

212
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,680
You are getting married, but you can't cook

213
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:39,190
I heard that Yuhan Department Store Cultural Center
Weekend cooking classes are great

214
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,860
I'll help you sign up

215
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,530
Let's go together

216
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,870
Cooking classes at Yuhan Department Store?

217
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,830
To make it exactly like this

218
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,550
(Yuhan Department Store Cultural Center
Special cooking classes)

219
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,720
That's where Ms. Jin Ciyu goes to class

220
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,140
This has never happened before.

221
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,890
It must be because of my change of attitude.
Zheng Xiumin has also made some progress

222
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,310
Don't you want it?

223
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,820
no

224
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,860
Thank you

225
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,450
I'm more grateful to you

226
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,700
Ji Won

227
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,580
I really feel sorry for you.

228
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,250
Thank you for giving me the chance, I won't let you down

229
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:49,220
I will be the one you can really rely on.

230
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,950
I definitely don't have a talent for acting.

231
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,250
Because I'm so tired.

232
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,670
Knowing it is bait, pretending to take the bait

233
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,490
Very good

234
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:58,750
If only the bad guys weren't so bad
It makes people hesitate whether to take revenge

235
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,540
But these people never give up, they are so bad

236
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,130
Thank you so much

237
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,300
Thank you so much

(Yuhan Department Store Cultural Center
Special cooking classes)

239
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,200
I had to pay for my own parking last week

240
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,830
I have been taking classes at the cultural center here for many years.

241
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,250
It's impossible

242
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,040
What is your name and license plate number, please?

243
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,460
Jin Ciyu, 5780

244
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,880
Miss Jin, you parked for more than five hours last week.

245
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,630
Excuse me
Since our course is only two hours long

246
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,180
-According to regulations, you must purchase goods...
-no

247
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,180
The parking space is only a few square meters.
What are you calculating about?

248
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,980
I've never paid for parking.

249
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,230
Why are you asking me to pay now?

250
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,400
This is my seat.

251
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,530
Oh my god

252
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,570
Everyone pays to attend class.
There is no such thing as who has the right seat.

253
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,620
This lady

254
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,410
Whatever the adults say, it's what it is.

255
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,420
Go away, go over there.

256
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,040
I'm sorry, let's just stick to our fixed seats.

257
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,300
- Let's switch seats.
-What are you sorry for?

258
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,760
Where are the fixed seats?

259
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,090
That lady is more sensible.

260
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:42,010
Anyway, whether it is in the past or now
People who don't know manners

261
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,060
There are everywhere

262
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,370

266
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,250

Mom, today is Sunday, where have you been?

271
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,890
I'm hungry

272
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,020
Why did you call me?

273
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,320
Where's Dad? Where's Dad?

274
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,240
Dad? He's busy.

275
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,990
I'm hungry. When will you be back?

276
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,990
Why is Dad busy?

277
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,910
Is Dad not home? Where did he go?

278
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,800
Sir, please drive faster.

279
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,100
My five-year-old is home alone.

280
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,060
What should I do?

-Yeonji
-Mother!

I'm mom, this is a video call
Put your phone down and look at me

-Mother!
-Don't cry, look at me

288
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,840
Mother!

289
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,660
Yanzhi, mom will be back soon.
It'll be here soon. Wait a minute.

291
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,300
Please help me

292
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,330
OK, thank you

293
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,080
Mr. Li, thank you so much

294
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,670
Thanks

295
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,970
Where have you been?

296
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,810
I'll go do something.

297
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,220
Am I playing?

298
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:13,890
What do you do on the weekend?

299
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,190
instant noodles…

300
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,440
How can you let a child eat instant noodles?

301
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,740
Don't eat

302
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,320
That's really exaggerated

303
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,700
Then you feed her.

304
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,330
How are you?

305
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,040
-Mother
-Um?

306
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,290
Since you are coming back so early
Why go to work on weekends?

307
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:10,530
The young lady's hands are really quick and neat

308
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,240
I like cooking

309
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,380
But this lady...

310
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,550
There is a way to move so slowly
Cooking a meal for the family?

311
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,840
At that rate, I won't be able to eat until tomorrow.

312
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:32,050
Do you want to eat it the day after tomorrow morning?

313
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,970
I plan to eat it the day after tomorrow afternoon

314
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,470
What?

315
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,390
What did you say?

316
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,650
My boyfriend likes to cook.
He said he would cook for me once every two days

317
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,990
My past era
I can't imagine a man entering the kitchen.

318
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,950
Times are different now.

319
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,700
I like it this way

320
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,620
This lady

321
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:04,630
You can tell what kind of family you will marry into at a glance

322
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,380
-Ms. Ciyu
-Oh my god

323
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,510
Are you ready?

324
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,930
teacher!

325
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,600
Why is she so annoying?

326
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:22,770
Teacher, some women can't cook at all

327
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,530
I come here to take classes to seduce men.

328
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,490
You really have to be careful.

329
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,360
Oh, ok, I understand.

330
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,210
Oh my god, Miss Ji-won

331
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,460
How do you do it so beautifully?

332
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,590
Wow, that's amazing, awesome

333
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,460
Well done

334
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:53,340
Although I really shouldn’t be able to cook at this time…

335
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,980
Peel that pear.

336
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,820
good

337
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:17,490
Don't make it too thick, cut it thinner

338
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,540
good

339
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:23,040
Thank you for your rigorous training.

340
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,920
This is exactly the craft I like.

341
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,960
How can an uneducated person...

342
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,510
What's the use of food if it only looks good?

343
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:38,100
It is very difficult to season pickled carrot shreds properly

344
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,890
This taste...

345
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,320
Just like the teacher did.

346
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:54,490
Because this is what you taught me after you learned it here
Ms. Kim Tzu-ok

347
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,660
I'm glad you said it was delicious.

348
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,470
When did you learn to cook?

349
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,930
How could I learn anything? I just did it.

350
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,140
Because I want to make it look prettier.
So do it slowly and deliberately

351
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,350
I heard it for the first time today
Pickled shredded carrots

352
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,820
Oh, my dad told me before

353
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,400
Your father...

354
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,860
He's such a nice guy.

355
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,870
- Please enjoy your meal
-Thank you, let's go.

356
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,740
Let's go shopping.

357
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,910
Oh Min-hwan

358
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,920
He said he wanted to buy me clothes to meet his parents.

359
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,260
Do you want to come with us?

360
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,430
Speaking of which…

361
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,020
I don't know Xiumin...

362
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,270
Also in yeah

363
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,700
Honey, when are we
Going to meet your parents?

364
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,200
What?

365
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,580
Oh, we should set a time.

366
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,370
I have to go first

367
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,840
I have an appointment

368
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,630
If I knew Min-hwan was coming
I won't date anyone else. What a shame.

369
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,130
Do you have an appointment?

370
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,970
Well, let's date next time.
I'll treat you to a big meal

371
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,930
I've already given you a birthday present and a wedding present.

372
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,390
next time

373
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,350
I'll treat you, thank you for saving my life

374
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,190
OK, that's it.

375
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,240
We haven't dated alone for a long time.
Let's go on a date, okay?

376
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,900
Oh, ok

377
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,070
very good

378
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,380
I really live because of you.

379
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,550
I'm leaving

380
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,940
Do you need to buy duty-free goods?

381
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,020
No

382
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,780
Do you need to buy duty-free goods?

383
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,860
No

384
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,360
Please wait a moment

385
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,030
Do you need a catalog?

386
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,130
(Ossendyk)

387
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,210
Could he be sending the same one?

388
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,920
No, it’s a little different. This time…

389
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,220
Looks a bit more expensive

390
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,240
I want this

391
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,160
Hey, this price is too expensive...

392
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,450
Are you a newlywed couple?

393
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,160
This is perfect as a wedding gift

394
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:29,870
I haven't met my mother-in-law yet.

395
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,830
But I heard she has very high standards.

396
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,330
If she has high standards

397
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,040
The future daughter-in-law should at least have this kind of bag

398
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,710
Not just for my mother-in-law.

399
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,670
Actually, we are U&K office couple.

400
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,760
Everyone is looking forward to seeing what the groom-to-be will buy for me.
Even I feel stressed.

401
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,270
He is a man whose body is dominated by his self-esteem.

402
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,850
Oh, yes.

403
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,390
I am a U&K legend

404
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,650
Then we'll buy this

405
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,190
-May I?
-certainly

406
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,440
Show us a few more similar ones.

407
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,530
This must go well with pink

408
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,910
- With this bag
-What?

409
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,010
I asked her to buy it, but she bought it all? Damn it

410
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,440
Are you going to buy cheap clothes online again?

411
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,650
I told you

412
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,990
My mother has very high standards.

413
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,450
If my mother is not satisfied with you

414
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,490
We can't get married.

415
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,250
I didn't want to
Let people who are poor enough to use my credit card spend money

416
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,380
Why should I do that?

417
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,960
If I don't spend it, another woman will spend it.

418
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,380
What's the big deal?

419
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,970
Two cups of coffee.

420
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,720
Thanks

421
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,890
Min-hwan, this looks great, right?

422
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,350
I like it very much

423
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,230
I think I finally became
Someone who matches your parents.

424
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,740
Having a family is a wonderful thing.

425
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,110
Good looking, very beautiful

426
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,240
Everything here is beautiful.

427
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,330
I think women really need to meet the right man.

428
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,540
Of course, a woman has to meet the right man.

429
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,800
You're about to meet my parents.

430
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,590
We need to find a place to eat

431
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,220
Regarding meal expenses, how can we...

432
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,680
(Bai Enhao)

433
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,440
-Baek Eun-ho?
- Keep talking

434
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,070
Is he the classmate of yours who opened a restaurant?

435
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,610
-no
-No?

436
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,820
etc.

437
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,410
Hello?

438
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,540
Isn’t this Kang Ji-won’s phone number?

439
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,960
Yes, hello

440
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,170
I'm Ji Won's boyfriend, my name is Park Min Hwan

441
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:25,420
Yes, hello

442
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,380
I'm Ji Won's friend, Baek Eun Ho

443
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,680
I often hear Jiwon mention you

444
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,680
I remember she said you were a very good cook

445
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,390
Yes, thank you

446
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:41,600
Is it inconvenient for Zhiyuan to answer the phone now?

447
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,270
That's not important

448
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,940
I heard you own a fine-dining restaurant.

449
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,280
What kind of food do you cook?

450
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,070
France or Italy?

451
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,780
Or no menu cuisine?

452
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,740
We cook creative dishes

453
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,410
French-based

454
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,080
Oh, that's perfect.

455
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,750
Here's what's going on

456
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,540
Ji Won will be meeting my parents soon

457
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,550
If I could eat at a friend's restaurant
It should make sense, we are talking about it

458
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,470
If you were her classmate

459
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:18,220
Will there be a discount for classmates?
Or how about discounts from acquaintances or friends?

460
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,230
It would be great if there was

461
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,190
I'll contact you later
I'll leave it to you then. Goodbye.

462
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,610
-What are you doing?
-Are you familiar with him? How familiar are you?

463
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,070
How? What did she say?

464
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,990
Is she with her boyfriend?

465
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,830
What's wrong with you? How is it? Is she busy?

466
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,880
I didn't get through to Jiwon.

467
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,790
I'll ask her later

468
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,300
What are you doing?

469
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,300
From Ji-won's perspective

470
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,220
- She might not want to accept the apology
-yes

471
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,050
No matter what, we should do something

472
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,680
As long as you are human, you should make up for your mistakes.

473
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,100
I, Xia Ruizhi

474
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:08,070
I was cheated by Jung Soo Min
The biggest mistake of my life

475
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,990
The date for meeting the parents will probably be in early December.

476
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,410
I'll leave it to you.

477
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,910
It seems she is getting married.
You can give a bigger red envelope.

478
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,960
marry?

479
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,420
(Kang Ji-won)

480
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:34,970
Hello?

481
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,760
Eunho, I'm sorry.

482
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,720
Never mind, that...

483
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,930
Congratulations on getting married

484
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,650
No, don't pay attention to what he said.

485
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,020
I'll find a way to handle it

486
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,480
I'll cook for you.

487
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,530
Eun Ho

488
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,860
You are my first love

489
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,120
Let me do it

490
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,750
They will become your family.

491
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,000
I will treat them specially

492
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:29,150
Your only grandpa was in hospital, but you came too late

493
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,360
If I'm impatient
I might die before you come.

494
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,360
You will live healthy for more than ten years.

495
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,240
What?

496
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,410
I came here right after I flew back from Japan.

497
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,870
Is it handled?

498
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,290
She is Yura, we only met for a short time

499
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,290
There's no one as good as her.

500
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,840
She is better than that employee named Jiang Zhiyuan
Hundreds of times better

501
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,510
Grandpa, please let her go.

502
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,260
She has nothing to do with me, and she will never be with me.

503
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,390
How could I just ignore it?

504
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,980
This is my personal emotional issue.

505
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,850
You are such a fool

506
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,310
Falling in love with someone who is already in love

507
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,980
Breaking family agreements

508
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:17,490
Villas, yachts, and fireworks

509
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:20,240
Still pestering employees to fly drones

510
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,530
How is this a personal problem for you?

511
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:31,920
Did you hear everything I did?

512
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,420
Of course

513
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,670
You are not alone
If your dad were still alive, it would be a different story.

514
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:42,890
Who are you…

515
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:48,730
We in the U&K will continue to work hard in the next 30 or 40 years.

516
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,900
People who care for and lead more than 600,000 employees

517
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,070
You're such a poor fool.

518
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,860
Fall in love, can't extricate yourself

519
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,280
well

520
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:11,670
how?

521
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,720
I missed a lot more than I thought.

522
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,980
What's wrong?

523
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,910
grandfather…

524
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,450
I must have cried a lot.

525
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:02,590
I'll be good, don't worry.

526
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,940
Sorry, Grandpa.

527
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,790
(Ossendyk)

528
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,350
Very cold

529
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:52,680
How did you get here?

530
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:57,980
Our company has a logistics warehouse nearby

531
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,560
I went there and stopped by...

532
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,700
Actually, I'm lying

533
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,450
I came because I miss you

534
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:19,170
Did anything happen to you?

535
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,050
Didn't you ask me before what I wanted to be?

536
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,760
I never thought about what I would become

537
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:38,020
From the moment I was born, I was determined to do something.

538
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:43,610
So I only work hard and study for U&K

539
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,080
I want to be the land

540
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,790
At least you have something to do now.

541
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,550
No

542
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,260
That was impossible.

543
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,060
How about starting simple?

544
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,190
What do you want to do right now?

545
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:29,030
When I just came back
I also feel that everything is black.

546
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:32,370
Where should I escape to? How can I make money?

547
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,370
I hate seeing Park Min-hwan and Jung Soo-min in front of me

548
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,290
So I thought to myself I don't want to be bullied anymore

549
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:46,380
I really stir-fried spicy pork
Knock him over like this

550
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,010
Ouch

551
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:59,980
After that I seemed to see more clearly.

552
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,490
Getting them married is just a process

553
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,200
I have to be happy after all.

554
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,950
Do what I like

555
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,370
And I like...

556
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,670
Meeting friends

557
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,810
I can…

558
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,320
Shake your hand?

559
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,440
Let Park Min-hwan and Jung Soo-min get married

560
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,610
Then make yourself happy.

561
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,590
It's not like you're getting married.

562
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,920
Just wear what I choose for you.

563
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,050
This is expensive clothing.

564
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:55,630
Ossendic!

565
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,640
What’s the use of being expensive?

566
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,390
The color is ugly and the style is weird

567
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:04,020
Your blind eyes
Do you want me to dig them out?

568
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,440
Why are you arguing so early in the morning?
Do you want to wait first?

569
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,110
Are you crazy? I'm going to be 30 minutes late

570
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:13,150
If she wants my baby son, she has to wait

571
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:17,320
Let a worthless woman take my son away
That's infuriating enough.

572
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:18,740
mom

573
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,830
Will you really help me buy a house?

574
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:24,500
Have you been looking for a house? What is your budget?

575
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,160
What is this?

576
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,590
You wear this one, it's very high-end, very good

577
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:32,090
This...

578
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,170
How about this red one?

579
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,550
I'm at your door, come down

580
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:39,680
(Hai Ying Villa)

581
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,020
Damn

582
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,360
How are you? How did you get here?

583
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,610
Are you going to meet your parents today?

584
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,320
What? That...

585
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:56,690
Don't be afraid

586
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:03,240
I know you are mine

587
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,470
What are you doing?

588
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,810
What? I'm just checking.
Are my things still good?

589
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:31,480
I have about ten minutes.

590
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,440
I don't plan on finishing in ten minutes.

591
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,940
What?

592
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,780
You will be late

593
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,530
Go introduce Kang Ji-won to your parents.

594
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:55,250
Chef, I'll do it.

595
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,050
Don't you trust me?

596
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,130
right

597
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,640
This table is very important today.

598
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:23,990
I'll be back in a minute.

599
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:25,120
good

600
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,580
Why does he look so sad?

601
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,000
But why hasn’t anyone come yet?

602
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,170
Hello, am I late?

603
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,420
On the way…

604
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,300
-No one is coming?
-Yes, no one has come yet.

605
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:47,810
What?

606
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:54,400
Kang Ji-won, where are you?

607
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,060
How can you be late?

608
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:00,360
My parents are here, but you are not here yet!

609
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,700
Don't you know how important today is?

610
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,160
I'm at the door

611
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,950
What are you doing and why are you here only now?

612
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:07,160
mom

613
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,330
Come here soon

614
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,540
Hasn't she arrived yet?

615
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,870
She arrived and she went to the toilet

616
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,150
I thought I was late
But it seems I came at the right time

617
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,780
Uncle, aunt, nice to meet you.

618
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,960
Oh, you are the one from before...

619
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,710
Right?

620
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,210
I like it this way

621
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,130
This lady

622
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:06,430
You can tell what kind of family you will marry into at a glance

623
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:09,890
Oh my god, you are Min-hwan's mother.

624
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,480
Thanks

625
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:20,310
I heard that your parents passed away very early.

626
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,610
Your tutoring is probably inadequate.

627
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,490
No, my father passed away when I was 23.

628
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,830
I have received adequate tutoring.

629
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,920
But my mom left home when I was 14.

630
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,920
So I was not influenced by her.

631
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,010
But this should be celebrated
Because she left home because of an affair

632
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:47,590
-How are you?
-Um

633
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:04,440
I've always wanted to know
What kind of girl will Min Hwan bring?

634
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,320
It seems that he brought a very remarkable girl with him.

635
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,030
Mom, Ji-won is really a good girl

636
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,240
She is very well behaved

637
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,910
She won't let you get a drop of water on your hands
She's such a good girl.

638
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:22,590
Why don't you wear the clothes I bought for you?
What's up with this eagle wings outfit?

639
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:25,460
Did you buy clothes for her?

640
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:29,300
Oh, not this one. No.

641
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:32,350
I plan to do it on a special day
Wear the clothes you bought for me again

642
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:36,140
But I got the bag.

643
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,610
Auntie, thank you so much
Raised Min-hwan so well

644
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:48,360
Because I want to become a family with him.
He went from head to toe

645
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,990
Bought me a whole set and dressed me up
Really thoughtful

646
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:57,620
I only received his first paycheck.
The red hygienic clothes you bought for me

647
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,080
Oh really?

648
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,830
You're really going too far.

649
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,760
(Pet Cat Management Trust Agreement)

650
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:14,550
(Client: Liu Zhihe)

651
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:22,770
From now on, no matter what happens to you

652
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:25,610
This cat will be in this house
Well cared for

653
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,610
Thanks

654
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,860
Are you going anywhere?
Why do you suddenly want to put your cat into a trust?

655
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,740
No one knows what will happen to me one day.

656
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,290
Don't you like cats very much?

657
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:43,580
I like it

658
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:47,500
I have another favor to ask of you.

659
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:00,100
(Ossendyk)

660
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,940
Is she doing well?

661
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,950
Good

662
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:24,000
I will protect you till the end

663
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:34,260
I'm a frank person, so I'll just say it.

664
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,550
I love you, mom

665
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:41,430
I'm not happy with you

666
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:44,230
I never thought about it

667
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:46,400
Become a family with people like you

668
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,320
Because there are no adults in your family, you must not have learned well.

669
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:55,110
But as long as you are willing to learn now,

670
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:58,780
Do you have this intention?

671
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,910
Yes, of course.

672
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,370
good

673
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,330
I'm not that rigid.

674
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,000
I don't care about the difference between men and women these days.

675
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:12,000
They are all my parents' babies.

676
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:16,800
But that's just social talk.

677
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,140
It's different at home.

678
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,470
Um

679
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:24,180
Family life is ultimately up to women.

680
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:27,690
To make sure men eat well and keep the house clean

681
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,560
Raise your children well

682
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:32,150
Yes, auntie, I have faith.

683
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,360
Men lose energy when they enter the kitchen

684
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:40,950
No matter how much someone denies

685
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:44,950
This is a major fact common to the world

686
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,540
I want to cook for Min-hwan

687
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,290
- I am currently learning cooking
-right

688
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,250
You must make breakfast for him.

689
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,510
No bread or cereal
That kind of unspeakable thing

690
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:57,550
Be sure to cook soup or stew a pot and eat it with rice

691
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:00,220
Yes, I understand

692
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,680
If you want children, three or four?

693
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:06,770
If possible, have as many children as possible.

694
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,400
I think this is good too.

695
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,310
I don't have any brothers or sisters, so I feel a little lonely

696
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,530
I am very satisfied with this

697
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:18,450
I'll contact you sometime.

698
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:19,910
Come with me to the doctor

699
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:24,540
Recently, there are many uteruses in poor condition.

700
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:28,750
I'll take a look and get the doctor's opinion.

701
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:33,840
If you take care of yourself
There's no reason to say no.

702
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,760
Have a health check-up

703
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:42,430
By the way, I have always been ashamed to face my ancestors.

704
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:44,010
Always makes me feel bad

705
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:47,470
Now that there are new family members joining

706
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,640
I plan to resume ancestor worship

707
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:51,560
recover?

708
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:53,810
Red east, white west, jujube, chestnut, pear, potato

709
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,400
I will teach you, don't worry.

710
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,070
Here are a few things you should keep in mind:

711
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,780
You must serve your elders sincerely

712
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:05,990
Respect and serve your husband

713
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,080
Proper child rearing

714
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:13,130
When working in the workplace
You show smart and capable

715
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:14,750
I totally agree

716
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:20,970
Why should I work?

717
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:27,390
Are you going to quit your job?

718
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,900
I want to continue working
But after hearing what my aunt said

719
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,150
I think I'm too greedy.

720
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,110
No!

721
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:38,690
Do you know how much it costs to raise a child these days?

722
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,740
How can you play at home?

723
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:43,360
How can it be a game?

724
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:45,280
Serve your uncle and aunt sincerely

725
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:46,410
You must respect and serve Min-hwan

726
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,790
If you want to raise your children well

727
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:53,420
24 hours a day aren't enough.

728
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:58,130
And my aunt, not red east and white west, but dates, chestnuts, pears and potatoes

729
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:01,130
Red in the east and white in the west, jujube, chestnut, pear, persimmon

730
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:04,760
-What?
- You said it was potato

731
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,180
Not quite the same

732
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:10,680
I myself worship my father every year
So I know very well

733
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:12,560
I will not reject ancestor worship.

734
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,020
So family education is very important

735
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:18,860
Miss, this is against the rules.

736
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,610
Daughters cannot worship their parents

737
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:28,780
Your dad would understand.
It is his sin to have only daughters

738
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:31,290
That's why everyone wants to have a son.

739
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:33,910
There's a reason for all this.

740
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,960
But I can't understand, auntie

741
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,010
Auntie?

742
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,590
Are you a judge?

743
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,850
Why was my father convicted?

744
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:50,850
Jiang Zhiyuan, are you crazy?

745
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,310
How dare you be so disrespectful?

746
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:54,180
Wait, don't talk.

747
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,600
Auntie?

748
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:59,570
Hey, are you done?

749
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,860
I don't want this marriage.

750
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:07,820
You are the aunt, right?

751
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,200
Wake up, auntie.

752
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:14,910
Your son is not that good.

753
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:17,250
Even if he is good

754
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:20,710
You should also understand that other people's daughters are just as precious

755
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,630
You listen to me.

756
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,630
Not You

757
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,430
I don't like this family.
So don't get married.

758
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:31,560
Do you understand?

759
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:35,640
Jiang Zhiyuan, are you crazy? You...

760
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,070
Wait a minute, hey, Kang Ji-won, hello!

761
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:42,270
Kang Ji-won

762
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,280
Kang Ji Won!

763
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,620
Hello!

764
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:01,460
What are you doing?

765
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,340
What do you think? Of course I'll break up with you

766
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,510
What? Break up?

767
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:13,430
Are you kidding me?

768
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:20,690
Let's not get involved anymore.

769
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:29,700
You guy...

770
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,990
Girls want to throw bigger boys
It's not easy actually

771
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,120
So when the other party is completely unexpected

772
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:42,330
Fall down once

773
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,150
Minhwan

774
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,810
Damn it.

775
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,300
Kang Ji Won!

776
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:37,760
How dare the cheating guy be so loud?

777
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:40,390
What else do you have besides being beautiful?

778
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,390
How could you do this to Xiumin?

779
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,020
My life is ruined

780
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:47,150
I have a woman I want to marry

781
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,150
You said you have nothing to do with my benefactor.
I won't do anything.

782
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:54,110
As long as they two get married
Can I live like this?

783
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,660
How could you get into such trouble?

784
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:58,870
Zheng Xiumin, stop!

785
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:00,700
I won't let it go easily this time.

786
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:02,870
You clean up the mess you made.
