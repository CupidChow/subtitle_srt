1
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,048
智媛
JI-WON

2
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:56,140
杀了我
Kill me.

3
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:12,948
我的命运终究是要死在朴敏焕手上吗？
Was I destined to die in Park Min-hwan's hands?

4
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:18,829
智媛
Ji-won.

5
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:21,916
智媛
Ji-won.

6
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,834
智媛！
Ji-won!

7
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,726
等等，等一下
Wait. Hold on...

8
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,337
你说一次看看
Tell me again.

9
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:15,010
我以后不接李在元的电话
I won't answer Lee Jae-won's calls.

10
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:18,097
就算他到家里来，也不要开门
If he comes to the house, I won't open the door,

11
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,182
然后马上打电话给你
and call you right away.

12
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,144
李室长
Mr. Lee.

13
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:29,066
感谢你每次都载我到医院来
Thank you for driving me to the hospital every time like this

14
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:32,194
也感谢你和我洽谈离婚事宜…
and giving me divorce advice, but--

15
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:34,613
你不必感谢我
You don't have to thank me for that.

16
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,782
这是我的业务
It's work for me.

17
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,452
U&K付我很多钱
I get paid a lot of money from U&K.

18
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,539
我只是照着雇主的要求去做
I do what my employer wants.

19
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,211
好
Okay.

20
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:00,973
不过你说过你关心我
But you said you cared about me.

21
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,443
你还是把想说的话都说出来了
You just have to say your piece.

22
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,572
请等一下
Just a moment.

23
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,784
刘志赫部长
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

24
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,829
喂？怎么会这个时间打给我？
Hey, what is it at this hour?

25
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:25,497
我现在在警察局
I'm at the police station.

26
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:26,707
警察局？
The police station?

27
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:30,502
我现在马上过去
I'll be right there.

28
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,088
不用到这里来，请你到医院去
No, go to the hospital instead.

29
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,633
唯一医院
YUIL MEDICAL CENTER

30
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,926
第15集
EPISODE 15

31
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,552
区域紧急医疗中心

32
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:43,641
不好意思
Excuse me.

33
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:47,686
姜智媛，32岁，从江南的U&K总公司送过来的这位患者在哪里？
Kang Ji-won, 32, transferred from U&K in Gangnam. Where is she?

34
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,023
亲爱的
Ji-won.

35
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,860
她的呼吸和脉搏都恢复正常了
Her breathing and pulse are stable now.

36
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:58,739
稍微有点发烧，等她恢复意识，我们会再过来看看
But she has a fever, so we'll check her once she wakes up.

37
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:03,369
由于是暴力事件，她跟警察一起过来，我开诊断书给你们
It was an assault, so she came with the police. I'll get you her record.

38
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,543
喂
Hey.

39
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,171
我会终结你的人生
I'm going to ruin your life,

40
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,048
做好心理准备
so brace yourself.

41
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,927
我会向媒体爆料富三代施暴又仗势欺人
I'll tell the media a third-generation tycoon assaulted me.

42
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,889
现在这个时代，你隐瞒不了的
You can't cover things up these days.

43
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,309
我已经惨到不能再惨了
I have nothing to lose now.

44
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:29,895
都是因为你
Thanks to you.

45
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,359
为了姜智媛而毁了你的人生会不会太逊了？
But isn't Ji-won too inferior to ruin your life over?

46
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,445
她瘦巴巴的，有什么看头？
She's nothing but skin and bones.

47
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,618
刘部长
Mr. Yu.

48
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,162
要我给你一个忠告吗？
Do you want some advice?

49
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,540
不要太相信她
Don't trust her.

50
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,793
你知道我为何会疯掉吗？
Do you know why I went mad?

51
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,921
姜智媛会让人发疯
Ji-won makes people lose their minds.

52
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,758
毁掉你的不是我和姜智媛
Ji-won and I aren't the ones that ruined you.

53
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,677
是你的垃圾品行
It's your trashy personality.

54
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:08,142
把人打成这样，你的品行就很高尚吗？
Look how you beat me. Is your personality any better?

55
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,520
你不能因为比我会打架就这样
You can't do this because you fight better.

56
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:16,900
你才是不该那样对待体重只有你一半的女人吧？
That's a bit rich, considering what you did to a woman half your size.

57
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:18,902
什么？
What?

58
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,160
对你不利的时候，你就寻求平等
You seek equality when at a disadvantage,

59
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,412
对你有利的时候，你就爱展现力量
and strength when at an advantage.

60
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,293
其实我不喜欢运用我的力量
I hate using my strength.

61
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,589
可是对你，我不得不用
But not to you.

62
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,552
刘志赫先生，请出来
Mr. Yu, you can come out.

63
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:47,639
走吧
Let's go.

64
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,060
那我呢？
What about me?

65
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,895
为什么不把我弄出去？
Why can't I come out?

66
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,315
我呢？
What about me?

67
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,860
你以为你的人生不能再惨了吗？
Do you really think you can't go any lower?

68
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,449
大错特错
You're wrong.

69
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,499
不，为什么只有有钱人可以出去？
No, wait. Is it because he's rich?

70
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,375
我也是U&K的人
I work at U&K too!

71
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,336
那我呢？
What about me?

72
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,049
有钱没罪，没钱有罪！
One law for the rich and another for the poor!

73
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,513
朴敏焕从今天起被解雇
Min-hwan is fired as of today

74
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,599
事由是对同事施暴，违反公司规定
for assaulting a colleague and violating the rules.

75
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:31,809
也再找找其他事由
Find anything else.

76
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,852
上次出轨事件时，我有查过了
I checked during his affair incident.

77
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,730
他还有擅离职守、使用公司信用卡明细不清
AWOL and unclear corporate card statements.

78
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,774
不当招待厂商的情况
And he illegally treated clients.

79
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,735
很好，他是不是有公司贷款？
Good. Doesn't he have a company loan?

80
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,404
我会要银行向他提出还款要求
I'll ask the bank for a repayment request.

81
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,407
我会把暴力、伤害等可以加的罪名都加上去
I'll add assault, injury, and anything else.

82
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,326
还有姜智媛…
And Ms. Kang is...

83
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:52,996
她现在在家里
She's at home.

84
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,707
这是她的意愿
It's what she wanted.

85
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,085
我刚好和杨珠兰科长在一起
I happened to be with Ms. Yang.

86
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:02,047
所以我让杨科长去陪她，不过她看起来不太好
So I left Ms. Kang with her, but she didn't look good.

87
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,890
朴敏焕是不是也有欠高利贷没还？
You said there was a debt that Min-hwan hadn't paid off, right?

88
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,144
施压要他还钱
Put some pressure on that.

89
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,937
我们买下债权也可以
Or buy the bonds.

90
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,106
我马上去查
I'll look into it.

91
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,071
刘部长
Mr. Yu.

92
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,074
智媛怎么样了？
How's Ji-won?

93
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,869
她不太好
She's not good.

94
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:36,498
我想她睡一觉会比较好，所以想让她喝点牛奶
I think she'll be better if she sleeps, so I'll get her some milk.

95
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,375
可是家里什么都没有
There's nothing in her house.

96
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,420
部长，你还好吗？
Are you okay?

97
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,339
嗯，还好
Well, yes.

98
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:49,178
谢谢你，现在由我来接手，你回去休息吧
Thank you. I'll take it from here. You should go home and rest.

99
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,629
志赫
Ji-hyuk.

100
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,308
对不起
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,437
全都是我不好
I'm sorry for everything.

102
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,489
你有没有受伤？
Were you hurt?

103
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,574
这边怎么了？
What's this?

104
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,038
你好
Hello.

105
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,209
问候就只有这样？
Is that all?

106
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,670
也太少了吧
It can't be.

107
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:33,675
你打来是因为你先生受我照顾
Considering you called because your husband's in my care,

108
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,302
只说这样也太少了吧
there should be more.

109
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,688
你们要不要到中国去一阵子？
How about going to China for a while?

110
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:52,319
唉唷，那我们当然感激不尽
Oh, my. We would be so thankful if you could do that for us.

111
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,738
不过你们搭船的时候，会有些辛苦
It'll be a rough ride on the ship though.

112
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:59,576
唉唷，那怎么会辛苦呢？我们都没把您吩咐的事给办好
That's nothing at all. We couldn't even get the job done.

113
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,079
如果您再给我一次机会
If you give us another chance,

114
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,040
我会用力踩油门，把她辗过去
I'll hit the accelerator and crush her.

115
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,792
请一定要联络我
So just let me know.

116
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:07,918
好，谢谢
Yeah, thank you.

117
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,923
没钱的人总会试图留下些东西
Poor people always try to keep a record.

118
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,344
手上必须要握有保险
As insurance.

119
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,555
你想要的是什么？
What do you want?

120
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:26,395
你不喜欢我好好照顾你爸吗？
Do you hate that I'm taking care of your father?

121
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:31,441
只要把姜智媛辗过去的简单事情变得不再简单了
Now that crushing Kang Ji-won isn't so simple anymore,

122
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,569
你就突然要我们什么都别做
you suddenly say, "Don't do anything."

123
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:39,449
之后朴敏换还突然说要离婚
Then Park Min-hwan suddenly asks me for a divorce,

124
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,078
而我爸又不接电话，我就明白了
and my dad won't pick up, so I realize,

125
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,748
这样下去，只有我会完蛋
"I'll get screwed over."

126
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:52,212
从你的表情看来
Judging by the look on your face,

127
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,258
有钱人也没多厉害
you're nothing special.

128
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:01,638
可恶，我不该窝在房间里的
Darn it. Why have I been cooped up at home like that?

129
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,308
换我问问题了
I ask the questions now.

130
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,144
你能为我做什么？
What can you do for me?

131
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:19,448
韩国的小虾米是有毒吗？怎么会这么没有分寸？
Are the shrimps in Korea poisonous? Why don't they know their place?

132
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:28,206
郑万植和裴熙淑的尸体被发现了吗？
Have the bodies of Jeong Man-sik and Bae Hui-suk been found?

133
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,000
我会去查警方的报告
I'll check the police report.

134
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,840
暂时不要让新闻报出来
Make sure there's no news about it.

135
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:41,219
让郑秀敏感到有危机变得没好处了
Jeong Su-min shouldn't feel threatened now.

136
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,764
朴敏焕和郑秀敏
Park Min-hwan and Jeong Su-min.

137
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,517
可以一次解决掉吗？
Can we take care of them both at once?

138
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,443
朴敏焕
PARK MIN-HWAN

139
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:00,906
喂？
Hello?

140
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,991
我现在在警察局
I'm at the police station right now.

141
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,952
不好意思，可以请你帮个忙吗？
I'm sorry, but can I ask for a favor?

142
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,705
什么？警察局？
What? The police station?

143
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,748
首尔城三警察局
SUNGSAM POLICE STATION

144
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,167
虽然把你弄出来了，但是这个案子有些严重
We got you out, but it's pretty serious.

145
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,794
我们可能罩不了你
We may not be able to cover it.

146
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,172
什么？那是什么意思？
What? What are you saying?

147
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,175
你没有事先跟我们商量过，就做出这种行为
It wasn't what we agreed on.

148
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:25,055
若我们与U&K正面对决，副社长的负担会很大
If we have to fight U&K head-on, the burden on Ms. Oh will be big.

149
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,139
喂！
Hey!

150
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,143
你那是什么讲话态度？你以为你是谁啊？
What's with the attitude? Who do you think you are?

151
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,395
你是云彩航空的副社长吗？
You're not the VP of Cloud Air!

152
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,528
喂

你也不是

所以不要这么没礼貌

可恶
Damn it.

156
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,873
只在擂台上打架的家伙，就只会耍嘴皮子
You only know how to fight in the ring. Watch your mouth.

157
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,708
你不过就是吴宥拉的小喽罗
You're just Yu-ra's henchman.

还敢对我颐指气使

先生，等一下
Mister, wait!

161
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,930
你为什么要把他打到流鼻血？
Why would you give him a nosebleed?

162
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,974
我有什么理由不能那么做吗？
Is there a reason I can't?

163
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,268
那家伙的态度很糟糕啊！
He gave me attitude!

164
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,103
可恶

很可怕
It was scary.

她说你要离婚，她不愿意自己一个人死
She said you asked for a divorce. She won't go down alone.

170

她说不会让你独自脱身
She won't let you get away alone.

171
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,041
她疯啦？真是的
Is she out of her mind? Damn it.

172
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,167

你为什么不接电话？
Why won't you pick up?

189

她拿走了要给她爸的钱？

215
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,139
她真的不是一般厉害
She's really something.

- 请叫保全过来 - 你真的是…

医师
Doctor.

226

- 医师 - 你喝醉了吗？
- Doctor. - Are you drunk?

227
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,259
医师，我是她的丈夫
I'm her husband.

228
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:17,096
可是她躲在这里，也不接电话
But she was hiding here and ignoring my calls.

229
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,934

有证据
I have it.

232
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,483
你真的想这样？
Do you really want to do this here?

233
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,901
在医院里？

要看得到画面，让人无法抵赖

241
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,092
- 请你出去 - 不要拦我

242
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,387
你要让妍芝没有爸爸吗？

其实我过得不好
To be honest, I'm not doing that well.

264
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:39,155
朴敏换和我决定要离婚了
Min-hwan and I are getting a divorce.

昨天我离开家里，现在住在楼上

266
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,243
想休息一阵子
I'm going to rest for now.

267
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:49,832
这是因果报应
It must be karma.

268
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,422
我被爱情蒙蔽了双眼
Blinded by love, I betrayed

269
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,008
背叛了我唯一的闺蜜，我的另一半

270
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,887
结果…
In the end...

271
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,977
总之我现在是一个人了
Anyway, I'm all alone now.

272
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,898
你说你要离婚，那事情变得容易许多
The divorce makes this easier to say.

273
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,446
你打算要杀了姜智媛吧？
Did you try to kill Ji-won?

274
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,459
换作是我也会这么做
I would've done the same.

275
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,131
我的意思是说 我知道姜智媛和朴敏焕
I'm saying I know Ji-won and Min-hwan are

他们两个…
Are they really...

278
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,557

我会告诉你何时跟如何进去

281
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,779
如果你有需要的话 我也会帮你找最好的律师
If you want, I'll get you the best lawyer too.

282
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:07,326
你就只需履行身为法定配偶的权利
You just fulfill your role as his legal spouse.

283
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,084
为什么要帮我？
Why?

284
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,587
我不服气
Because it's not fair.

285
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,466
你的人生不是由于朴敏焕而毁了吗？
Isn't your life ruined because of Min-hwan?

286
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,390
要是你离婚 你就拿不到之前在公司工作的补偿
If you divorce, you won't be rewarded for your work at the company.

287
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:31,851
你什么都不剩
You'll be left with nothing.

288
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:33,853
我…
That's true...

289
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,397
的确是如此
for me.

290
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,277
那你能得到什么？
But what do you gain?

291
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,832
我希望姜智媛回到我身边
I want to get Kang Ji-won back.

292
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,921
我喜欢姜智媛
I like Ji-won.

293
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,883
所以我讨厌她跟朴敏焕纠缠
So I hate that she's with him.

294
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,763
我会想办法让她回到我身边
I'm going to make her come back to me.

295
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:12,683
所以帮帮我
So help me.

296
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:27,990
我可以问你一件事吗？
Can I ask you something?

297
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,206
你为什么讨厌我？
Why do you hate me?

298
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:41,796
因为你只知道自己
Because you're selfish.

299
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,967
有的人会啃食身边的人
There are those who gnaw at people around them.

300
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:50,805
而你正是这种人，所以我很讨厌
You are that type, so I hate you.

301
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,309
你又不了解我
You don't know me that well.

302
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:57,228
你不相信任何人吧？
You don't trust anyone, do you?

303
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,481
那是因为你是不值得信任的人
That's because you're not trustworthy.

304
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:06,779
你认为别人也跟你一样 所以你无法相信人
You think everyone's like you, so you can't trust anyone.

305
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,742
你这么想，我们怎么合作？
How can you work with me thinking like that?

306
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,205
你不是问我为什么讨厌你吗？
Didn't you ask me why I hated you?

307
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:18,958
我没说我无法与你合作
I never said I couldn't work with you.

308
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,337
你决定好就告诉我
Let me know when you decide.

309
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,474
谈得很顺利
It went well.

310
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:39,061
如你所说，她问我为何要帮她
As you said, she asked me why I was helping her.

311
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:44,984
如果我全都说谎，她应该不会相信 所以我适当地掺入一些真话
I didn't think she'd believe me if I lied, so I mixed in some truth.

312
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:54,493
除了她会发现出轨的一对 是吴宥拉和朴敏焕之外
Except that it'll be Oh Yu-ra and Park Min-hwan instead,

313
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,370
我说的全都是事实
everything I said was true.

314
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,247
还有…
Also...

315
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:03,419
我们公司有提供给员工一项保险
There's an insurance policy provided to company employees.

316
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,629
家人保险
A family insurance.

317
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,008
理赔对象包括本人、配偶与直系血亲
It compensates yourself, spouse, and immediate family.

318
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,136
离职时，本人可以决定是否继续加保
You can decide to keep it when you quit.

319
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,346
二手市场
SECOND HAND MARKET

320
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,224
过不久应该就会通知朴敏焕
A notice will go to Park Min-hwan soon.

321
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:25,024
把这个卖了，就可以救急
I can take care of the more urgent debt if this gets sold.

322
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,487
他本来不晓得有这种保险
He doesn't know such insurance existed,

323
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,113
不过很快就会知道了
but he will soon.

324
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,075
舞台正在搭建中
The stage is being set.

325
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,202
糖果

326
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:04,021
我要不要干脆去死？
Shall I just die?

327
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:08,150
虽然如果朴敏换没有起歹念 那项保险就没有用
Though it's useless if Min-hwan doesn't decide to die.

328
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:09,485
要是我死了
If I die...

329
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,616
我爸妈就能领到我的身故保险金
my mom and dad can get my life insurance benefit.

330
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:23,124
在朴敏焕走到现在这步之前 有好几次机会可以停止
Min-hwan could've stopped several times on his way here,

331
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,793
但是他都没有
but he didn't.

332
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,588
他应该会一路走到底
He'll go all the way.

333
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,216
那就没有问题了
Then there's no problem.

334
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,261
郑秀敏应该也会一路走到底
Jeong Su-min will go all the way too.

335
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,393
为什么大家
Why is everyone

336
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,270
都只在找姜智媛？
looking for Kang Ji-won?

337
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:49,608
因为现在的郑秀敏 应该会对你更加执着
I think Jeong Su-min is more obsessed with you right now.

338
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,990
现在就剩那一刻了
It's that moment now.

339
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,747
剩下的就是让郑秀敏经历那一刻
All that's left is for her to experience it.

340
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,145
要不要回日本呢？
How about returning to Japan?

341
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,400
比起以前，刘志赫行动积极许多
Yu Ji-hyuk is moving more actively than before.

342
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,486
他把朴敏焕个人的债务和高利贷
He's pressuring Park Min-hwan

343
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,697
全都买下来，向他施压 他应该撑不久
with his debt and private loans. He won't last long.

344
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:39,950
他似乎也不放弃寻找郑万植和裴熙淑
And he hasn't given up on Man-sik and Hui-suk.

345
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:43,287
他搜遍了 仁川所有废弃工厂附近的监视器画面
He got all the CCTV footage from the abandoned factory.

346
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:44,830
虽然他不会找到什么
He won't find anything,

347
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:48,042
但是与U&K正面迎战，没有任何好处
but nothing good can come from fighting U&K head-on.

348
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,260
看来你没信心
You must not be confident.

349
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,097
你已经先害怕，要我逃跑了
Seeing how you're telling me to run away.

350
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,267
没关系
It's okay.

351
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:09,480
他爷爷不一样
His grandfather is different.

352
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:13,901
他与温室花朵刘志赫不一样
Unlike Ji-hyuk, who's like a flower in a green house,

353
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,569
他是很现实的人
he's realistic.

354
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:20,366
他知道灰姑娘会多么令人头疼
He knows how much of a nuisance Cinderella can be.

355
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,095
将军
Checkmate.

356
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:46,016
我都赢不过爷爷
I can never beat you.

357
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,395
因为你全都想要，就被我看穿步数了
You want everything, so I can read your hand.

358
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:54,442
懂得放弃不属于自己的东西 是作为领导者的条件
A good leader should know how to give up something that's not theirs.

359
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,819
好
Okay.

360
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,198
你来啦？
Hey!

361
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:04,827
嗯
Hi.

362
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,912
我和爷爷在下象棋
We were just playing janggi.

363
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,747
今天我又输了
And I lost again.

364
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,461
不过我觉得我应该能赢过你 要一起下吗？
But I think I can beat you. Do you want to play?

365
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:16,547
爷爷
Grandfather.

366
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,924
您不是要我带喜欢的女生回来吗？
You asked me to bring the woman I like.

367
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,136
我会正式带她过来
I will introduce her to you.

368
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,140
所以请不要再让宥拉到家里来了
So don't let Yu-ra into the house anymore.

369
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,269
你之前说你是单恋，没打算跟她交往
You said it was one-sided and weren't going to make it work.

370
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,854
你改变心意了吗？
Did you change your mind?

371
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,064
对，我打算跟她在一起
Yes, I'm going to pursue it.

372
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,569
可是家里不能有前未婚妻进出
So I can't have my ex-fiancée frequenting my house.

373
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,201
我在订婚期间太不用心了
I was so indifferent during our engagement.

374
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,496
我都不晓得他这么急性子
I didn't know he was so impatient.

375
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,498
像我们这样的人
People like us

376
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:53,334
结婚不是我们说好就可以
can't marry for love, can we?

377
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,338
别做鲁莽的举动 先获得爷爷的同意…
Get permission from your grandfather before you--

378
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,255
我会的
I will.

379
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:00,799
我现在就把她介绍给您
I'll introduce her now.

380
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,111
您好，我是姜智媛
Hello, I'm Kang Ji-won.

381
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:35,376
我们来把姜智媛处理掉
Let's get rid of Kang Ji-won.

382
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:38,212
你不要回日本吗？
You're not going back to Japan?

383
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,381
我输了会活不下去
I can't live with myself if I lose.

384
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:44,426
我为何要被微不足道的小虫 害得我有这种感觉？
Why do I have to feel this way over those cockroaches?

385
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,597
对，当初我就应该亲自出手
Yeah, I should've done it myself.

386
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:51,350
借他人之手只是让自己头痛
It's a headache having others do it.

387
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:12,663
我告诉自己 必然会发生的事，就算困难也要面对
I've decided to face the obstacles that are bound to happen.

388
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:24,174
上次我跟你见面的时候
When I met you last time,

389
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:28,095
有些话没有告诉你
there's something I didn't tell you.

390
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,767
并不是面对就能解决所有事情
Powering through isn't a solution to everything.

391
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,315
我知道我孙子给了你 许多作为短暂交往的回报
I'm aware he gave you a lot for seeing him briefly.

392
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,985
所以你以后打算怎么做？
So what are you going to do from now on?

393
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,864
我会回过头去看和反省我有没有做错
I'll look back and reflect on my faults.

394
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,450
能够改正的就改正
I'll correct what I can.

395
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,160
剩下的…
And the rest...

396
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,039
我想我也无可奈何
I guess it is what it is.

397
00:31:56,123 --> 00:32:02,087
现在差不多是你想你也无可奈何 然后退出的时候了
It's time for you to step back and say, "It is what it is."

398
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,260
您果然知道这件事
So you knew.

399
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,309
我为了这件事狠狠骂了刘志赫
I gave him hell for that.

400
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:18,604
不会再有这种事了
That won't ever happen again.

401
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,734
他真的有很多不足
He lacks so much.

402
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,446
您对他娇生惯养
You spoiled him.

403
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,866
他只知道工作，对钱完全没有概念
He only knows how to work. He has no concept of money.

404
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:35,871
其实他太过富家少爷的态度 令我不知所措
Honestly, I was flustered because he was like a rich boy.

405
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,083
你是想要说什么？
What are you trying to say?

406
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:46,507
可是我喜欢他这一点
But I liked that about him.

407
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,261
其实我也是有很多不足的人
To tell you the truth, I lack a lot too.

408
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,558
当我以为他是完美的富三代的时候
When I thought he was a perfect third-generation chaebol,

409
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:59,061
感觉他遥不可及
he seemed unreachable.

410
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:05,192
可是当我看到他傻气、生气、散漫
But he can be foolish, get angry, and messy.

411
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:08,278
不知所措，以及有时…
He gets embarrassed, and sometimes...

412
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:12,616
耍孩子气的样子
he acts like a baby. Seeing those sides of him,

413
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,956
我想我们可以好好在一起
I thought we could do well together.

414
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:28,465
我想要跟他一起过得幸福
I want to be happy with him.

415
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:33,512
爷爷
Sir.

416
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:39,643
请把刘志赫交给我
Please, give Yu Ji-hyuk to me.

417
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,533
所有关于朴敏焕解雇的事宜 明天就会处理完毕
Park Min-hwan's termination will be finalized by tomorrow.

418
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:59,955
不过你为什么要问 公司帮忙加保的员工保险呢？
By the way, why did you ask about the insurance for employees?

419
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,790
通常他们都不会继续加保
They don't usually keep it.

420
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:05,043
这只是一项公司福利 大部分的人根本不知道有这个东西
It's just a company perk. Most don't know about it.

421
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:08,046
朴敏焕必定会继续加保
Park Min-hwan will do it.

422
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,157
看起来好好吃
That looks good.

423
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:36,867
三个
Three.

424
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,619
味道和口感如何？
How's the taste and texture?

425
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:46,418
确实如你所说 菠菜海螺意大利面最受欢迎
As you predicted, the spinach pasta with sea snails was most popular.

426
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:48,045
这应该会成为主打商品
It'll be the main product.

427
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:49,922
太好了
That's good.

428
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:54,468
在韩国的意大利面里 不常使用海螺与波菜…
Sea snails and spinach aren't common ingredients for pasta in Korea...

429
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,428
哦，对了
Oh, right.

430
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:57,805
请看镜头
Look at the camera.

431
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:58,972
好
Okay.

432
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,434
很好
Yes, that's good.

433
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:04,019
放轻松就好
Just be comfortable.

434
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,271
他会拍下自然的模样
He's going to get a natural look.

435
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:12,820
刘熙妍
YU HUI-YEON

436
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,538
今天真是辛苦你了
Great job today.

437
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:27,167
不会啦，你解救了差点失业的我 我才要感谢你
It was nothing. You saved me from being unemployed. I appreciate it.

438
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,629
我会尽快把修改好的食谱传给你
I'll send you the recipe revisions soon.

439
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,089
- 有点难呢 - 好
- It's hard. - Yeah.

440
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:35,342
我也会把草案和工厂时程 整理好传给你
I'll send you the draft and factory schedule too.

441
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:36,677
好
Okay.

442
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:38,804
对了
By the way,

443
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:44,685
今天没有看到刘熙妍和刘志赫
I didn't see Yu Hui-yeon and Yu Ji-hyuk today.

444
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,605
刚才部长一直都在啊
Mr. Yu was there all day.

445
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,483
这么说来，今天没看到熙妍耶
I haven't seen Hui-yeon either.

446
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:52,818
她去哪了？
Where did she go?

447
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,447
那我先走了
I should get going.

448
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:00,242
- 路上小心 - 好
- Goodbye! - Bye!

449
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:10,586
郑秀敏
JEONG SU-MIN

450
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:14,590
拒绝接听
CALL DECLINED

451
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,180
郑秀敏
JEONG SU-MIN

452
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:23,098
拒绝接听
CALL DECLINED

453
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,698
为什么不接我电话？
Why not pick up my calls?

454
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:42,284
我问你为何不接我电话
Why won't you pick up?

455
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:46,121
我为什么要接你电话？
Why do I have to pick up your calls?

456
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,086
好吧，我可以理解
Yeah, I get it.

457
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:57,049
你跟我老公交往了七年 结果他却选择了我，而不是你
You were with him for seven years, but he chose me over you.

458
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,926
你肯定一时很难接受
I'm sure it was hard to accept.

459
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,677
就算是这样
But still,

460
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:06,558
你怎么可以勾引已婚男子？你害得我要离婚了
how could you seduce a married man? I'm about to get divorced because of you.

461
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,026
请问是警卫室吗？
Is this security?

462
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,028
这里是16楼
This is the 16th floor.

463
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,113
有外部人士进来
An outsider is here.

464
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:21,907
请你们尽快处理
Take care of her.

465
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,786
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

466
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,246
你以为我会坐视不管吗？
Do you think I'd let it slide?

467
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:30,457
喂
Hey.

468
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:35,629
我为何要跟别人的男人搞在一起？我又不是你
Why would I sleep with someone else's man? I'm not you.

469
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:42,803
哦，你是用这种方式勾引了朴敏焕 所以你应该很清楚
Right, you seduced Min-hwan this way, so I'm sure you know best.

470
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:49,643
可是如果他是会背叛 交往七年女友的人
But if he betrayed his girlfriend of seven years,

471
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,397
你怎么会不知道 他也可以对你这么做呢？
why didn't you know he could do the same to you?

472
00:37:55,774 --> 00:38:00,821
我会在公司贴大字报 让你们俩在公司里都抬不起头来
I'll put posters up here to make you two too ashamed to work here.

473
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,322
我不会放过你
I won't stand for it.

474
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,203
这可怎么办才好？
That's too bad.

475
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:13,083
你老公已经被这个公司开除了
Your husband was fired.

476
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:21,466
所以别在这里无谓地怀疑我 回去当个贤内助，对哦
So stop suspecting me, and go be a good wife. Oh, wait.

477
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,260
你们要离婚了吧？
You two are divorcing.

478
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:26,680
真糟糕
That's too bad.

479
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,225
不过…
But...

480
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,228
我越想越觉得不高兴
thinking about it is pissing me off.

481
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,649
只有你才会贪图朴敏焕这种垃圾
Only you would covet trash like Min-hwan.

482
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:39,651
我怎么会呢？
Why would I?

483
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:45,365
除非我是个傻子才会吧
Unless I was a fool.

484
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:58,336
放手，我自己走，放开我！
Let go. I'm going. Let me go!

485
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:09,848
敏焕，刚才郑秀敏来公司大闹 吓到我了
Min-hwan, Jeong Su-min just came and caused a fuss. It scared me.

486
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:16,688
不过公司不会谣传什么八卦 因为大家都只在说郑秀敏是不是疯了
But rumors won't spread here since everyone thinks Su-min's crazy.

487
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,860
唉呀，不小心传错了，抱歉
Oh, no. I sent it to the wrong person. Sorry.

488
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:25,030
她真的是疯了！
Is she out of her mind?

489
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:30,160
我不会放过她
I won't stand for this.

490
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,211
郑秀敏很快就会打给我了
Jeong Su-min will call me soon.

491
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:50,889
郑秀敏
JEONG SU-MIN

492
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,475
我要毁了姜智媛
I'm going to ruin Kang Ji-won.

493
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,018
你大可拥有她
Have her.

494
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:59,022
但是在那之前 我一定要让她跌到谷底
In return, she has to hit rock bottom first.

495
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,566
我要让她向我求饶
I'll make her beg.

496
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,443
在那之前，我不会合作
I won't cooperate before that.

497
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,453
郑秀敏上钩了
We have Su-min in our hands.

498
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:15,288
我来让朴敏焕行动
I'll try to move Min-hwan.

499
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:19,459
他现在差不多应该收到了
I think he's gotten it by now.

500
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,341
海英别墅
HAEYEONG VILLA

501
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:30,011
U&K寄了什么给我？
What would U&K send me?

502
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,351
U&K人寿，保险单
U&K LIFE INSURANCE POLICY

503
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,145
开什么玩笑？
What the heck?

504
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:41,106
我都被公司开除了 哪有钱可以缴保险费？
I was fired. I have no money to pay for this.

505
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:59,666
保障事项：配偶伤害死亡，五亿韩元（人民币269万6420元）
SPOUSE'S DEATH AFTER INJURY 500 MILLION WON

506
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:36,995
你可能没有理由要罩我
You may not have a reason to cover for me,

507
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,372
可是我们可以交易
but we can make a deal.

508
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:43,960
我来解决郑秀敏，让她不会再来烦你
I'll take care of Su-min so she won't bother you.

509
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,465
再准备一份餐点
Tell them to bring one more meal.

510
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:51,134
我们先吃再来谈
Let's eat first.

511
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:07,317
所以你要怎么处理你老婆？
So how will you take care of your wife?

512
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,949
我现在是穷光蛋，正打算要去死
I'm broke, so I was going to kill myself.

513
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,243
可是出现生路了
But there's a way to live.

514
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:19,871
而那条生路也可能对你有帮助
And I think that might help you too.

515
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,836
保障事项：配偶伤害死亡，五亿韩元（人民币269万6420元）
SPOUSE'S DEATH AFTER INJURY 500 MILLION WON

516
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,339
这要配偶死亡才能领到
You can only get this after death.

517
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,508
只要郑秀敏消失在这个世界上
If Su-min disappears,

518
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,552
就不会有人威胁你了
there won't be anyone to threaten you.

519
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,392
当然这不容易，我们也得套好说法
It won't be easy. We have to get our story straight.

520
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,436
不过你是不是能帮我呢？
But can't you help me?

521
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47,232
又要我帮你收拾善后？
You want me to clean up your mess? Again?

522
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,818
不只是收拾善后
Not just that.

523
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,987
你还得帮我布局
Set it up for me too.

524
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:57,158
这个世界上金钱和人脉就是一切 而我一个都没有
Money and connections are everything, but I don't have any of them.

525
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,496
你有胆量
You've got guts.

526
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,085
很多东西都没有的话，至少要有胆量
If you don't have anything, you should at least have guts.

527
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:11,172
可是你是不是只有胆量？
But isn't that all you have?

528
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,427
你以为做这种决定很容易吗？
You think it was easy to decide?

529
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,555
这是我的最后防线
This is my last resort.

530
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,473
我得赌上性命
I'll risk my life.

531
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:25,645
这是你最后一次机会
This is your last chance.

532
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:42,454
现在朴敏焕在吴宥拉的套房里
Park Min-hwan is at Oh Yu-ra's suite right now.

533
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,376
所以就是今天了
So it's today.

534
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:56,509
郑秀敏
JEONG SU-MIN

535
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:06,728
朴敏焕和姜智媛 温顿饭店，1355号房
Park Min-hwan and Kang Ji-won are in room 1355 at Winton Hotel.

536
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,150
1355号
Room 1355.

537
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,234
1355号
Room 1355.

538
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,334
让开
Move.

539
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:21,029
话说亲爱的，你真的好聪明哦
But I think you're really smart, babe.

540
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:24,991
话说这还真天才
But that is pretty genius.

541
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:28,077
你怎么会想到 要以老婆的身故保险金东山再起？
Going after your wife's life insurance benefit?

542
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:30,371
你怎么会想到要投保癌症保险啊？
How did you think of cancer insurance?

543
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:36,085
等到我领到保险金，我请你大吃一顿
Once I get paid, I'll treat you to something nice.

544
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,134
不用担心
Don't worry.

545
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:46,262
我这个人可是非常会报恩
I know how to return the favor properly.

546
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:52,602
吓我一跳
Oh, my God!

547
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,822
可恶
Damn...

548
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,203
不管是谁，都有够无言
Whoever it is, this is ridiculous.

549
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:12,497
喂，朴敏焕
Hey, Min-hwan.

550
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:18,169
你真的是个无法处理的垃圾
You're a piece of trash that can't be handled.

551
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:23,925
不然你是要怎样？
What are you going to do about it?

552
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,053
对哦
Right?

553
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:32,183
我要把那段录音交给警方
I'm going to send the voice recording to the police.

554
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,270
我爸在哪里？你杀了他吗？
Where's my dad? Did you kill him?

555
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:39,774
杀了他？
Kill him?

556
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,694
我以为你要和姜智媛复合
I thought you were trying to get Ji-won back.

557
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,737
你和这女的在这里做什么？
What are you doing here with her?

558
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,656
听说你也被公司开除了
I heard you were fired.

559
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:50,034
既然你时间这么多 你们俩就去吃牢饭吧
Since you have a lot of free time, spend it in jail.

560
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:53,329
那个疯女人
Are you insane?

561
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,003
滚开，滚！
Get lost!

562
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:03,131
放开我，我叫你放开我！
Let go of me!

563
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:04,215
放手！
Let go!

564
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:06,175
该死
Damn it...

565
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:09,679
现在该怎么办？
What do I do now?

566
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,223
还能怎么办？
What do you mean?

567
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:14,350
就照你的计划去做
We'll go forward with your plan.

568
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,644
但是不能在这里
But not here.

569
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:19,022
我会帮你布局
I'll set it up for you.

570
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:22,275
副社长
Ms. Oh.

571
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,373
假如朴敏焕杀了郑秀敏
If Park Min-hwan kills Jeong Su-min,

572
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:42,503
就定调为谋杀妻子以诈领保险金
set it up as murder for the insurance claim

573
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:45,548
编好故事之后，发给媒体
and distribute it to the media.

574
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:50,553
我会去准备，可是…
I'll get it ready, but...

575
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:54,849
要让朴敏焕说的关于我的事 都变成是在胡扯
Make sure whatever he says about me is nonsense.

576
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,894
证据当然也要消灭
Get rid of all the evidence, got it?

577
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:32,303
你这是在做什么？
What do you think you're doing?

578
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,315
所以说你为何要做那种无谓的事？
So why did you do something like that?

579
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:49,404
你什么都好，就是没有自知之明
You're great, but you don't know your place.

580
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:56,077
我有钱，我全都给你
I have money. I'll give it all to you.

581
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,504
要是你杀了我
If you kill me,

582
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:09,716
你想那女的会放过你吗？
do you think she'll leave you alone?

583
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:20,184
郑秀敏
Su-min.

584
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:23,563
我承认你很厉害
I'll give it to you.

585
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,275
你真的有让吴宥拉抵赖不掉的证据
You really have hard evidence on Oh Yu-ra.

586
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,446
可是怎么办才好？
But too bad for you.

587
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:35,783
你昏倒的时候，吴宥拉把它全删了
She erased it when you passed out.

588
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:38,327
什么？
What?

589
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:41,414
你这个傻瓜
You dummy.

590
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:46,127
像我们这种人
People like us shouldn't

591
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:49,130
不能跟有权有势的人作对
go against people with power.

592
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,091
我们能做什么？
What can we do?

593
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:54,260
还有…
And...

594
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:57,388
你没有钱
you have no money.

595
00:50:57,472 --> 00:50:58,931
零韩元
0 WON

596
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,977
什么？为什么？
What's that?

597
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,021
反正那本来就不是你的钱
It wasn't your money anyway!

598
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,774
你是趁机占为己有
You stole it when you had the chance.

599
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:12,278
对了
Oh, right.

600
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,532
我买给姜智媛的包包在你那里
You had the bag I bought for Ji-won.

601
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:19,952
我卖掉了
I sold that.

602
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,372
你得先帮你老公救急啊
To take care of urgent matters for me.

603
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,419
不要觉得太委屈
Don't be too upset.

604
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,134
你不是说不愿意自己一个人死吗？
You said you wouldn't go down alone.

605
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,349
不是你死，就是我死
One of us has to die.

606
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:44,602
站在我的立场来看
So...

607
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:50,024
我得先解决掉你才能重新开始
I have to take care of you to start over.

608
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:57,073
你等着
Just wait.

609
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,953
喂！放开我！
Hey! Let me go!

610

放开我！
Let me go!

613
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,920
把我…
Let me...

614
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:13,673
把我放开
Let me go!

615
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:14,841
喂！
Hey!

616
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:41,993
瓦斯…
The gas...

617
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,214
她去哪了？
Where did she go?

618
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,018
喂！
Hey!

619
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:11,272
你疯啦？
Are you crazy?

620
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,734
交出车钥匙，滚到一边去
Leave the car key and move aside.

621
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,322
好，我知道了，你先冷静
Okay. Just calm down.

622
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:22,825
把刀放下，拜托你冷静！
Put the knife down! Calm down!

623
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,286
我不会死
I won't die.

624
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:26,829
我绝不会死！
I'll never die!

625
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,501
来
Here.

626
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:35,588
车钥匙给你
Here's the key.

627
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,968
车钥匙在这里，你把刀放下
Here it is. Put the knife down.

628
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:43,137
快点过来拿
Just take it!

629
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,516
拿走，来
Take it. Here.

630
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,775
去死
You little...

631
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:00,821
过来
Come here.

632
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:02,782
给我过来！
Come here!

633
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,288
可恶
Damn it...

634
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:17,213
我可爱的妻子来旅行
My lovely wife's going to

635
00:54:17,797 --> 00:54:20,591
大概是在我去买东西的时候
die from carbon monoxide poisoning

636
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:24,762
由于锅炉故障，一氧化碳中毒而死
from a boiler malfunction while I'm away to get groceries.

637
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:29,308
所以别再毁了我的人生
So stop ruining my life.

638
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:32,019
该死的时候就乖乖去死
Just die already.

639
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:34,563
喂，要死你自己乖乖去死
Hey! If you're going to die, just die already.

640
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:42,446
原来保险金是在说这个啊
This is what the insurance was about?

641
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:45,658
你以为会如你所愿吗？
You think it'll go your way?

642
00:54:48,995 --> 00:54:50,246
我想是会
I think it will.

643
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:54,875
可恶！
Damn it!

644
00:55:01,424 --> 00:55:04,218
我老公可不能当不了男人啊
My husband shouldn't lose his manhood.

645
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:07,263
可恶
Damn it...

646
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,142
真是的
You little...

647
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,226
不对
No.

648
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:14,895
喂，姜智媛跟我说
Kang Ji-won told me

649
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,356
你是太监
that you were sterile.

650
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,067
你在胡说什么？
What are you talking about?

651
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:23,529
你当不了男人！
You're shooting blanks!

652
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,948
要我讲简单一点吗？
Want me to spell it out?

653
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:28,993
我不是流产
I didn't miscarry.

654
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,162
我不曾怀孕过
I was never pregnant.

655
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:33,748
你听懂了吗？
Do you get it now?

656
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:39,670
你别想
I don't think so.

657
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:42,840
- 竟敢… - 放开我，你这个混蛋！
- You little... - Let go, you bastard!

658
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:44,508
- 给我过来！- 放手！
- Come here! - Let go!

659
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:45,634
我叫你放手！
Let go of me!

660
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:52,099
- 滚开！- 滚开！
- Get lost! - Get lost!

661
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:13,848
杨珠兰科长的离婚诉讼 似乎会变得容易许多
I think Ms. Yang's divorce suit will get easier.

662
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:19,270
作为成立通奸罪证据的存储卡影像 不知道为什么复原了
The evidence of the affair on the SD card, I don't know why, but it's been restored.

663
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,106
- 突然间吗？- 对
- Suddenly? - Yes.

664
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:25,651
本来就是无缘无故没有影像
The video didn't work for no reason.

665
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:27,987
突然之间又无缘无故好了
It suddenly worked for no reason too.

666
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,658
会成的事就是会成 看来他们是注定要离婚
I guess they're just meant to get a divorce.

667
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:53,053
朴敏焕先生离世，仅此转达讣闻 地点：唯一医院殡仪馆

668
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:19,538
我查看了警方的报告

669
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:23,792
他的死因是摔倒在玻璃桌上 头部撞到桌脚
He fell over a glass table and died after hitting his head.

670
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:31,258
由于现场留有证据，警方认定 郑秀敏是头号嫌犯，正在寻找中
With the evidence, the police are looking for Jeong Su-min as the prime suspect.

671
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,762
可是监视器没有运作
But the security cameras didn't work,

672
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:37,306
还需要再查明确切情形
so they must find out what happened.

673
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,523
你要去…
Are you going...

674
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:50,194
参加丧礼吗？
to the funeral?

675
00:59:06,252 --> 00:59:09,964
我曾经想过要是你死了就好了
I thought about how nice it would be if you died.

676
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:12,091
在我气到快死
I thought I'd burst of anger then.

677
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:17,596
当失望变成绝望
Back when those disappointing times

00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:21,183

were confirmed with despair and betrayal.

00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:24,520
你今天好美
You look so beautiful today.

680
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,230
可恶
This little...

681
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,690
滚开！
Get lost!

682
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:28,774
去死
Just die.

683
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:37,574
我想了一整夜，怎么想也想不通 你为何要对我那样
I spent all night wondering why you were like that to me.

684
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:40,411
没想到却这样结束了
But it ended like this.

685
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,101
你怎么敢来这里？
How dare you come here?

686
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:12,860
要不是你背叛我们家敏焕
If you didn't betray Min-hwan,

687
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:17,781
他就不会跟秀敏那女人结婚了
he never would've married Su-min.

688
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,827
她杀了我儿子
She killed my son.

689
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:25,706
坏女人
That wench.

690
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:29,793
怎么会…
How could this...

691
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:36,467
她毁了我宝贝儿子的人生
She ruined my precious son's life!

692
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:39,345
我可怜的孩子
My poor boy!

693

24日在京畿道加丰面的一家民宿中

The police confirmed his wife, Jeong, is the prime suspect.

696
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,162
这是行销一组的郑秀敏吧？
Isn't this Jeong Su-min from marketing?

697
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:06,705
之前那个
Don't you remember?

698
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:08,749
不是吧，只是长得像吧
No, they just look alike.

699
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,127
那你是说死掉的丈夫是朴敏焕吗？
Are you saying Min-hwan's dead?

700
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:13,962
你在说什么？嘘
What? Keep it down.

701
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,090
我听说是耶
I hear it's him.

702
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:17,049
喂
Hey...

703
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:24,723
怎么回事？
What's this?

704
01:01:28,644 --> 01:01:33,357
朴敏焕的父母报案遭窃 小偷趁他们不在时进来
Park Min-hwan's parents reported a theft. A thief came in while they were away.

705
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:35,859
看来是郑秀敏
It was Jeong Su-min.

706
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,333
那表示她在首尔
That means she's in Seoul.

707
01:01:53,419 --> 01:01:56,672
警方通缉 加丰面民宿杀人案的嫌犯郑秀敏
It's been a day since the police put out an APB

708
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:58,924
已经过了一天
on Jeong Su-min, the prime suspect,

709
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:02,052
依旧没能掌握到她的行踪
but her exact whereabouts are still unknown.

710
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,430
- 警方认为… - 没关系
- The police - It's fine.

711
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:07,141
目前她关掉手机，躲避搜查，逃亡中
assume she's off the grid and on the run

712
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:11,437
并且表示需要国民积极关注本案

713
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:18,610
嫌犯身高160公分，身材瘦弱
The suspect is 160 cm tall with a lean physique

714
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:22,698
涉嫌在加丰面的一家民宿 杀害丈夫朴姓男子
and under suspicion of killing her husband at a pension.

715
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:31,373
可是我有点不安
But I feel uneasy.

716
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:36,044
你太善良了，所以你也许不知道
You're too nice, so you wouldn't know.

717
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,802
但就是有些人不懂得适可而止
Some people don't know when to stop.

718
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:49,641
如果不把他们彻底狠狠踩在脚底下
Unless you stomp on them completely,

719
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:53,145
他们不会停止
they don't stop.

01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:04,406
你不能丢下我，独自幸福，智媛
You can't be the only one who's happy, Ji-won.

721
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:08,952
绝对不行
Never.

722
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:44,279
我做了什么？
What did I do?

723
01:03:44,363 --> 01:03:46,073
- 你有证据吗？- 接受惩罚吧
- Do you have proof? - Pay for what you did.

724
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:49,117
我不会软弱
I will stay strong.

725
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:52,162
我也会再加把劲
I'll try a little harder too.

726
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:55,123
她买稀释液，表示她要纵火
She bought thinner. That means she'll set a fire.

727
01:03:55,207 --> 01:03:57,459
不让她来有什么用？
What's the use of stopping her from coming?

728
01:03:57,543 --> 01:04:00,921
我们已经照你想做的去做了 这次让我照我想做的去做吧
We did what you wanted. Let me do what I want this time.

729
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:04,258
事到如今，还能怎么样？
We can't do anything about it now.

730
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:06,176

我真的是为了你，学了各种东西

732
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:11,139
姜智媛，我要杀了你！
I'm going to kill you!

733
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:13,850
这是你造孽的代价 也是我打造的地狱
This is the price for your sins and hell I made for you.

734
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:14,893
接受吧
Take it.
