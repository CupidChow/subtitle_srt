1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,580
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

2
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,300
I just wanted to talk about Agent Jiang's birthday party
How can it be so grand?

3
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,340
So it was a proposal?

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,180
I hope today is Ji Won
The best birthday gift I've ever received

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,260
How do you like it?

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,890
Jiwon, I envy you.

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,560
It's really amazing

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,730
How did you come up with the idea of doing this?

9
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,660
Drones and fireworks really scare me a bit.

10
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,160
Oh, that's nothing, everyone does it

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,960
Even if it's just a proposal package for 39,000 won
I will be happy too

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,880
Thank you

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,710
(Second-hand market)

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,300
Proposal…

15
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,840
(Proposal props)

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
Thirty-nine thousand won?

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,390
Fifty thousand won? That's crazy.

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,310
Oh, hello, Minister.

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,820
Regarding recent events
The company wants to reward Agent Jiang

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,700
Will provide her with a villa on her birthday

21
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,365
Comfort?

22
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,033
About Section Chief Kim Kyung-wook

23
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:57,701
oh

24
00:01:58,953 --> 00:01:59,995
Because of that thing

25
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,000
Providing a villa to comfort her?

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,500
Usually provides apartments
But this time it was more generous.

27
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,420
This guy really loves her.

28
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,840
A pure man

29
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,680
What should I do? It seems you don't understand women.

30
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,640
Jiang Zhiyuan only loves me

31
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,100
Oh my god, are you crazy?

32
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,860
Sorry, Minister.

33
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,820
This is a great opportunity

34
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,070
Do you want to find all the members of the marketing team?
How about having a birthday party together?

35
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,660
She thought it was a birthday party, but there was a surprise

36
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,580
I'm going to propose to her as a surprise.

37
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,960
I'm going to marry Kang Ji Won

38
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,630
Come and join us, and be sad, you little brat.

39
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,380
You're such a nasty guy.

40
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,590
The minister will come to congratulate us, right?

41
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,350
certainly

42
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,770
I can also provide other support

43
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,900
Ouch

44
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,590
congratulations

45
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,090
You still...

46
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,970
Can't you forgive me?

47
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,110
Ji-won, I'm sorry, calm down.

48
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,520
Okay?

49
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,820
sorry

50
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,910
Don't be angry

51
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,700
Let's be good friends like before, okay?

52
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,250
I don't understand you

53
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,340
But the point is

54
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,970
I don't want to understand

55
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,100
I'm leaving

56
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,770
Ji Won…

57
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,730
Kang Ji Won!

58
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,920
You know I can't swim, right?

59
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,350
Do you know what they say?

60
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,720
How to say it?

61
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,180
Carbonara

62
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,900
spaghetti

63
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,710
Ji Won

64
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Will you be cold?

65
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,900
Agent Jiang, are you okay?

66
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,900
I'm fine

67
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,780
Xiumin is sleeping. She must have been frightened.

68
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,620
It's really dangerous near the water at night. I'm so glad.

69
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,000
How could Xiumin fall?

70
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,830
Didn't she jump down by herself?

71
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,290
She slipped

72
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,710
She seems a little drunk

73
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,050
Is that so?

74
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,430
Fortunately, no one was injured.

75
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,300
Xiumin will thank you for the rest of her life

76
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,680
You are her savior.

77
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,350
Luckily there is hot cocoa here

78
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,100
Very hot

79
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,820
Yes, you drink something hot.

80
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,860
Let the body temperature rise,

81
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,610
It seems you will have a good life in the future

82
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,910
More things need to happen so that there will be more memories

83
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,040
The proposal was indeed brilliant.

84
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,040
Of course

85
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,420
-Do you want to collect it?
-What?

86
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,800
It's only 11 o'clock now

87
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,430
We still have a lot to say
I still need to drink some more wine, this night is still long

88
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,930
I've been frightened too much today, and I'm tired

89
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,890
Have a good rest everyone

90
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,680
Thank you today

91
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,850
Let's go

92
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,100
Honey, shall we go upstairs too?

93
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,690
You go up first, I'll finish this drink and then go up

94
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,610
OK, that's it.

95
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,680
I showed you a great example of how to propose today

96
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,350
I can't do it a second time. I can't do it.

97
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,310
Oh my God, I'm so scared, what's going on?

98
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,430
Um?

99
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,900
You came in late.

100
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,070
what are you doing here?

101
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,780
Come on in

102
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,830
I just proposed today

103
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,290
And Kang Ji-won is in the next room

104
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,040
This is more exciting.

105
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,630
Don't you want it?

106
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,680
Are you drunk?

107
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,470
You seem to be in a good mood

108
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,430
Ji Won…

109
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,730
Jump into the water for me

110
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,290
Now

111
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,330
You made me happy.

112
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,340
Come

113
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,860
How are you?

114
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,700
She jumped down

115
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,910
Not a slip

116
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,660
She jumped down by herself.

117
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,620
Right in front of me

118
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,800
Maybe I don't understand Zheng Xiumin at all

119
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,850
I think it's simple

120
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,980
Park Min-hwan is trash, Jung Soo-min covets my things

121
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,940
So just let them get married
I'll be happy.

122
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,700
But that's not the case

123
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,620
She pulled me down

124
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,710
She grabbed my arm
Pull me deeper

125
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,460
and…

126
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,920
She was still smiling, I saw

127
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,600
Is this my hallucination?

128
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,560
I really hope so.

129
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,810
But not

130
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,350
She really intends to die

131
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:03,190
It's like she doesn't care even if she dies in the water.

132
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,950
As long as I die with you
She seems like she doesn't care about anything

133
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,020
I want to show you something

134
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,380
Whenever I feel lost
When you don't know what you are doing

135
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,960
I will come here

136
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,260
After quietly clearing my mind

137
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,430
You will gain the strength to take another step

138
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,190
No one knows what the future holds

139
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,310
However

140
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,280
We are the ones who know the most

141
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,030
So don't be afraid

142
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,740
You have made a lot of progress now.

143
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,120
You found out
The unknown side of someone I've been with for 26 years

144
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,960
If Jung Soo-min shows
It has never been like this before

145
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,800
That means you are not so easy to deal with now.

146
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,650
I sincerely wish you a happy birthday

147
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,820
Thank you for the proposal

148
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,960
This was the best first birthday ever

149
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,690
Episode 9

150
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,360
Agent Jiang

151
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,240
-Hello
-Hello

152
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,870
Oh my god, what is that?

153
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,240
Agent Jiang, you wouldn't...

154
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,290
I'm engaged

155
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,210
Oh my god, is this a one carat?

156
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,630
Wow, Agent Park is really good.

157
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,090
So beautiful

158
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
So envious

159
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,880
-It really suits her, right?
-yes

160
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,010
Are you planning to regret your marriage?
Can we announce this to the world?

161
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,640
I did this because I wanted to break up.

162
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,600
When everything is revealed, Park Min-hwan's working life

163
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,600
There will be a severe blow

164
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,320
I have improved a lot and become very difficult to mess with.

165
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,990
So, what are you going to do this weekend?

166
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,030
Are you coming to Yu Han Department Store?

167
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,990
This is my first and last time
To hollow out Park Min-hwan

168
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,120
Unfortunately, I had to go to Japan on a business trip that day.

169
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,290
You really missed a good show.

170
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,290
Park Min-hwan's expression will definitely be interesting to watch

171
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,090
I will cheer for you

172
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,220
Just find time to meet the parents on the weekend.

173
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,770
My mom is going to take a cooking class at the cultural center
There is no space

174
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,730
Are you going to eat something delicious? I want to eat too.

175
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,530
Ouch

176
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,530
You greedy ghost, so greedy

177
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,650
-I…
-Scare me to death, what is that?

178
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,320
It seems that the printer is jealous

179
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,830
It's jealous

180
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,040
Oh, are you two planning another surprise?

181
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,750
I really envy Agent Jiang

182
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,340
Of course I have to do this for her.

183
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,510
Now all that's left is meeting the parents.

184
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,970
What will you bring then?
What about the classic legend, Agent Park?

185
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,850
Even I am looking forward to it

186
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,310
yes

187
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,350
I didn't know Min Hwan had this side

188
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,520
I shouldn't have any higher expectations.

189
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,520
expect?

190
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,990
What do you expect me to do?

191
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,070
Don’t people say

192
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,780
Good men will help girls before meeting their parents
Buy a whole set of clothes, shoes and bags, right?

193
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,870
By the way, giving shoes as a gift will make girls run away

194
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,080
Then just have a good friend deliver it!

195
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,500
Oh, is there such a thing?

196
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,590
Isn't that great? I'm going to spread the word

197
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,510
Oh, yes.

198
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,520
I want to sell it on the second-hand market...

199
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,400
Just sell the bed frame.
The rest should be thrown away, they are too old

200
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,740
besides…

201
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,700
Who could it be?

202
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,330
Ji Won

203
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,300
I'll give this to you and leave.

204
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,010
This is your birthday present.

205
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,940
This pair

206
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,030
Isn't this a beautiful pair? Buy it for me

207
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,990
Bought this for me as a birthday gift

208
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,370
Um…

209
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,370
besides…

210
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,010
I want to give you something else as a wedding gift

211
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,010
May I?

212
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,680
You are getting married, but you can't cook

213
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:19,190
I heard that Yuhan Department Store Cultural Center
Weekend cooking classes are great

214
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,860
I'll help you sign up

215
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,530
Let's go together

216
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,870
Cooking classes at Yuhan Department Store?

217
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,830
To make it exactly like this

218
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,550
(Yuhan Department Store Cultural Center
Special cooking classes)

219
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,720
That's where Ms. Jin Ciyu goes to class

220
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,140
This has never happened before.

221
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,890
It must be because of my change of attitude.
Zheng Xiumin has also made some progress

222
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,310
Don't you want it?

223
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:02,820
no

224
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,860
Thank you

225
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,450
I'm more grateful to you

226
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,700
Ji Won

227
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,580
I really feel sorry for you.

228
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,250
Thank you for giving me the chance, I won't let you down

229
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:29,220
I will be the one you can really rely on.

230
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,950
I definitely don't have a talent for acting.

231
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,250
Because I'm so tired.

232
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,670
Knowing it is bait, pretending to take the bait

233
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,490
Very good

234
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:38,750
If only the bad guys weren't so bad
It makes people hesitate whether to take revenge

235
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,540
But these people never give up, they are so bad

236
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,130
Thank you so much

237
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,300
Thank you so much

(Yuhan Department Store Cultural Center
Special cooking classes)

239
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,200
I had to pay for my own parking last week

240
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,830
I have been taking classes at the cultural center here for many years.

241
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,250
It's impossible

242
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,040
What is your name and license plate number, please?

243
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,460
Jin Ciyu, 5780

244
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:31,880
Miss Jin, you parked for more than five hours last week.

245
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,630
Excuse me
Since our course is only two hours long

246
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,180
-According to regulations, you must purchase goods...
-no

247
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,180
The parking space is only a few square meters.
What are you calculating about?

248
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,980
I've never paid for parking.

249
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,230
Why are you asking me to pay now?

250
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,400
This is my seat.

251
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,530
Oh my god

252
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,570
Everyone pays to attend class.
There is no such thing as who has the right seat.

253
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,620
This lady

254
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,410
Whatever the adults say, it's what it is.

255
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,420
Go away, go over there.

256
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,040
I'm sorry, let's just stick to our fixed seats.

257
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,300
- Let's switch seats.
-What are you sorry for?

258
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,760
Where are the fixed seats?

259
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,090
That lady is more sensible.

260
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,010
Anyway, whether it is in the past or now
People who don't know manners

261
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,060
There are everywhere

262
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,370
The number of development teams has been confirmed

266
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,250

Mom, today is Sunday, where have you been?

271
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,890
I'm hungry

272
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,020
Why did you call me?

273
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,320
Where's Dad? Where's Dad?

274
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,240
Dad? He's busy.

275
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,990
I'm hungry. When will you be back?

276
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,990
Why is Dad busy?

277
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,910
Is Dad not home? Where did he go?

278
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,800
Sir, please drive faster.

279
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,100
My five-year-old is home alone.

280
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,060
What should I do?

I can't get rid of it
Traffic jam in Seoul during weekends

282

-Yeonji
-Mother!

I'm mom, this is a video call
Put your phone down and look at me

287

-Mother!
-Don't cry, look at me

288
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,840
Mother!

289
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,660
Yanzhi, mom will be back soon.
It'll be here soon. Wait a minute.

291
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,300
Please help me

292
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,330
OK, thank you

293
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,080
Mr. Li, thank you so much

294
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,670
Thanks

295
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,970
Where have you been?

296
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,810
I'll go do something.

297
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,220
Am I playing?

298
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,890
What do you do on the weekend?

299
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,190
instant noodles…

300
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,440
How can you let a child eat instant noodles?

301
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,740
Don't eat

302
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,320
That's really exaggerated

303
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,700
Then you feed her.

304
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,330
How are you?

305
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,040
-Mother
-Um?

306
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,290
Since you are coming back so early
Why go to work on weekends?

307
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,530
The young lady's hands are really quick and neat

308
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,240
I like cooking

309
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,380
But this lady...

310
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,550
There is a way to move so slowly
Cooking a meal for the family?

311
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,840
At that rate, I won't be able to eat until tomorrow.

312
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,050
Do you want to eat it the day after tomorrow morning?

313
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,970
I plan to eat it the day after tomorrow afternoon

314
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,470
What?

315
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,390
What did you say?

316
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,650
My boyfriend likes to cook.
He said he would cook for me once every two days

317
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,990
My past era
I can't imagine a man entering the kitchen.

318
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,950
Times are different now.

319
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,700
I like it this way

320
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,620
This lady

321
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:44,630
You can tell what kind of family you will marry into at a glance

322
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,380
-Ms. Ciyu
-Oh my god

323
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,510
Are you ready?

324
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,930
teacher!

325
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,600
Why is she so annoying?

326
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,770
Teacher, some women can't cook at all

327
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,530
I come here to take classes to seduce men.

328
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,490
You really have to be careful.

329
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,360
Oh, ok, I understand.

330
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,210
Oh my god, Miss Ji-won

331
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,460
How do you do it so beautifully?

332
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,590
Wow, that's amazing, awesome

333
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,460
Well done

334
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,340
Although I really shouldn’t be able to cook at this time…

335
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,980
Peel that pear.

336
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,820
good

337
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,490
Don't make it too thick, cut it thinner

338
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,540
good

339
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:03,040
Thank you for your rigorous training.

340
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,920
This is exactly the craft I like.

341
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,960
How can an uneducated person...

342
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,510
What's the use of food if it only looks good?

343
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:18,100
It is very difficult to season pickled carrot shreds properly

344
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,890
This taste...

345
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,320
Just like the teacher did.

346
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,490
Because this is what you taught me after you learned it here
Ms. Kim Tzu-ok

347
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,660
I'm glad you said it was delicious.

348
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,470
When did you learn to cook?

349
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,930
How could I learn anything? I just did it.

350
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,140
Because I want to make it look prettier.
So do it slowly and deliberately

351
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,350
I heard it for the first time today
Pickled shredded carrots

352
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,820
Oh, my dad told me before

353
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,400
Your father...

354
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,860
He's such a nice guy.

355
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,870
- Please enjoy your meal
-Thank you, let's go.

356
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,740
Let's go shopping.

357
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,910
Oh Min-hwan

358
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,920
He said he wanted to buy me clothes to meet his parents.

359
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,260
Do you want to come with us?

360
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,430
Speaking of which…

361
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,020
I don't know Xiumin...

362
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,270
Also in yeah

363
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,700
Honey, when are we
Going to meet your parents?

364
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,200
What?

365
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,580
Oh, we should set a time.

366
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,370
I have to go first

367
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,840
I have an appointment

368
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:17,630
If I knew Min-hwan was coming
I won't date anyone else. What a shame.

369
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,130
Do you have an appointment?

370
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,970
Well, let's date next time.
I'll treat you to a big meal

371
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,930
I've already given you a birthday present and a wedding present.

372
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,390
next time

373
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,350
I'll treat you, thank you for saving my life

374
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,190
OK, that's it.

375
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,240
We haven't dated alone for a long time.
Let's go on a date, okay?

376
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,900
Oh, ok

377
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,070
very good

378
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,380
I really live because of you.

379
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,550
I'm leaving

380
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,940
Do you need to buy duty-free goods?

381
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,020
No

382
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,780
Do you need to buy duty-free goods?

383
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,860
No

384
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,360
Please wait a moment

385
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,030
Do you need a catalog?

386
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,130
(Ossendyk)

387
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,210
Could he be sending the same one?

388
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,920
No, it’s a little different. This time…

389
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,220
Looks a bit more expensive

390
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,240
I want this

391
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,160
Hey, this price is too expensive...

392
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,450
Are you a newlywed couple?

393
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,160
This is perfect as a wedding gift

394
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:09,870
I haven't met my mother-in-law yet.

395
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,830
But I heard she has very high standards.

396
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,330
If she has high standards

397
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,040
The future daughter-in-law should at least have this kind of bag

398
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,710
Not just for my mother-in-law.

399
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,670
Actually, we are U&K office couple.

400
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,760
Everyone is looking forward to seeing what the groom-to-be will buy for me.
Even I feel stressed.

401
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,270
He is a man whose body is dominated by his self-esteem.

402
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,850
Oh, yes.

403
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,390
I am a U&K legend

404
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,650
Then we'll buy this

405
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,190
-May I?
-certainly

406
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,440
Show us a few more similar ones.

407
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,530
This must go well with pink

408
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,910
- With this bag
-What?

409
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,010
I asked her to buy it, but she bought it all? Damn it

410
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,440
Are you going to buy cheap clothes online again?

411
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,650
I told you

412
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,990
My mother has very high standards.

413
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,450
If my mother is not satisfied with you

414
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,490
We can't get married.

415
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:36,250
I didn't want to
Let people who are poor enough to use my credit card spend money

416
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,380
Why should I do that?

417
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,960
If I don't spend it, another woman will spend it.

418
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,380
What's the big deal?

419
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,970
Two cups of coffee.

420
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,720
Thanks

421
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,890
Min-hwan, this looks great, right?

422
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,350
I like it very much

423
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,230
I think I finally became
Someone who matches your parents.

424
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,740
Having a family is a wonderful thing.

425
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,110
Good looking, very beautiful

426
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,240
Everything here is beautiful.

427
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,330
I think women really need to meet the right man.

428
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,540
Of course, a woman has to meet the right man.

429
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,800
You're about to meet my parents.

430
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,590
We need to find a place to eat

431
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,220
Regarding meal expenses, how can we...

432
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,680
(Bai Enhao)

433
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,440
-Baek Eun-ho?
- Keep talking

434
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,070
Is he the classmate of yours who opened a restaurant?

435
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,610
-no
-No?

436
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,820
etc.

437
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,410
Hello?

438
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,540
Isn’t this Kang Ji-won’s phone number?

439
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,960
Yes, hello

440
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,170
I'm Ji Won's boyfriend, my name is Park Min Hwan

441
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,420
Yes, hello

442
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,380
I'm Ji Won's friend, Baek Eun Ho

443
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,680
I often hear Jiwon mention you

444
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,680
I remember she said you were a very good cook

445
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,390
Yes, thank you

446
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:21,600
Is it inconvenient for Zhiyuan to answer the phone now?

447
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,270
That's not important

448
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,940
I heard you own a fine-dining restaurant.

449
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,280
What kind of food do you cook?

450
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,070
France or Italy?

451
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,780
Or no menu cuisine?

452
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,740
We cook creative dishes

453
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,410
French-based

454
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,080
Oh, that's perfect.

455
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,750
Here's what's going on

456
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,540
Ji Won will be meeting my parents soon

457
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:49,550
If I could eat at a friend's restaurant
It should make sense, we are talking about it

458
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,470
If you were her classmate

459
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:58,220
Will there be a discount for classmates?
Or how about discounts from acquaintances or friends?

460
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,230
It would be great if there was

461
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:03,190
I'll contact you later
I'll leave it to you then. Goodbye.

462
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,610
-What are you doing?
-Are you familiar with him? How familiar are you?

463
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,070
How? What did she say?

464
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,990
Is she with her boyfriend?

465
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,830
What's wrong with you? How is it? Is she busy?

466
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,880
I didn't get through to Jiwon.

467
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,790
I'll ask her later

468
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,300
What are you doing?

469
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,300
From Ji-won's perspective

470
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,220
- She might not want to accept the apology
-yes

471
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,050
No matter what, we should do something

472
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,680
As long as you are human, you should make up for your mistakes.

473
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,100
I, Xia Ruizhi

474
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:48,070
I was cheated by Jung Soo Min
The biggest mistake of my life

475
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,990
The date for meeting the parents will probably be in early December.

476
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,410
I'll leave it to you.

477
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,910
It seems she is getting married.
You can give a bigger red envelope.

478
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,960
marry?

479
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,420
(Kang Ji-won)

480
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:14,970
Hello?

481
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,760
Eunho, I'm sorry.

482
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,720
Never mind, that...

483
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,930
Congratulations on getting married

484
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,650
No, don't pay attention to what he said.

485
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,020
I'll find a way to handle it

486
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,480
I'll cook for you.

487
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,530
Eun Ho

488
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,860
You are my first love

489
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,120
Let me do it

490
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,750
They will become your family.

491
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,000
I will treat them specially

492
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:09,150
Your only grandpa was in hospital, but you came too late

493
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,360
If I'm impatient
I might die before you come.

494
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,360
You will live healthy for more than ten years.

495
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,240
What?

496
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,410
I came here right after I flew back from Japan.

497
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:20,870
Is it handled?

498
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,290
She is Yura, we only met for a short time

499
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,290
There's no one as good as her.

500
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,840
She is better than that employee named Jiang Zhiyuan
Hundreds of times better

501
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,510
Grandpa, please let her go.

502
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,260
She has nothing to do with me, and she will never be with me.

503
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,390
How could I just ignore it?

504
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,980
This is my personal emotional issue.

505
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,850
You are such a fool

506
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,310
Falling in love with someone who is already in love

507
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,980
Breaking family agreements

508
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:57,490
Villas, yachts, and fireworks

509
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,240
Still pestering employees to fly drones

510
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,530
How is this a personal problem for you?

511
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:11,920
Did you hear everything I did?

512
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,420
Of course

513
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,670
You are not alone
If your dad were still alive, it would be a different story.

514
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:22,890
Who are you…

515
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:28,730
We in the U&K will continue to work hard in the next 30 or 40 years.

516
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,900
People who care for and lead more than 600,000 employees

517
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,070
You're such a poor fool.

518
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,860
Fall in love, can't extricate yourself

519
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,280
well

520
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:51,670
how?

521
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,720
I missed a lot more than I thought.

522
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:13,980
What's wrong?

523
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,910
grandfather…

524
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,450
I must have cried a lot.

525
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:42,590
I'll be good, don't worry.

526
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,940
Sorry, Grandpa.

527
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,790
(Ossendyk)

528
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,350
Very cold

529
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,680
How did you get here?

530
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:37,980
Our company has a logistics warehouse nearby

531
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,560
I went there and stopped by...

532
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,700
Actually, I'm lying

533
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,450
I came because I miss you

534
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,170
Did anything happen to you?

535
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,050
Didn't you ask me before what I wanted to be?

536
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,760
I never thought about what I would become

537
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:18,020
From the moment I was born, I was determined to do something.

538
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:23,610
So I only work hard and study for U&K

539
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,080
I want to be the land

540
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,790
At least you have something to do now.

541
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,550
No

542
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,260
That was impossible.

543
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,060
How about starting simple?

544
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,190
What do you want to do right now?

545
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:09,030
When I just came back
I also feel that everything is black.

546
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:12,370
Where should I escape to? How can I make money?

547
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,370
I hate seeing Park Min-hwan and Jung Soo-min in front of me

548
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,290
So I thought to myself I don't want to be bullied anymore

549
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,380
I really stir-fried spicy pork
Knock him over like this

550
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,010
Ouch

551
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:39,980
After that I seemed to see more clearly.

552
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,490
Getting them married is just a process

553
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:55,200
I have to be happy after all.

554
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,950
Do what I like

555
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,370
And I like...

556
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,670
Meeting friends

557
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,810
I can…

558
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:27,320
Shake your hand?

559
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,440
Let Park Min-hwan and Jung Soo-min get married

560
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,610
Then make yourself happy.

561
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,590
It's not like you're getting married.

562
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,920
Just wear what I choose for you.

563
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,050
This is expensive clothing.

564
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,630
Ossendic!

565
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,640
What’s the use of being expensive?

566
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,390
The color is ugly and the style is weird

567
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:44,020
Your blind eyes
Do you want me to dig them out?

568
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,440
Why are you arguing so early in the morning?
Do you want to wait first?

569
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,110
Are you crazy? I'm going to be 30 minutes late

570
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:53,150
If she wants my baby son, she has to wait

571
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:57,320
Let a worthless woman take my son away
That's infuriating enough.

572
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:58,740
mom

573
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:01,830
Will you really help me buy a house?

574
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:04,500
Have you been looking for a house? What is your budget?

575
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,160
What is this?

576
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,590
You wear this one, it's very high-end, very good

577
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:12,090
This...

578
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:13,170
How about this red one?

579
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:15,550
I'm at your door, come down

580
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,680
(Hai Ying Villa)

581
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,020
Damn

582
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,360
How are you? How did you get here?

583
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,610
Are you going to meet your parents today?

584
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:34,320
What? That...

585
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:36,690
Don't be afraid

586
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,240
I know you are mine

587
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,470
What are you doing?

588
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:04,810
What? I'm just checking.
Are my things still good?

589
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,480
I have about ten minutes.

590
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,440
I don't plan on finishing in ten minutes.

591
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,940
What?

592
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,780
You will be late

593
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,530
Go introduce Kang Ji-won to your parents.

594
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:35,250
Chef, I'll do it.

595
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,050
Don't you trust me?

596
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:40,130
right

597
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,640
This table is very important today.

598
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:03,990
I'll be back in a minute.

599
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:05,120
good

600
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,580
Why does he look so sad?

601
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,000
But why hasn’t anyone come yet?

602
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,170
Hello, am I late?

603
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,420
On the way…

604
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,300
-No one is coming?
-Yes, no one has come yet.

605
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:27,810
What?

606
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,400
Kang Ji-won, where are you?

607
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,060
How can you be late?

608
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:40,360
My parents are here, but you are not here yet!

609
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,700
Don't you know how important today is?

610
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,160
I'm at the door

611
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,950
What are you doing and why are you here only now?

612
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:47,160
mom

613
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,330
Come here soon

614
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,540
Hasn't she arrived yet?

615
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,870
She arrived and she went to the toilet

616
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,150
I thought I was late
But it seems I came at the right time

617
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,780
Uncle, aunt, nice to meet you.

618
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,960
Oh, you are the one from before...

619
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,710
Right?

620
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:38,210
I like it this way

621
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,130
This lady

622
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:46,430
You can tell what kind of family you will marry into at a glance

623
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:49,890
Oh my god, you are Min-hwan's mother.

624
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,480
Thanks

625
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:00,310
I heard that your parents passed away very early.

626
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,610
Your tutoring is probably inadequate.

627
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,490
No, my father passed away when I was 23.

628
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,830
I have received adequate tutoring.

629
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,920
But my mom left home when I was 14.

630
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,920
So I was not influenced by her.

631
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,010
But this should be celebrated
Because she left home because of an affair

632
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,590
-How are you?
-Um

633
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:44,440
I've always wanted to know
What kind of girl will Min Hwan bring?

634
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,320
It seems that he brought a very remarkable girl with him.

635
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,030
Mom, Ji-won is really a good girl

636
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,240
She is very well behaved

637
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,910
She won't let you get a drop of water on your hands
She's such a good girl.

638
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:02,590
Why don't you wear the clothes I bought for you?
What's up with this eagle wings outfit?

639
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,460
Did you buy clothes for her?

640
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,300
Oh, not this one. No.

641
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,350
I plan to do it on a special day
Wear the clothes you bought for me again

642
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:16,140
But I got the bag.

643
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,610
Auntie, thank you so much
Raised Min-hwan so well

644
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:28,360
Because I want to become a family with him.
He went from head to toe

645
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,990
Bought me a whole set and dressed me up
Really thoughtful

646
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:37,620
I only received his first paycheck.
The red hygienic clothes you bought for me

647
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,080
Oh really?

648
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,830
You're really going too far.

649
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,760
(Pet Cat Management Trust Agreement)

650
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:54,550
(Client: Liu Zhihe)

651
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:02,770
From now on, no matter what happens to you

652
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:05,610
This cat will be in this house
Well cared for

653
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:08,610
Thanks

654
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,860
Are you going anywhere?
Why do you suddenly want to put your cat into a trust?

655
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,740
No one knows what will happen to me one day.

656
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,290
Don't you like cats very much?

657
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:23,580
I like it

658
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:27,500
I have another favor to ask of you.

659
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:40,100
(Ossendyk)

660
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,940
Is she doing well?

661
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:57,950
Good

662
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:04,000
I will protect you till the end

663
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:14,260
I'm a frank person, so I'll just say it.

664
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,550
I love you, mom

665
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:21,430
I'm not happy with you

666
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,230
I never thought about it

667
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:26,400
Become a family with people like you

668
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:30,320
Because there are no adults in your family, you must not have learned well.

669
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:35,110
But as long as you are willing to learn now,

670
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:38,780
Do you have this intention?

671
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,910
Yes, of course.

672
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,370
good

673
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,330
I'm not that rigid.

674
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,000
I don't care about the difference between men and women these days.

675
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:52,000
They are all my parents' babies.

676
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:56,800
But that's just social talk.

677
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,140
It's different at home.

678
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,470
Um

679
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:04,180
Family life is ultimately up to women.

680
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:07,690
To make sure men eat well and keep the house clean

681
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,560
Raise your children well

682
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:12,150
Yes, auntie, I have faith.

683
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,360
Men lose energy when they enter the kitchen

684
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:20,950
No matter how much someone denies

685
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:24,950
This is a major fact common to the world

686
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,540
I want to cook for Min-hwan

687
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:29,290
- I am currently learning cooking
-right

688
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:32,250
You must make breakfast for him.

689
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:35,510
No bread or cereal
That kind of unspeakable thing

690
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:37,550
Be sure to cook soup or stew a pot and eat it with rice

691
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,220
Yes, I understand

692
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,680
If you want children, three or four?

693
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,770
If possible, have as many children as possible.

694
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,400
I think this is good too.

695
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,310
I don't have any brothers or sisters, so I feel a little lonely

696
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,530
I am very satisfied with this

697
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:58,450
I'll contact you sometime.

698
00:56:58,530 --> 00:56:59,910
Come with me to the doctor

699
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:04,540
Recently, there are many uteruses in poor condition.

700
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:08,750
I'll take a look and get the doctor's opinion.

701
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:13,840
If you take care of yourself
There's no reason to say no.

702
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,760
Have a health check-up

703
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:22,430
By the way, I have always been ashamed to face my ancestors.

704
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:24,010
Always makes me feel bad

705
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:27,470
Now that there are new family members joining

706
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,640
I plan to resume ancestor worship

707
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:31,560
recover?

708
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,810
Red east, white west, jujube, chestnut, pear, potato

709
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:37,400
I will teach you, don't worry.

710
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,070
Here are a few things you should keep in mind:

711
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,780
You must serve your elders sincerely

712
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:45,990
Respect and serve your husband

713
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,080
Proper child rearing

714
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:53,130
When working in the workplace
You show smart and capable

715
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:54,750
I totally agree

716
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:00,970
Why should I work?

717
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:07,390
Are you going to quit your job?

718
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,900
I want to continue working
But after hearing what my aunt said

719
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,150
I think I'm too greedy.

720
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,110
No!

721
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:18,690
Do you know how much it costs to raise a child these days?

722
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,740
How can you play at home?

723
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:23,360
How can it be a game?

724
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:25,280
Serve your uncle and aunt sincerely

725
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:26,410
You must respect and serve Min-hwan

726
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:28,790
If you want to raise your children well

727
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:33,420
24 hours a day aren't enough.

728
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:38,130
And my aunt, not red east and white west, but dates, chestnuts, pears and potatoes

729
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:41,130
Red in the east and white in the west, jujube, chestnut, pear, persimmon

730
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:44,760
-What?
- You said it was potato

731
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,180
Not quite the same

732
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:50,680
I myself worship my father every year
So I know very well

733
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:52,560
I will not reject ancestor worship.

734
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,020
So family education is very important

735
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:58,860
Miss, this is against the rules.

736
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:01,610
Daughters cannot worship their parents

737
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:08,780
Your dad would understand.
It is his sin to have only daughters

738
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:11,290
That's why everyone wants to have a son.

739
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:13,910
There's a reason for all this.

740
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,960
But I can't understand, auntie

741
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,010
Auntie?

742
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,590
Are you a judge?

743
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,850
Why was my father convicted?

744
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:30,850
Jiang Zhiyuan, are you crazy?

745
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:32,310
How dare you be so disrespectful?

746
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:34,180
Wait, don't talk.

747
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,600
Auntie?

748
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,570
Hey, are you done?

749
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,860
I don't want this marriage.

750
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:47,820
You are the aunt, right?

751
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:52,200
Wake up, auntie.

752
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:54,910
Your son is not that good.

753
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:57,250
Even if he is good

754
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:00,710
You should also understand that other people's daughters are just as precious

755
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,630
You listen to me.

756
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,630
Not You

757
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,430
I don't like this family.
So don't get married.

758
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:11,560
Do you understand?

759
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,640
Jiang Zhiyuan, are you crazy? You...

760
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,070
Wait a minute, hey, Kang Ji-won, hello!

761
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,270
Kang Ji-won

762
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,280
Kang Ji Won!

763
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,620
Hello!

764
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:41,460
What are you doing?

765
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,340
What do you think? Of course I'll break up with you

766
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,510
What? Break up?

767
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:53,430
Are you kidding me?

768
01:00:57,270 --> 01:01:00,690
Let's not get involved anymore.

769
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:09,700
You guy...

770
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:14,990
Girls want to throw bigger boys
It's not easy actually

771
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,120
So when the other party is completely unexpected

772
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:22,330
Fall down once

773
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,150
Minhwan

774
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,810
Damn it.

775
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,300
Kang Ji Won!

776
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:17,760
How dare the cheating guy be so loud?

777
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:20,390
What else do you have besides being beautiful?

778
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,390
How could you do this to Xiumin?

779
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,020
My life is ruined

780
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:27,150
I have a woman I want to marry

781
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:30,150
You said you have nothing to do with my benefactor.
I won't do anything.

782
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:34,110
As long as they two get married
Can I live like this?

783
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,660
How could you get into such trouble?

784
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:38,870
Zheng Xiumin, stop!

785
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:40,700
I won't let it go easily this time.

786
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,870
You clean up the mess you made.
