1
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,584
<i>I used to always
pick a bad hand.</i>

2
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,711
Crap...

3
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,674
Bring Mom.

4
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:52,219
When a couple fights, the
husband should reach out first.

5
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:55,306
Oh, it's working.

6
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,520
Do you need anything?

7
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:02,855
I'll get it for you.

8
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,489
<i>My dad was hard-working but
struggled to make ends meet.</i>

9
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,450
<i>I always felt sad
and bad for him.</i>

10
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,330
Just get a new car.

11
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,416
This one sounds like a
100-year-old grandpa coughing.

12
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,585
She can hear you!

13
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,295
Don't be so heartless.

14
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,255
I'm afraid it's dangerous.

15
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:30,800
This baby won't
put me in danger.

16
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,968
You'll be alone without me.

17
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:38,140
Drive safe.

18
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:41,769
Are you coming at night?

19
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,271
I'll be pretty late.

20
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:45,981
Check the doors before bed!

21
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,503
Who would steal
anything from us?

22
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,262
There you go.

23
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,429
Go on now.

24
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:18,514
Bye.

25
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,519
She's pretty. Just like her mom.

26
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,355
So what? Her mom ran away.

27
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:30,526
Mr. Kang shouldn't have married
her for her pretty face.

28
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,237
- I feel sorry for that poor kid.
- Stop it.

29
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,322
<i>The poor kid whose mom ran away.</i>

30
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:41,996
<i>In this tiny little neighborhood,
people talked about us to pass the time.</i>

31
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:47,209
<i>And it hurt me more because
I was going through puberty.</i>

32
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,171
Dad...

33
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:55,718
Where's he going?

34
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:10,149
It's raining. Shall
we rent a video?

35
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,735
- Shall we have some <i>ramyeon </i>too?
- Sounds great.

36
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,445
I'll go rent it.

37
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,822
- Hurry back.
- Okay.

38
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,079
<i>Mom?</i>

39
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,280
<i>To carry on, I had to accept
that it was just my life.</i>

40
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,909
<i>That my life was just
one of the awful ones.</i>

41
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:05,996
<i>That there was no reason
that I shouldn't be</i>

42
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,124
<i>one of the unlucky ones.</i>

43
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:13,795
It's 1,200 won.

44
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,891
Did you lose your wallet?

45
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:30,229
Goodness. You make it so obvious
that your mother ran away.

46
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,481
Because of your mother,

47
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:35,776
you must act smart so others
won't find fault with you.

48
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,528
You know that, right?

49
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,488
Don't be so nosy.

50
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,914
Here.

51
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,290
Is it yours?

52
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,636
<i>So anything was good.</i>

53
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:07,558
<i>I was desperate to feel a
hand reaching out to me.</i>

54
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,185
JEONG SU-MIN

55
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:11,353
What?

56
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,605
Those brats...

57
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:14,690
I'll punish you!

58
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:19,069
<i>Too desperate to judge
whether it was land or swamp.</i>

59
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,573
<i>But.</i>

60
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:27,077
<i>I was determined not to do it
again with my second chance.</i>

61
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:32,416
<i>I was going to fight, grow,</i>

62
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,294
<i>and become happier
than anyone else.</i>

63
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:40,716
<i>It was finally my turn
to pick a good hand.</i>

64
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,600
<i>I picked a good hand this time.</i>

65
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,019
<i>I believed I'd be happy.</i>

66
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,694
I called to talk, but
you wouldn't pick up.

67
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,447
I thought about
coming back later.

68
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,785
But you might keep dodging my
calls, so I waited to see you.

69
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,789
Ji-won.

70
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,166
I can explain this.

71
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:37,314
<i>I was wrong. I still
only pick bad hands.</i>

72
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,865
{\an8}EPISODE 12.

73
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,366
{\an8}BASED ON THE NAVER SERIES WEBNOVEL
<i>MARRY MY HUSBAND </i>BY SUNGSOJAK.

74
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,769
{\an8}Hui-yeon, I'm sorry...

75
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,646
{\an8}<i>Ms. Kang, what do we do?</i>

76
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,731
<i>Just now,</i>

77
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,985
I called Ms. Yang because
she didn't show up.

78
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,615
What do we do? Ms. Yang
has stomach cancer.

79
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,629
<i>That's why life's hard.</i>

80
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,131
<i>The future's a mystery.</i>

81
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:53,682
I thought I'd knew everything
at this age when I was a kid.

82
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,185
No, you're doing great.

83
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:01,481
I read your column in the company
paper about that unfortunate incident.

84
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,944
{\an8}<i>The staff could've been shaken.
It was the appropriate response.</i>

85
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,031
I was proud.

86
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:13,660
And I felt bad for asking you
to clean up my employee's mess.

87
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:16,788
We're like family. It's
the least I could do.

88
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,082
My father always told me

89
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,002
not to forget that
U&K was my family.

90
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:27,549
I've never thought differently.

91
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,509
Gang-cheol's so lucky.

92
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,470
He's raised you well.

93
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:38,101
If you feel that way, I shouldn't
have broken off the engagement.

94
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,814
We got engaged because
of our parents,

95
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,609
and Ji-hyuk was so apathetic.

96
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,820
And I never liked him as a man.

97
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:53,033
That's why I agreed to
break off the engagement.

98
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,328
But he's become charming.

99
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,831
What's happened?

100
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:10,509
<i>So I'm going to stay in
Korea for quite a while.</i>

101
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,973
Can I do that?

102
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,016
I'll come and see you often.

103
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,562
How would it feel to have my
boyfriend marry my best friend?

104
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:28,443
Would I feel lucky since I
got a new rich boyfriend?

105
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,365
It's like a soap, isn't it?

106
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,551
You bought a car to
take me to the hospital.

107
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,929
How long since you last drove?

108
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,643
How were the test results?

109
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,605
It's not going to be easy.

110
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,985
I have to wait long because
the doctor's schedule is full.

111
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,824
Still, medicine's gotten
so much better, so...

112
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,670
I hate this.

113
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,216
I get weak if I'm with you.

114
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,887
I can endure it if I'm alone.

115
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:52,569
That's exactly why
I follow you around.

116
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,865
You can't be mentally
healthy when you're in pain.

117
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,204
Cry.

118
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,999
Don't hold it back.
Just cry in my arms.

119
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,377
You have to cry.

120
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,885
Why are you so good to me?

121
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,142
<i>It's my fault.</i>

122
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,436
<i>My fate went to her.</i>

123
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,439
<i>But why?</i>

124
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,025
<i>This doesn't end with
Min-hwan's marriage?</i>

125
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,166
Hey.

126
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,751
Stop glaring.

127
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:52,796
You should've told my mom
if you hated this place.

128
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,925
How can I tell her? You
should've told her for me.

129
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,008
Why would I?

130
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,512
I think my mom's right.

131
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,056
It's dangerous for a
pregnant woman to fly.

132
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,520
All right. Fine.

133
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,273
The honeymoon isn't important.

134
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,697
Min-hwan.

135
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,826
Let's live a good life, okay?
You're the head of our house now.

136
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,077
- The baby...
- Hey!

137
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,455
Why am I the head?

138
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,206
Ji-won never said that.

139
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,387
Su-min.

140
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:46,850
You're great and all, but
you don't know marriage.

141
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,769
Listen carefully.

142
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:55,275
Marriages work well when each
spouse does their own job.

143
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:57,444
What?

144
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,905
You didn't like the
wedding invitation,

145
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:03,617
didn't understand Mom, and
hated the honeymoon destination,

146
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,327
You keep complaining to me.

147
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:09,039
That's because you only
think about yourself.

148
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,582
Look at me.

149
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:14,002
Did I say anything about your
friends who caused a scene

150
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,170
at our wedding?

151
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,131
You were upset and
threw your phone at me.

152
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:19,257
Hey!

153
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,551
Are they the same thing?

154
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,262
There's no use talking to you...

155
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,931
Forget it.

156
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,267
Damn it.

157
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,106
<i>Congratulations</i>

158
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:39,194
on picking up my trash.

159
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,657
No.

160
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,789
Hey, Sang-jong. Has
it been rented out?

161
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,333
Yeah, I just wired the money.

162
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,668
- Thank you.
<i>- Bye.</i>

163
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:55,752
Okay.

164
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,590
But is it really okay to tell
your mom you were scammed?

165
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,425
<i>Even if she falls for it,</i>

166
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,970
won't your wife
throw a fit about it?

167
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:08,014
I'm her only son.
She won't kill me.

168
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,810
And it wasn't my wife's
money, so what can she do?

169
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:12,894
Hold on.

170
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,690
{\an8}YU SANG-JONG: 360 MILLION WON.

171
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,985
Okay, I got the money!

172
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,572
Debts are assets
too. It'll be okay.

173
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,282
Okay, thanks. Bye!

174
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,951
Oh, my God!

175
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,039
What were you talking about?

176
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:35,916
What?

177
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,170
What do you mean?
What did you hear?

178
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,298
What did you mean?

179
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,800
You said it wasn't my money!

180
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,721
Well...

181
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:53,727
It'll be released soon.
This puts us in a spot.

182
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,230
They even checked the draft.
How could they back out now?

183
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,441
You can't do this
before the launch.

184
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,525
This is insane.

185
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,069
Wait! Wait a second!

186
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,951
What is it, Hui-yeon?

187
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,786
Are things not going well

188
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,832
with the project the respected Ms.
Yang and Ms. Kang are working on?

189
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,255
- Tae-hyeong.
- Yes?

190
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,383
Don't hold onto a
hopeless project.

191
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,638
Let's go smoke, okay?

192
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,475
Yeah, let's go.

193
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,393
Keep working, okay?

194
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,564
It's 1:45 p.m.

195
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:44,653
You took three and a half days
off, and you show up to work now?

196
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,696
You act so meticulous at work,

197
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,908
but you're more meticulous
about your free time.

198
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,618
Mr. Kim?

199
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,205
Yes, Ms. Kang?

200
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,625
You must be going somewhere
far to smoke during work hours.

201
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,960
Since Ms. Yang is away,

202
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:04,923
you should help with the meal kit,
but you don't review the data.

203
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,883
Oh, that?

204
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,345
I don't need to
review it. That's why.

205
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,723
Tae-hyeong, let's go.

206
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,270
The chefs suddenly canceled
their contracts? Why?

207
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,109
What?

208
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,654
What's with Chef Lee Gwang-min?

209
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,948
We're about to
release. Why postpone?

210
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,328
He says the product's of poor
quality. Honestly, it's ridiculous.

211
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,581
I think something's
up. Kim Gyeong-uk...

212
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,586
I mean, Mr. Kim is
good at politics.

213
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,756
He has connections. I
think he did something.

214
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,677
What about Ms. Yang?

215
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,181
I took her home. I think
she should take time off.

216
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,891
Time off...

217
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,955
It's not time for
me to be angry.

218
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,666
But you won't hear me out,

219
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,377
and you made me call
you like this at work.

220
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,589
I'm sorry.

221
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,883
I needed time to
sort my thoughts.

222
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,847
I was confused.

223
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,186
I was given another chance,

224
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:47,776
and I thought I just had to get
Min-hwan and Su-min to marry.

225
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,280
While I was doing it, you were

226
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,284
like a gift to me.

227
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,511
Did you ever hear
that I was married?

228
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:27,524
It gets sorted out in a few years
anyway. I just sped up the process.

229
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,985
Yu-ra's a family friend
since we were kids.

230
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,573
I thought I could marry
her without any feelings.

231
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,494
But that wasn't the case,
so I ended it with her.

232
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,499
You can marry someone
without any feelings?

233
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,919
Such relationships exist.

234
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,554
To be honest,

235
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,810
I didn't know how I felt
about you before your funeral.

236
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,730
So I ended it when I got back.

237
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:09,732
That's all.

238
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,409
I don't know.

239
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,706
Everything you say just
sounds like an excuse to me.

240
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,083
Ji-won.

241
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,002
I'm not trying to blame you.

242
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,546
I just...

243
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,843
I realized I
dreamed of something

244
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,304
too happy.

245
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,558
At the lake,

246
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,061
you told me

247
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,190
having a family
was a good thing.

248
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,987
Do you know what it means
to not have a family?

249
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,867
I wanted to start a family.

250
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,874
Yes, I made a mistake.

251
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,131
My mom

252
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,011
left home when I was 14.

253
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,265
She found love.

254
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:31,564
She endured for 14 years
because of me, but...

255
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,400
No matter how long you endure,

256
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,658
<i>those left behind</i>

257
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,120
get hurt.

258
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:01,803
No matter what the relationship
is, once it's started,

259
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,431
I don't think it's
right for one person

260
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,017
to end it one-sidedly.

261
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:33,501
I recruited Dr. Lee to our
cancer ward from the States.

262
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,586
She specializes
in stomach cancer.

263
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,463
YUIL MEDICAL CENTER
DR. LEE HYEON-JI

264
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,675
I spent half a year on this.

265
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,552
Ms. Yang will receive

266
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,180
surgery as soon as possible.

267
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:26,971
Hello?

268
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:39,025
I hate clichés like this,
but I guess I can't help it.

269
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,445
Thanks for coming.

270
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,874
I thought it was only right
to talk to you, so I came.

271
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,085
There's nothing to worry...

272
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,712
That's not for you
to decide, is it?

273
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,840
It bothers me.

274
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:07,803
I'm sorry.

275
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,350
I didn't know he was engaged.

276
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,562
And I'm going to
stop seeing him.

277
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:24,612
In life, there are times when
you accidentally stab someone.

278
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:29,617
But saying you didn't know
and will never do it again

279
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,327
doesn't cut it.

280
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,794
What do you want me to do?

281
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,338
I liked him.

282
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:47,718
I didn't mean to,
but I fell for him.

283
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,141
So I had a happy
dream for a moment.

284
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,854
However, after I
found out about you,

285
00:23:58,604 --> 00:23:59,730
I ended it.

286
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:01,357
<i>I didn't know how I felt...</i>

287
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,360
<i>So I ended it when I got back.</i>

288
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:10,741
That's interesting
that you fell for him.

289
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,538
Didn't you have a
boyfriend of seven years?

290
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,709
You were practically
married to him.

291
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:25,840
Why did you suddenly
fall for your boss?

292
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,550
After seven years of working.

293
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:36,392
Because Ji-hyuk's
U&K's successor?

294
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,729
- It's not like that.
- Then you didn't know?

295
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,109
My grandfather knew

296
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,319
{\an8}<i>promoted to CEO</i>

297
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:47,778
<i>that I just</i>

298
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,656
<i>didn't want anything.</i>

299
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,159
My life was decided since birth.

300
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,872
So I studied and
worked only for U&K.

301
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,213
So you knew.

302
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:10,301
I think we're done.

303
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,594
If you'll excuse me.

304
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,100
What I hate the most

305
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,186
are people like you.

306
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,148
Self-righteous nobodies.

307
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:26,359
You were greedy but
say you weren't.

308
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:30,279
You know everything
but pretend you don't.

309
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:38,412
You're not dumb
enough to not know

310
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:40,539
he could change your life.

311
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,510
How predictable.

312
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,974
You're the type of
person I hate as well.

313
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,271
Do you think
everyone's like you?

314
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:08,776
You think it was important to
me that he was U&K's successor?

315
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,780
It didn't matter to me at all.

316
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,371
Because

317
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,667
my life changed without him.

318
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,306
<i>I need to get a grip.</i>

319
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,656
<i>If the cancer went
to Yang Ju-ran...</i>

320
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,705
<i>Wait...</i>

321
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,169
<i>What happens now?</i>

322
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:54,590
- Open the door.
- Okay.

323
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,266
Say bye to your mom.

324
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,186
Say bye. Bye.

325
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:09,814
Princess.

326
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:12,233
Don't come here
anymore. Rest at home.

327
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:15,694
Okay? Go on now.

328
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:19,281
I'm Lee Jae-won,
Ju-ran's husband.

329
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,244
I have stomach cancer.

330
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,958
What am I doing right now?

331
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,341
Let's go.

332
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:39,343
Are you cold?

333
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,311
Go inside first.

334
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:51,897
- What?
- Your lips.

335
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,190
<i>Husband...</i>

336
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,067
<i>Husband...</i>

337
00:28:56,235 --> 00:29:01,282
<i>What if the fate has something to do
with the husband, not marrying Min-hwan?</i>

338
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,539
<i>I went to see Dr. Lee.</i>

339
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,710
<i>I made treatment appointments.
I can get surgery soon too.</i>

340
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,464
<i>I don't know why, but she
always left one spot open.</i>

341
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,382
She specializes
in stomach cancer.

342
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,052
I spent half a year on this.

343
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:31,812
What? A scam?

344
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,775
- I'll kill that real estate agent.
- No, Mom!

345
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:40,237
I took care of it.
I spoke to her, Mom.

346
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:41,906
What did you take care of?

347
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:45,201
Why are you on your
knees here if you did?

348
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,412
<i>When I think about it, Su-min is</i>

349
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:50,456
<i>different from me.</i>

350
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,166
Right.

351
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:55,711
If you think about it,
this is all your fault.

352
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,546
What does a man know?

353
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:01,342
This is why a good woman
needs to join the family.

354
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,803
I shouldn't have been so hasty.

355
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,139
I felt strangely
hesitant about this.

356
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,475
It felt wrong.

357
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:16,190
<i>Although she married
Min-hwan like me,</i>

358
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:20,027
<i>would she just let them
walk all over her like me?</i>

359
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:26,867
Mother.

360
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:30,746
You should get the
facts straight.

361
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:35,960
You picked the house and gave
him money to sign the contract.

362
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:37,962
Why are you blaming me?

363
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:47,680
I mean, after I let it slide that he
was renting a house, not buying one.

364
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,724
Goodness.

365
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:54,436
Listen to you! I've been nice
to you since you're pregnant.

366
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,773
You didn't bring anything,
but what? You let it slide?

367
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,068
I have money. He said
to not bring anything.

368
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,739
I guess it's because he
wanted to move in here...

369
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:07,366
Hey.

370
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:10,160
You're a contract
employee. What money?

371
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:13,622
Contract employee? You said
she'd work after giving birth.

372
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,209
She will.

373
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:19,920
She's a competent
contract employee.

374
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:21,213
I did stocks.

375
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,591
- What?
- I earned quite a lot.

376
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:24,842
What?

377
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:31,098
I'm not excited about
this at all either.

378
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:35,769
And let's be honest. I did everything
you wanted for the wedding.

379
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,981
And during the honeymoon,
I learned of his...

380
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,524
Hush!

381
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:50,951
In any case, stop
hitting Min-hwan.

382
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:57,625
He's the head of the
household and our baby's dad.

383
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:00,294
Or shall I just leave
with our baby general?

384
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:06,133
Our baby...

385
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:08,636
Here it is.

386
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,433
Marriage isn't all
that bad, right?

387
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,018
I gained an ally.

388
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:19,396
Don't worry.

389
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,898
My mom can be harsh,

390
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,107
but she's cool.

391
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:24,735
Once our baby's born,
she'll buy us a house!

392
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,655
Once she hears the baby crying,

393
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:29,156
she can't withstand it.

394
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,282
There's no baby.

395
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,040
What? No what? What did you say?

396
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,293
My God!

397
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:45,798
I'll be home later.

398
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,050
Make sure the house is clean.

399
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,970
I can't believe this is my life.

400
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,432
I have two more mouths
to feed at my age.

401
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:58,102
God, such nuisances.

402
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,269
Darn it...

403
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,570
What do you mean?

404
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:09,780
There's no what?

405
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:12,408
I...

406
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,788
had a miscarriage.

407
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,799
<i>When you threw your phone at me,</i>

408
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,552
<i>my stomach started to hurt.</i>

409
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,221
<i>I was so scared.</i>

410
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,890
<i>And I didn't know what to do.</i>

411
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:40,519
<i>I didn't want to disappoint your
mom, so I couldn't tell you.</i>

412
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:05,878
Our baby.

413
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,145
By the way...

414
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:30,360
You said you craved beef during
our honeymoon because of the baby.

415
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:35,991
But didn't you not
have the baby then?

416
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:43,290
Didn't you say you had a
house when you didn't too?

417
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:45,458
What?

418
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:47,753
But our baby...

419
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:24,206
Ms. Kang!

420
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,708
You scared me.

421
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,293
Didn't you leave earlier?

422
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,380
I thought of you.

423
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:43,851
Since last Christmas, I've
been trying to eat healthy.

424
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:48,814
This is rich in protein and so
crunchy! It's my favorite lately.

425
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:50,732
Really?

426
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,321
It is good.

427
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:58,949
But for some reason...

428
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:01,910
Does it remind you of something?

429
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,913
It's probably this!

430
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:08,750
It's perfect. I
desperately needed it.

431
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:20,220
To tell the truth, my brother bought
all this saying you'd need it.

432
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:22,305
What?

433
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:42,034
He's been hesitant and
walking on eggshells lately.

434
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:45,329
Is it because of Yu-ra?

435
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,835
Yes, well...

436
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,048
She's been seeing my grandpa.

437
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,342
But Ms. Kang,

438
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,427
whether he called
off the engagement

439
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,056
for you or because he came to
his senses, I'm totally in favor.

440
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,894
To tell you the truth, he
got engaged because of me.

441
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,774
He said we should make a family
firm enough to stand on like land.

442
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,491
<i>Also, my brother had
no interest in dating.</i>

443
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:27,412
<i>He just seemed emotionless. He
always suppressed his emotions.</i>

444
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:28,830
<i>Like some robot.</i>

445
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,292
<i>He's so different lately.</i>

446
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:33,627
<i>He wasn't like this.</i>

447
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,381
The weather is chilly.

448
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,758
- Go inside.
- I'm okay.

449
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:42,010
- Hey.
- I'm back.

450
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,680
I'll escort Yu-ra now.

451
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,098
Yeah, okay. Bye.

452
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,308
- I'll come again.
- Okay, come often.

453
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:49,476
- Okay.
- Bye.

454
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,816
What are you doing?

455
00:37:56,483 --> 00:38:00,362
I've been meaning to tell you
this. You've changed a lot.

456
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,533
You didn't just change
your appearance.

457
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:06,868
You're a man now.

458
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,580
I came to see your grandfather.

459
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:15,752
No matter how our relationship
is, he and I are still close.

460
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:18,338
That's interesting.

461
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:20,632
I think you two
suddenly got closer.

462
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:24,803
You came to Korea on the 8th
and visited him three times.

463
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:32,185
It never happened in our
five-year engagement.

464
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,188
Things like this.

465
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:38,358
You didn't care about
anything but work.

466
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,485
You're so detailed now.

467
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,572
Is it because of her?

468
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:46,199
Didn't you accept my decision?

469
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,412
That was before I knew
there was a woman.

470
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:55,250
I don't like anyone touching

471
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,252
what's mine.

472
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,422
<i>Also, Yu-ra may seem normal,</i>

473
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:03,675
{\an8}<i>but she's a total whack job.</i>

474
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:04,759
{\an8}2017.

475
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,514
Get out.

476
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,192
How much longer
will you do this?

477
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,194
You know we're not anything.

478
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,655
It's her fault. Why
covet what's mine?

479
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:32,412
I don't like anyone
touching what's mine.

480
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:35,581
<i>Enough.</i>

481
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,001
Ms. Kang.

482
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,130
I know Mr. Yu's a good person.

483
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,633
This is my fault.

484
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,552
So let's stop
talking about this.

485
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:48,636
Ms. Kang.

486
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,475
I'm not actually his
real little sister.

487
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,690
My brother was hurt badly
because of me and my mom.

488
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:02,984
So...

489
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:08,198
He could never cheat on anyone.

490
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:22,587
I realized it again.

491
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,507
Yu-ra's a great kid.

492
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,846
You don't think she visits you
with good intentions, do you?

493
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,223
That's why I like her.

494
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:36,726
She's greedy enough to be
lady of the U&K household.

495
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,729
I like those who obsess
over what's theirs.

496
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:42,023
A man should meet
the right woman.

497
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:45,443
A woman needs spite
to protect her family.

498
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:51,283
You're right. You said that.

499
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,661
That's why I thought
it'd be okay.

500
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,042
Grandfather.

501
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:03,920
When my mother was alive,

502
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,799
how did you feel about
Father meeting Ms. Cha?

503
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:14,598
Did Ms. Cha have
more spite and greed

504
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:17,350
than my mother?

505
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,150
I liked Ms. Cha.

506
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:31,448
Mother was always sick, and I
relied more on her as a kid.

507
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:42,417
Before I learned that Hui-yeon was
only five years younger than me.

508
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,178
After learning that, I
felt bad for Hui-yeon.

509
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,604
So after I got engaged to Yu-ra,

510
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,815
I held it in even when
I couldn't stand it.

511
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:12,113
I vowed that I'd never
become like my father.

512
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:19,704
But I only learned things
didn't work that way

513
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:23,750
when I saw the end.

514
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,380
But...

515
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:41,518
What should I have
done, Grandfather?

516
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,650
It's too hard.

517
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,539
So he's the bastard that cheated
on his girlfriend with her bestie.

518
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:06,334
And she's the bitch that
married her bestie's boyfriend.

519
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,670
Because they don't
know who Ji-hyuk is?

520
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,047
Yes.

521
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:12,674
Those fools.

522
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,676
What if they find out?

523
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:43,455
There's laundry to do today. Don't
just do what's in the basket.

524
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:46,833
Organize the closet and
wash the old clothes too.

525
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:50,211
By myself? Where are you going?

526
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:54,299
I'm the secretary of the Women's
Center. I have a luncheon.

527
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,634
Oh, right.

528
00:43:59,763 --> 00:44:04,100
Since you're alone, take it
easy while listening to it.

529
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:07,354
Isn't your life so sweet?

530
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:08,813
You're so lucky.

531
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:15,731
Your grandmother will be back
later, our little general.

532
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:39,803
Darn it...

533
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,346
Seriously?

534
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:45,642
Is this really right?

535
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,519
Is this married life?

536
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,584
What's this?

537
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,255
U&K STOCKHOLDER'S LIST

538
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:16,965
Yu Ji-hyuk...

539
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:22,971
{\an8}YU JI-HYUK YU HUI-YEON.

540
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:26,683
What is this?

541
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,103
No way.

542
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,147
Did she really...

543
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:33,815
<i>Su-min.</i>

544
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:38,486
I have some trash to throw
away. Will you do it for me?

545
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:41,448
<i>Congratulations</i>

546
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:45,326
on picking up my trash.

547
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:51,833
She dumps Min-hwan on me

548
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,253
and goes for a rich man?

549
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:02,218
No way. No.

550
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:04,804
I stole him.

551
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,807
I did it.

552
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:09,851
I did!

553
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,896
No!

554
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:34,834
Why is

555
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,212
the house like this?

556
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,755
Why are you asking me?

557
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:43,134
Your wife did this to the house,
locked the door, and won't come out.

558
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:04,489
What?

559
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,371
What?

560
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:16,376
Damn it...

561
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,964
All that tall jerk did was be
born into the right family.

562
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:25,718
What the hell have my parents
done their entire lives?

563
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:32,433
I can fly much higher
with a little support.

564
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:37,105
Are you jealous of
Yu Ji-hyuk right now?

565
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:42,402
Kang Ji-won dumped you on me.

566
00:47:43,278 --> 00:47:45,238
So what will you
do about it now?

567
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:54,497
So it wasn't just trash.

568
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:57,584
I picked up trash with no pride.

569
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,502
You little...

570
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:01,629
Not just that.
You're stupid too.

571
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:03,548
Have you paid off your debt?

572
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:06,426
My mom can hear you.
Stop bring that up.

573
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:13,057
How much is left? Is
100 million won enough?

574
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:15,643
What?

575
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,396
We deserve compensation.

576
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:21,691
Why does Ji-won get
all the good stuff?

577
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:25,945
Are you out of your mind?

578
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:29,991
Do you think she'll
give it to you?

579
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:32,118
I'll make her.

580
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:35,955
I know everything about her.

581
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:38,916
Even what she doesn't know.

582
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,376
<i>Happy you beat me?</i>

583
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:25,171
<i>You're my other half. We can't
just end things like this.</i>

584
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:54,450
{\an8}<i>Ji-won, I can't reach you.</i>

585
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:56,869
<i>How have you been?</i>

586
00:49:56,953 --> 00:49:59,497
<i>I heard about you by chance.</i>

587
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:02,583
<i>It's your mom.</i>

588
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:23,730
Ji-won.

589
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:34,115
You grew up so well.

590
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:38,703
You really did.

591
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,750
You're still beautiful.

592
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:49,088
You were always the prettiest
in our neighborhood.

593
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:52,884
I'm all old now.

594
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,471
Time can't help but pass.

595
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,100
You're pretty too.

596
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:03,519
I'm glad you take after me.

597
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,150
I know it's in the past now,

598
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,073
but I never liked
your father much.

599
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:18,951
I was young and struggling,

600
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:21,454
and he liked me so much.

601
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:24,457
I thought I could like him too.

602
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:28,252
Everyone got married
like that back then.

603
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,505
So I didn't like you either.

604
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,008
I mean, I did.

605
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:36,886
You're my kid. How could I not?

606
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:42,350
Anyway, I'm sorry.

607
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:45,770
I was immature.

608
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,816
I had you when I wasn't ready.

609
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:53,194
Still...

610
00:51:55,238 --> 00:51:57,156
I missed you so much.

611
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:01,619
Then why didn't
you come to see me?

612
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:08,501
Forget my dad, you
could've come to see me.

613
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:10,336
I did.

614
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,797
He didn't let me.

615
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:16,717
Do you not know how
much he cared about you?

616
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,972
I know he was a
good father to you.

617
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:23,307
He was sweet.

618
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,727
But he was so stubborn.

619
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,688
He wasn't considerate.

620
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,984
It was hard for me too.

621
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:37,530
I was only able to come to see you
after I heard your father had passed.

622
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:39,490
It took me courage.

623
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:45,121
My father tried his
best to raise me.

624
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:51,752
Of course, your
absence was big for me.

625
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,714
I was just an adolescent girl.

626
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:02,680
<i>That's why I became attached
to the wrong people.</i>

627
00:53:04,307 --> 00:53:06,434
<i>I didn't know how
to express myself.</i>

628
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:07,935
No...

629
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,273
Actually, I didn't
know how I felt.

630
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,611
There was no one to teach me.

631
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:21,449
I'm sorry.

632
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,037
It's all my fault.

633
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,917
I was a bad mother,
and it made you suffer.

634
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:33,294
How can I make it up to you?

635
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,214
How can I do it?

636
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:51,354
What are you doing tomorrow?

637
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:52,563
What?

638
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:57,944
If you're free, would you
like to spend time with me?

639
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,339
Did you get home okay yesterday?

640
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:19,715
Did you sleep well?

641
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:22,635
Yes, what about you, Mom?

642
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:25,179
Is it because I met you?

643
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,931
I couldn't sleep at all.

644
00:54:30,685 --> 00:54:32,478
Are you craving anything?

645
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:35,982
Pork <i>gukbap</i>.

646
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,404
Do you know how to do this?

647
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:42,989
This is my first time.

648
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:44,073
This is pretty.

649
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:45,449
Where do we look?

650
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:46,701
Here?

651
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,744
{\an8}I LOVE YOU.

652
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,207
{\an8}WITH MOM.

653
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:54,959
Heart?

654
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:57,003
One, two, three.

655
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:03,509
This is so pretty.

656
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:06,804
They don't sell this in Busan.
Does it look good on me?

657
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,181
We'll take this.

658
00:55:09,265 --> 00:55:11,058
No, don't!

659
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:13,019
That's okay.

660
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:14,437
This is so expensive.

661
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,188
Show us this.

662
00:55:16,272 --> 00:55:18,482
It's too expensive.

663
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,736
Still, shall I just try it on?

664
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,612
- Can we?
- Yes.

665
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,074
How does it look?

666
00:55:27,158 --> 00:55:28,451
- It looks good.
- Does it?

667
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:34,790
I wanted to buy
something like this.

668
00:55:34,874 --> 00:55:37,752
My friends brag about
their daughters so much.

669
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:38,836
How does it look?

670
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:41,047
It looks good on you.

671
00:55:41,756 --> 00:55:43,215
What about the black?

672
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:44,925
The size is...

673
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:51,182
Are you that happy?

674
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:53,392
Of course.

675
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:56,020
I'm so lucky to have
a daughter like you.

676
00:55:57,313 --> 00:56:00,608
Since you date a rich man,
you know how to spend...

677
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:13,161
I knew it.

678
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:22,088
Even when I went to a good college and
joined a big company, you never called.

679
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:26,133
Ji-won, what I just said...

680
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:28,344
If you're talking
about Yu Ji-hyuk,

681
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:31,013
I'm not seeing him. We broke up.

682
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:33,349
What?

683
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:35,726
Why on earth?

684
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,149
Are you lying to me right now?

685
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:45,861
Why did you do it?

686
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:51,158
Why?

687
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:55,162
Then why did you run away?

688
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:02,336
I didn't want to believe it.

689
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:05,714
Goodness. Look who called.

690
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:07,216
How have you been?

691
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:09,844
- It's been so long...
- <i>I heard you needed money.</i>

692
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:16,225
Did you know everything?

693
00:57:19,854 --> 00:57:21,147
Then what is this?

694
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,233
I wanted to try it once.

695
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,823
A date with my mom.

696
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,035
A loved daughter,
a good daughter.

697
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:37,538
Happy mother and daughter.

698
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:44,253
I wanted to try it once.

699
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:49,592
Now I've done it.

700
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,219
Have a safe trip back.

701
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:58,684
Do you have any money?

702
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:01,896
A good college and
a good company.

703
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:03,731
Do you have 100 million won?

704
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,650
I'll never come see you again.

705
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:09,195
Do you think I wanted to?

706
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:14,283
You should understand me! Who
else would understand your mom?

707
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:23,042
I have no money. I
have no mother either.

708
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:27,671
I didn't before, and
I won't in the future.

709
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:33,886
You chose to live as a
woman instead of a mother,

710
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:38,933
so live the rest of your
life that way quietly.

711
00:58:40,476 --> 00:58:41,769
Don't be greedy.

712
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:57,576
You wench.

713
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:21,642
No wonder they live like that.

714
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:25,896
Why do I always have to do it
myself to get things done properly?

715
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,149
I said I was going to a funeral.

716
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:32,027
No one died!

717
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:37,116
I can't stay at home. Try a
married life. Can you come out now?

718
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:38,325
Damn it...

719
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:46,458
What was that?

720
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,926
What?

721
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,808
Park Min-hwan?

722
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:07,062
Yes?

723
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:06,455
I flipped him!

724
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:08,832
For the first time. Finally!

725
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:15,422
Yes, I've still got it! The
reserve for the national...

726
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:31,772
{\an8}KANG HYEON-MO.

727
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:36,735
Dad.

728
01:01:42,408 --> 01:01:43,867
The gift you gave me...

729
01:01:47,538 --> 01:01:49,957
I wanted to use it
really well this time.

730
01:01:56,839 --> 01:01:58,924
But why is the
world so hard on me?

731
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:04,972
I hurt someone
precious to me again.

732
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:09,309
It's all too difficult for me.

733
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:13,981
I really wanted to
do well this time.

734
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:16,984
What do I do?

735
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,904
What do I do in this case?

736
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:36,628
I'm sorry I'm such a fool.

737
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:35,645
Yes.

738
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:38,690
Okay. In three minutes?

739
01:03:39,525 --> 01:03:40,692
I understand.

740
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:18,790
{\an8}Kang Ji-won stole my fiancé.

741
01:05:18,874 --> 01:05:23,754
{\an8}<i>You punish the woman who betrayed you,
and change your life with a fortune.</i>

742
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:27,799
{\an8}<i>What do I have to do
to make that happen?</i>

743
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:30,093
{\an8}<i>Kill Kang Ji-won.</i>

744
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:31,595
{\an8}I'll clean up the mess.

745
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:36,016
{\an8}Do as you're told, and
this shitty life is over.

746
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,060
{\an8}Say it again.

747
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,853
{\an8}Stop lying.

748
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,647
{\an8}Why are you doing this to me?

749
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:44,316
{\an8}<i>I can't protect you forever.</i>

750
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,401
{\an8}I like you so much.

751
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,320
{\an8}<i>Don't blame yourself.</i>

752
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:51,281
{\an8}<i>The inevitable just happened.</i>

753
01:05:57,496 --> 01:05:59,498
