1
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,510
Customer No. 34, your latte is ready.

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,060
Customer No. 35, your iced Americano is ready.

3
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,110
No iced Americano

4
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,520
Hmm? I just finished it.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,070
Maybe another customer took it.

6
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,280
Customer No. 34

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,990
Customer No. 34

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,330
Oh, it's me

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,620
Where's my coffee?

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,370
Excuse me, I'll make you a cup right away.

11
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,880
If no one steals

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,730
The coffee will stay there.

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,940
But if someone takes it

14
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,980
Are you kidding me? What is this?

15
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,450
The coffee won't be there.

16
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,670
I need someone to steal my destiny

17
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,310
Episode 2

18
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,890
All down, you know all down, right?

19
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,190
I just need to lose a ball

20
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,770
All fell down

21
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:30,901
I throw the ball, and the pins are like bowling pins

22
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,111
All fly out

23
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,781
Looking back, I really was...

24
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,408
Oh, Ji Won

25
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,830
If someone steals my destiny

26
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,620
That should be you.

27
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,590
Because you will only be happy if you take my things

28
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,060
Come here soon

29
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,320
minister

30
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,370
Hello, Minister

31
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,200
Minister, are you going on a field trip?

32
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,320
Agent Yang just said you won't be coming to work today

33
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,660
Oh, yes.

34
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,580
I have something unexpected this morning.

35
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,740
So that's it

36
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,370
Jiang Zhiyuan, are you working on your project plan properly?

37
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,920
If you do it badly again this time, I really won't tolerate it.

38
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm trying to do

39
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,630
The section chief said

40
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,630
It feels like Ji Won is not working hard.

41
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,130
Our Ji-won works very hard.

42
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,390
Is this the delicious coffee?

43
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,180
Is it the one in front of the bus stop?

44
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,640
Look at you, you're lazy at work.

45
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,850
Leaving work to buy coffee during work hours

46
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,230
sorry

47
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,690
- I bought it on my way back from a field trip
- Women don't work anyway.

48
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,150
Just stuffing delicious food into your mouth...

49
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,880
-Agent Jiang
-Um?

50
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,050
Please come over here

51
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,100
Let's have coffee

52
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,150
Minister, would you like some drink?

53
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,570
I haven't drunk yet

54
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,990
Actually I didn't have breakfast

55
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,160
That’s why when I go out on a mission…

56
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,290
It's better to have breakfast

57
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,580
You drink it

58
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,250
I'm afraid you'll be embarrassed to drink coffee by yourself when you get home

59
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,670
That's why I deliberately asked you to come here to drink

60
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,300
Thanks

61
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,890
That's right

62
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,020
I don't plan to quit.

63
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,030
Do you want to see this?

64
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,990
This is what my dad gave me.

65
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,410
Every time my dad gives me pocket money

66
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,490
Draw a love heart

67
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,660
Even though I always ask him not to scribble on the money

68
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,710
But it still couldn't suppress his artistic soul

69
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,630
I am such a beloved daughter of my father

70
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,390
I plan to try hard

71
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,520
besides…

72
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,400
You said I was a capable person

73
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,360
Gave me a lot of strength
It allowed me to make up my mind, thank you.

74
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,540
Actually, it's been a long time since I last saw you.

75
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,790
I haven't been pursuing anything.

76
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,130
I'm just busy living

77
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,170
I decided not to live that kind of life anymore.

78
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,010
Good decision

79
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,270
Will you laugh?

80
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,100
I think it's the first time I saw you smile

81
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,530
Excuse me

82
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,410
Do you have any dates this weekend?

83
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,830
This weekend?

84
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,750
No

85
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,540
-So…
- I have made an appointment with Jiwon

86
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,170
We're going out together this weekend.

87
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,880
You've forgotten? That's so sad.

88
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,470
I have already made a reservation at Gusuting
That's a delicious barbecue restaurant.

89
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,020
Lonely Pavilion?

90
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,390
Yes, do you know that store?

91
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,360
I think I've heard

92
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,030
I see

93
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,280
I want to drink that delicious coffee too.

94
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,450
Let's go buy it together

95
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,290
Sorry, I'm a bit busy now

96
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,290
Why? I want to drink

97
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,210
I heard the sandwiches there are delicious too.

98
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,300
Kang Ji-won is so boring

99
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,930
The minister wanted her to work on the weekend, and I rescued her.

100
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,310
Can't you even drink a cup of coffee with me?

101
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,230
A model student who only knows how to work

102
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,270
So annoying

103
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,380
(Employee Search)

104
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,500
(Kang Ji-won)

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,050
(Name: Jiang Zhiyuan)

106
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,970
(Taeha High School, Korea University)

107
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,470
Hello? Is this Guseting?

108
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,560
I would like to inquire about group reservations for this Sunday

109
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,140
Busan Taeha High School Reunion, 6 o'clock...

110
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,310
Oh, is it half past five?

111
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,480
(Zhao Dongshuo)

112
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,200
Hello? Dongshuo

113
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,030
Can you help me find someone?

114
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,580
Yes, now

115
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,210
I'll call you back later

116
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,800
Minister, this is for you.

117
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,720
(Pain Relief)

118
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,390
This is a painkiller

119
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,680
I heard it's best to take it whenever you feel a little pain.

120
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,690
Have you eaten?

121
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,480
Your injury should hurt.

122
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,570
Oh, I'm fine.

123
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,320
You're well prepared, but take care of yourself first

124
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,780
You probably need this more than I do.

125
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,260
Thanks

126
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,530
Come out for a while

127
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,620
I must let Jung Soo Min steal my destiny

128
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
Wouldn’t you…

129
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,110
It's because of Liu Zhihe
Are you saying you want to break up with me?

130
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,780
What?

131
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,990
Liu Zhihe became a minister at a young age

132
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,030
You seem to think he has some background.

133
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,740
You only know one thing but not the other.
Half-witted vixen

134
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,290
I said that men should be judged by appearance and brains

135
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,370
Do you know?

136
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,170
What does that expression of yours mean?

137
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,630
You don’t have anything going on with Liu Zhihe, do you?

138
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,220
Minister, I'm sorry.

139
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,640
You are here because the minister asked me to buy an OK bandaid
That's why it's like this?

140
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,140
Did that guy ask you to buy a Band-Aid?

141
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,350
That crazy old man

142
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,480
He actually wants you, a person with an injured foot, to buy it?

143
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,980
I can't stand it

144
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,610
I will break up

145
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,160
Because I feel that between us
It doesn't seem to be the same as before

146
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,250
I don't know

147
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,830
I don't want to say it out loud

148
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,250
What is this?

149
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:55,050
You think I'm a little cold
Are you throwing a tantrum?

150
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,340
Um

151
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,640
I want a relationship that everyone admires

152
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,430
I hope you are that kind of

153
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,350
The kind that others would want to steal

154
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,060
Excellent boyfriend

155
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,730
What?

156
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,230
What does it matter what other people think?
It's enough that we are sincere to each other

157
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,160
Kang Ji-won, you little guy

158
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,820
I thought you were stupid, but it seems you are not.

159
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,540
Okay

160
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,040
I'll pay more attention

161
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,040
Let's reconcile.

162
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,710
-good
-Um

163
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,630
What? What are you doing?

164
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,710
Let's reconcile

165
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,340
Why in the company?

166
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,470
It's okay, no one will come.

167
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,970
-Yes
-Won't

168
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,350
Wait, there's a phone call.

169
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,850
It's my mom. She called and asked me to take medicine.

170
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,690
This won't work.

171
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,740
Oh, yeah

172
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,580
I untie this

173
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,010
I…

174
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,510
I know it's none of my business

175
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,810
But even if they are couples

176
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:32,310
You shouldn't force intimacy.

177
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,690
that…

178
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,900
I just remember that I used to

179
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,070
I regret it

180
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,280
You are a smart person

181
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,240
Don't make the wrong choice like me.

182
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,340
Did she come here specially because she was worried about me?

183
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,050
It's lunch time

184
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,600
Let's go eat

185
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,140
Agent Yang

186
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,930
Have you made a restaurant reservation?

187
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,280
Honey, what shall we eat?

188
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,860
I want to eat curry

189
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,280
Let's go to an Indian restaurant.

190
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,410
Sorry, I'm poor lately.

191
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,200
And today the meal in the staff cafeteria is spicy fried pork

192
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,500
Minhwan, why don't you take Xiumin out to eat curry?

193
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,590
No, if you want spicy fried pork

194
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,050
Then I will also eat at the staff restaurant today

195
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,130
Oh well

196
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,180
Then let's go to the staff restaurant.

197
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,150
Thanks, my other half

198
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,330
for you

199
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,090
It's not that I don't know

200
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,510
As long as it doesn't suit your taste, you will be scheming

201
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,310
Let's sit there.

202
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,150
Oh, really, you should be careful too.

203
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,320
Ji Won, are you okay?

204
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,530
Ji Won, are you okay?

205
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,030
what to do?

206
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,530
The reason why I endure

207
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,950
Because I thought you were my only friend

208
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,040
-sorry
- You should have avoided it, but you got splashed

209
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,870
what to do?

210
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,380
Let's sit there.

211
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,350
Ouch

212
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,900
hateful

213
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,940
Damn

214
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,780
Oh god, I'm sorry.

215
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,200
How are you?

216
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,820
sorry

217
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,620
Xiumin, I'm sorry.

218
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,660
Did you trip over my feet?

219
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,540
Honey

220
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,500
-Are you hurt?
- Really

221
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,380
Isn't this your favorite shirt?

222
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,510
Ossendic?

223
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,970
The whole thing is ruined

224
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,350
what to do?

225
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,930
Give me a napkin

226
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,100
Oh, napkins, ok

227
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,020
I won't be bullied anymore.

228
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,770
Excuse me

229
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,570
Is there anyone outside?

230
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,860
Are you calling me?

231
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,490
right…

232
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,660
Excuse me

233
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,620
Can you help me?

234
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,580
Do you need sanitary napkins?

235
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,660
right…

236
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,750
right

237
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,790
Please wait a moment. I'll get it for you.

238
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,590
Thank you, thank you so much.

239
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,840
Thank you so much

240
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,850
I just want to know who is this great benefactor

241
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,390
The one who saved my life, I didn't expect it was someone I knew

242
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,560
I will definitely treat you well once

243
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,730
No need to entertain, it's nothing.

244
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,240
Xiyan, don't move yet.

245
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,780
Excuse me

246
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,490
really

247
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,760
alright

248
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,640
How can you be so nice?

249
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,390
You are the one I thought didn't exist in this era
The Good Samaritan

250
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Kind people who only exist in movies

251
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,190
And you are the light and salt of my life
My real savior

252
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,070
Is this your personality?

253
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,360
God

254
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,870
You look so pretty when you smile

255
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,990
Why don’t I know this?

256
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,910
Beautiful and kind

257
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,250
You are truly the best person in the world.

258
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,790
You are really exaggerating.

259
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,050
Others will surely do the same.

260
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,260
No, it's not.

261
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,510
There was another person who came in before you.

262
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,470
I really begged her.

263
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,310
But she just kept mumbling

264
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,770
I went to the toilet, washed my hands and left.

265
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,520
Thanks, my other half

266
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,070
Excuse me, have you eaten yet?

267
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,660
I haven't eaten yet

268
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,280
I came to eat without any preparation

269
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,160
The result was a crisis.

270
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,500
Yes

271
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,420
Looking back
We haven't had dinner together.

272
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,670
If possible, would you like to eat together?

273
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,680
You said you were going to get a napkin.

274
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,900
But he never came back, so I wondered what happened.

275
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,150
She's in an emergency, too.

276
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,150
What's going on?

277
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,160
Anyway

278
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,660
We've taken care of it ourselves

279
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,950
Very well handled

280
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,040
Is this handled well?

281
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,040
Park Min-hwan must be furious

282
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,670
He begged me for a year to buy him that shirt

283
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,800
I'm really sorry, Agent Park.

284
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,510
I'll buy you a new shirt

285
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,180
No

286
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,850
It's just a shirt.

287
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,220
You don't need to care

288
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,060
Isn't that a famous brand?

289
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,650
Shouldn't it be 1.5 million or 1.8 million won?

290
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,780
Not that expensive, probably around 1.2 million won

291
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,450
-Um…
-what to do?

292
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,820
I'm just a contractor, I don't have much money.

293
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,540
It's okay, don't worry about it, just eat.

294
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,250
Is it really okay?

295
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,170
As expected, he is Agent Park, very capable

296
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,260
-Super strong
-You're great too

297
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,050
I should go buy a shirt.

298
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,560
Eat, everyone. I have a lot of shirts at home.

299
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,180
Your heart is as broad as the sea

300
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,770
Today I was planning to try the spicy fried pork
It smells so good.

301
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,560
Agent Park is the best

302
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,000
(Weite Western Restaurant)

303
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,710
Always be careful with fire

304
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,210
Chop some more onions

305
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,510
Very good, continue

306
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,840
Hey, this is burnt.

307
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,140
If you leave it alone, it will burn. Redo it.

308
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,870
Thank you for visiting

309
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:08,950
The food is so delicious

310
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Thanks

311
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,600
Chef Baek Eun-ho

312
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,680
yes

313
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,980
You graduated from Busan Taeha High School, right?

314
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,020
Yes, what's up?

315
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,200
Xiyan, you are really good at eating.

316
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,540
yes

317
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,250
Why do girls eat so much?

318
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,540
Whether male or female

319
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,080
To do great things, you must definitely eat more

320
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,040
This is what my grandfather taught me.

321
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,510
So did your grandfather do something big?

322
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,430
He is selling bean sprouts.

323
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,930
And tofu and sauce

324
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,640
It turns out that he runs a small vegetable shop.

325
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,350
Xiyan, you are blessed by your grandfather
That's why it's so energetic

326
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,520
Koreans just want to eat rice

327
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,480
Yes, well said.

328
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,070
I'm a picky eater, it's too bad

329
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,410
How are you supposed to work if you only eat that?

330
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,740
You eat too little

331
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,530
That is to say

332
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,620
I should be able to eat like Jiwon

333
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,080
Looking back

334
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,580
Ji-won has never had indigestion since she was a child.

335
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,080
Her digestive ability is so good that she can even eat steel.

336
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,420
-Isn't that right? Jiwon
-Um

337
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,090
Is that really the case?

338
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,890
I remember I used to eat pork soup rice with her

339
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,430
She's just like an uncle.

340
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,470
Eat generously

341
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,020
You uncle

342
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,480
Min-hwan, you can't say that.

343
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,270
No matter what, you have to love our Ji Won

344
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,560
like

345
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,650
Yes, love is important.

346
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,400
I envy you for having such a good friend.

347
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,660
Yes, Xiumin is so great.

348
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,990
Why are there no men...

349
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,580
Agent Jiang, let me pour you a glass of water

350
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,290
- Help me pour it too
-What? Why would I?

351
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,500
You have to pour water anyway.

352
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,300
- Help me too...
- You come to work in the company anyway

353
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,800
Would you like to help me with my work too?

354
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,050
this…

355
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,890
that…

356
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,560
That woman is so young, how dare she do that?

357
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,140
Don't call that woman.

358
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,440
This is the company

359
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,110
Although she is younger, her rank is the same as yours.

360
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,360
What?

361
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,910
oh

362
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,120
But I'll remind her.

363
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,160
Yeah, tell her.

364
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,750
Have her manners been eaten by a dog?

365
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,040
Min-hwan, you should finish eating with Soo-min before going upstairs.

366
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,920
You know she's a picky eater.

367
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,090
Ignore her, she doesn't eat much.

368
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,300
Very different from me

369
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,800
Yeah, okay

370
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,800
See you later

371
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,980
Hee-yeon, I'm sorry.

372
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,320
I recycled the plates for you.
You feel very unhappy, right?

373
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,950
Sorry, I should have held back.

374
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,660
I knew it as soon as I saw it

375
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,120
The person who just ignored me in the bathroom

376
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,370
It's Zheng Xiumin

377
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,960
Excuse me, the person who just came in

378
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,090
Could you please do me a favor?

379
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:54,430
I am not ready yet, I need help from others

380
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,470
It's troublesome

381
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,110
After our meeting, shall we go for coffee?

382
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,570
- It's my treat
- I said I'd like to invite you

383
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,160
Ji Won seems angry

384
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,250
Because I ruined your shirt

385
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,170
Ouch

386
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,210
You also know that Ji Won is not that kind of person

387
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,380
Just now she was worried that you ate too little

388
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,880
She usually cares about you very much.

389
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,050
Is this really the case?

390
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,390
Ji Won is so ruthless sometimes

391
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,440
I don't know how much I like her.

392
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,480
Ouch

393
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,110
It doesn't matter.

394
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,450
- Come in
- I want a ride too

395
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,700
Ouch

396
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,540
My hand...

397
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,420
Oh, okay

398
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,260
this…

399
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,680
What should I do?

400
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,640
Well, that...

401
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,820
No, no.

402
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,530
Excuse me

403
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,150
Sorry, can you lend me this?

404
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
You use

405
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,450
What perfume?

406
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,080
This is...

407
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,210
Good smell

408
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,540
Yeah, yeah

409
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,520
（Conference Room）

410
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,480
-for you
-Thanks

411
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
good

412
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,440
What are you doing?

413
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,730
What?

414
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,990
Chief, those are the meeting materials.

415
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,320
Didn't I tell you not to do that?

416
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,950
Um?

417
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,910
To be honest

418
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,620
I don't even need to read the business plan you wrote to know it's terrible

419
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,040
At least be sincere.

420
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:33,540
Will the atmosphere of the meeting be good?

421
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,760
Do you think this makes sense?

422
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,180
- You guys tell me
-Once a person becomes incompetent

423
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,850
They only make a big fuss about the little things they know

424
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,560
Oh, it does feel a bit insincere.

425
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,020
Hee-yeon, the staple

426
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,520
Be like this

427
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,230
Slanting nails

428
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,270
Staples?

429
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,230
That's right

430
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
Xiumin is really sensible

431
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,700
All reprints and repins

432
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,530
All?

433
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:09,370
This seems to waste a lot of paper.

434
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,630
I want you to realize

435
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,790
You've wasted a few trees.

436
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,050
Section Chief

437
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,760
I think Agent Yang understands what you mean

438
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,220
Ji-won, pour the chief a cup of coffee

439
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,140
Section Chief

440
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,140
Please help me look at the business plan I wrote

441
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,020
I have to be a full-time employee.

442
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,520
Should we go out for some fresh air?

443
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,360
Is that so?

444
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,580
Agent Yang, I'm sorry.

445
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,160
Because I don't know much

446
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,000
No

447
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,500
It doesn't matter

448
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,670
This really can't go on any longer.

449
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,760
Agent Yang

450
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,680
Would you like to have a cup of coffee with me?

451
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,680
I have to do what the section chief wants me to do.

452
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,730
It will be fine in a moment

453
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:19,150
You're a bit weird.

454
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,860
Next time

455
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,240
At least please take a look at this.

456
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,910
"One-person family"

457
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,080
Isn't this the project proposal that was rejected by the section chief?

458
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,830
What do you want me to watch this for?

459
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,590
Please take a closer look

460
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,550
If you're still not free, forget it.

461
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,550
Then I'll go first

462
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,560
Scare me

463
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,770
Where did you run back from?

464
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,020
Oh, that...

465
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,480
The meeting is over, wait till I go to the bathroom
Let's go to the lounge and laze around.

466
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,780
etc.

467
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,160
Min Hwan said he had something to tell me

468
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,490
I'll find you later

469
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:14,870
(Proposal for quick-cooking meal kits in the one-person household era)

470
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,860
(Pain Relief)

471
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,670
Hee-yeon, I have something to ask.

472
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,800
Got to go back to the office.

473
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,310
So you want me to finish eating this by myself?

474
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,150
I can't just accept the benefits you give me every time, right?

475
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:28,030
So this Sunday
Do you want to go on a date with me?

476
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,030
My treat

477
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,370
Sunday?

478
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,870
You're going to date me this weekend.

479
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,330
I found a delicious barbecue restaurant.
Guse Pavilion

480
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,420
I can't seem to do it on Sunday.

481
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,420
Do you have a date?

482
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,750
I have an appointment.

483
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,880
But I don't think I'll go

484
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,470
Can I not go?

485
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,510
What is the appointment?

486
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,310
Alumni Reunion

487
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,350
Of course I have to go to the class reunion.

488
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,020
Go see First Love

489
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,270
Then feel disappointed

490
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,480
This is the way to move forward and forget the past.

491
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,030
No one knows where my first love is

492
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,690
What are you doing?

493
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,110
I was actually very unpopular in school.

494
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,540
I need to go there
Looking back on my shameful past?

495
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,580
This is more appropriate, right?

496
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,340
If you don't go, it will just be a miserable past.

497
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,970
If you change it drastically
That will become a glorious history.

498
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,570
minister

499
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,330
yes

500
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,540
You asked me if I was free on Sunday.

501
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,920
If it's urgent, I'm willing to come to work

502
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,840
Don’t you have an appointment?

503
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,510
That's right

504
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,180
But it doesn't matter, work comes first

505
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,550
I think this is right

506
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,350
You are the priority

507
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,020
that…

508
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:28,230
I'm actually wondering whether I should go or not.

509
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,280
Go ahead

510
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,070
Although I hesitated
The answer will be different every time

511
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,700
But let’s try it this time.

512
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,450
You can go

513
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,160
Just remember that you owe me a favor.

514
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:45,790
What?

515
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,440
(Basic nutritional information of quick-cooking food packs)

516
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,940
Please take a closer look

517
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,860
If you're still not free, forget it.

518
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:15,610
Very well written

519
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Agent Yang

520
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,330
Have you seen it?

521
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,790
Um

522
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,710
I have seen

523
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:28,920
very nice

524
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,090
Do you want to do it with me?

525
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:43,180
That's not how things work in the company

526
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,730
The section chief has a different point of view from us...

527
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,600
That person has not seen

528
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,520
-What?
- I saw

529
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,360
He pretended to read

530
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,030
But it's just for show

531
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,950
Not just this time

532
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,290
Including your report.

533
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,330
He vetoed everything.

534
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,590
This is something everyone knows.

535
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,520
Look at him, he's really outrageous.

536
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,890
Because he thought that was power.

537
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,900
Impossible

538
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,110
If you are controlled by emotions for too long, you will lose your objectivity

539
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,820
Regardless of other

540
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,780
Regardless of the section chief's opinion

541
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,580
What do you think?

542
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,870
Do you really think my proposal
Is that outrageous? Really?

543
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,590
Then I'll discuss it with the section chief.

544
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,470
Section Chief Kim Kyung-wook…

545
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,700
She's really annoying lately.

546
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,950
Scare me

547
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,500
Section Chief

548
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,540
Excuse me, have you had lunch?

549
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,750
The beautiful Xiumin in our group

550
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,000
I ate loach soup to nourish my body

551
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,800
What about you?

552
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,050
I had spicy fried pork in the staff cafeteria

553
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,760
It seems delicious.

554
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,430
Say

555
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:52,100
I have a secret to tell you.

556
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,230
secret?

557
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,070
You know I want a full-time job.

558
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:02,320
I have an idea, but I can't figure it out.

559
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,870
Of course I'll help you.

560
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,120
Really?

561
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,540
Thank you so much

562
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,250
No

563
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,460
Our group is
The yellow-faced woman and the ugly one who doesn't look like a woman

564
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,090
Because of the low mood in our group

565
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,010
We really need you to become a full-time employee.

566
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,090
The section chief is really

567
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,970
You are so humorous

568
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,810
You know he does whatever he wants.

569
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,770
So he always opposes what you say

570
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:42,070
Ever since he pursued you and was rejected

571
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,320
What are you talking about? That's too childish.

572
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:51,410
Jin Jingxu for seven years
I have been doing such childish things.

573
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,420
I know he can become a section chief.

574
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,500
Because he took your project plan

575
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,840
Submit it under your own name

576
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,300
As he did before

577
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,510
He used my business plan to get Zheng Xiumin a full-time job

578
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,300
He is my predecessor

579
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:11,720
In the company, people would always give away things made by their subordinates.
Use the name of your superior...

580
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,680
You never did that.

581
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,560
I am very confident in this plan

582
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:23,150
You know this is a good plan.

583
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,780
But the Chief...

584
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,790
On Monday I will submit the rejected proposals

585
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,830
Submit it again without changing the title

586
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,120
What?

587
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:38,210
Wait until you are sure he has not seen it before vetoing it.

588
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,840
Then…

589
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,250
Would you like to work with me?

590
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,990
I'm 100% sure he didn't see it.

591
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,240
No, maybe 99%?

592
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,080
I'm sure Kim Kyung-wook didn't read the project proposal

593
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,330
But if he remembers a chart or a picture...

(The Love Bible)

595
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,630
Don't be afraid, I'm right.

596
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:30,470
I know how lazy he is and how he doesn't do anything.

597
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,820
Chief, please take a look.

598
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,150
This is a new project

599
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,010
(Proposal for quick-cooking meal kits in the one-person household era)

600
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,230

（Nutrition Information）

604
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,530
Are you kidding me?

605
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,070
This is the same as what you gave me last time...

606
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,620
I'm speechless

607
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,040
This is the same as what you gave me last time...

608
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,210
It's worse than before!

609
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,090
I am this person

610
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:53,130
It's not that I haven't seen people who can't do things.
But this is the first time I see someone like you

611
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,100
How could you be so bad?

612
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,810
This is obviously cutting and pasting information from everywhere

613
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:03,310
If you don't want to work, don't do it.
Why do you want to torture me?

614
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,700
Chief, I'm really sorry.

615
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,610
This is the same one as last time.

616
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,660
I got the wrong one. Please wait.

617
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,000
This one is right, the green one

618
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,500
I'm sorry, Chief. I'm so sorry.

619
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:33,340
What? Didn't he realize that he had seen it?

620
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,300
Exaggeration, he really didn't do anything

621
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,390
It really lives up to its reputation

622
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,290
I didn't quite believe it.
He actually didn't know

623
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,710
The title is exactly the same, how could he not know?

624
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,420
I said he wasn't working.

625
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,090
Now we are the same team

626
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,380
Quick cooking packs will definitely be popular

627
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,640
Providing consumers with fast, simple and delicious food

628
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,430
good

629
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,190
Now I finally know why everything goes wrong for me

630
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,770
I can't believe it.

631
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:30,570
I've been working for this guy.

632
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,900
Are you two the only ones drinking coffee?

633
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,620
cheers

634
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,950
Chief Jin is exaggerating, how could he not know?

635
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,010
"Quick cooking meal for one person"

636
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,060

(Basic nutritional information of quick-cooking food packs)

638
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:16,490
cheers

639
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,570
Why did you ask me out after get off work?

640
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,370
To tell you the secret I told you today.

641
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,460
The word secret

642
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,960
It's really exciting

643
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,550
Is it okay to eat pork belly?

644
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,680
Oh, that's right.

645
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
Did you say you had spicy fried pork for lunch?

646
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:46,020
Eating pork for two consecutive meals

647
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,600
Isn't this a bit bad?

648
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,520
Won't

649
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,900
I prefer Korean pork to Korean beef

650
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,400
You really know how to eat

651
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,480
(Pork: Imported)

652
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,730
Xiumin, you are such a nice girl

653
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,150
I'm not

654
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,740
The really nice girl is Ji Won

655
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:06,910
All I talk about is Kang Ji-won

656
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Do you like her that much?
I really don't understand women.

657
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,290
Ji Won

658
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,090
Not like us
She graduated from a Korean university.

659
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,670
She is smart

660
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,010
and

661
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,260
Still a bit ambitious

662
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,140
What's so great about Korean universities?

663
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,640
The people who graduated there only know how to study, but they are useless.

664
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,680
The plan is full of unrealistic nonsense.

665
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,640
Ji Won probably doesn't think so.

666
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:34,810
She'll probably think you don't know talent.

667
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,440
No vision

668
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:38,780
You say I have no vision?

669
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:46,280
I think you have an inferiority complex about your academic qualifications.

670
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,120
Don't do this

671
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,250
University?

672
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,870
It's of no use at all

673
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:52,420
No

674
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,040
I mean, her idea might be good.

675
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,050
Although execution is another matter

676
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,840
That Jiang Zhiyuan

677
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:03,890
Always so rigid

678
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,390
So that's what she thought in her heart?

679
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:12,190
By the way, the one she printed wrong today
Quick cooking meal package project

680
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,730
It's terrible, but the idea is good.

681
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,520
You bring it over here

682
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,690
Develop with me

683
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,660
It might be a big seller.

684
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:26,530
With you...

685
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,540
-Together?
-right

686
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,500
Anyway, if Zhiyuan were to do it, she would definitely not do it well.

687
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,920
If you can rely on your experience, you can grasp the direction

688
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:42,380
I think it should be OK for me to get a full-time job.

689
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:50,100
I really feel comfortable with you.

690
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:53,430
It's like I'm chatting with my brother about work.

691
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,520
She just said

692
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:00,020
Am I like a brother?

693
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,410
Of course, yes.

694
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:13,160
The boss is my brother.

695
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:15,500
Come

696
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,210
Our Xiumin

697
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:19,790
Tell me more about the project plan.

698
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,590
us

699
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,340
Let's have a drink first.

700
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,510
cheers

701
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:33,600
Brother Chief, come and have some meat.

702
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,690
Well played

703
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,610
Why is she Kang Ji-won's friend?

704
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:44,820
I can't even try.

705
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,860
What does it matter?

706
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:49,870
I think she's in love with you too.
Just make a quick deal.

707
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:53,290
What's the deal? Are you selling used goods?

708
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,410
Are you kidding?

709
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,080
All down, right?

710
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:58,290
Too strong

711
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,670
Well played!

712
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,250
Well played!

713
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,050
Shang Tsung

714
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,560
Do you know any nice girls?

715
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,850
I'm really going crazy

716
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:15,520
nerve

717
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,940
You are full of energy.

718
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,400
Where is your girlfriend?

719
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,860
Why does mentioning her make me feel cold?

720
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,980
She's just for marriage.

721
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:26,570
What is used for marriage?

722
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:28,820
Look

723
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:33,160
She is kind-hearted and frugal.

724
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:36,500
She works hard to make money but doesn't know how to spend it.

725
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,660
-how?
-Wow

726
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,120
She's the perfect wife.

727
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:42,670
She's super boring.

728
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:46,090
She will look at the company's outlook report

729
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:47,920
Have you ever seen anyone watching that kind of thing?

730
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:52,890
I guess she should be looking at materials in the company now

731
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,350
Like this

732
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:07,320
Rebirth means you can do anything

733
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:10,320
Although it's not a big deal
But I let Zheng Xiumin eat the turtle

734
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:11,660
Kim Kyung-wook too

735
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:14,530
I can do anything

736
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:48,740
These are couple earrings. You must wear them on Sunday.

737
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,650
Your everlasting love, Xiumin

738
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,530
Did you see the earrings she was wearing?

739
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:08,250
You've been so distant lately, I'm so sad

740
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,510
I'm not saying this because I'm drunk

741
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,130
I'm going to sleep at your house tonight.

742
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,800
We spent the weekend together and went to Guse Pavilion on Sunday

743
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,310
(Guse Pavilion)

744
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:21,770
Guse Pavilion

745
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:23,640
I am sure

746
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:30,740
(Guse Pavilion)

747
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,750
(Busan Taeha High School, 37th Reunion)

748
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,960
She really came

749
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,050
Ji Won!

750
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,880
Jiwon, you're here?

751
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,090
Let's go in quickly

752
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,180
What's going on?

753
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,180
Aren’t we both going to have dinner?

754
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,140
If I said it was a class reunion, you definitely wouldn't come

755
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,770
We are all over 30, let's forget the past

756
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:08,400
They are all very nice people.

757
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,110
- Let's go
- Xiumin, I...

758
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,230
It's okay.

759
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:22,160
I'm leaving, help me with my bag

760
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,540
Kang Ji-won is really amazing

761
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,000
No one who is familiar with her dares to come

762
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,460
She must be here to eat meat.

763
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,090
Looking at her dress, she looks very poor.

764
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:34,630
Why are you speaking in Seoul accent all of a sudden? So corny

765
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:38,470
By the way, why is she still playing with Xiumin?

766
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:40,100
Can't you tell it at a glance?

767
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,430
Xiumin, that innocent child, is so kind to her.

768
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,100
If Xiumin wasn't here, she wouldn't even have any barbecue to eat.

769
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:48,810
Drink milk!

770
00:51:58,450 --> 00:51:59,530
Don't be like this.

771
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:10,590
Zheng Xiumin is so kind

772
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,380
We should take care of her.

773
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,010
Did you see the earrings she was wearing?

774
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,630
She should have learned how to wear it from Xiumin

775
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,340
You can tell it's a fake from 500 meters away.

776
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,100
When Jiang Zhiyuan was in high school...

777
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,430
Wisdom, etc.

778
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,680
What's wrong?

779
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:29,060
Jiang Zhiyuan was not at her seat just now

780
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,930
Hello, have you been here all the time?

781
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,720
Why are you pretending not to be there?

782
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:09,980
You are really insidious.

783
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,320
I won't go there

784
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,240
No, don't come over. Today I...

785
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,910
I'm going to your house today

786
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:28,620
After a drink, I want to see my lover

787
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,210
I'll be there in an hour

788
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,590
Do these two people think my home is a hotel?

789
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:38,760
them…

790
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,340
etc.

791
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,140
All right

792
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,640
There's no need to wait for something that's going to happen anyway.

793
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,560
You two love each other to death

794
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,440
I will help you get results quickly.

795
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:25,140
You go this way.

796
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,470
Thanks

797
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,520
Are you just getting off work now?

798
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,690
Yes, you just came back now?

799
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:37,860
I have something to do.

800
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,320
You've worked hard. I'll take my leave now.

801
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,450
etc.

802
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:56,750
This one?

803
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,550
This is the gift I received

804
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,300
That is...

805
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,720
Counterfeit goods

806
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,560
Those who understand will know it at a glance

807
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,740
That is...

808
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,530
Counterfeit goods

809
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,290
Those who understand will know it at a glance

810
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,540
Are you talking about me?

811
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,080
What's the meaning?

812
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,000
It's better not to wear it

813
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,010
It's better not to wear it

814
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,260
I remember

815
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:49,600
He's said the same thing to me before.
I think he's being disrespectful.

816
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:54,390
Because I didn't know to go to the class reunion
What kind of humiliation will I suffer?

817
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,770
That's a gift from my friend.
Of course I think it's bad for him to say that.

818
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:01,480
sorry

819
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:02,980
no

820
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:04,940
Thank you

821
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:10,870
Do you want me to take you home?

822
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:12,660
What?

823
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,500
Because it's late

824
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,500
Oh, no thanks

825
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,540
There are also buses available, which will arrive soon.

826
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,670
I want to take you back

827
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:29,640
Thank you for your kindness

828
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,140
I have a date with my boyfriend

829
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,190
goodbye

830
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,540
Thanks, no need to look for it

831
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,920
What?

832
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,710
I was working overtime. I'll be back soon.

833
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,550
She is rushing back in the middle of working overtime?

834
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:12,510
Right, she is also a human being. She will definitely be hungry if she hasn’t eaten for too long.

835
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,560
There's beer in the fridge, have another one and wait for me

836
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,890
It's incredible

837
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,480
Jiang Zhiyuan, you are dead today

838
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:27,070
(whisky)

839
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,200
Will you get drunk if you drink this?

840
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,370
I love you, my other half

841
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:37,910
Be gentle with me

842
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,910
I love you, I said I like you

843
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:53,140
"Come quickly"?

844
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:56,810
There's not even an emoji, so cold

845
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,930
It's really too much

846
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:01,770
I'm not going

847
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:02,850
I'm not going anymore

848
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:21,790
You make my heart go up and down

849
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:29,090
Jiang Zhiyuan, you are dead today

850
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,380
How come he got here so quickly?

851
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,850
I'm not going, I'm not happy, I want to go home

852
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,270
I'm a little sad

853
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,020
What? Why isn't she here?

854
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:56,410
Honey, you're back.

855
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:03,960
You're here soon.

856
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,080
I thought you would be here in a while.

857
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,920
I'm eager to spend a hot night with you

858
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:11,630
So I took a taxi.

859
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,550
There's no need to do this.

860
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,510
us

861
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,140
Long time

862
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:24,310
there is none left

863
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:25,850
Right?

864
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:28,940
It's been a long time.

865
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,940
So we should talk...

866
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:35,240
Wanna chat?

867
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,280
Talk with your body

868
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:42,290
Let's put the clothes...

869
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:46,920
Now

870
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,790
us

871
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,130
unnecessary

872
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,710
Clothes

873
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:03,970
Come

874
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,310
Don't move

875
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,630
It suits you very well and looks good.

876
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:34,630
Turning the shameful past into a glorious history

877
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:37,840
People like me
It's not something that can change overnight.

878
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,510
I was bullied before.

879
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:43,850
She forgot how bad she was.

880
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,520
Fortunately, I met you, Agent Park

881
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:49,850
I'm coming, behind you

882
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:52,980
I used to like you!

883
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,110
I have someone I like.

884
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:57,530
Which woman did he fall in love with to do that?

885
01:00:58,070 --> 01:00:59,110
Go and ask around

886
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,330
