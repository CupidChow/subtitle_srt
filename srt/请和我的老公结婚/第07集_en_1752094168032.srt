1
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,390
Don't scribble on money.

2
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,850
She'll die anyway.

3
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,190
- What should we do? - Just be quiet.

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,320
With my husband

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,160
Get married

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,080
Should Park Min switch and marry Jung Soo Min?

7
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,710
right

8
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,590
otherwise

9
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,300
I will marry Park Min-hwan

10
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,680
Get cancer

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,520
Then she died at the hands of her best friend and husband.

12
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,020
What is supposed to happen will eventually happen

13
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,030
Don't you know anything at all?

14
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,990
I don't know, maybe I didn't change anything.

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,410
Probably only one or two

16
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,080
For example, in order to clear up the misunderstanding, Bai Enhao was asked to attend the class reunion.

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,590
Oh, that's why Eun-ho went to the class reunion

18
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,340
But how do you know what happened in Guse Pavilion?

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,970
because…

20
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,480
I went to the funeral.

21
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:35,114
My funeral

22
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,332
What about my funeral?

23
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,007
Kang Ji-won

24
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,634
Very sad

25
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,850
Many people...

26
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,850
Feeling Regret

27
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,270
Deception

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,150
I can imagine it without seeing it

29
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,150
No one will be sad

30
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,660
No one will regret it

31
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,040
Everyone just thinks someone died.

32
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,960
"Yes, there was this person

33
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,790
Not now.”

34
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,550
That's about it.

35
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,430
Should we talk somewhere else?

36
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,350
It'll probably take a long time.

37
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,910
This is his home, right?

38
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,670
Aren't you getting off the bus?

39
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,960
Oh, okay

40
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,770
Come in

41
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,870
Can't

42
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,830
- No. - You can put it down.

43
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,290
I like cats

44
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,550
It doesn't like people very much

45
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,050
Harrow

46
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,840
I thought it didn't like

47
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,050
You are so cute

48
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,430
Would you like some tea?

49
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,350
I have all kinds of tea and also coffee

50
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,060
Everything is good

51
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,980
I get along really well with Cheese Tabby.

52
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,070
So cute

53
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,880
Can't avoid it?

54
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,250
What will happen if you avoid it?

55
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,180
For example, if you break up with Park Min-hwan or break up with Jung Soo-min

56
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,010
I tried

57
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,140
But…

58
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,310
Park Min-hwan is the kind of person who gets mad when I tell him to break up

59
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,980
I think I might die ten years earlier.

60
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,070
What if you escape to a place where he can't find you?

61
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,780
I was planning to do that.

62
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,740
When I first came back, I was scared of everything

63
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,500
I didn't think much, I just wanted to escape to somewhere else.

64
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,040
But reality does not allow

65
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,340
To be able to shake your head and leave

66
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,210
Must have certain financial support

67
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,970
You can run away now, and I can help you

68
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,340
yes

69
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,970
But I learned

70
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,850
Even if I run, I can't escape

71
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,360
You see, I have a scar here.

72
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,490
I was scalded by the kettle.

73
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,200
You got hurt instead of me.

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,920
The shape of this scar is exactly the same as the one I had before.

75
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,020
If I hadn't been injured

76
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,150
final…

77
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,440
Will you get hurt?

78
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,700
right

79
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,500
It's not a matter of escaping.

80
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,460
What is supposed to happen will eventually happen

81
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,210
Unless I leave my fate to others

82
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,050
Scars will be scars

83
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,300
Marriage is marriage

84
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,850
die…

85
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,770
It will be death

86
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,820
So I'm not going to run away

87
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,630
Kang Ji-won

88
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,030
Taxi, empty

89
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,800
Normally, even if someone calls for a taxi, I won't come here.

90
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,180
I didn't expect this kind of fate

91
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,060
I was planning to leave work.

92
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,810
But it just feels right.

93
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,100
Thanks

94
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,030
It seems you lost something precious.

95
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,320
I don't even know if it's precious

96
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,330
We are just a passing relationship

97
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,080
OMG

98
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,120
Why are you doing this?

99
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,000
A man should have courage

100
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,880
Even if I die, I will see the result

101
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I should have done that earlier.

102
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,260
I'm regretting

103
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,720
I seem to have had a few chances.

104
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,520
Why did you miss it?

105
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,390
Sometimes I don't know it's an opportunity

106
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,730
Sometimes I think I can't do that

107
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,240
Actually, I don’t know

108
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,570
I just recently figured out what I was thinking.

109
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,950
I'm just living

110
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,420
Suddenly I heard the news of her death.

111
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,470
If you were given another chance, what would you do?

112
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,390
There won't be a chance.

113
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,560
I mean if there is

114
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,940
Will you seize the opportunity?

115
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,820
You had several chances that you missed.

116
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,400
Maybe you don't grasp it.

117
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,450
Maybe you think you shouldn't do that.

118
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,200
I…

119
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,910
So don't regret it

120
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,790
I think you make decisions for a reason.

121
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,840
Otherwise...

122
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,710
Will you really take the chance?

123
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,790
Maybe it sounds stupid.

124
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,750
But I really didn’t know before, my own feelings

125
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,550
If I had known, I would have protected her.

126
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,510
So if I had the chance

127
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,110
I will definitely catch

128
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,030
How did you come back?

129
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,780
I thought I was dead

130
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,160
But when I opened my eyes, it was 2013

131
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,220
I fall asleep and wake up

132
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,510
It's 2013

133
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,820
Episode 7

134
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,080
The marketing team seems to be finished.

135
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,830
In this case, I hope that the quick cooking package can be replaced by us

136
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,960
Yeon-ji's father

137
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,420
Treat other people's misfortune as...

138
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Hello?

139
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:22,090
I have an interview at 7 o'clock, so I can't take Yanzhi to the cram school.

140
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,970
You should be more sincere when you lie.

141
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,600
What company would interview at 7pm?

142
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,640
Don't you know everything?

143
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,350
I said it's like this

144
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,770
I heard that your company’s case also failed?

145
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,650
dad

146
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,990
what?

147
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,700
Haven't you sent Yanzhi to the nursery yet?

148
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,700
I don't know. I'm hanging up.

149
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,500
how?

150
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,380
Would you like to work with me?

151
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,210
Or should I take you away?

152
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,840
Frankly speaking, if it weren't for me

153
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,930
Will it be you or Kang Ji-won who will become the section chief based on this project?

154
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,850
Why is my life like this?

155
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,290
U&K Jeju Human Resources Development Institute

156
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,970
I personally really hate your type.

157
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,220
The most beautiful beauty

158
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,280
what?

159
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,470
Head of Human Resources

160
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,100
Isn't he the head of the strategic planning department, directly under the chairman?

161
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,730
- If he comes, there will be bloodshed. - Yes.

162
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,320
What is going on?

163
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,410
Liu Zhihe Marketing Director

164
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,750
Long heard of your name

165
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,050
Has the director been transferred to the Personnel Department?

166
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,850
I am a salaried employee. If the president wants me to come, I have to come.

167
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,930
This is not a personnel change for official business, but a family matter...

168
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,480
In U&K, the president…

169
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,400
You can do whatever you want

170
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,610
Whether it is for business or family matters

171
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,950
You think...

172
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,330
Is it true that the president can't do anything?

173
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,000
I didn't expect he would send you here.

174
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,090
Personnel record card, Kang Ji-won

175
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,340
I didn't expect you to like this type

176
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,180
I mean I was surprised.

177
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,840
Your preferences are more ordinary than I thought.

178
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,760
She is not...

179
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,720
Ordinary People

180
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,680
Maybe

181
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,600
After all, she has been in a public relationship for seven years.

182
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,020
But he developed a delicate relationship with his boss

183
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,270
that…

184
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,230
After get off work yesterday, you went back to your residence in Cheongdam-dong with her.

185
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,820
Are you working overtime too?

186
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,860
Are you still following me?

187
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,450
If necessary, you have to do this

188
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,200
You will do the same

189
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,330
Although you don't need it yet, you are a person who can do anything

190
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,870
There will definitely be times when you want to do this.

191
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,170
Are you planning to hand over the quick-cooking meal package project to Kang Ji-won?

192
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,140
So this personnel decision was made after a rather inappropriate night.

193
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,600
Liu Zhihe Marketing Director

194
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,270
This case will be investigated further by the Personnel Department

195
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,310
When you are not swayed by provocative public opinion

196
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,980
Don't be deceived by women. From a very objective perspective

197
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,320
Before making a judgment, it seems inappropriate for Kang Ji-won to take charge of this project.

198
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,950
We have to consider that she is also a party to the incident, etc.

199
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,950
Before rewards and punishments are determined

200
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,090
It would be better to let Yang Zhulan take charge

201
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,050
Personnel record card, Yang Zhulan

202
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,800
Agent Jiang Zhiyuan can be a member of the team

203
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,450
If you can not be influenced by public opinion and not be deceived by women

204
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,370
Maintain a very objective perspective

205
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,830
You will come to the conclusion that Agent Jiang Zhiyuan is very suitable to be in charge of this project

206
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,580
I mean, nothing happened last night.

207
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,800
Start now

208
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,220
The one-person household quick-cooking meal project will be restarted

209
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,930
The team leader is…

210
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,060
Yang Zhulan Agent

211
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,110
The team members are Agent Kang Ji-won, Agent Park Min-hwan and Staff Jung Soo-min

212
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,200
Report completed

213
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,630
minister

214
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,890
Agent Yang is acting as section chief. Please discuss the schedule adjustment with her.

215
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,180
You said you wanted Park Min-hwan and Jung Soo-min to get married

216
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,730
Wouldn't it be easier to put them in the same group?

217
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,980
But there are three agents in such a project

218
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,780
You know what I can do

219
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,250
I knew it would be Agent Yang.

220
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,540
congratulations

221
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,340
Am I very lucky?

222
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,970
I shouldn't have joined.

223
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,630
The Quick Cooking Pack Team is a Dream Team

224
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,010
Since this is the main project

225
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,310
This team must have been formed with long-term considerations until next year, right?

226
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,390
Is this reasonable? How can there be three agents working on one project?

227
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,900
Does this mean that I should quit?

228
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,020
That guy...is not

229
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,400
Is there something wrong with the minister?

230
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,990
This is not a decision a minister would make.

231
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,120
There must be some reason.

232
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,660
Let’s work hard.

233
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
come on

234
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,050
With this opportunity, you will be one step ahead of Liu Xiyan.

235
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,180
Please take care of me

236
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,060
Really delicious

237
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,440
How do you know I like strawberry milk?

238
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,600
I just buy what I like.

239
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,230
We are the same

240
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,070
By the way, we should go to the workshop

241
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,780
Workshop?

242
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,160
I haven't been there since I joined the company.

243
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,120
It was supposed to be held twice a year.

244
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,870
But Minister Liu is too individualistic and selfish.

245
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,290
oh

246
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,130
Really delicious

247
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,970
No, it's okay.

248
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,090
When I go to the workshop, I'll grill some delicious meat for you.

249
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,760
I'll bring a few bottles of milk.

250
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,840
Every time my dad gives me pocket money

251
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,220
Draw a love heart

252
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,340
Will you really take the chance?

253
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,930
What is supposed to happen will eventually happen

254
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,430
die

255
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,730
It will be death

256
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,460
I just started working here today.

257
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,750
If you're looking for me, that's a bit scary.

258
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,800
If it's by chance, it feels like fate

259
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,890
Do you know Dynamite?

260
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,230
Do you mean the bomb invented by Nobel?

261
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,860
What about "Haruhi"?

262
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,960
As far as I know, the period from March to May is called spring.

263
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,670
Although I don't know what else I need to know

264
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,010
May your life be smooth, long and happy.

265
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,050
congratulations

266
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,510
I mean you still have a lot of time left.

267
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,480
Open

268
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,110
Resting

269
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,280
Chef

270
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,360
I'm going back

271
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,740
-Okay, you've worked hard, go back. -Okay

272
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,250
elder brother

273
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,300
minister

274
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,470
Minister Liu, you can't sleep here, Mr. Liu Zhihe

275
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,510
Hello

276
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,430
Oh, yeah

277
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,930
Hello

278
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,350
I pressed his call button and the call was dialed to you.

279
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,690
oh

280
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,190
I guess it's because I called him like crazy, so my number is at the top

281
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,820
This crazy friend of household registration and my boss

282
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,740
After he kicked me out of our group, I couldn't contact him for the whole day.

283
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,160
But I don't know why he drank and lay here.

284
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,330
He's never been like this

285
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,330
Could it be puberty...

286
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,830
Or is middle age coming?

287
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,880
Who sent such an excellent cake?

288
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,550
This is what love is all about

289
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,720
- What? - It means delicious.

290
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,550
Is that so?

291
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,100
Hey, cutie, wake up.

292
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,310
Please ask

293
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,980
Do you know Kang Ji Won?

294
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,690
Um?

295
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,280
Oh, Werther

296
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,650
Using goats running in New Zealand, and beloved husband

297
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,160
Are you the one who made Basque cheesecake using goat milk squeezed out after giving birth to your second baby?

298
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,040
Oh my god

299
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,090
It's really delicious

300
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,170
Thanks

301
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,390
You know what I can do

302
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,820
Minister Liu Zhihe

303
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,920
The number you dialed cannot be answered...

304
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,840
Dried pollack soup?

305
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,000
Because you were carried back by Xiyan yesterday

306
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,840
Come together and drink on an empty stomach

307
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,930
Thanks

308
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,930
The president is looking for you

309
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,990
The wine you drank was really good.

310
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,910
You should have rinsed your mouth, the smell of alcohol is still strong

311
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,500
There is no bad wine in this house.

312
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,800
Yura handled Wang Chang's affairs very well

313
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,180
Very capable

314
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,220
Oh Yoo-ra, Vice President of Cloud Airlines

315
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,890
I heard that you and Li Shichang had a big fight.

316
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:04,850
Nothing

317
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,690
Of course there is, even though Director Li also said there is no

318
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,520
It seems that besides Director Li, you have other informants in the company.

319
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,900
I know you'll get rid of my eyes and ears one day

320
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,780
But Director Li can't

321
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,450
Find a way to make him yours.

322
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,330
He has such value

323
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,000
Ouch

324
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,670
I have discussed this with Wu Kangzhe.

325
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,710
You go deal with Yura

326
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:40,470
I helped Wu Kangzhe a lot before, he couldn't say anything

327
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,890
Don't you want me to marry Yu-ra?

328
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,600
What do I hope for?

329
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,400
Look at you.

330
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,570
You didn't even rebel during puberty, yet you clashed with my people?

331
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,530
The little girl carried him home

332
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,820
Start drinking again early in the morning

333
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,740
Even so

334
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,290
I won't force you to fulfill my wish.

335
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,590
I knew from the beginning that you and Yura had no intention of each other

336
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,630
But that was a promise

337
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,130
It is not polite to overturn it unilaterally

338
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,550
Especially from the male side

339
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,810
So you try to be sincere.

340
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,770
Handle it well

341
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,570
When can I see that lady?

342
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,530
Why don't you answer? You are the one who caused this problem.

343
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,540
You shouldn't see her.

344
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,290
I feel the same as you do

345
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,170
Just like you want me to be happy

346
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,680
I also hope she is happy

347
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,700
My time was over then.

348
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,130
But at least...

349
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,880
This time I can protect her.

350
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,680
Kang Ji-won

351
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,020
I won't run away

352
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,270
But I don't want to regret it anymore

353
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,990
Even if I am not in her happiness

354
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,090
Roy Gental, I should have bought it earlier.

355
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,760
When you think it's too late, you should buy it now.

356
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,010
Have you seen Roy Gental?

357
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,970
I would have bought it if I had known this earlier. I have been wanting to buy it for six months.

358
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,600
Don't look at it, I sold it four months ago

359
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,150
Because the water of the Han River is too cold, otherwise I would have jumped in a long time ago

360
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,400
Did you hear that?

361
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,070
They're saying, I sold you the Roy Gentar stock.

362
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,240
Do you know how many times it has increased?

363
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,700
At least I still have TKU, so I will continue to be with you

364
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,620
Roy Gental

365
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,800
Return rate 701%

366
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,800
Ji-won, please come out for a moment.

367
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,520
What was she looking at just now?

368
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,860
Roy Gental

369
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,830
Kang Ji-won bought this stock without Min-hwan's knowledge, right?

370
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,580
She plays dumb every time. What a cunning fox.

371
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:45,050
But why doesn't she sell it?

372
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,260
Does she think it will rise further?

373
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,100
buy

374
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,020
Didn’t I use your credit card to go to a restaurant with Xiumin last time?

375
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,230
It's nice there

376
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,440
I was thinking about you at that time

377
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,320
I really want to take you there someday.

378
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,070
And that day is today

379
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,660
Are you thinking about me?

380
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,080
My brother...

381
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,410
Always thinking of you

382
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,000
Is dinner tonight okay?

383
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,130
Say

384
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,840
Do you have money?

385
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,630
Oh, yes.

386
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,760
Didn't I give you money after I sold the red-hot Roy Jantar stock?

387
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,560
Let's use that money.

388
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,900
In this case, before getting married, I must do something with Zheng Xiumin

389
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,360
But I think I need to spend some money.

390
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,820
How could I forget?

391
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:53,570
He said he was going to some nice place, but in fact he was just trying to get something.

392
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,780
I'm really stupid.

393
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:01,000
What's wrong? Why do you say you're stupid? What did you do with the money?

394
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:06,130
I didn't tell you that I used all that money to buy insurance

395
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,590
What?

396
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:12,010
But now I can't even get half of it back if I terminate the contract

397
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:16,720
But after ten years, it can increase by 10%.

398
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,930
Hey, you idiot, are you stupid?

399
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,180
Are you possessed?

400
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,980
That's all a scam, it only benefits the insurance company

401
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,730
I thought you were so smart, you're a complete idiot

402
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,770
Damn, really.

403
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,360
Should I sell TKU?

404
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,830
The ruling and opposition party lawmakers involved in the so-called TKU list…

405
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:43,000
It seems like it will go up again, I'm going crazy

406
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,750
But I have made a lot of money

407
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,090
I'm really going crazy

408
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,170
How much do you need?

409
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,510
I have a savings account that is about to mature.

410
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,300
What savings deposit?

411
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,560
You sold Roy Gental for me, and it would be a shame if I asked you to sell TKU.

412
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,850
Um

413
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,860
Don't sell your stocks, I'll lend them to you.

414
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,110
Honey

415
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,740
Also, we're not going to dinner today.

416
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,700
Let's go somewhere else this weekend and invite Xiumin to go with us

417
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,090
Look at the sky, it's so beautiful

418
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,800
I should have worn sunglasses.

419
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,510
The weather forecast says it will be cloudy

420
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,600
But I want to go out with you, the weather should be good

421
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,930
Because you are a weather elf

422
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,680
You really know me well.

423
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,480
Jiang Zhiyuan, you should not work so hard

424
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,320
You beat the section chief and drove away the executive

425
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,690
Do you want to be a representative director of U&K?

426
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,990
Although everyone in the company praises you

427
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,610
But you're not attractive to men that way.

428
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,320
You fool

429
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:04,120
Min-hwan, in this day and age, it's bad to say something like this

430
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,330
Xiumin, have a cool beer.

431
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,470
Do you want one too?

432
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,090
I want cookies too

433
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,180
for you

434
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,360
Come to think of it, you two are really precious to me.

435
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:40,070
I have known Xiumin since junior high school.

436
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,990
Minhwan…

437
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,330
We have been dating since I entered society.

438
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,040
Our fate is incredible

439
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,750
yes

440
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,180
We are a family

441
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,760
Do you want me to push her secretly when I take her out for some fresh air?

442
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,690
You and Me

443
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,060
And Min-hwan

444
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,570
Be happy

445
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,950
Then I have to work hard.

446
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,700
Only then can the two princesses be happy, right?

447
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,960
Kang Ji-won, how is it?

448
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,500
Feeling like Park Min-hwan?

449
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,590
hateful

450
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,890
-What's wrong? -What's going on?

451
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,010
Um?

452
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,270
No, there seems to be insects

453
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,190
What? Bug? Where?

454
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,520
- That's scary. - Come here.

455
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,270
-Where's the worm? -Where?

456
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,440
I am afraid of insects

457
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:02,030
I drive it away, I come, don't come over

458
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,530
-Minhwan hyung-Are you okay?

459
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,740
There are insects

460
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,990
I'll help you catch it.

461
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,790
How are you?

462
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,000
I think of the time when we were still in a relationship.

463
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,790
You helped me drive away the bugs then, it was so cool

464
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,840
I have that?

465
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:22,880
When?

466
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,390
Xiumin is also afraid of insects

467
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,310
I'm so lucky to have you here

468
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,350
Um

469
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,280
After riding the bike, we will go traveling next time

470
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,820
How about it?

471
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,410
Can you ride it yourself?

472
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,490
Ride over there

473
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,040
Very good, that's it

474
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,300
Hello? Agent Yang

475
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,590
What?

476
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,550
OK, I'll go over there

477
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,300
Um?

478
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,550
Are you going to the company again?

479
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:15,270
Oh, Ji-won is really a workaholic

480
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,310
Still working on weekends?

481
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,320
I only have her

482
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,780
But she has been saying she is busy lately and can't play with me

483
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,610
I haven't seen her lately.

484
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,320
She thought the project was hers.

485
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,830
Xiumin, can you ride a bicycle?

486
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,080
I've never ridden

487
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,670
I'm a little scared

488
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,420
What is there to be afraid of?

489
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,050
I'll teach you, let's go ride

490
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,710
-Is that so? -Don't be afraid

491
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,260
Hello? Ji Won

492
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,630
Excuse me

493
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,850
I have occasions where I want to get away

494
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,300
You just called me.

495
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,810
- Did that scare you? - What?

496
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,350
No

497
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,980
So you're not coming?

498
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,520
I'm waiting for you

499
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,020
What?

500
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:01,860
Where are you?

501
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,260
This is for you

502
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,850
Wow, thank you

503
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,140
But should I give you flowers?

504
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,060
I heard you moved to work near here.

505
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,520
Yes, very close

506
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,480
So you must come and see

507
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,240
I have a dinner reservation today

508
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,540
- I'm leaving. - Huh?

509
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,000
Oh, okay

510
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,530
Minister, I have something to tell you.

511
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,490
I also have something to say

512
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,160
Sit down

513
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,660
How do you come to work on weekends?

514
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,540
Today I'm going to arrange a date between Park Min-hwan and Jung Soo-min

515
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,250
Went out with them and then ran away

516
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,930
I missed two things in the process of inheriting in 2021

517
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,550
One of them is Cloud Aviation and Celite Travel

518
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,680
I remember

519
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,810
They broke away from the U&K and became completely independent.

520
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,650
Another thing is...

521
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,900
Li Xijun, Director

522
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:11,820
Although my grandfather asked me to keep him by my side

523
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,450
But when I became president, he resigned.

524
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,450
Why would he do that?

525
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,120
He's an uncomfortable person anyway.

526
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,670
People who can't be controlled

527
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,300
This is why I can't let you be the leader of the quick-cooking meal pack team.

528
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,010
I will help you, no matter what

529
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,890
Whatever you need

530
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,470
I will help you all

531
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,740
You always go to the distant store early in the morning.

532
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:02,080
But I work at a branch near my home...

533
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,160
I'm not late

534
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,040
You arrived three minutes ago.

535
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,960
I'm not usually like this...

536
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,340
I'm not late

537
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,050
Okay

538
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,340
I hope you're not late.

539
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,510
But

540
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,890
Today the guy came again

541
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,280
I see you so often

542
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,070
I want to know who you are

543
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,030
See if you will be fickle

544
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,410
Is it qualified to become a stable land?

545
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,620
I hope you didn't drink too much today.

546
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,000
It depends on how much you desire it.

547
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,920
Why are you doing this?

548
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,590
I think that's why I came here

549
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,100
Stop doing food shows

550
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:04,560
You are capable enough to make money without attracting women's attention

551
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,400
What does it have to do with you?

552
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,940
Sparkling mineral water

553
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,780
I won't drink anymore

554
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,200
I have something I have to do

555
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,550
In order to improve the teamwork of the marketing department, a full workshop will be held

556
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,960
Stay safe, and...

557
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:42,850
Report completed

558
00:44:58,190 --> 00:44:59,200
Agent Yang

559
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,410
How about letting Hee-yeon prepare for the workshop?

560
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,290
good

561
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:08,620
Hee Yeon

562
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:13,000
Do you want to prepare a workshop?

563
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,040
Me?

564
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:17,920
Do I come to prepare for the workshop?

565
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:26,640
U&K Food Autumn Workshop

566
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,680
We are one! Marketing Team!

567
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,990
Winner

568
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,790
It would be terrible if we got a size 5 sleeping bag.

569
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:00,090
How come the workshop's accommodation is determined by treasure hunting?

570
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,220
I can't sleep in a place like this.

571
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,390
Just take the game seriously.

572
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:08,140
This is much more fun than just drinking.

573
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:12,270
And if it weren’t for a day like this, how would there be a chance to hunt for treasure?

574
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:18,900
Put it on that table

575
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:24,570
When I found out that Liu Xiyan was a preparatory committee member, I felt uneasy.

576
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,080
You're still playing the name tag tearing game, what the hell is going on?

577
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,540
But I am still very happy

578
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,790
The feeling of loss that she had not been able to participate in this project should be gone now.

579
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:37,090
Yeah, we sit all day, it's nice to do something we don't normally do.

580
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,300
You are full of unfounded confidence.

581
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,010
You're not very good at treasure hunting, are you?

582
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,340
You won’t know until you try it

583
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,630
I plan to try to find

584
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:47,180
Anyway, this kind of thing can't be done if you're dead.

585
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,850
Dead?

586
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:55,190
oh

587
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,400
People will die one day.

588
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,030
At this time, girls just sit aside and watch the fun.

589
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,240
Just sit back and enjoy the success

590
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,650
Do you believe me?

591
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,610
I'll find camper number one soon.

592
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,370
Then help your girls team find

593
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:12,830
Number One

594
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
very good

595
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,420
Park Min Hwan

596
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,290
Hey, wait.

597
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:28,220
I'm done

598
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,350
If I remember correctly, Park Min Hwan will get number five

599
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,270
Sleeping in a sleeping bag

600
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,600
I finally found number four and hid

601
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,190
Finally slept in a tent

602
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,150
And Jung Soo Min...

603
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,200
Come, give it to you

604
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:52,120
Do you need anything else?

605
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,330
Let’s take a photo together

606
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,750
OK

607
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,960
It's strange that Jung Soo Min always gets the best

608
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,130
Hiding

609
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:11,100
Would you hide the number one flag too hard?

610
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,970
Oh, I hid that.

611
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,060
It means to find

612
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,770
You're too wild.

613
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,400
Who will go into the water?

614
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,440
Yes, the water is cold.

615
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,730
water?

616
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,530
It's so difficult

617
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,990
If the section chief was still here, I would ask him for help.

618
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,780
Where is Min-hwan? Can he swim?

619
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,620
What? Do you want him to help you find it?

620
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,960
Isn't this natural? The water must be that stream, it's dangerous.

621
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:42,380
Just ask someone for help. Is it necessary to take the difficult path?

622
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,470
What? He's your boyfriend, so that's not okay?

623
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,600
No, not because of that.

624
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,970
Then your boyfriend can lend it to me.

625
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:04,070
Ji-won, if you want something, you must do whatever it takes to get it.

626
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,030
If you really want it, that's it. That's what I do.

627
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:18,500
Is that why Jung Soo Min gets everything?

628
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:29,380
In 2023, she did get everything

629
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,480
I like you very much

630
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,810
I will help you, no matter what

631
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,900
Just ask someone for help. Is it necessary to take the difficult path?

632
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:52,360
Did you find flag number one?

633
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:56,030
- If I knew where it was, I would... - I heard Hee-yeon hid it by the stream

634
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,370
Can you help me?

635
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,790
- Of course - No

636
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,870
Not that, help me with something else

637
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:15,550
Can I be honest with you?

638
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,560
Don't think I'm weird.

639
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,060
Don't hate me, just listen to me.

640
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:30,780
Please keep that relationship with me.

641
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,370
I know you want to help me and do everything for me

642
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,420
But I plan to try it myself.

643
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,760
Before the media announces that you are the heir to U&K

644
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:55,090
You always do the right thing

645
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,510
I don't want someone like this

646
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,640
For me to do things that are not like you

647
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:06,810
I…

648
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,440
You said I was a capable person

649
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:13,110
I really can do anything.

650
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:18,120
so what…

651
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:22,620
Please let me occasionally

652
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,330
Just be honest with you

653
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:29,500
At this moment, people who live a second life

654
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,130
Just the two of us

655
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,880
Let me confide in you

656
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:37,800
Things that cannot be told to others

657
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:54,240
Didn't you say your dad gave you pocket money?

658
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,110
Will you draw a blue heart?

659
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:16,220
How could this...

660
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:25,560
I am the pocket money your father gave you.

661
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,770
I should listen to you.

662
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,320
Do everything for you

663
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,450
So you can use me as you like.

664
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,330
No problem

665
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:07,270
You don’t have to use pocket money, right?

666
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,400
I just want to chat with pocket money

667
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:16,190
besides…

668
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,450
I hope pocket money can make me happy

669
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:28,160
Don’t you want to do anything with the pocket money you got from your rebirth?

670
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,710
- Ji-won - Minister

671
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,630
Is there anything you want to do?

672
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:41,130
I want to...

673
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,850
Become happy

674
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,440
I absolutely have to rely on myself

675
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:53,900
With my own strength

676
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,530
Become happy

677
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,810
Is that guy only working out and not working?

678
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,310
You can't get this.

679
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,690
My waist

680
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:42,820
If I didn't have a herniated disc, you'd all be dead.

681
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,780
My fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae

682
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,580
Um?

683
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,830
What's wrong? Xiumin, are you okay?

684
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:52,910
What's wrong?

685
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,880
Min-hwan, I seem to be hooked by a branch

686
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:58,880
Let me see

687
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,800
Oh, that's serious.

688
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,340
it hurts

689
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,730
You should take medicine.

690
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,190
Let's go to base camp.

691
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,070
It's okay, I smeared saliva

692
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:29,410
By the way, could you help me with something?

693
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:31,700
What's up?

694
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,460
I know where the number one flag for girls is

695
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,580
But in the water

696
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:42,050
What if I go into the water and the wound hurts worse?

697
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,420
Oh, okay

698
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,890
Kang Ji-won

699
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,450
So far

700
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,130
Agent Yang, I asked the boss.

701
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:27,840
He said the stream was more than two meters deep in some places and there was sphagnum moss, it was dangerous, don't go down

702
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,760
Let's go over and take a look

703
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:33,560
Wait, let me contact security first.

704
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,130
Are you crazy?

705
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,710
In this season, it is not easy to go into the water without any preparation.

706
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:05,380
I don't even know the depth, and I'm still alone

707
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,380
Minister, I'm fine.

708
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:11,840
Not good at all!

709
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,970
Just tell me

710
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,020
What's so difficult about this?

711
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:20,230
Why take the hard road when you can just ask for help?

712
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,190
Because I'm different from Jung Soo Min

713
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,150
Because she is wrong and I am right

714
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,370
I won't be like Jung Soo Min

715
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:38,040
I want to achieve everything by myself and with my own strength

716
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,210
That's right

717
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:45,380
This is Kang Ji-won

718
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,500
This is me

719
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:20,000
minister

720
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,880
Is there anything you want to do?

721
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,260
I think…

722
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,220
Have you ever been on a boat?

723
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:38,850
Ever since my dad passed away

724
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,640
I feel like I'm on a boat every day

725
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:46,440
I clearly stood firmly and straight

726
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,230
But the boat kept shaking

727
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:50,650
I feel uneasy

728
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,950
I want stability

729
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,870
I want to step on the land

730
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,020
I want to be the land

731
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:54,760
I will never let them get married.

732
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,380
It's all over now

733
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:58,390
Just think of one thing today.

734
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:59,930
Kang Ji Won won

735
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:01,430
If we still have time

736
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:03,850
I should love you to the point of being unable to extricate myself

737
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:05,850
But fate put the brakes on

738
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:07,310
So you can't even get back ten won?

739
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:09,650
I also borrowed from a loan shark

740
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,940
But if this continues, he will not be able to give up marrying you.

741
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:15,940
Should we get married?

742
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:19,990
You are so shameless, you say you need to rely on me for support, as if you are a family member.
