1
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,050
智媛
JI-WON

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,140
杀了我
Kill me.

3
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,950
我的命运终究是要死在朴敏焕手上吗？
Was I destined to die in Park Min-hwan's hands?

4
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,830
智媛
Ji-won.

5
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,920
智媛
Ji-won.

6
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,830
智媛！
Ji-won!

7
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,730
等等，等一下
Wait. Hold on...

8
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,340
你说一次看看
Tell me again.

9
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,010
我以后不接李在元的电话
I won't answer Lee Jae-won's calls.

10
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,100
就算他到家里来，也不要开门
If he comes to the house, I won't open the door,

11
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,180
然后马上打电话给你
and call you right away.

12
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,140
李室长
Mr. Lee.

13
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,070
感谢你每次都载我到医院来
Thank you for driving me to the hospital every time like this

14
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,190
也感谢你和我洽谈离婚事宜…
and giving me divorce advice, but--

15
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,610
你不必感谢我
You don't have to thank me for that.

16
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,780
这是我的业务
It's work for me.

17
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,450
U&K付我很多钱
I get paid a lot of money from U&K.

18
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,540
我只是照着雇主的要求去做
I do what my employer wants.

19
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,210
好
Okay.

20
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,970
不过你说过你关心我
But you said you cared about me.

21
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,440
你还是把想说的话都说出来了
You just have to say your piece.

22
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,570
请等一下
Just a moment.

23
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,780
刘志赫部长
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

24
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,830
喂？怎么会这个时间打给我？
Hey, what is it at this hour?

25
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,500
我现在在警察局
I'm at the police station.

26
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,710
警察局？
The police station?

27
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,500
我现在马上过去
I'll be right there.

28
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,090
不用到这里来，请你到医院去
No, go to the hospital instead.

29
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,630
唯一医院
YUIL MEDICAL CENTER

30
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,930
第15集
EPISODE 15

31
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,550
区域紧急医疗中心

32
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,640
不好意思
Excuse me.

33
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,690
姜智媛，32岁，从江南的U&K总公司送过来的这位患者在哪里？
Kang Ji-won, 32, transferred from U&K in Gangnam. Where is she?

34
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,020
亲爱的
Ji-won.

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,860
她的呼吸和脉搏都恢复正常了
Her breathing and pulse are stable now.

36
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,740
稍微有点发烧，等她恢复意识，我们会再过来看看
But she has a fever, so we'll check her once she wakes up.

37
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,370
由于是暴力事件，她跟警察一起过来，我开诊断书给你们
It was an assault, so she came with the police. I'll get you her record.

38
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,540
喂
Hey.

39
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,170
我会终结你的人生
I'm going to ruin your life,

40
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,050
做好心理准备
so brace yourself.

41
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,930
我会向媒体爆料富三代施暴又仗势欺人
I'll tell the media a third-generation tycoon assaulted me.

42
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,890
现在这个时代，你隐瞒不了的
You can't cover things up these days.

43
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,310
我已经惨到不能再惨了
I have nothing to lose now.

44
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,900
都是因为你
Thanks to you.

45
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,360
为了姜智媛而毁了你的人生会不会太逊了？
But isn't Ji-won too inferior to ruin your life over?

46
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,450
她瘦巴巴的，有什么看头？
She's nothing but skin and bones.

47
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,620
刘部长
Mr. Yu.

48
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,160
要我给你一个忠告吗？
Do you want some advice?

49
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,540
不要太相信她
Don't trust her.

50
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,790
你知道我为何会疯掉吗？
Do you know why I went mad?

51
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,920
姜智媛会让人发疯
Ji-won makes people lose their minds.

52
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,760
毁掉你的不是我和姜智媛
Ji-won and I aren't the ones that ruined you.

53
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,680
是你的垃圾品行
It's your trashy personality.

54
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,140
把人打成这样，你的品行就很高尚吗？
Look how you beat me. Is your personality any better?

55
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,520
你不能因为比我会打架就这样
You can't do this because you fight better.

56
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,900
你才是不该那样对待体重只有你一半的女人吧？
That's a bit rich, considering what you did to a woman half your size.

57
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,900
什么？
What?

58
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,160
对你不利的时候，你就寻求平等
You seek equality when at a disadvantage,

59
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,410
对你有利的时候，你就爱展现力量
and strength when at an advantage.

60
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,290
其实我不喜欢运用我的力量
I hate using my strength.

61
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,590
可是对你，我不得不用
But not to you.

62
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,550
刘志赫先生，请出来
Mr. Yu, you can come out.

63
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
走吧
Let's go.

64
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,060
那我呢？
What about me?

65
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,900
为什么不把我弄出去？
Why can't I come out?

66
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,320
我呢？
What about me?

67
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,860
你以为你的人生不能再惨了吗？
Do you really think you can't go any lower?

68
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,450
大错特错
You're wrong.

69
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,500
不，为什么只有有钱人可以出去？
No, wait. Is it because he's rich?

70
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,380
我也是U&K的人
I work at U&K too!

71
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,340
那我呢？
What about me?

72
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,050
有钱没罪，没钱有罪！
One law for the rich and another for the poor!

73
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,510
朴敏焕从今天起被解雇
Min-hwan is fired as of today

74
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
事由是对同事施暴，违反公司规定
for assaulting a colleague and violating the rules.

75
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,810
也再找找其他事由
Find anything else.

76
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,850
上次出轨事件时，我有查过了
I checked during his affair incident.

77
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,730
他还有擅离职守、使用公司信用卡明细不清
AWOL and unclear corporate card statements.

78
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,770
不当招待厂商的情况
And he illegally treated clients.

79
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,740
很好，他是不是有公司贷款？
Good. Doesn't he have a company loan?

80
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,400
我会要银行向他提出还款要求
I'll ask the bank for a repayment request.

81
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,410
我会把暴力、伤害等可以加的罪名都加上去
I'll add assault, injury, and anything else.

82
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,330
还有姜智媛…
And Ms. Kang is...

83
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,000
她现在在家里
She's at home.

84
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,710
这是她的意愿
It's what she wanted.

85
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,090
我刚好和杨珠兰科长在一起
I happened to be with Ms. Yang.

86
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,050
所以我让杨科长去陪她，不过她看起来不太好
So I left Ms. Kang with her, but she didn't look good.

87
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,890
朴敏焕是不是也有欠高利贷没还？
You said there was a debt that Min-hwan hadn't paid off, right?

88
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,140
施压要他还钱
Put some pressure on that.

89
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,940
我们买下债权也可以
Or buy the bonds.

90
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,110
我马上去查
I'll look into it.

91
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,070
刘部长
Mr. Yu.

92
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,070
智媛怎么样了？
How's Ji-won?

93
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,870
她不太好
She's not good.

94
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,500
我想她睡一觉会比较好，所以想让她喝点牛奶
I think she'll be better if she sleeps, so I'll get her some milk.

95
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,380
可是家里什么都没有
There's nothing in her house.

96
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,420
部长，你还好吗？
Are you okay?

97
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,340
嗯，还好
Well, yes.

98
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,180
谢谢你，现在由我来接手，你回去休息吧
Thank you. I'll take it from here. You should go home and rest.

99
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,630
志赫
Ji-hyuk.

100
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,310
对不起
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,440
全都是我不好
I'm sorry for everything.

102
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,490
你有没有受伤？
Were you hurt?

103
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,570
这边怎么了？
What's this?

104
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,040
你好
Hello.

105
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,210
问候就只有这样？
Is that all?

106
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,670
也太少了吧
It can't be.

107
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,680
你打来是因为你先生受我照顾
Considering you called because your husband's in my care,

108
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,300
只说这样也太少了吧
there should be more.

109
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,690
你们要不要到中国去一阵子？
How about going to China for a while?

110
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:32,320
唉唷，那我们当然感激不尽
Oh, my. We would be so thankful if you could do that for us.

111
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,740
不过你们搭船的时候，会有些辛苦
It'll be a rough ride on the ship though.

112
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,580
唉唷，那怎么会辛苦呢？我们都没把您吩咐的事给办好
That's nothing at all. We couldn't even get the job done.

113
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,080
如果您再给我一次机会
If you give us another chance,

114
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,040
我会用力踩油门，把她辗过去
I'll hit the accelerator and crush her.

115
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,790
请一定要联络我
So just let me know.

116
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,920
好，谢谢
Yeah, thank you.

117
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,920
没钱的人总会试图留下些东西
Poor people always try to keep a record.

118
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,340
手上必须要握有保险
As insurance.

119
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,560
你想要的是什么？
What do you want?

120
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,400
你不喜欢我好好照顾你爸吗？
Do you hate that I'm taking care of your father?

121
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,440
只要把姜智媛辗过去的简单事情变得不再简单了
Now that crushing Kang Ji-won isn't so simple anymore,

122
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,570
你就突然要我们什么都别做
you suddenly say, "Don't do anything."

123
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,450
之后朴敏换还突然说要离婚
Then Park Min-hwan suddenly asks me for a divorce,

124
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,080
而我爸又不接电话，我就明白了
and my dad won't pick up, so I realize,

125
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,750
这样下去，只有我会完蛋
"I'll get screwed over."

126
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,210
从你的表情看来
Judging by the look on your face,

127
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,260
有钱人也没多厉害
you're nothing special.

128
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,640
可恶，我不该窝在房间里的
Darn it. Why have I been cooped up at home like that?

129
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,310
换我问问题了
I ask the questions now.

130
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,140
你能为我做什么？
What can you do for me?

131
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,450
韩国的小虾米是有毒吗？怎么会这么没有分寸？
Are the shrimps in Korea poisonous? Why don't they know their place?

132
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,210
郑万植和裴熙淑的尸体被发现了吗？
Have the bodies of Jeong Man-sik and Bae Hui-suk been found?

133
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,000
我会去查警方的报告
I'll check the police report.

134
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,840
暂时不要让新闻报出来
Make sure there's no news about it.

135
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,220
让郑秀敏感到有危机变得没好处了
Jeong Su-min shouldn't feel threatened now.

136
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,760
朴敏焕和郑秀敏
Park Min-hwan and Jeong Su-min.

137
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,520
可以一次解决掉吗？
Can we take care of them both at once?

138
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,440
朴敏焕
PARK MIN-HWAN

139
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,910
喂？
Hello?

140
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,990
我现在在警察局
I'm at the police station right now.

141
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,950
不好意思，可以请你帮个忙吗？
I'm sorry, but can I ask for a favor?

142
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,710
什么？警察局？
What? The police station?

143
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,750
首尔城三警察局
SUNGSAM POLICE STATION

144
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,170
虽然把你弄出来了，但是这个案子有些严重
We got you out, but it's pretty serious.

145
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,790
我们可能罩不了你
We may not be able to cover it.

146
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,170
什么？那是什么意思？
What? What are you saying?

147
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,180
你没有事先跟我们商量过，就做出这种行为
It wasn't what we agreed on.

148
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,060
若我们与U&K正面对决，副社长的负担会很大
If we have to fight U&K head-on, the burden on Ms. Oh will be big.

149
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,140
喂！
Hey!

150
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,140
你那是什么讲话态度？你以为你是谁啊？
What's with the attitude? Who do you think you are?

151
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,400
你是云彩航空的副社长吗？
You're not the VP of Cloud Air!

152
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,530
喂

所以不要这么没礼貌

00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,990
可恶
Damn it.

156
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,870
只在擂台上打架的家伙，就只会耍嘴皮子
You only know how to fight in the ring. Watch your mouth.

157
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,710
你不过就是吴宥拉的小喽罗
You're just Yu-ra's henchman.

还敢对我颐指气使

先生，等一下
Mister, wait!

161

你为什么要把他打到流鼻血？
Why would you give him a nosebleed?

162
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,970
我有什么理由不能那么做吗？
Is there a reason I can't?

163
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,270
那家伙的态度很糟糕啊！
He gave me attitude!

164
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,100
可恶

很可怕
It was scary.

她说你要离婚，她不愿意自己一个人死
She said you asked for a divorce. She won't go down alone.

170

她说不会让你独自脱身
She won't let you get away alone.

171
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,040
她疯啦？真是的
Is she out of her mind? Damn it.

172
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,170

你为什么不接电话？
Why won't you pick up?

189

她拿走了要给她爸的钱？

215
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,140
她真的不是一般厉害
She's really something.

- 请叫保全过来 - 你真的是…

医师

- 医师 - 你喝醉了吗？
- Doctor. - Are you drunk?

227
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,260
医师，我是她的丈夫
I'm her husband.

228
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,100
可是她躲在这里，也不接电话
But she was hiding here and ignoring my calls.

229
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,930

有证据
I have it.

232
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,480
你真的想这样？
Do you really want to do this here?

233
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,900
在医院里？

要看得到画面，让人无法抵赖

241
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,090
- 请你出去 - 不要拦我

242
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,390
你要让妍芝没有爸爸吗？

其实我过得不好
To be honest, I'm not doing that well.

264
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:19,160
朴敏换和我决定要离婚了
Min-hwan and I are getting a divorce.

昨天我离开家里，现在住在楼上

00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,240
想休息一阵子
I'm going to rest for now.

267
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,830
这是因果报应
It must be karma.

268
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,420
我被爱情蒙蔽了双眼
Blinded by love, I betrayed

269
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,010
背叛了我唯一的闺蜜，我的另一半

270
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,890
结果…
In the end...

271
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,980
总之我现在是一个人了
Anyway, I'm all alone now.

272
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,900
你说你要离婚，那事情变得容易许多
The divorce makes this easier to say.

273
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,450
你打算要杀了姜智媛吧？
Did you try to kill Ji-won?

274
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,460
换作是我也会这么做
I would've done the same.

275
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,130
我的意思是说 我知道姜智媛和朴敏焕
I'm saying I know Ji-won and Min-hwan are

他们两个…
Are they really...

278
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,560

我会告诉你何时跟如何进去

281
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,780
如果你有需要的话 我也会帮你找最好的律师
If you want, I'll get you the best lawyer too.

282
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,330
你就只需履行身为法定配偶的权利
You just fulfill your role as his legal spouse.

283
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,080
为什么要帮我？
Why?

284
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,590
我不服气
Because it's not fair.

285
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,470
你的人生不是由于朴敏焕而毁了吗？
Isn't your life ruined because of Min-hwan?

286
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,390
要是你离婚 你就拿不到之前在公司工作的补偿
If you divorce, you won't be rewarded for your work at the company.

287
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,850
你什么都不剩
You'll be left with nothing.

288
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,850
我…
That's true...

289
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,400
的确是如此
for me.

290
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,280
那你能得到什么？
But what do you gain?

291
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,830
我希望姜智媛回到我身边
I want to get Kang Ji-won back.

292
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,920
我喜欢姜智媛
I like Ji-won.

293
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,880
所以我讨厌她跟朴敏焕纠缠
So I hate that she's with him.

294
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,760
我会想办法让她回到我身边
I'm going to make her come back to me.

295
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,680
所以帮帮我
So help me.

296
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,990
我可以问你一件事吗？
Can I ask you something?

297
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,210
你为什么讨厌我？
Why do you hate me?

298
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,800
因为你只知道自己
Because you're selfish.

299
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,970
有的人会啃食身边的人
There are those who gnaw at people around them.

300
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,810
而你正是这种人，所以我很讨厌
You are that type, so I hate you.

301
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,310
你又不了解我
You don't know me that well.

302
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,230
你不相信任何人吧？
You don't trust anyone, do you?

303
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,480
那是因为你是不值得信任的人
That's because you're not trustworthy.

304
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,780
你认为别人也跟你一样 所以你无法相信人
You think everyone's like you, so you can't trust anyone.

305
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,740
你这么想，我们怎么合作？
How can you work with me thinking like that?

306
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,210
你不是问我为什么讨厌你吗？
Didn't you ask me why I hated you?

307
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,960
我没说我无法与你合作
I never said I couldn't work with you.

308
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,340
你决定好就告诉我
Let me know when you decide.

309
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,470
谈得很顺利
It went well.

310
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,060
如你所说，她问我为何要帮她
As you said, she asked me why I was helping her.

311
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,980
如果我全都说谎，她应该不会相信 所以我适当地掺入一些真话
I didn't think she'd believe me if I lied, so I mixed in some truth.

312
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:34,490
除了她会发现出轨的一对 是吴宥拉和朴敏焕之外
Except that it'll be Oh Yu-ra and Park Min-hwan instead,

313
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,370
我说的全都是事实
everything I said was true.

314
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,250
还有…
Also...

315
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,420
我们公司有提供给员工一项保险
There's an insurance policy provided to company employees.

316
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,630
家人保险
A family insurance.

317
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,010
理赔对象包括本人、配偶与直系血亲
It compensates yourself, spouse, and immediate family.

318
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,140
离职时，本人可以决定是否继续加保
You can decide to keep it when you quit.

319
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,350
二手市场
SECOND HAND MARKET

320
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,220
过不久应该就会通知朴敏焕
A notice will go to Park Min-hwan soon.

321
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:05,020
把这个卖了，就可以救急
I can take care of the more urgent debt if this gets sold.

322
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,490
他本来不晓得有这种保险
He doesn't know such insurance existed,

323
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,110
不过很快就会知道了
but he will soon.

324
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,080
舞台正在搭建中
The stage is being set.

325
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,200
糖果

326
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,020
我要不要干脆去死？
Shall I just die?

327
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,150
虽然如果朴敏换没有起歹念 那项保险就没有用
Though it's useless if Min-hwan doesn't decide to die.

328
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,490
要是我死了
If I die...

329
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,620
我爸妈就能领到我的身故保险金
my mom and dad can get my life insurance benefit.

330
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:03,120
在朴敏焕走到现在这步之前 有好几次机会可以停止
Min-hwan could've stopped several times on his way here,

331
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,790
但是他都没有
but he didn't.

332
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,590
他应该会一路走到底
He'll go all the way.

333
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,220
那就没有问题了
Then there's no problem.

334
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,260
郑秀敏应该也会一路走到底
Jeong Su-min will go all the way too.

335
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,390
为什么大家
Why is everyone

336
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,270
都只在找姜智媛？
looking for Kang Ji-won?

337
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,610
因为现在的郑秀敏 应该会对你更加执着
I think Jeong Su-min is more obsessed with you right now.

338
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,990
现在就剩那一刻了
It's that moment now.

339
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,750
剩下的就是让郑秀敏经历那一刻
All that's left is for her to experience it.

340
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,150
要不要回日本呢？
How about returning to Japan?

341
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,400
比起以前，刘志赫行动积极许多
Yu Ji-hyuk is moving more actively than before.

342
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,490
他把朴敏焕个人的债务和高利贷
He's pressuring Park Min-hwan

343
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:16,700
全都买下来，向他施压 他应该撑不久
with his debt and private loans. He won't last long.

344
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,950
他似乎也不放弃寻找郑万植和裴熙淑
And he hasn't given up on Man-sik and Hui-suk.

345
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,290
他搜遍了 仁川所有废弃工厂附近的监视器画面
He got all the CCTV footage from the abandoned factory.

346
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,830
虽然他不会找到什么
He won't find anything,

347
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,040
但是与U&K正面迎战，没有任何好处
but nothing good can come from fighting U&K head-on.

348
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,260
看来你没信心
You must not be confident.

349
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,100
你已经先害怕，要我逃跑了
Seeing how you're telling me to run away.

350
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,270
没关系
It's okay.

351
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,480
他爷爷不一样
His grandfather is different.

352
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,900
他与温室花朵刘志赫不一样
Unlike Ji-hyuk, who's like a flower in a green house,

353
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,570
他是很现实的人
he's realistic.

354
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:00,370
他知道灰姑娘会多么令人头疼
He knows how much of a nuisance Cinderella can be.

355
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,100
将军
Checkmate.

356
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,020
我都赢不过爷爷
I can never beat you.

357
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,400
因为你全都想要，就被我看穿步数了
You want everything, so I can read your hand.

358
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,440
懂得放弃不属于自己的东西 是作为领导者的条件
A good leader should know how to give up something that's not theirs.

359
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,820
好
Okay.

360
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,200
你来啦？
Hey!

361
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,830
嗯
Hi.

362
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,910
我和爷爷在下象棋
We were just playing janggi.

363
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,750
今天我又输了
And I lost again.

364
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,460
不过我觉得我应该能赢过你 要一起下吗？
But I think I can beat you. Do you want to play?

365
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,550
爷爷
Grandfather.

366
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,920
您不是要我带喜欢的女生回来吗？
You asked me to bring the woman I like.

367
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,140
我会正式带她过来
I will introduce her to you.

368
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,140
所以请不要再让宥拉到家里来了
So don't let Yu-ra into the house anymore.

369
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,270
你之前说你是单恋，没打算跟她交往
You said it was one-sided and weren't going to make it work.

370
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,850
你改变心意了吗？
Did you change your mind?

371
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,060
对，我打算跟她在一起
Yes, I'm going to pursue it.

372
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,570
可是家里不能有前未婚妻进出
So I can't have my ex-fiancée frequenting my house.

373
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,200
我在订婚期间太不用心了
I was so indifferent during our engagement.

374
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,500
我都不晓得他这么急性子
I didn't know he was so impatient.

375
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,500
像我们这样的人
People like us

376
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,330
结婚不是我们说好就可以
can't marry for love, can we?

377
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,340
别做鲁莽的举动 先获得爷爷的同意…
Get permission from your grandfather before you--

378
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,260
我会的
I will.

379
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,800
我现在就把她介绍给您
I'll introduce her now.

380
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,110
您好，我是姜智媛
Hello, I'm Kang Ji-won.

381
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,380
我们来把姜智媛处理掉
Let's get rid of Kang Ji-won.

382
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,210
你不要回日本吗？
You're not going back to Japan?

383
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,380
我输了会活不下去
I can't live with myself if I lose.

384
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,430
我为何要被微不足道的小虫 害得我有这种感觉？
Why do I have to feel this way over those cockroaches?

385
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,600
对，当初我就应该亲自出手
Yeah, I should've done it myself.

386
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,350
借他人之手只是让自己头痛
It's a headache having others do it.

387
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,660
我告诉自己 必然会发生的事，就算困难也要面对
I've decided to face the obstacles that are bound to happen.

388
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,170
上次我跟你见面的时候
When I met you last time,

389
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,100
有些话没有告诉你
there's something I didn't tell you.

390
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:13,770
并不是面对就能解决所有事情
Powering through isn't a solution to everything.

391
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,320
我知道我孙子给了你 许多作为短暂交往的回报
I'm aware he gave you a lot for seeing him briefly.

392
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,990
所以你以后打算怎么做？
So what are you going to do from now on?

393
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:26,860
我会回过头去看和反省我有没有做错
I'll look back and reflect on my faults.

394
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,450
能够改正的就改正
I'll correct what I can.

395
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,160
剩下的…
And the rest...

396
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:35,040
我想我也无可奈何
I guess it is what it is.

397
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:42,090
现在差不多是你想你也无可奈何 然后退出的时候了
It's time for you to step back and say, "It is what it is."

398
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,260
您果然知道这件事
So you knew.

399
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,310
我为了这件事狠狠骂了刘志赫
I gave him hell for that.

400
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,600
不会再有这种事了
That won't ever happen again.

401
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,730
他真的有很多不足
He lacks so much.

402
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,450
您对他娇生惯养
You spoiled him.

403
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,870
他只知道工作，对钱完全没有概念
He only knows how to work. He has no concept of money.

404
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,870
其实他太过富家少爷的态度 令我不知所措
Honestly, I was flustered because he was like a rich boy.

405
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,080
你是想要说什么？
What are you trying to say?

406
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,510
可是我喜欢他这一点
But I liked that about him.

407
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,260
其实我也是有很多不足的人
To tell you the truth, I lack a lot too.

408
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:36,560
当我以为他是完美的富三代的时候
When I thought he was a perfect third-generation chaebol,

409
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,060
感觉他遥不可及
he seemed unreachable.

410
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,190
可是当我看到他傻气、生气、散漫
But he can be foolish, get angry, and messy.

411
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,280
不知所措，以及有时…
He gets embarrassed, and sometimes...

412
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,620
耍孩子气的样子
he acts like a baby. Seeing those sides of him,

413
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,960
我想我们可以好好在一起
I thought we could do well together.

414
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,470
我想要跟他一起过得幸福
I want to be happy with him.

415
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,510
爷爷
Sir.

416
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:19,640
请把刘志赫交给我
Please, give Yu Ji-hyuk to me.

417
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:34,530
所有关于朴敏焕解雇的事宜 明天就会处理完毕
Park Min-hwan's termination will be finalized by tomorrow.

418
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,960
不过你为什么要问 公司帮忙加保的员工保险呢？
By the way, why did you ask about the insurance for employees?

419
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,790
通常他们都不会继续加保
They don't usually keep it.

420
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:45,040
这只是一项公司福利 大部分的人根本不知道有这个东西
It's just a company perk. Most don't know about it.

421
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,050
朴敏焕必定会继续加保
Park Min-hwan will do it.

422
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,160
看起来好好吃
That looks good.

423
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,870
三个
Three.

424
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,620
味道和口感如何？
How's the taste and texture?

425
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:26,420
确实如你所说 菠菜海螺意大利面最受欢迎
As you predicted, the spinach pasta with sea snails was most popular.

426
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,050
这应该会成为主打商品
It'll be the main product.

427
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
太好了
That's good.

428
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:34,470
在韩国的意大利面里 不常使用海螺与波菜…
Sea snails and spinach aren't common ingredients for pasta in Korea...

429
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,430
哦，对了
Oh, right.

430
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,810
请看镜头
Look at the camera.

431
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:38,970
好
Okay.

432
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,430
很好
Yes, that's good.

433
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,020
放轻松就好
Just be comfortable.

434
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,270
他会拍下自然的模样
He's going to get a natural look.

435
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,820
刘熙妍
YU HUI-YEON

436
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,540
今天真是辛苦你了
Great job today.

437
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:07,170
不会啦，你解救了差点失业的我 我才要感谢你
It was nothing. You saved me from being unemployed. I appreciate it.

438
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,630
我会尽快把修改好的食谱传给你
I'll send you the recipe revisions soon.

439
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,090
- 有点难呢 - 好
- It's hard. - Yeah.

440
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,340
我也会把草案和工厂时程 整理好传给你
I'll send you the draft and factory schedule too.

441
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,680
好
Okay.

442
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:18,800
对了
By the way,

443
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,690
今天没有看到刘熙妍和刘志赫
I didn't see Yu Hui-yeon and Yu Ji-hyuk today.

444
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,610
刚才部长一直都在啊
Mr. Yu was there all day.

445
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,480
这么说来，今天没看到熙妍耶
I haven't seen Hui-yeon either.

446
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,820
她去哪了？
Where did she go?

447
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,450
那我先走了
I should get going.

448
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,240
- 路上小心 - 好
- Goodbye! - Bye!

449
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,590
郑秀敏
JEONG SU-MIN

450
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,590
拒绝接听
CALL DECLINED

451
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,180
郑秀敏
JEONG SU-MIN

452
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,100
拒绝接听
CALL DECLINED

453
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,700
为什么不接我电话？
Why not pick up my calls?

454
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,280
我问你为何不接我电话
Why won't you pick up?

455
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,120
我为什么要接你电话？
Why do I have to pick up your calls?

456
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,090
好吧，我可以理解
Yeah, I get it.

457
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:37,050
你跟我老公交往了七年 结果他却选择了我，而不是你
You were with him for seven years, but he chose me over you.

458
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,930
你肯定一时很难接受
I'm sure it was hard to accept.

459
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,680
就算是这样
But still,

460
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:46,560
你怎么可以勾引已婚男子？你害得我要离婚了
how could you seduce a married man? I'm about to get divorced because of you.

461
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,030
请问是警卫室吗？
Is this security?

462
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,030
这里是16楼
This is the 16th floor.

463
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,110
有外部人士进来
An outsider is here.

464
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,910
请你们尽快处理
Take care of her.

465
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,790
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

466
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,250
你以为我会坐视不管吗？
Do you think I'd let it slide?

467
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,460
喂
Hey.

468
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,630
我为何要跟别人的男人搞在一起？我又不是你
Why would I sleep with someone else's man? I'm not you.

469
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:22,800
哦，你是用这种方式勾引了朴敏焕 所以你应该很清楚
Right, you seduced Min-hwan this way, so I'm sure you know best.

470
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:29,640
可是如果他是会背叛 交往七年女友的人
But if he betrayed his girlfriend of seven years,

471
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:33,400
你怎么会不知道 他也可以对你这么做呢？
why didn't you know he could do the same to you?

472
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:40,820
我会在公司贴大字报 让你们俩在公司里都抬不起头来
I'll put posters up here to make you two too ashamed to work here.

473
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,320
我不会放过你
I won't stand for it.

474
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,200
这可怎么办才好？
That's too bad.

475
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:53,080
你老公已经被这个公司开除了
Your husband was fired.

476
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:01,470
所以别在这里无谓地怀疑我 回去当个贤内助，对哦
So stop suspecting me, and go be a good wife. Oh, wait.

477
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,260
你们要离婚了吧？
You two are divorcing.

478
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,680
真糟糕
That's too bad.

479
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,230
不过…
But...

480
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,230
我越想越觉得不高兴
thinking about it is pissing me off.

481
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,650
只有你才会贪图朴敏焕这种垃圾
Only you would covet trash like Min-hwan.

482
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,650
我怎么会呢？
Why would I?

483
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,370
除非我是个傻子才会吧
Unless I was a fool.

484
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,340
放手，我自己走，放开我！
Let go. I'm going. Let me go!

485
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:49,850
敏焕，刚才郑秀敏来公司大闹 吓到我了
Min-hwan, Jeong Su-min just came and caused a fuss. It scared me.

486
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,690
不过公司不会谣传什么八卦 因为大家都只在说郑秀敏是不是疯了
But rumors won't spread here since everyone thinks Su-min's crazy.

487
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,860
唉呀，不小心传错了，抱歉
Oh, no. I sent it to the wrong person. Sorry.

488
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,030
她真的是疯了！
Is she out of her mind?

489
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,160
我不会放过她
I won't stand for this.

490
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,210
郑秀敏很快就会打给我了
Jeong Su-min will call me soon.

491
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:30,890
郑秀敏
JEONG SU-MIN

492
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,480
我要毁了姜智媛
I'm going to ruin Kang Ji-won.

493
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,020
你大可拥有她
Have her.

494
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,020
但是在那之前 我一定要让她跌到谷底
In return, she has to hit rock bottom first.

495
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,570
我要让她向我求饶
I'll make her beg.

496
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,440
在那之前，我不会合作
I won't cooperate before that.

497
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,450
郑秀敏上钩了
We have Su-min in our hands.

498
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,290
我来让朴敏焕行动
I'll try to move Min-hwan.

499
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,460
他现在差不多应该收到了
I think he's gotten it by now.

500
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,340
海英别墅
HAEYEONG VILLA

501
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,010
U&K寄了什么给我？
What would U&K send me?

502
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,350
U&K人寿，保险单
U&K LIFE INSURANCE POLICY

503
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,150
开什么玩笑？
What the heck?

504
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:21,110
我都被公司开除了 哪有钱可以缴保险费？
I was fired. I have no money to pay for this.

505
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,670
保障事项：配偶伤害死亡，五亿韩元（人民币269万6420元）
SPOUSE'S DEATH AFTER INJURY 500 MILLION WON

506
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:17,000
你可能没有理由要罩我
You may not have a reason to cover for me,

507
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,370
可是我们可以交易
but we can make a deal.

508
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,960
我来解决郑秀敏，让她不会再来烦你
I'll take care of Su-min so she won't bother you.

509
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,470
再准备一份餐点
Tell them to bring one more meal.

510
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,130
我们先吃再来谈
Let's eat first.

511
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:47,320
所以你要怎么处理你老婆？
So how will you take care of your wife?

512
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,950
我现在是穷光蛋，正打算要去死
I'm broke, so I was going to kill myself.

513
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,240
可是出现生路了
But there's a way to live.

514
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,870
而那条生路也可能对你有帮助
And I think that might help you too.

515
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,840
保障事项：配偶伤害死亡，五亿韩元（人民币269万6420元）
SPOUSE'S DEATH AFTER INJURY 500 MILLION WON

516
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,340
这要配偶死亡才能领到
You can only get this after death.

517
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,510
只要郑秀敏消失在这个世界上
If Su-min disappears,

518
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,550
就不会有人威胁你了
there won't be anyone to threaten you.

519
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:20,390
当然这不容易，我们也得套好说法
It won't be easy. We have to get our story straight.

520
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,440
不过你是不是能帮我呢？
But can't you help me?

521
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:27,230
又要我帮你收拾善后？
You want me to clean up your mess? Again?

522
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,820
不只是收拾善后
Not just that.

523
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,990
你还得帮我布局
Set it up for me too.

524
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,160
这个世界上金钱和人脉就是一切 而我一个都没有
Money and connections are everything, but I don't have any of them.

525
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:41,500
你有胆量
You've got guts.

526
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,090
很多东西都没有的话，至少要有胆量
If you don't have anything, you should at least have guts.

527
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,170
可是你是不是只有胆量？
But isn't that all you have?

528
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,430
你以为做这种决定很容易吗？
You think it was easy to decide?

529
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,560
这是我的最后防线
This is my last resort.

530
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,470
我得赌上性命
I'll risk my life.

531
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,650
这是你最后一次机会
This is your last chance.

532
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,450
现在朴敏焕在吴宥拉的套房里
Park Min-hwan is at Oh Yu-ra's suite right now.

533
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,380
所以就是今天了
So it's today.

534
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,510
郑秀敏
JEONG SU-MIN

535
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:46,730
朴敏焕和姜智媛 温顿饭店，1355号房
Park Min-hwan and Kang Ji-won are in room 1355 at Winton Hotel.

536
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,150
1355号
Room 1355.

537
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,230
1355号
Room 1355.

538
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,330
让开
Move.

539
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:01,030
话说亲爱的，你真的好聪明哦
But I think you're really smart, babe.

540
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,990
话说这还真天才
But that is pretty genius.

541
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:08,080
你怎么会想到 要以老婆的身故保险金东山再起？
Going after your wife's life insurance benefit?

542
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,370
你怎么会想到要投保癌症保险啊？
How did you think of cancer insurance?

543
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,090
等到我领到保险金，我请你大吃一顿
Once I get paid, I'll treat you to something nice.

544
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:23,130
不用担心
Don't worry.

545
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,260
我这个人可是非常会报恩
I know how to return the favor properly.

546
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,600
吓我一跳
Oh, my God!

547
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,820
可恶
Damn...

548
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,200
不管是谁，都有够无言
Whoever it is, this is ridiculous.

549
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,500
喂，朴敏焕
Hey, Min-hwan.

550
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,170
你真的是个无法处理的垃圾
You're a piece of trash that can't be handled.

551
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,930
不然你是要怎样？
What are you going to do about it?

552
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:07,050
对哦
Right?

553
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:12,180
我要把那段录音交给警方
I'm going to send the voice recording to the police.

554
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:15,270
我爸在哪里？你杀了他吗？
Where's my dad? Did you kill him?

555
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:19,770
杀了他？
Kill him?

556
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,690
我以为你要和姜智媛复合
I thought you were trying to get Ji-won back.

557
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,740
你和这女的在这里做什么？
What are you doing here with her?

558
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,660
听说你也被公司开除了
I heard you were fired.

559
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:30,030
既然你时间这么多 你们俩就去吃牢饭吧
Since you have a lot of free time, spend it in jail.

560
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,330
那个疯女人
Are you insane?

561
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,000
滚开，滚！
Get lost!

562
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,130
放开我，我叫你放开我！
Let go of me!

563
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:44,220
放手！
Let go!

564
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,180
该死
Damn it...

565
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,680
现在该怎么办？
What do I do now?

566
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:52,220
还能怎么办？
What do you mean?

567
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,350
就照你的计划去做
We'll go forward with your plan.

568
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:56,640
但是不能在这里
But not here.

569
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,020
我会帮你布局
I'll set it up for you.

570
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:02,280
副社长
Ms. Oh.

571
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,370
假如朴敏焕杀了郑秀敏
If Park Min-hwan kills Jeong Su-min,

572
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,500
就定调为谋杀妻子以诈领保险金
set it up as murder for the insurance claim

573
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,550
编好故事之后，发给媒体
and distribute it to the media.

574
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,550
我会去准备，可是…
I'll get it ready, but...

575
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,850
要让朴敏焕说的关于我的事 都变成是在胡扯
Make sure whatever he says about me is nonsense.

576
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:37,890
证据当然也要消灭
Get rid of all the evidence, got it?

577
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,300
你这是在做什么？
What do you think you're doing?

578
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,320
所以说你为何要做那种无谓的事？
So why did you do something like that?

579
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:29,400
你什么都好，就是没有自知之明
You're great, but you don't know your place.

580
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,080
我有钱，我全都给你
I have money. I'll give it all to you.

581
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,500
要是你杀了我
If you kill me,

582
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,720
你想那女的会放过你吗？
do you think she'll leave you alone?

583
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,180
郑秀敏
Su-min.

584
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,560
我承认你很厉害
I'll give it to you.

585
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:07,280
你真的有让吴宥拉抵赖不掉的证据
You really have hard evidence on Oh Yu-ra.

586
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:11,450
可是怎么办才好？
But too bad for you.

587
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,780
你昏倒的时候，吴宥拉把它全删了
She erased it when you passed out.

588
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,330
什么？
What?

589
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:21,410
你这个傻瓜
You dummy.

590
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:26,130
像我们这种人
People like us shouldn't

591
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,130
不能跟有权有势的人作对
go against people with power.

592
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:32,090
我们能做什么？
What can we do?

593
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,260
还有…
And...

594
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,390
你没有钱
you have no money.

595
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:38,930
零韩元
0 WON

596
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:42,980
什么？为什么？
What's that?

597
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:45,020
反正那本来就不是你的钱
It wasn't your money anyway!

598
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,770
你是趁机占为己有
You stole it when you had the chance.

599
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,280
对了
Oh, right.

600
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:56,530
我买给姜智媛的包包在你那里
You had the bag I bought for Ji-won.

601
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:59,950
我卖掉了
I sold that.

602
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,370
你得先帮你老公救急啊
To take care of urgent matters for me.

603
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:08,420
不要觉得太委屈
Don't be too upset.

604
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,130
你不是说不愿意自己一个人死吗？
You said you wouldn't go down alone.

605
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:21,350
不是你死，就是我死
One of us has to die.

606
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,600
站在我的立场来看
So...

607
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,020
我得先解决掉你才能重新开始
I have to take care of you to start over.

608
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,070
你等着
Just wait.

609
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,950
喂！放开我！

放开我！
Let me go!

613
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,920
把我…
Let me...

614
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:53,670
把我放开
Let me go!

615
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,840
喂！
Hey!

616
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:21,990
瓦斯…
The gas...

617
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,210
她去哪了？
Where did she go?

618
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:47,020
喂！
Hey!

619
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:51,270
你疯啦？
Are you crazy?

620
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,730
交出车钥匙，滚到一边去
Leave the car key and move aside.

621
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,320
好，我知道了，你先冷静
Okay. Just calm down.

622
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,830
把刀放下，拜托你冷静！
Put the knife down! Calm down!

623
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,290
我不会死
I won't die.

624
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,830
我绝不会死！
I'll never die!

625
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,500
来
Here.

626
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:15,590
车钥匙给你
Here's the key.

627
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:20,970
车钥匙在这里，你把刀放下
Here it is. Put the knife down.

628
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,140
快点过来拿
Just take it!

629
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,520
拿走，来
Take it. Here.

630
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,780
去死
You little...

631
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,820
过来
Come here.

632
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,780
给我过来！
Come here!

633
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:49,290
可恶
Damn it...

634
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:57,210
我可爱的妻子来旅行
My lovely wife's going to

635
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,590
大概是在我去买东西的时候
die from carbon monoxide poisoning

636
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:04,760
由于锅炉故障，一氧化碳中毒而死
from a boiler malfunction while I'm away to get groceries.

637
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:09,310
所以别再毁了我的人生
So stop ruining my life.

638
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,020
该死的时候就乖乖去死
Just die already.

00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,560
喂，要死你自己乖乖去死
Hey! If you're going to die, just die already.

640
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,450
原来保险金是在说这个啊
This is what the insurance was about?

641
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:25,660
你以为会如你所愿吗？
You think it'll go your way?

642
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,250
我想是会
I think it will.

643
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:34,880
可恶！
Damn it!

644
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:44,220
我老公可不能当不了男人啊
My husband shouldn't lose his manhood.

645
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,260
可恶
Damn it...

646
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:51,140
真是的
You little...

647
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:52,230
不对
No.

648
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,900
喂，姜智媛跟我说
Kang Ji-won told me

649
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,360
你是太监
that you were sterile.

650
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:00,070
你在胡说什么？
What are you talking about?

651
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:03,530
你当不了男人！
You're shooting blanks!

652
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:05,950
要我讲简单一点吗？
Want me to spell it out?

653
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,990
我不是流产
I didn't miscarry.

654
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,160
我不曾怀孕过
I was never pregnant.

655
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:13,750
你听懂了吗？
Do you get it now?

656
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:19,670
你别想
I don't think so.

657
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:22,840
- 竟敢… - 放开我，你这个混蛋！
- You little... - Let go, you bastard!

658
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,510
- 给我过来！- 放手！
- Come here! - Let go!

659
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:25,630
我叫你放手！
Let go of me!

660
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,100
- 滚开！- 滚开！
- Get lost! - Get lost!

661
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,850
杨珠兰科长的离婚诉讼 似乎会变得容易许多
I think Ms. Yang's divorce suit will get easier.

662
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:59,270
作为成立通奸罪证据的存储卡影像 不知道为什么复原了
The evidence of the affair on the SD card, I don't know why, but it's been restored.

663
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:02,110
- 突然间吗？- 对
- Suddenly? - Yes.

664
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:05,650
本来就是无缘无故没有影像
The video didn't work for no reason.

665
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:07,990
突然之间又无缘无故好了
It suddenly worked for no reason too.

666
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:12,660
会成的事就是会成 看来他们是注定要离婚
I guess they're just meant to get a divorce.

667
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:33,050
朴敏焕先生离世，仅此转达讣闻 地点：唯一医院殡仪馆

我查看了警方的报告

669
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,790
他的死因是摔倒在玻璃桌上 头部撞到桌脚
He fell over a glass table and died after hitting his head.

670
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:11,260
由于现场留有证据，警方认定 郑秀敏是头号嫌犯，正在寻找中
With the evidence, the police are looking for Jeong Su-min as the prime suspect.

671
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,760
可是监视器没有运作
But the security cameras didn't work,

672
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:17,310
还需要再查明确切情形
so they must find out what happened.

673
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,520
你要去…
Are you going...

674
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,190
参加丧礼吗？
to the funeral?

675
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:49,960
我曾经想过要是你死了就好了
I thought about how nice it would be if you died.

676
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:52,090
在我气到快死
I thought I'd burst of anger then.

677
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:57,600
当失望变成绝望
Back when those disappointing times

00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,180

你今天好美
You look so beautiful today.

680
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,230
可恶
This little...

681
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:07,690
滚开！
Get lost!

682
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:08,770
去死
Just die.

683
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:17,570
我想了一整夜，怎么想也想不通 你为何要对我那样
I spent all night wondering why you were like that to me.

684
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:20,410
没想到却这样结束了
But it ended like this.

685
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:44,100
你怎么敢来这里？
How dare you come here?

686
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,860
要不是你背叛我们家敏焕
If you didn't betray Min-hwan,

687
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:57,780
他就不会跟秀敏那女人结婚了
he never would've married Su-min.

688
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:01,830
她杀了我儿子
She killed my son.

689
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:05,710
坏女人
That wench.

690
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,790
怎么会…
How could this...

691
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:16,470
她毁了我宝贝儿子的人生
She ruined my precious son's life!

692
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,350
我可怜的孩子
My poor boy!

24日在京畿道加丰面的一家民宿中

696
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,160
这是行销一组的郑秀敏吧？
Isn't this Jeong Su-min from marketing?

697
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,710
之前那个
Don't you remember?

698
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:48,750
不是吧，只是长得像吧
No, they just look alike.

699
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:52,130
那你是说死掉的丈夫是朴敏焕吗？
Are you saying Min-hwan's dead?

700
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:53,960
你在说什么？嘘
What? Keep it down.

701
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:56,090
我听说是耶
I hear it's him.

702
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:57,050
喂
Hey...

703
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,720
怎么回事？
What's this?

704
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:13,360
朴敏焕的父母报案遭窃 小偷趁他们不在时进来
Park Min-hwan's parents reported a theft. A thief came in while they were away.

705
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:15,860
看来是郑秀敏
It was Jeong Su-min.

706
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:31,330
那表示她在首尔
That means she's in Seoul.

707
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,670
警方通缉 加丰面民宿杀人案的嫌犯郑秀敏
It's been a day since the police put out an APB

708
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,920
已经过了一天

709
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:42,050
依旧没能掌握到她的行踪
but her exact whereabouts are still unknown.

710
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:44,430
- 警方认为… - 没关系
- The police - It's fine.

711
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:47,140
目前她关掉手机，躲避搜查，逃亡中
assume she's off the grid and on the run

712
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:51,440
并且表示需要国民积极关注本案

713
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:58,610
嫌犯身高160公分，身材瘦弱
The suspect is 160 cm tall with a lean physique

714
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:02,700
涉嫌在加丰面的一家民宿 杀害丈夫朴姓男子
and under suspicion of killing her husband at a pension.

715
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:11,370
可是我有点不安
But I feel uneasy.

716
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:16,040
你太善良了，所以你也许不知道
You're too nice, so you wouldn't know.

717
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,800
但就是有些人不懂得适可而止
Some people don't know when to stop.

718
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:29,640
如果不把他们彻底狠狠踩在脚底下
Unless you stomp on them completely,

719
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:33,150
他们不会停止
they don't stop.

01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:44,410
你不能丢下我，独自幸福，智媛
You can't be the only one who's happy, Ji-won.

721
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:48,950
绝对不行
Never.

722
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:24,280
我做了什么？
What did I do?

723
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,070
- 你有证据吗？- 接受惩罚吧
- Do you have proof? - Pay for what you did.

724
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,120
我不会软弱
I will stay strong.

725
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,160
我也会再加把劲
I'll try a little harder too.

726
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:35,120
她买稀释液，表示她要纵火
She bought thinner. That means she'll set a fire.

727
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,460
不让她来有什么用？
What's the use of stopping her from coming?

728
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:40,920
我们已经照你想做的去做了 这次让我照我想做的去做吧
We did what you wanted. Let me do what I want this time.

729
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:44,260
事到如今，还能怎么样？
We can't do anything about it now.

730
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,180

我真的是为了你，学了各种东西

732
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,140
姜智媛，我要杀了你！
I'm going to kill you!

733
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:53,850
这是你造孽的代价 也是我打造的地狱
This is the price for your sins and hell I made for you.

734
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:54,890
接受吧
Take it.
