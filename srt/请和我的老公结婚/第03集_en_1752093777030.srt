1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,000
You are waiting there

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,170
Hey

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,470
Yo

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,300
There is express delivery

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:15,770
where…

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,680
(Bomb me)

8
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,100
Hello, did you order the hot original fried chicken?

9
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,270
Spicy fried chicken

10
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,100
Is there any fried chicken in salty sauce?

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,320
No

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,730
Do you want some fried chicken?

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,490
Why would I order fried chicken?

14
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,690
Come on, let's start over.

15
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,990
Oh, I said it wrong.

16
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,490
It's hot original fried chicken, hot spicy sauce fried chicken
Fried chicken with salty sauce

17
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,290
There is also a large portion of fries and a free Coke.

18
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,750
-Excuse me, that...
-gentlemen

19
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,920
We didn't order any food, please leave

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,340
Please wait a moment

21
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,004
It's not Coke, it's soda?

22
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,840
Sir, I said we didn't order any food.

23
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,509
Please leave

24
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,552
Didn't you order fried chicken?

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,890
That’s right, isn’t this number 401?

26
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,520
No matter what your number is, just go.

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,730
I have to confirm it.

28
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,850
Why are you like this?

29
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,400
You pissed me off.

30
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,980
How? What do you want?

31
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,570
But it should be here, right?

32
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,660
I'll go check it out. Please wait here for a moment.

33
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Whether you want to confirm or not, don't come again

34
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,830
- I'll come back later.
-Don't come here, go away!

35
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,210
Get out of here, hey!

36
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,500
etc.

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,500
Hey, Kang Ji-won, hello!

38
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,630
What is this?

39
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,760
Kang Ji-won, open the door

40
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,560
I think we shouldn't be like this now.

41
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,140
What? What are you talking about? Hey!

42
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,020
I'm not delivering fried chicken.
I'm Park Min-hwan, open the door

43
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,530
Open the door, hey

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,700
I'm really confused by your attitude today.

45
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,120
What do you think about our relationship?

46
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,290
What are you thinking?

47
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,540
Are you possessed?

48
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,880
This is not like your usual self, hey!

49
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Open the door, what's wrong with you lately?

50
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,380
I need some time
If you have any difficulties, you can tell me

51
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,550
I will accept your opinion 100%

52
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,430
Who is she kidding?

53
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,030
I'm leaving. You're really going too far.

54
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,430
Kang Ji-won

55
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,520
Are you listening?

56
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,770
I didn't think you were easy to get.

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,110
I love your inner self more

58
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,200
To be honest, you are skinny and nothing good to look at.

59
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,990
Don't get me wrong.

60
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,830
Anyway…

61
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,830
I'm not good today

62
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,460
Good night

63
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,350
It was almost tragic.

64
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,030
hateful

65
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,910
Damn

66
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,840
Ouch

67
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,720
He left, if he didn't come out
I was planning to go in again.

68
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,630
I did a good job, right?

69
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,340
well done

70
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,220
Feels like a spy, not bad.

71
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,270
But what is going on?

72
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,150
that…

73
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,150
Should I leave?

74
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,200
Episode 3

75
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,620
Hello

76
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,330
You really are

77
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,540
Where did you suddenly go with the fried chicken?

78
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,380
Do you know how busy I am when I have to cook and deliver food?

79
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,340
Brother Zhihe wants me to go over immediately

80
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,340
Hello

81
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,630
So…

82
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,670
You lost it

83
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,630
- You should get there faster.
- You lost it

84
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,970
- You lost it
- I thought you ran away

85
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,060
You really are

86
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,100
But why so sudden?

87
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,100
I don't know

88
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,560
He asked me to pretend to deliver food to the wrong house.

89
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,400
There seems to be something hidden

90
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
What's the secret?

91
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,360
This morning he suddenly asked me to help find someone

92
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,950
I made more than a hundred calls.

93
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,030
-You need someone?
-right

94
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,240
-Why?
-I have no idea

95
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,870
He suddenly became like this

96
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,790
I dare not ask him

97
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,680
You really should be an artist.

98
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,100
I don't dare to stand in front of the public

99
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,400
Your problem lies here

100
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,650
Too timid...

101
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,030
I mean be cautious.

102
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,700
If you were a little more shameless, we would make a lot of money.

103
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,740
If you go on TV and do this

104
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,240
And this

105
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,580
and this

106
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,700
Our turnover will definitely soar

107
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,290
That's right

108
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,170
I may not be able to come to work this Sunday
I've already spoken to the sous chef.

109
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,090
What's up? Are you going on a blind date?

110
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,800
Are you going to open up?

111
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,800
No, not like that.

112
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,640
I have a high school reunion

113
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,970
What?

114
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,930
Are you going?

115
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,400
You are not heartbroken by your first love
So you don’t even want to think of your high school classmates?

116
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,570
You confessed and got rejected, right?

117
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,700
It's not easy to reject you.

118
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,200
Really

119
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,580
But how did you find out about the class reunion?

120
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,040
You haven't contacted anyone.

121
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,410
that…

122
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,010
(U&K, Minister Liu Zhihe)

123
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,170
Excuse me

124
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,590
Are you free on Sunday?

125
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,440
You seem like a nice person.

126
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,360
But I have a girlfriend.

127
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,280
-terribly sorry
-What?

128
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,900
No, what are you thinking about?

129
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,320
That's not what I meant. Absolutely not.

130
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,790
There was a high school reunion

131
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,920
A man told me that there was a class reunion

132
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,830
But I don't know who he is

133
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,420
He is obviously not my classmate

134
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,170
Sounds suspicious.

135
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,720
It's best not to get involved at this time.

136
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,720
Unless you want to see your first love, don't go.

137
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,730
What happened to me?

138
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,940
You really shouldn't do that.

139
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,690
Don't talk to me anymore.

140
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,490
Do you want to see her?

141
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,490
Because you were hurt by the rejection.
So I don't want to fall in love

142
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,530
Wearing a fake ring

143
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,250
Right? I shouldn't go there, okay?

144
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,130
If you're going, be sure to...

145
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,540
Dress up

146
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,080
not good

147
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,860
Honestly, I'm sad today.

148
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,110
You'll pay for this at Gusuting on Sunday.

149
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,240
Don't be late

150
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,740
Dressing up is not something that can be done overnight

151
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,750
(Sunday)

152
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,720
Is my other half on the way?
Today is our date

153
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,220
Don't be late, dress nicely

154
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,850
Although becoming beautiful is not something that can be achieved overnight

155
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,020
But I think it's beautiful.

156
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:15,280
(Guse Pavilion)

157
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,740
(The 37th reunion of Busan Taeha High School)

158
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,750
Zheng Xiumin, isn’t this Zheng Xiumin?

159
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,710
How did you become so beautiful?

160
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,380
She was beautiful.

161
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,470
My lovely girl, you haven't changed at all.

162
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,930
Hey, Xiumin is here, let's have a drink

163
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,010
Come have a drink

164
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Sit down

165
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,020
Busan Taeha High School, come on!

166
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,440
After Xiumin joined a big company
It feels a little different.

167
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,740
How should I put it? She looks like a capable urban woman.

168
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,530
I'm lucky.

169
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,580
Jiwon also supports me

170
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,950
Are you still playing with her?

171
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,080
She is my other half.

172
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,460
You are too soft-hearted, and you are still being taken advantage of.

173
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,960
How is that woman doing?

174
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,340
Am I still relying on you in a very poor way?

175
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,840
She is just plain

176
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,010
But she has become much prettier recently.

177
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,510
And Zhiyuan will come over later. I asked her to come.

178
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,310
Wait, she's coming here?

179
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,480
Wait for her to come over, and be nice to her.

180
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,440
She's been in a bad mood lately.

181
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,810
Why are you in a bad mood?

182
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,950
I'm not recommending her.
Should she be sent to U&K as a contract employee?

183
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,620
After she came to work
I seem to have a crush on Park Min-hwan

184
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,080
Isn’t the person you’re flirting with Park Min-hwan?

185
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,620
Is it the same person?

186
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,210
Um?

187
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,330
Oh, that...

188
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,090
No, it's not like that.

189
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,260
Don't mention this to Jiwon for a while.

190
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,220
-Don't mention it.
-What don't you mention?

191
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,100
That girl started again?

192
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,980
(Other half)

193
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,020
Hello? Ji Won

194
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,610
Xiumin, where are you?

195
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,620
If you can't find it, I'll bring you here.

196
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,630
I'm coming, behind you

197
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,430
Ji Won

198
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,770
What's going on?

199
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,560
Aren't we just the two of us having dinner?

200
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,980
Long time no see everyone

201
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,000
Dressing up is not something that can be done overnight

202
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,970
Agent Jiang

203
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,350
You said you had an appointment on Sunday

204
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,310
So do you want to go out with me tomorrow?

205
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,230
(Saturday)

206
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,700
(Stock balance: 1,403,000 KRW)

207
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,950
It's over 1.4 million won.

208
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,710
That means I invested 3 million won
It will become 6 million won

209
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,960
Wait for next month's salary to come in

210
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,420
I'm gonna put it all in.

211
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,630
(Ossendyk)

212
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,450
What are you doing?

213
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,950
The difference is bigger than I thought

214
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,720
No wonder the minister told me not to wear it.

215
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,840
Kang Ji Won is such an idiot

216
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,520
(2011)

217
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,900
What a nice view

218
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,570
Ji Won

219
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,870
Sorry, I'm late.

220
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,120
No, it's okay.

221
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,170
You are so beautiful today
You wore the clothes I bought for you

222
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,340
Today is this, clang clang

223
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,550
Couple hats

224
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,560
You also wear

225
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,020
It suits you very well and looks good.

226
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,560
Thanks

227
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,810
I wish I could wear glasses like you.

228
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,400
It looks better without wearing it

229
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,030
You have no confidence again. You are beautiful, very beautiful.

230
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,620
Where's Min-hwan?

231
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,870
He will be here soon

232
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,540
It's a nice day today. It's hot.

233
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,040
Give me sweet and sour candy

234
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,470
Sorry, I finished eating last time and forgot to buy it again

235
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:16,220
What? You know I like that.

236
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,100
Feel sorry

237
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,360
What happened? Did Ji-won make Xiu-min cry again?

238
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,280
Min-hwan, Ji-won said she doesn't have sweet and sour candy
She knows I like to eat that

239
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,370
If she had the heart, she would have prepared in advance.

240
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,620
I'm so sad

241
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,830
Why are you like this?

242
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,330
I knew this would happen, so I bought it.

243
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,460
Sweet and sour candy!

244
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,170
-Minhwan is so nice
-well done

245
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,760
-Should we go flower viewing?
-Okay, remember to take your stuff.

246
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,350
- Come here
-good

247
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,680
etc.

248
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,480
Wow, it's really beautiful

249
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,400
-Are you here?
-Um

250
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,780
- Jiwon, look there, isn’t it beautiful?
-Um

251
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,750
The long-awaited date with my benefactor

252
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,580
Oh, sorry.

253
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,330
No, that's okay.

254
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,000
Ossendic…

255
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,340
This is a gift from Xiumin.

256
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,970
This is not Ossendic, it's a fake

257
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,680
I just found out

258
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,560
This is true, right?

259
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,270
Yes, the real thing

260
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,280
The sheen is totally different, isn't it?

261
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,110
It's really beautiful

262
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Thank you, isn't it beautiful?

263
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Benefactor, why didn’t you drink before?

264
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,160
How nice it would be to drink together

265
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,290
I don't drink? I can drink a lot.

266
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,170
You said last time that you don't drink

267
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,630
You said you drank and got into trouble as a kid

268
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,420
So I decided not to drink it.

269
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,640
Have I? In trouble?

270
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,100
How are you?

271
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,610
I didn't drink before

272
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,530
But Park Min-hwan makes me sad
So I...

273
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,240
God

274
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,580
So you're saying that you were involved because of Agent Park
Start drinking again?

275
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,450
Not now, maybe in about five years.

276
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,080
I think drinking in moderation is fine.

277
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,260
There is no need to avoid drinking such good things for fear of getting into trouble.

278
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,090
-Would you like some fried dumplings?
-good

279
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,260
- Boss, we want six fried dumplings
-good

280
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,930
Drinking caused trouble
To me, it seems like a big deal

281
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,770
I don't remember it at all

282
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,900
Why do I live so timidly?
Keep reflecting on yourself?

283
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,400
Fried dumplings are here

284
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,860
Thanks

285
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,990
I envy you.

286
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,610
Cheerful and healthy

287
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,200
You look a lot like your name.

288
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,580
That's right

289
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,040
My name Xiyan sounds like Xiyuan, so it's not a bad fate.

290
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,370
Therefore, "establishing happy connections with others"

291
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,830
That's my motto

292
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,960
I see

293
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,630
Benefactor, let's have a toast

294
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,550
- Happy
-fate

295
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,600
Try it now, it's delicious.

296
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,560
-Eat it right away?
-right

297
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,810
Right now?

298
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,650
Delicious, right? Super delicious, right?

299
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,610
Super delicious, right?

300
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,360
No matter how much I think about it,

301
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,240
It's so right that we meet today

302
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,910
On Sundays, you have to think about going to work tomorrow.
There is no way to drink as much as you want

303
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,070
That's right

304
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,410
Didn’t you say you had a class reunion tomorrow?

305
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,960
-Should we exercise some moderation?
-Oh, that

306
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,290
I haven't decided whether to go yet.

307
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,970
In fact, I was not only unpopular before

308
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,170
But being bullied

309
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,090
What? You're being bullied?

310
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,300
Why?

311
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,810
Don't know

312
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,980
They suddenly hate me

313
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,190
So I became timid

314
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,150
More mistakes due to fear

315
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,440
As a result, everyone hates me even more

316
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,360
You should ask them why they do this.

317
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,570
How can I ask?

318
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,830
How do you know what others are thinking if you don’t ask?

319
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:50,210
Although I am the kind of person who would want to run away if things get too difficult.

320
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,920
But I still think that before that
Do everything you can.

321
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,460
You have to know that the other party is an unreasonable lunatic

322
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,130
Or is there any reason?

323
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,140
I won't have any lumps in my heart

324
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,720
Won't there be any pimples?

325
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,390
right

326
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,020
Such a matter of course
Why haven't I thought about it?

327
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,940
Zheng Xiumin is so kind

328
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,030
When Jiang Zhiyuan was in high school...

329
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,530
Wisdom, etc.

330
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,610
Jiang Zhiyuan was not at her seat just now

331
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,870
I have to listen to the conversation that follows.

332
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,950
Yes

333
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,000
If I don't want to feel uncomfortable, I should go

334
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,590
What's wrong?

335
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,680
Turning the shameful past into a glorious history

336
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,970
Easier said than done

337
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,600
People like me
It's not something that can change overnight.

338
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,430
Although it is true

339
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,810
But you can try hard

340
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,940
-effort?
-Steady and steady, everything will go well

341
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,530
Those who are fully prepared will not fail

342
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,660
What are you doing

343
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,120
I really like eating dumplings

344
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,170
I'll take it home and heat it up.

345
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,890
Benefactor, I can finally repay you.

346
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,200
Hello

347
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,030
Hee-yeon, long time no see

348
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,540
This is my favorite boss at work.

349
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,660
Hello

350
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,710
Hello, I am designer Song Caimin

351
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,460
Then let's come in.

352
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,340
OK, let's go

353
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:08,800
I will pay the bill today with the membership voucher I bought

354
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,220
- No, Hee-yeon
-Shh

355
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,310
benefactor

356
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,430
Please concentrate

357
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,730
The membership voucher will expire if not used today?

358
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,730
Very good

359
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:21,520
It would be bad if we didn't have this person to use it.

360
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,570
Your hair is very healthy, any hairstyle is suitable for you

361
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,400
Want an S-shaped perm?

362
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,910
Or water wave type?

363
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,700
If the shape changes too much suddenly

364
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,580
Maybe I was misunderstood and reincarnated.

365
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:38,540
Just a little wave, and also curl the eyelashes

366
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,000
- And get your eyebrows trimmed
-etc

367
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,880
I want to be reborn

368
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,140
OK, I got it

369
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,980
Then you will be reborn today

370
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,060
And reparted her hair.

371
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,190
besides…

372
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,360
To make up

373
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,280
Is Director Nan here?

374
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,570
I asked her to come over

375
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,360
I'll let you see in the mirror today

376
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,700
You've never seen yourself

377
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,310
An ordinary person who is not as mature as you

378
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,850
Judging everything by appearance

379
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,520
If you want something, you need to dress accordingly.

380
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,900
This is just the beginning

381
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,850
Perfect

382
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,730
It suits you so well

383
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,070
Good for you

384
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,900
So beautiful, do you like it?

385
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,050
How about this?

386
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,270
Awesome!

387
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,730
Classics never go out of fashion

388
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,700
Never mind, maybe next time.

389
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,320
Why? This is great.

390
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,490
Someone else is going to receive this.

391
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,170
You bastard, you sprayed all over my meat

392
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,460
Do you have a cold?

393
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,050
I was choked by the smoke, not by a cold.

394
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,510
What? Your girlfriend doesn't answer the phone.
You won't call back?

395
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,390
I'm not calling Kang Ji Won

396
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,190
The real master is to leave it alone

397
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,020
(Call record: Jiang Zhiyuan)

398
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,730
(Not connected)

399
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,280
As long as you leave her alone, she will start to think a lot

400
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,070
Once you start thinking too much, you will surrender.

401
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,410
- You don't understand
-Help

402
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,450
You see

403
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,370
Do you need my help?

404
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,580
Hammock?

405
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,380
I'm good at setting up a hammock

406
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,500
Want to spread it out? One, two, three

407
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,140
You guys come over for barbecue later.

408
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,150
But that woman lasted longer than I expected.

409
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,900
You're going to die anyway.

410
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,700
Get out of here!

411
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,120
The dumplings are cold.

412
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,120
Excuse me, I want more dumplings...

413
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,760
Thank you, Hee-yeon

414
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,850
That quick cooking bag

415
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,770
I'll help you deal with it.

416
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,730
Joined Yang Zhulan and Zheng Xiumin as members

417
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,060
Make up for your deficiencies

418
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,070
Has he seen my business proposal?

419
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,820
Join Zheng Xiumin as a team member?

420
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,570
Could it be that...

421
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,080
Did you forget that we have an appointment tomorrow?
Guse Pavilion, 5:30

422
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,540
(good)

423
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
Hello?

424
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,630
Ji Won, it's me

425
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,600
What are you doing today?

426
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,890
I went to eat spicy rice cakes with Xiyan today

427
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,230
Now she is sleeping

428
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,810
Liu Xiyan is at your house? Why?

429
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,110
We were chatting and then she fell asleep

430
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,110
We also had some wine.

431
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,490
Hello?

432
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,990
Why don't you look for me?

433
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,620
Did I do anything to upset you?

434
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,210
No, have you done anything to offend me?

435
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,550
No

436
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,800
I have something to ask of you, so I'm calling you.

437
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,010
What's up?

438
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,730
you…

439
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,400
this…

440
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,980
Isn’t there a quick-cooking meal package project?

441
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,690
Really good

442
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,070
That's pretty good.

443
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,940
I'll revise it a bit and submit it again

444
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,610
Could I revise it a bit and submit it?

445
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,990
how?

446
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,960
No, that's my project.

447
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:19,040
Why? Weren't you rejected?
I feel I can succeed

448
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,170
I have to get a full-time job.

449
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,960
Let's grow together, my friend.

450
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,130
You should have told me earlier.

451
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,300
If I knew

452
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,180
I won't modify it.

453
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,730
Sorry, I'll tell you next time when I have a good idea

454
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,480
besides…

455
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,280
I don't feel good about you calling me by my first name in the office

456
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,570
Although we are friends, we are at different levels.

457
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:50,950
There is also a difference in experience
You ask me to make coffee, give me orders

458
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,280
Seems a bit over

459
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,580
Let's keep public and private affairs separate, okay?

460
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,340
-What?
- I'm going to hang up now, see you tomorrow

461
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,640
What?

462
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,100
How dare Jiang Zhiyuan do this to me?

463
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,070
I rescheduled all my appointments for you.
I'm going to attend the class reunion tomorrow.

464
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,150
See you tomorrow, little girl

465
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,360
I love you, see you tomorrow

466
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,870
I also bought some beautiful earrings to show Ruizhi.

467
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,870
In conclusion

468
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:40,670
A little carelessness
She forgot how bad she was before.

469
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,250
It doesn't matter

470
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,500
If she doesn't understand, I can teach her again.

471
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,920
You must remember to wear the earrings I gave you tomorrow

472
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,350
(Proposal for quick-cooking meal kits in the one-person household era)

473
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,100
Here, the fried chicken is here, come over here

474
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,900
What did your mother say?

475
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,940
I told her I was with the section chief and she said okay.

476
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,610
My mom is really

477
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,030
I'm 31 years old, and there's still access control?

478
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,910
That's because you're so beautiful.

479
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,120
She's so worried.

480
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,660
Speaking of women

481
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,130
It's better to be cared for and raised

482
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,590
Come

483
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,510
What’s the point of my mother raising me like this?

484
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,600
To meet a man as reliable as you
To continue living this life

485
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,560
Yeah, yeah.

486
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,400
Now that we've finished talking about business

487
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,240
-You really are my brother, right?
-etc

488
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,910
Of course

489
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,700
Start now

490
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,240
I really am your brother.

491
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,250
(Proposer: Marketing Agent 1, Kang Ji-won)

492
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,500
Come

493
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,950
(Guse Pavilion)

494
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,590
Hello? Ji Won

495
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,630
Xiumin, where are you?

496
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,600
If you can't find it, I'll bring you here.

497
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,850
I'm coming, behind you

498
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,110
Ji Won

499
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,200
What's going on? Aren't we the only two eating?

500
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,130
Long time no see everyone

501
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,640
Wow, what's going on?

502
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,350
The ugly duckling Kang Ji-won has become so beautiful?

503
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:48,350
I don't remember who you are
So it's like our first meeting.

504
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
You are so rude.

505
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,190
Is that so? I'm so sorry.

506
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,320
I was too reckless.

507
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,650
He never changed.

508
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,070
I was very reckless in high school.

509
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,070
- I'm still just as reckless now
- Really

510
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,490
You even imitate Xiumin in wearing earrings

511
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,950
What's the point of being polite?

512
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,580
Earrings?

513
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,460
It's different

514
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,590
This looks more advanced.

515
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:22,510
That looks a bit rough.

516
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,770
Is that a fake?

517
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,810
Wow, are you imitating her?

518
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,650
Xiumin, you should buy the genuine product.

519
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,770
There are a lot of fakes lately that are very good.

520
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,690
Oh, you can buy fake goods even if you don’t have money.

521
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,150
(five hours ago)

522
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,420
Makeup is also a skill, practice more and you will improve

523
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,600
My benefactor, where are the fakes...

524
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,350
wrong

525
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,940
Counterfeit goods

526
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,310
There are S-class, A-class, B-class, etc.

527
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,900
This is a level of insincerity.

528
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,070
A level of insincerity?

529
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:22,410
There's no sincerity in pretending to be genuine.
No sincerity counterfeit

530
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,370
There is only one intention for giving such a gift.

531
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:32,540
Embarrass you

532
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,880
-no…
- Come have a drink

533
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,590
You definitely have more than one trick

534
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,340
To highlight that I learn from you

535
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:46,050
Compare it with mine.
Yours is like the original

536
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,560
-I‥
-But

537
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,140
What to do?

538
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,940
You wear mine.

539
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,020
I seem to have made a real friend

540
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,650
Excuse me

541
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,900
Kang Ji-won is really amazing

542
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,270
No one who is familiar with her dares to come

543
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,020
She must be here to eat meat.

544
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,320
Looking at her dress, she looks very poor.

545
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,830
Kang Ji-won is really amazing

546
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,990
No one who is familiar with her dares to come

547
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,580
She must be here to show off.

548
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,920
Looking at her clothes, it seems that everything she bought was new.

549
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,340
Why are you speaking in Seoul accent all of a sudden? So corny

550
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,340
By the way, why is she still playing with Xiumin?

551
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,550
Can't you tell it at a glance?

552
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,130
Xiumin, that innocent child, is so kind to her.

553
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,550
She sticks to Xiumin and takes away everything that belongs to her

554
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,510
Really annoying

555
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,220
She is really amazing.

556
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,730
Zheng Xiumin is so kind

557
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,810
We should take care of her.

558
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,980
You see, when Kang Ji-won was in high school...

559
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,440
Wisdom, etc.

560
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,570
What's wrong?

561
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,700
Jiang Zhiyuan was not at her seat just now

562
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,450
Have you always been here?

563
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,910
-Why are you pretending not to be there? You...
- Could it be

564
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,000
I'll come in first

565
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,330
When I hear you coming in, should I go to greet you?

566
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,720
Don't worry about me, just keep talking.

567
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,060
I'm curious too

568
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,020
How have I treated Xiumin since high school?

569
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,520
Don't you know?

570
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,110
As long as it's Xiumin's
You want to learn from her.

571
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,940
Aren’t the earrings you’re wearing now imitating Xiumin?

572
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,860
This one?

573
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,700
Xiumin gave me earrings

574
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,540
But it's fake

575
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,250
Very obvious

576
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,460
So I bought the real thing myself

577
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,130
But they are still couple earrings of the same style
Isn’t it?

578
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,140
I still want to know

579
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:16,060
What else do I want from Xiumin?

580
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,350
man

581
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,560
I heard that you have a crush on Xiumin
Park Min-hwan or something else?

582
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,560
People don't change

583
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:28,440
Xiumin and Eunho dated in high school
Didn’t you also ask them to break up?

584
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,110
I want Xiumin to break up with Eunho?

585
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,410
Have they dated?

586
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,870
Park Min-hwan is Xiumin's ambiguous object?

587
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,120
She recommended you to work as a contract employee in a big company like U&K

588
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,170
You also stole her ambiguous object

589
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,750
That's too much.

590
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:49,420
I really can't continue talking to you.

591
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,630
-What did you say?
-Hello

592
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,510
If you only listen to one side
Such a bad attitude towards people

593
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,310
You should at least check the facts.

594
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,940
Listen carefully

595
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,780
(U&K, represented by Kang Ji-won)

596
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,740
I am an agent for U&K

597
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,950
I heard that contract employees also have business cards.

598
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,990
Are you lying?
How can we trust you?

599
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:19,490
I have been in the company for seven years.
When did Xiumin join the company?

600
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:24,750
I remember it was my second year as an agent.
Recommend Xiumin to come in

601
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,670
-About last year or so?
-Oh my god, yes

602
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:31,210
I often met with her to ask about her resume.
So I know it was at the beginning of last year

603
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,380
The strangest thing is

604
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,260
About Park Min-hwan

605
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,560
He is my boyfriend

606
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,980
(Park Minhwan)

607
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,900
(Amplified)

608
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,950
Hello? Honey

609
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,320
Honey, I'm at the class reunion.
Did you call me?

610
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,530
Um?

611
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,370
I didn't call you so that you can have fun without worrying about it.

612
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:02,790
I must have pressed it accidentally.

613
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,130
Oh, that's it,

614
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,590
Say hello to my friends.

615
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,420
friend?

616
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,180
Hello

617
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:21,260
Hello, I am Jiang Zhiyuan's friend

618
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:24,100
Are you really Kang Ji-won's boyfriend?

619
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,440
Hello, I'm Jiang Zhiyuan's boyfriend
My name is Park Min-hwan

620
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,480
Except Xiumin
I haven't heard of her other friends.

621
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,900
Please take good care of our Ji-won

622
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,070
I should tell you...

623
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,570
Hello? Hey

624
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,410
What is this?

625
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,370
Is that ok?

626
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,390
Ji Won

627
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,650
-where are you going?
-you…

628
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:09,980
Hello, Kang Ji-won!

629
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,110
Okay, forget about the other things.

630
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,650
But no matter how young you are

631
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,240
You can't just like your friend's boyfriend.
Just ask them to break up?

632
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,130
Classmates, don't do this.

633
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:36,800
Don't bully your classmates. Don't do this.

634
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,880
Very dirty

635
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,300
Oh, I almost forgot

636
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,100
That thing is weird too.

637
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,600
I like Eun-ho, that's right.

638
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,770
But Xiumin has never dated Eunho.

639
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,690
Have you ever dated Eunho?

640
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,120
that…

641
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,920
I'm sorry, Ji-won, I didn't tell you then.

642
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,210
I know you like Eunho

643
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,920
How can I tell you that I'm dating him?

644
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:28,020
What are you talking about?
Didn’t you say I wanted you to break up?

645
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,770
Shouldn't I know that you guys are dating?

646
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,730
I was wrong

647
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,780
We are dating in secret, so I didn't tell you.

648
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,200
Do I know it or not?

649
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:47,160
Oh, it's so scary, Kang Ji-won is so fierce

650
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,750
You have no friends because of your bad temper.

651
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:53,250
-Why do you care so much?
-Because you care, so I care

652
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,710
Because I don't care

653
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,800
You have forgotten your three years
How did you bully me?

654
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:04,300
Even now I take out my business card to clarify

655
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,350
You're still just saying I have a bad temper

656
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,640
Does anyone know if that business card is fake?

657
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,480
The bag you're carrying is fake.

658
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,020
What are you talking about, girl?

659
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,230
This is when I got my first salary.

660
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,820
Go to the department store
12-month installment payment for genuine products

661
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,280
No, forget it.

662
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,410
You're really funny.

663
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:28,370
Randomly guessing that others are fake

664
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,540
And then just say no?

665
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,910
What else can I say?

666
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,960
You should apologize and say sorry!

667
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,790
It is you who should apologize!

668
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,470
Because of Zheng Xiumin's words

669
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,630
You bullied me for three whole years.

670
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,640
Do you still want to do this at a class reunion that you haven’t had for a long time?

671
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:53,640
Also correct

672
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:57,860
If you just want to bully me
You certainly don't want to apologize, do you?

673
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,480
How could I have that?

674
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,440
I am a fair person.

675
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,620
So you don't mean
Didn't Xiumin and Eunho date?

676
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,450
The person involved said they were in a relationship, why do you say they weren’t?

677
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,420
I don't know anything else

678
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:34,640
But I can tell you one thing for sure.

679
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,270
Zheng Xiumin and I

680
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,610
Never dated

681
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,460
Long time no see, Kang Ji Won

682
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,640
What are you talking about?

683
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:15,770
No

684
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,860
-sorry
- Explain clearly

685
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,730
This is a promise

686
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,030
To break the agreement

687
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:28,570
There must be a proper reason

688
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,870
I can’t understand, how can I ask for forgiveness from the other party?

689
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,080
I can't explain it clearly

690
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,080
Because don't

691
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,830
So don't

692
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:42,630
Who are you

693
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:46,050
The person who will inherit the U&K Group

694
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:49,090
Once you inherit the company and make your decision

695
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,890
You're telling people I can't explain it clearly.
No means no

696
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,060
Is this how you plan to run your company?

697
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:57,810
After I inherit the company
No one will ask me to explain it clearly

698
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,610
No matter how great you are

699
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,030
They can't beat the combined efforts of the two.

700
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:11,990
Since ancient times, people who have done great things

701
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,700
There must be another half

702
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,740
And it has to be an excellent other half

703
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:19,500
Is this really the case?

704
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,120
Of course, your dad is also...

705
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:29,130
Recent young people

706
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,470
There is a ridiculous idea that it is better not to get married.

707
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:33,800
Do you think so too?

708
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:35,560
I think

709
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,180
marry

710
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,850
I have someone I like.

711
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,150
In conclusion

712
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,900
That's it

713
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:55,910
Is that someone I know?

714
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,460
Which family's daughter is she? What's her name?

715
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,040
I'm unrequited love

716
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:10,590
What did you say?

717
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,260
You asked me to study business administration, and I did.

718
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,260
They asked me to go to the American branch, and I went.

719
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:19,680
You want me to be in charge of food when I come back.
I joined the marketing team.

720
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:22,140
I will do whatever you ask.

721
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,850
this time

722
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,610
Please believe me

723
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,610
How dare you?

724
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,570
Do you think I don't know?

725
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:31,650
Which time have you

726
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,070
Have you ever done something you didn't want to do?

727
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,530
You just don't have any ideas, so just do it.

728
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,040
It has always been like this

729
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,000
Then you should know
I'll do what I want this time too.

730
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,330
Oh, you guy

731
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,890
I have to report this to you, Grandpa.

732
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,060
I have someone I like.

733
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,900
I don't want women's problems

734
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:38,260
Which woman did he fall in love with to do that?

735
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,180
Go and ask around

736
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,390
He never made unnecessary mistakes.

737
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,520
That makes me more scared.

738
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,360
People say that if a person behaves abnormally, he or she is going to die.

739
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,780
Indeed, he would never give up on women.

740
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,650
A stubborn person

741
00:51:58,110 --> 00:51:59,120
So…

742
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,700
What should we do about President Wu?

743
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,870
My son no longer listens to me.

744
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:06,160
Is there any need to talk about grandson?

745
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,790
But these are two different things. No means no.

746
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:13,630
Ever since his mother passed away

747
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,380
He never spoke for a long time.

748
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,390
What happened to him suddenly?

749
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,060
-So…
- Go and ask around

750
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,640
It is better to remove the unnecessary buds as soon as possible.

751
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,450
It's so difficult

752
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,080
There is a class reunion

753
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,490
Class reunion?

754
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,580
Do I know you?

755
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,590
Although I don't know, I think
You should know that there is a class reunion

756
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,210
Why are you telling me this?

757
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,800
Do you remember Kang Ji Won?

758
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:02,050
As far as I know, there was a misunderstanding in high school.

759
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:05,390
If you can, please go to a class reunion.
It would be better if we cleared up the misunderstanding.

760
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:06,890
Misunderstand?

761
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:10,350
Wait, who would this be better for?

762
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,070
It will be better for Kang Ji-won

763
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,570
Please

764
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:30,920
(Guse Pavilion)

765
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:40,630
-Yes, Captain.
- Minister, where are you?

766
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,890
-Are you on your way?
- I'm going over now

767
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:52,350
Isn’t that Bai Enhao?

768
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,190
-Yes, it's Baek Eun-ho
- He's fine.

769
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,730
Hey little bastard, why didn't you answer my call?

770
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,940
Eun-ho, why are you here?

771
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:01,400
No, more importantly

772
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:02,990
you say

773
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,410
You haven't dated Xiumin?

774
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,660
Say

775
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,380
Have you ever liked me?

776
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,880
Then why did you do that back then?

777
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,480
(Guse Pavilion)

778
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,770
She wears it so beautifully

779
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,190
Going to a class reunion?

780
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:39,880
etc.

781
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:43,960
No

782
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,880
So what I want to say is...

783
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,020
Feel sorry

784
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,270
I'll wipe your hands.

785
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,490
What did I do?

786
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,160
I have to go

787
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:20,040
Oh, okay

788
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,710
Wait, wait a minute

789
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,970
Listen to me, what I want to say is...

790
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,470
I never liked you

791
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,220
I just

792
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,010
Just a slip of the tongue

793
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,020
I used to...

794
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,280
Like you!

795
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:44,170
Start now
I won't be so foolish as to stick to just one form anymore

796
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:45,790
You are so beautiful

797
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,670
-Feel sorry
- Made him crazy

798
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,220
So beautiful

799
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,090
You guys bullied her yourselves, why are you blaming me?

800
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,800
Don't worry, my significant other.
I really won't let it go this time.

801
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:59,930
Minister, it's nice to see you smile.

802
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,480
Liu Zhihe seems to be interested in you

803
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,560
Rumor has it that the Minister and Hee-yeon had an affair

804
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,980
Should I tell Ji-won everything?

805
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:10,190
Tell her that Park Min Hwan will have an affair with Jung Soo Min
Then hurt her

806
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:16,080
