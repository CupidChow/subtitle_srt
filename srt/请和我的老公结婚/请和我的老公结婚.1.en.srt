TO ACTUAL PEOPLE, PLACES, INCIDENTS,

5
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:20,471
Cold wind isn't good for you.

6
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:27,937
Ji-won.

7
00:01:29,647 --> 00:01:31,023
You're still so pretty.

8
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:38,406
I won't forgive you if you leave me.

9
00:01:38,614 --> 00:01:40,700
Don't forget you have me.

10
00:01:40,783 --> 00:01:42,993
You have to live a long life with me.

11
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:46,706
Thanks.

12
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:50,710
I got unlucky in my marriage,
but I'm glad I have you.

13
00:01:55,089 --> 00:01:56,799
Why would you say that?

14
00:01:56,882 --> 00:01:58,634
Min-hwan's a great husband.

15
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:02,847
-He's cheating on me.
-What?

16
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,891
He texted me
"I love you" and "I miss you."

17
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:08,936
Then he deleted it right away.

18
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,939
I'm sure it was sent by mistake.

19
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:16,193
Don't get sensitive.

20
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,621
Do you want me to talk to him?

21
00:02:28,706 --> 00:02:31,917
Forget it. I just need you.

22
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:35,588
I only need you too.

23
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:40,718
Let's only think good thoughts.
Okay, my other half?

24
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:48,100
Ms. Kang Ji-won,
it's time to go to the transfusion room.

25
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:53,481
This medicine won't hurt at all.

26
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:55,524
You'll get better once it's done.

27
00:02:55,858 --> 00:02:59,320
Never give up.

28
00:03:08,412 --> 00:03:09,997
CHEMOTHERAPY

29
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:34,730
<i>I can't remember the last time</i>
<i>I was happy.</i>

30
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,149
<i>So why do I miss it so much?</i>

31
00:03:40,194 --> 00:03:41,862
<i>I was given six months.</i>

32
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:44,573
<i>Twelve months, if there was a miracle.</i>

33
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:49,245
It's all pointless now.

34
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:05,302
Great job. You look so beautiful today.

35
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:11,225
You look beautiful.

36
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:14,979
I picked the perfect dress for you!

37
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:26,031
Forget it. You're part of our family now.

38
00:04:26,115 --> 00:04:27,241
You're my daughter.

39
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:31,453
You poor thing.

40
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:35,207
It's not your fault that you didn't
receive proper household discipline.

41
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,794
As your mother, I'll teach you now.

42
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:42,298
You pitiful girl.

43
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:51,724
Min-hwan's the third generation
of families with only sons.

44
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:52,892
Three generations!

45
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:54,935
How dare you sever that?

46
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:56,186
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,108
I took in a worthless girl like you.
Why can't you have kids?

48
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:05,070
Do you even know how to do anything?

49
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:09,950
-Mom, bear with her.
-Let go.

50
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:14,914
What a waste. Sit down.
Why are you so angry?

51
00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:16,874
DUGA HOLDINGS

52
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,877
What? You quit your job?

53
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:21,962
I'm going into stocks.

54
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:23,964
Do you remember Roijental? Look.

55
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:28,010
A few more trades,
and it could change our lives.

56
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:30,930
But I can't trade when I need to
because of work.

57
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:33,140
It won't work for me.

58
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:35,267
We have monthly loan payments!

59
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:37,019
We should've discussed this!

60
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:39,271
Hey! Are you messing with me?

61
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:42,566
Why would I have to discuss this with you?

62
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:45,527
Mom!

63
00:05:46,195 --> 00:05:49,448
Do you think I'll do well?
Do you think I'll hit it big?

64
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:53,285
Of course. My son can do anything.

65
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:56,372
Issues at home?
Does the world revolve around you?

66
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:58,707
Everyone here has issues at home.

67
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,794
This is why married woman shouldn't work.

68
00:06:04,254 --> 00:06:05,631
What are you doing?

69
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:07,633
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:34,952 --> 00:06:36,954
You said you'd fix the lock today.

71
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:38,998
Do I look like a bum?

72
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,752
Working overtime every day

73
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,838
doesn't mean you're good at your job.

74
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:49,425
You're so busy running around
because you're so bad at it.

75
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:51,010
Know your place.

76
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:53,178
Don't you hear the washing machine?

77
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:54,471
I started it,

78
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:56,598
-so you could've taken out--
-Jeez.

79
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:57,516
Hey!

80
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,811
I've been working all day,
and I just sat down.

81
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:02,646
I won't do it.

82
00:07:10,404 --> 00:07:13,032
It's stage 4 gastric cancer.

83
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,160
Things don't look good.

84
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,378
You poor thing.

85
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:28,297
My poor son.

86
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,842
Why did you have to marry her?

87
00:07:32,676 --> 00:07:35,345
This is why you have to pick
people carefully.

88
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:40,142
I thought things were looking up.
How could I be so unlucky?

89
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:42,770
Mom, if Ji-won has cancer,

90
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:44,229
who will make my meals?

91
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:48,192
You're too nice!
Why would you worry about that?

92
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:51,070
People need to work to overcome illness.

93
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:54,073
Technology is advanced these days.
She'll be fine.

94
00:07:55,365 --> 00:07:56,492
Right?

95
00:07:56,825 --> 00:08:00,245
Don't think about telling your company.
Work until you can.

96
00:08:00,537 --> 00:08:05,000
Don't think about acting emotionally
just because you're sick.

97
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,251
It's a nuisance!

98
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,171
Can't they just zap it out?

99
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:12,091
It'll be fine. We've got technology.

100
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:15,135
Cancer is no big deal nowadays.

101
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:22,351
Your therapy is finished.

102
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,274
EPISODE 1

103
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:37,241
Don't worry about your husband's affair.

104
00:08:37,324 --> 00:08:40,119
It's better off without them
when you're older.

105
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:45,541
You're not well.
Don't think about bad things.

106
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,920
You have a great friend.

107
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:51,713
She's so pretty and pleasant.

108
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:59,388
You're right. I have a great friend.

109
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,159
<i>She's a good worker too.</i>

110
00:09:21,535 --> 00:09:22,995
<i>She's a manager at U&K.</i>

111
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:26,165
It's the company I worked at.

112
00:09:50,314 --> 00:09:52,691
To be honest, I lack a lot of things.

113
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,280
Babe!

114
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:13,337
But Su-min was the only one
who stayed by my side.

115
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:26,767
She's always been,

116
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:29,811
and she always will.

117
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:35,067
Ms. Kang Ji-won?

118
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,945
Well...

119
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:42,032
Your guardian must come
if you want to continue treatment.

120
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:45,702
They need to come pay or take you home.

121
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,585
I'm very sorry.

122
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:56,088
Please settle it by the end of the day.

123
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:58,674
<i>The person you are trying to call...</i>

124
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:05,681
Pick up.

125
00:11:10,227 --> 00:11:11,937
<i>The person you are trying...</i>

126
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,522
<i>Did you take the deposit?</i>

127
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:14,898
<i>Answer the phone.</i>

128
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:17,192
<i>I'm begging you. Pick up the phone.</i>

129
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,572
<i>You quit your job after we got married,</i>

130
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:24,908
<i>so I had to support us, but forget that.</i>

131
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:27,035
<i>But at least pay the hospital bills.</i>

132
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,161
<i>Answer the phone.</i>

133
00:11:34,584 --> 00:11:39,298

TAXI
VACANT

135
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:30,098
Heungma-dong, Haeyeong Villa.

136
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,651
Goodness. You must be really sick.

137
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:43,820
You'll get better.

138
00:12:44,404 --> 00:12:46,948
Spring has come.

139
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:48,825
I won't get better.

140
00:12:50,118 --> 00:12:51,370
I'm dying.

141
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:52,788
Stop it.

142
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:54,956
You can't say bad things like that.

143
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:56,792
The doctors told me.

144
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:58,877
It's true.

145
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:01,797
Nothing good can come from living.

146
00:13:02,005 --> 00:13:03,757
Why would you say that?

147
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,303
TAXI DRIVER CERTIFICATION
NAME: CHOI NAM-HYEON

148
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:11,056
My father passed away early.

149
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:13,266
I don't have siblings.

150
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:16,520
I barely have a husband.

151
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,064
No.

152
00:13:20,774 --> 00:13:23,151
It would've been better not to have one.

153
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:27,614
Then...

154
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:32,619
I wouldn't have any debt,
and I'd be able to pay my hospital bills.

155
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:43,338
You need to follow your path
until the very end to know for sure.

156
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:51,471
Excuse me. This isn't the way.

157
00:13:51,555 --> 00:13:55,183
I'll take you down a good path.
Just trust me.

158
00:14:58,038 --> 00:15:00,123
See? We're here.

159
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:02,250
I told you.

160
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,544
The path you know isn't the only one.

161
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:07,797
There are other paths.

162
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:09,424
That path could be better.

163
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,892

165
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:24,856
Thank you.

166
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,775
Wait just a moment.

167
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:39,246
Ma'am?

168
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,918
This is my last day as a taxi driver.

169
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:49,589
Take it. Think of it
as an allowance from your dad.

170
00:15:50,423 --> 00:15:52,217
You'll gain energy in no time.

171
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,803
You'll be running around,
making big money.

172
00:15:55,512 --> 00:15:56,846
You'll meet someone

173
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,433
who would die for you
and have a good life.

174
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,895
No, you don't have to do this.

175
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,990
Come on now!

176
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:17,742
You're hurting an old man's arm!

177
00:17:30,023 --> 00:17:32,942
But I think you're really smart, babe.

178
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:36,237
How did you think of cancer insurance?

179
00:17:40,283 --> 00:17:42,118
Her dad died of cancer.

180
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:45,288
She kept getting thinner.

181
00:17:45,372 --> 00:17:48,083
I thought it was time,
so I took out a policy.

182
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:56,716
Amazing. You did a good job.

183
00:18:01,638 --> 00:18:02,889
Was it a billion won?

184
00:18:03,223 --> 00:18:04,974
Yeah, if she dies.

185
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:10,271
I already got the diagnostic insurance
and bought you that designer bag.

186
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:14,484
I put the rest in stocks
to buy you a better bag.

187
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:16,820
You're so sweet.

188
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:19,656
Let's buy a house when Ji-won dies.

189
00:18:19,739 --> 00:18:21,241
That sounds nice.

190
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:24,327
But this bitch is holding out longer
than I thought.

191
00:18:24,411 --> 00:18:28,123
I even didn't tell her to go
to a doctor after I took out the policy.

192
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:32,168
She's persistent.

193
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:39,342
Maybe I'll take her out for some air
and push her off somewhere.

194
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:44,097
No. What if you fall too?

195
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,433
Why not? I can push her gently.

196
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,685
No one would know.

197
00:18:48,768 --> 00:18:52,230
What the hell has she been eating?
Why is she so tenacious?

198
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,357
You should eat whatever she ate.

199
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:57,777
I don't need to. I'm already strong.

200
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,917
You crazy bastards!

201
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,173
Ji-won?

202
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:19,966
Babe, are you okay?

203
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:21,342
Spit it out!

204
00:19:26,806 --> 00:19:28,933
-Are you okay, babe?
-I'm okay.

205
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:32,854
This is insurance fraud.

206
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:36,065
I'm going to report you.

207
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:37,484
Hey!

208
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:38,735
What the hell?

209
00:19:40,361 --> 00:19:41,529
Babe, are you okay?

210
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,072
-I'm okay.
-Are you sure?

211
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:44,157
-Yeah.
-Okay.

212
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:47,035
I won't forgive you if you leave me.

213
00:19:48,411 --> 00:19:49,496
Jeong Su-min.

214
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,304
I'm going to kill you both!

215
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:09,724
I'll kill you both!

216
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,226
Hey!

217
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,061
That's enough.

218
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:15,980
Aren't you sick of this?

219
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,149
Come on.

220
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:20,360
This little...

221
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:30,036
Hey.

222
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:34,749
What the hell can you do right now?

223
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:39,379
Let's go.

224
00:20:39,462 --> 00:20:40,922
Move out of the way.

225
00:20:46,052 --> 00:20:47,554
Hey!

226
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:58,648
Come on!

227
00:20:58,731 --> 00:21:00,066
Wait.

228
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:06,364
Ji-won.

229
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:21,379
I'm sorry.

230
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,177
You're sorry?

231
00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:30,013
That's enough.

232
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:37,896
We can't do anything about it now.

233
00:21:38,271 --> 00:21:40,148
The living should go on living.

234
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:43,610
You're going to die anyway.

235
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:45,695
You always think only about yourself.

236
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:02,795
This is great.

237
00:22:09,677 --> 00:22:11,346
You think you won't die?

238
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:14,307
You don't think it'll happen to you?

239
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:16,476
-It'll happen to you.
-Stop!

240
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,269
-What?
-Stop it!

241
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:20,355
Babe!

242
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,314
Hey!

243
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:24,859
If you're going to die,
just die already. Get lost!

244
00:22:51,594 --> 00:22:54,681
<i>I longed for the happiness I've never had,</i>
<i>yet here I am,</i>

245
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:58,434
<i>with my good old friend, unhappiness.</i>

246
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:11,239
Babe.

247
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:13,616
I think she's dead.

248
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:16,869
She was going to die anyway.

249
00:23:16,953 --> 00:23:18,621
Does it matter how she dies?

250
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:19,831
What happens to us?

251
00:23:19,914 --> 00:23:20,957
Stop talking!

252
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:24,711
People with cancer faint often.

253
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:26,129
She tripped and fell.

254
00:23:26,212 --> 00:23:28,756
And we found her like this.
We know nothing.

255
00:23:29,882 --> 00:23:31,509
What if we don't get paid?

256
00:23:31,592 --> 00:23:32,677
-Well?
-What now?

257
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,138
<i>I was given six months.</i>

258
00:23:35,221 --> 00:23:37,473
<i>Twelve months, if there was a miracle.</i>

259
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,936
<i>I didn't even get to live that much.</i>

260
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:45,940
<i>I just died.</i>

MARRY MY HUSBAND

263
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,210
Babe, what are you doing?

264
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:11,799
Why are you spacing out?

265
00:24:14,177 --> 00:24:16,387
Why aren't you wearing your glasses?

266
00:24:31,694 --> 00:24:33,321
Did you go to the hospital?

267
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:36,074
What did they say?

268
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:50,546
Babe, what's wrong? That hurts!

269
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,006
That hurts!

270
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,725
What's wrong with you?

271
00:25:04,185 --> 00:25:05,686
Hey!

272
00:25:07,188 --> 00:25:09,232
Kang Ji-won, let go! Let go of me!

273
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:10,775
Let go of me right now!

274
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:12,193
Ji-won, let go!

275
00:25:12,276 --> 00:25:13,653
God damn it! Let go!

276
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:18,574
Ms. Kang Ji-won!

277
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:26,791
Snap out of it.

278
00:25:26,874 --> 00:25:28,876
We're at work. What are you doing?

279
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,421
Work?

280
00:25:50,231 --> 00:25:51,232
Are you okay?

281
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:57,864
What's going on?

282
00:25:57,947 --> 00:25:59,365
I don't know.

283
00:26:44,577 --> 00:26:45,870
Were you hurt?

284
00:26:47,288 --> 00:26:48,581
Just a second.

285
00:26:50,124 --> 00:26:51,500
Kang Ji-won.

286
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:00,134
Ji-won!

287
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,136
The living should go on living.

288
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,846
You're going to die anyway.

289
00:27:05,306 --> 00:27:06,682
Get lost!

290
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:23,282
Hey, Ji-won!

291
00:27:56,649 --> 00:27:57,984
Stop.

292
00:28:07,368 --> 00:28:08,995
Can you calm down now?

you ran over 200 meters.

304
00:29:38,334 --> 00:29:39,460
You were sprinting.

305
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:45,758
I should ask you the same.

306
00:29:49,011 --> 00:29:50,304
What's going on?

307
00:30:24,346 --> 00:30:26,431

No, I'm fine.

310
00:30:42,072 --> 00:30:43,740

Is this a dream?

321
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,415

<i>Does it mean I travelled back in time?</i>

That's right.

343
00:34:18,037 --> 00:34:19,581
Where's the money he gave me?

344
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:21,082
Here it is.

345
00:34:45,607 --> 00:34:49,027
<i>Take it. Think of it as an allowance</i>

346

Dad!

348
00:35:06,878 --> 00:35:08,880
You can't draw on money like that.

349
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:11,007
Those aren't drawings.

350
00:35:11,716 --> 00:35:12,717
It's love.

351
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,470

00:36:13,611 --> 00:36:15,071
Dad...

362
00:36:19,367 --> 00:36:21,035
You should have told me it was you.

363
00:37:03,578 --> 00:37:05,455
Why is your face so bloated?

364
00:37:09,584 --> 00:37:11,210
Come out. Let's go eat.

365
00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:21,804
<i>Ji-won, what's going on?</i>

366
00:37:21,888 --> 00:37:24,557
<i>You haven't been picking up</i>
<i>since you ran out.</i>

367
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:26,434
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

368
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:28,227
<i>I'm coming over right now.</i>

369
00:37:28,936 --> 00:37:30,563
<i>I'm not feeling well.</i>

370
00:37:30,647 --> 00:37:32,815
<i>Don't come. I'm with Min-hwan.</i>

371
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,323
Oh, my.

372
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,248
Hey.

373
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:53,002
You're so immature.

374
00:37:54,045 --> 00:37:57,298
Yeah, I know you have a lot on your mind.
That's okay.

375
00:37:58,216 --> 00:38:00,134
I don't understand,

376
00:38:00,218 --> 00:38:02,303
but women say it happens, so, fine.

377
00:38:03,054 --> 00:38:04,430
I get it.

378
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:06,641
But you're making it too obvious at work.

379
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,309
Isn't that wrong?

380
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,896
What good can come
from making things bad for me?

381
00:38:14,148 --> 00:38:15,692
Speak so I can understand.

382
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:25,410
When did it happen?

383
00:38:26,411 --> 00:38:28,788
We haven't done it in a while.

384
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:30,123
Why are you pregnant?

385
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:34,293
Are you sure it's mine?

386
00:38:36,337 --> 00:38:37,797
What?

387
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,674
You told me you think you're pregnant.

388
00:38:40,508 --> 00:38:42,802
<i>I remember.</i>

389
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:46,597
<i>I couldn't stomach anything,</i>
<i>so I thought I was pregnant.</i>

390
00:38:46,681 --> 00:38:49,016
<i>It was gastritis from stress.</i>

391
00:38:49,434 --> 00:38:50,852
<i>Was this the start?</i>

392
00:38:51,686 --> 00:38:54,522
<i>It wasn't enough</i>
<i>he stressed me out until I died,</i>

393
00:38:54,605 --> 00:38:56,524
<i>he had an affair with my friend.</i>

394
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:01,195
I was just kidding.

395
00:39:01,821 --> 00:39:04,657
It's not like you could do that
with another man.

396
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,910
Don't take this the wrong way.

397
00:39:09,078 --> 00:39:11,330
I'm just saying that you're not young.

398
00:39:11,956 --> 00:39:15,001
If you step back now,
you can't work again.

399
00:39:15,793 --> 00:39:17,420
That's a huge career break.

400
00:39:17,795 --> 00:39:19,046
You love work.

401
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,133
You don't want to become
some old stay-at-home lady.

402
00:39:22,216 --> 00:39:23,426
Having a baby now

403
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:27,054
is like clipping the wings
off of a free bird.

404
00:39:27,805 --> 00:39:31,642
<i>If I hadn't known you'd sponge off of me</i>
<i>after quitting your job,</i>

405
00:39:31,726 --> 00:39:33,519
<i>your words would be plausible.</i>

406
00:39:34,729 --> 00:39:35,772
Get an abortion.

407
00:39:37,398 --> 00:39:38,399
As for the fee...

408
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:41,152
Fine.

409
00:39:42,361 --> 00:39:43,571
I'll pay for half.

410
00:39:44,864 --> 00:39:47,200
-Half?
-If you're going to do it anyway,

411
00:39:47,283 --> 00:39:49,535
do it quickly for your body.

412
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,037
Also, I don't want kids.

413
00:39:51,871 --> 00:39:53,664
Nothing good can come from it.

414
00:39:54,582 --> 00:39:57,502
<i>Min-hwan's the third generation</i>
<i>of families with only sons.</i>

415
00:39:57,585 --> 00:39:59,587
How dare you sever that?

416
00:40:11,432 --> 00:40:12,433
I'm not pregnant.

417
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:15,728
It's gastritis.

418
00:40:20,525 --> 00:40:21,943
You're not pregnant?

419
00:40:23,444 --> 00:40:25,905
It's gastritis? I see.

420
00:40:30,326 --> 00:40:32,119
Then why are you so sensitive?

421
00:40:36,207 --> 00:40:37,291
Let's break up.

422
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:40,002
-What?
-Are you done talking?

423
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:52,348
Are you done talking?

424
00:40:53,474 --> 00:40:57,144
I tried to be understanding
when you were acting crazy today.

425
00:40:57,228 --> 00:40:58,729
And you want to break up?

426
00:40:58,813 --> 00:40:59,856
Let go of me!

427
00:40:59,939 --> 00:41:01,232
You little...

428
00:41:03,484 --> 00:41:05,695
Did I say something wrong?

429
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,530
Why are you being hysterical?

430
00:41:07,613 --> 00:41:09,115
<i>-I forgot.</i>
<i>-Are </i>you crazy?

431
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,533
<i>Park Min-hwan</i>

432
00:41:10,616 --> 00:41:11,993
<i>doesn't care if I die.</i>

433
00:41:12,076 --> 00:41:14,537
<i>But can't stand the idea of breaking up.</i>

434
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,665
Let go of me and talk!

435
00:41:17,832 --> 00:41:20,501
Who do you think you are
to break up with me?

436
00:41:20,585 --> 00:41:21,919
I'm going to kill you.

437
00:41:22,378 --> 00:41:24,672
Tell me. What is it?

438
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:29,635
Tell me.

439
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:31,971
Do you think you can break up with me?

440
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:33,431
How dare you say that.

441
00:41:34,098 --> 00:41:35,141
Tell me. Why?

442
00:41:35,224 --> 00:41:37,226
Tell me.

443
00:41:38,686 --> 00:41:41,314
Is anyone there? Someone, help me!

444
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,404
Help!

445
00:41:49,488 --> 00:41:51,198
Please help me!

446
00:41:53,284 --> 00:41:54,201
Miss?

447
00:41:54,285 --> 00:41:57,788
You can't come to the police station
over a lover's quarrel.

448
00:41:57,872 --> 00:42:00,041
It's not like that. He almost...

449
00:42:00,124 --> 00:42:01,375
I know. I get it.

450
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:03,711
But eight out of ten women

451
00:42:03,794 --> 00:42:06,255
ask us why we're doing this to their men.

452
00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:08,132
How ridiculous is that for us?

453
00:42:08,215 --> 00:42:09,050
You know, sir.

454
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:12,261
There are days
when women are sensitive for no reason.

455
00:42:12,845 --> 00:42:14,555
I'll apologize on her behalf.

456
00:42:14,889 --> 00:42:17,141
You weren't hit, and nothing's broken.

457
00:42:17,516 --> 00:42:20,061
I see your boyfriend works
for a big company.

458
00:42:20,603 --> 00:42:24,732
You can't come to the police
just because you got angry and sensitive--

459
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:25,650
Excuse me.

460
00:42:26,233 --> 00:42:29,028
Do I have to come here
after something's broken?

461
00:42:30,363 --> 00:42:31,781
Forget it.

462
00:42:31,864 --> 00:42:33,824
Can you at least take me home?

463
00:42:45,378 --> 00:42:46,712

464
00:42:52,802 --> 00:42:54,220

465
00:42:55,262 --> 00:42:56,764

00:42:56,847 --> 00:42:58,933
BALANCE: 718,916 WON
RECIPIENT: PARK MIN-HWAN

467
00:42:59,016 --> 00:43:01,227
<i>At this time, I was scared to break up.</i>

468
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,062
<i>So I did whatever he wanted.</i>

469
00:43:03,145 --> 00:43:05,690
<i>He already has a lot of my money.</i>

470
00:43:05,773 --> 00:43:07,942
<i>He's used my card and cash loans.</i>

471
00:43:09,735 --> 00:43:10,569
What do I do?

472
00:43:10,653 --> 00:43:11,779
<i>I can't see a way.</i>

473
00:43:11,862 --> 00:43:13,948
<i>I already settled my severance pay.</i>

474
00:43:14,031 --> 00:43:16,701
<i>I can't run away with 700,000 won.</i>

475
00:43:16,784 --> 00:43:18,035
<i>I won't last a month.</i>

476
00:43:20,705 --> 00:43:22,832
<i>I'm sorry I got mad and yelled.</i>

477
00:43:22,915 --> 00:43:25,209
<i>-But you're at fault too.</i>
-What the hell?

478
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:27,003
<i>I meant what I said earlier.</i>

479
00:43:27,086 --> 00:43:28,754
<i>I was going to buy you a bag</i>

480
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:30,673
<i>once the stocks do well.</i>

481
00:43:30,756 --> 00:43:32,967
<i>I got inside information on Roijental.</i>

482
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,844
He's crazy.

483
00:43:34,927 --> 00:43:37,221
<i>Let's get married after this.</i>

484
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,814
I'm going into stocks.
Do you remember Roijental?

485
00:43:46,981 --> 00:43:47,982
Roijental?

486
00:43:50,401 --> 00:43:51,277
Roijental?

487
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,029
<i>Why didn't I think of that?</i>

488
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:56,323
Roijental!

489
00:43:56,407 --> 00:43:58,534
<i>The only success in Min-hwan's life.</i>

490
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:00,911
<i>I see a way now.</i>

491
00:44:02,371 --> 00:44:04,915
<i>I'll use this to get through this for now.</i>

492
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:07,126
<i>I don't remember everything</i>

493
00:44:07,209 --> 00:44:08,627
<i>that happened since 2013,</i>

494
00:44:13,257 --> 00:44:15,301
<i>but I know what was successful.</i>

495
00:44:15,384 --> 00:44:16,510
I can do this.

496
00:44:17,887 --> 00:44:21,057
I'm going to live a proper life this time.
For real.

497
00:44:33,152 --> 00:44:34,320
<i>I told you.</i>

498
00:44:34,403 --> 00:44:36,906
You didn't have to do the scan.

499
00:44:36,989 --> 00:44:38,324
It's just gastritis.

500
00:44:38,407 --> 00:44:40,659
It's serious, so take your meds.

501
00:44:40,743 --> 00:44:41,952
Don't be stressed.

502
00:44:43,704 --> 00:44:44,872
Yes, sir.

503
00:44:53,547 --> 00:44:54,548
Okay.

504
00:44:55,132 --> 00:44:57,134
I just need to maintain my health.

Is that by chance...

Did you get hurt yesterday?

I'm so sorry. I was so out of it.

00:46:22,052 --> 00:46:23,387
What?

520
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:26,640
When you said a <i>gukbap </i>restaurant,

521
00:46:26,724 --> 00:46:29,894
I didn't think it'd look like this.

522

You haven't tried it yet.

532
00:47:15,606 --> 00:47:17,149
What are you referring to?

533
00:47:21,111 --> 00:47:23,572
I meant the food.

534
00:47:27,618 --> 00:47:29,078
Thank you.

00:47:44,927 --> 00:47:46,845
Then I stopped by the bookstore.

540
00:47:49,682 --> 00:47:51,267
Thank you for yesterday.

541
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,645
You took me home,

542
00:47:54,728 --> 00:47:57,273
and bought me
the cup noodle and chamomile--

543
00:47:57,356 --> 00:47:59,108
You're different today.

544
00:48:00,776 --> 00:48:02,111
I am?

545
00:48:02,695 --> 00:48:04,405
Are you really going to quit?

546
00:48:07,283 --> 00:48:09,034
I was considering it.

547
00:48:10,494 --> 00:48:12,413
I can't keep going like this.

548
00:48:12,496 --> 00:48:17,334
I figured it was time for a change.

549
00:48:19,086 --> 00:48:20,754
-Marriage?
-What?

550
00:48:21,463 --> 00:48:24,341
You bought a book about interior.
I just assumed.

551
00:48:24,425 --> 00:48:25,759
MASTER INTERIOR DESIGN

552
00:48:25,843 --> 00:48:27,428
No, that's not...

553
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:31,557
<i>True, I was preparing</i>
<i>to marry Park Min-hwan this year.</i>

554
00:48:34,977 --> 00:48:37,146
I do have to think about marriage.

555
00:48:37,229 --> 00:48:39,690
<i>In that I'd rather die than do it.</i>

556
00:48:47,698 --> 00:48:48,866
Actually...

557
00:48:53,037 --> 00:48:54,621
OTHER HALF

558
00:49:14,058 --> 00:49:15,517
It's okay.

559
00:49:19,646 --> 00:49:21,774
<i>Ji-won, call me right back, over.</i>

560
00:49:25,194 --> 00:49:27,696
<i>Why won't she pick up?</i>

561
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,990
<i>She caused a scene at work yesterday.</i>

562
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:42,211
You're my only friend, Ji-won.

563
00:49:46,715 --> 00:49:49,593
Where the hell is she?
Why won't she answer?

564
00:50:01,397 --> 00:50:02,981
<i>It's the same scar.</i>

565
00:50:11,907 --> 00:50:12,741
I'm so sorry!

566
00:50:14,493 --> 00:50:16,537
The scar looks bad.

567
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:20,290
It's fine.

568
00:50:24,211 --> 00:50:25,379
Let's go.

569
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:27,423
Okay.

570
00:50:32,219 --> 00:50:33,554
Thanks for the meal.

571
00:50:33,637 --> 00:50:34,805
That makes us even.

572
00:50:35,389 --> 00:50:36,598
One meal was enough.

573
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:39,476
Okay.

574
00:50:41,478 --> 00:50:42,646
Also...

575
00:50:46,191 --> 00:50:48,193
You are a very talented person.

576
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:51,530
Getting married
and starting a family is nice,

577
00:50:51,613 --> 00:50:53,490
but I think it'd be a shame if you quit.

578
00:50:56,118 --> 00:50:57,119
As your boss.

579
00:51:05,002 --> 00:51:06,003
Thank you.

580
00:51:08,255 --> 00:51:10,132
Now, if you'll excuse me.

581
00:51:10,924 --> 00:51:12,301
Okay. Bye.

582
00:51:33,322 --> 00:51:37,201
WORK, MEAL KIT, STOCKS

583
00:51:37,284 --> 00:51:38,827
MEAL KIT

584
00:51:47,252 --> 00:51:49,379
You are a very talented person.

585
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:55,761
<i>I was scared of him</i>
<i>because he was always frowning.</i>

586
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,889
<i>But he's a pretty decent person.</i>

587
00:52:00,474 --> 00:52:03,519
<i>How did he know I was talented?</i>

588
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,397
<i>I had forgotten</i>

589
00:52:09,525 --> 00:52:11,818
<i>that I was good at my job.</i>

590
00:52:12,402 --> 00:52:14,738
<i>I wanted to do a lot of things at work.</i>

591
00:52:15,072 --> 00:52:18,033
<i>Things I had to give up</i>
<i>after getting married</i>

592
00:52:18,617 --> 00:52:21,912
<i>because I didn't want</i>
<i>to discourage Park Min-hwan.</i>

593
00:52:22,287 --> 00:52:24,206
<i>Things Kang Ji-won wanted to do.</i>

594
00:52:31,755 --> 00:52:35,384
KANG JI-WON

595
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:38,887
What's her deal?

596
00:52:38,971 --> 00:52:40,597
She's pissing me off again.

597
00:52:54,444 --> 00:52:57,531
Why do I have to go through this
because of Min-hwan?

598
00:53:11,211 --> 00:53:12,879
Get to work, everyone!

599
00:53:12,963 --> 00:53:15,966
Work starts in ten minutes.
You should all be ready.

600
00:53:16,049 --> 00:53:17,384
I'm watching you all.

601
00:53:17,467 --> 00:53:19,469
Get to work! Got it?

602
00:53:21,013 --> 00:53:22,014
Kang Ji-won.

603
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,101
Kang Ji-won!

604
00:53:38,405 --> 00:53:40,907
ROIJENTAL

605
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:43,994
QUANTITY: FULL AMOUNT

606
00:53:46,204 --> 00:53:47,205
PURCHASE

607
00:53:48,165 --> 00:53:49,666
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PURCHASE?
YES

608
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,918
Wow, it went up even more.

609
00:53:52,502 --> 00:53:53,754
How far will it rise?

610
00:53:55,255 --> 00:53:56,548
Ji-won.

611
00:54:04,364 --> 00:54:06,283
I thought you'd call last night.

612
00:54:09,161 --> 00:54:10,620
What did you do?

613
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:16,042
Last night?

614
00:54:17,127 --> 00:54:19,045
You know MODU Community.

615
00:54:20,088 --> 00:54:22,799
I was browsing
the Marriage, In-laws & Family Board,

616
00:54:22,883 --> 00:54:24,134
and I lost track of time.

617
00:54:25,844 --> 00:54:27,345
I see.

618
00:54:28,513 --> 00:54:32,559
There's this woman
who has late stage cancer.

619
00:54:33,977 --> 00:54:36,730
She saw her husband and her friend in bed.

620
00:54:38,482 --> 00:54:40,817
Really? That's crazy.

621
00:54:42,194 --> 00:54:43,195
It is, isn't it?

622
00:54:43,278 --> 00:54:48,074
Wow, that friend is worse
than the husband. So gross.

623
00:54:48,158 --> 00:54:50,577
How could she do that to her best friend?

624
00:54:51,328 --> 00:54:52,329
I know.

625
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,168
She's going to die anyway,
so she probably thought it was okay.

626
00:55:04,132 --> 00:55:07,427
You can have everything I own if I die.

627
00:55:07,928 --> 00:55:09,554
But if you die, I will too.

628
00:55:14,935 --> 00:55:16,728
-Kang Ji-won.
-Yes?

629
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,033
When will you get your touch back?

630
00:55:31,701 --> 00:55:34,788
You don't like my proposal?
Is it that bad?

631
00:55:35,455 --> 00:55:37,207
"Bad"?

632
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,335
That would be saying it nicely.
This just sucks.

633
00:55:40,418 --> 00:55:42,128
It sucks!

634
00:55:44,548 --> 00:55:48,343
MEAL KIT PROPOSAL FOR SINGLE HOUSEHOLDS

635
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:53,181
<i>This was turned down at this time.</i>

636
00:55:53,265 --> 00:55:54,724
<i>However,</i>

637
00:55:54,808 --> 00:55:58,895
<i>Su-min proposed it without changing</i>
<i>a single word and he proceeded it.</i>

638
00:55:58,979 --> 00:55:59,980
Ji-won.

639
00:56:00,981 --> 00:56:03,567
This is great!

640
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:06,820
Can I fix it a little
and propose it again?

641
00:56:06,903 --> 00:56:11,116
<i>She became a full-time employee with this</i>
<i>and got promoted.</i>

642
00:56:11,616 --> 00:56:13,618
Does this make sense to you?

643
00:56:13,702 --> 00:56:15,328
Single household? Meal kit?

644
00:56:15,537 --> 00:56:17,664
Why would someone living alone cook?

645
00:56:17,747 --> 00:56:20,709
"Add water to a pot and boil it"?
How bothersome.

646
00:56:21,293 --> 00:56:23,795
And the green onions are vacuum-sealed?

647
00:56:23,879 --> 00:56:25,755
Jeez, freeze-dried squid?

648
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:29,259
Opening all these packages
will take a whole day!

649
00:56:29,426 --> 00:56:31,094
Does this make sense to you?

650
00:56:31,177 --> 00:56:34,598
The development team will say,
"Do it yourself if you can!"

651
00:56:35,974 --> 00:56:38,226
-What do I do?
<i>-Manager Kim Gyeong-uk.</i>

652
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:40,645
<i>He's rude and incompetent.</i>

653
00:56:40,729 --> 00:56:42,314
<i>He's an opportunist.</i>

654
00:56:42,397 --> 00:56:43,899
<i>Who was it again?</i>

655
00:56:43,982 --> 00:56:46,693
<i>He has relations with a famous higher-up.</i>

656
00:56:46,776 --> 00:56:47,986
Who am I talking to?

657
00:56:49,195 --> 00:56:50,614
Ms. Kang?

658
00:56:50,697 --> 00:56:52,365
What are you thinking about?

659
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:57,037
If you tell me what it lacks,
I'll edit it.

660
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,832
This is the problem with women.
They're so dependent!

661
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:03,251
You need to figure it out yourself.

662
00:57:03,335 --> 00:57:06,838
Also, try to be considerate of others
when you come to work.

663
00:57:07,088 --> 00:57:09,215
Why are you dressed like that?

664
00:57:09,883 --> 00:57:12,469
Ms. Yang's like that because she's married

665
00:57:12,552 --> 00:57:13,803
but you're not.

666
00:57:13,887 --> 00:57:16,431
How are the men supposed to take it?

667
00:57:16,514 --> 00:57:19,476
This is because
women don't do military service.

668
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:23,104
Our country should make women serve too.

669
00:57:23,188 --> 00:57:24,648
Right, Mr. Park?

670
00:57:25,023 --> 00:57:26,566
Yes, I'll proceed with it.

671
00:57:26,983 --> 00:57:28,151
Right?

672
00:57:28,234 --> 00:57:30,070
Fix this and bring it back.

673
00:57:54,803 --> 00:57:58,348
<i>She's Kim Gyeong-uk's right-hand person,</i>
<i>so we barely spoke.</i>

674
00:57:58,431 --> 00:58:00,725
<i>But she's a good employee.</i>

675
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:04,562
<i>Mr. Kim prevented her promotion</i>
<i>until she quit the company,</i>

676
00:58:04,646 --> 00:58:07,857
<i>but she deserved to be a manager.</i>

677
00:58:10,068 --> 00:58:11,653
-Excuse me--
-Ms. Yang.

678
00:58:12,862 --> 00:58:14,447
Mr. Kim's looking for you.

679
00:58:58,658 --> 00:58:59,784
This is nice!

680
00:59:05,123 --> 00:59:06,624
-Let's talk.
-No.

681
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:07,709
But, I...

682
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:10,211
Damn it.

683
00:59:20,221 --> 00:59:21,598
Goodness!

684
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:24,017
Be careful.

685
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,603
Are you okay? You suddenly jumped out!

686
00:59:26,686 --> 00:59:28,897
<i>What was that? Something just...</i>

687
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,732
No, I'm fine. I'm so sorry.

688
00:59:30,815 --> 00:59:32,317
I'm sorry.

689
00:59:45,955 --> 00:59:48,124
It felt the same. I'm sure of it.

690
00:59:50,668 --> 00:59:52,170
It was the same spot too.

691
00:59:54,214 --> 00:59:55,799
No.

692
00:59:55,882 --> 00:59:58,259
That's not possible. What am I thinking?

693
01:00:01,638 --> 01:00:02,639
Hey.

694
01:00:03,848 --> 01:00:04,849
Hey!

695
01:00:05,642 --> 01:00:07,519
Hey, Ji-won! Hey!

696
01:00:08,603 --> 01:00:09,646
Kang Ji-won!

697
01:00:13,274 --> 01:00:14,317
Are you okay?

698
01:00:24,577 --> 01:00:26,079
<i>Eventually, I got hurt.</i>

699
01:00:26,913 --> 01:00:28,373
<i>In the same exact spot.</i>

700
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:33,002
I avoided it, but I couldn't avoid it.

701
01:00:37,215 --> 01:00:39,884
<i>Wait, does that mean...</i>

702
01:00:46,683 --> 01:00:47,684
No.

703
01:00:49,102 --> 01:00:51,896
<i>But my injury is gone.</i>

704
01:00:53,898 --> 01:00:56,359
<i>I once burned myself</i>
<i>because I was so anxious</i>

705
01:00:56,442 --> 01:00:59,404
<i>I might've been pregnant</i>
<i>and spilled some hot water.</i>

706
01:01:00,196 --> 01:01:02,907
<i>What does this mean?</i>
<i>I'm missing something.</i>

707

01:02:00,465 --> 01:02:02,508
<i>If TKU Technology does well,</i>

719
01:02:02,592 --> 01:02:05,011
<i>it'll be huge, so I don't regret this.</i>

720
01:02:05,094 --> 01:02:07,847
<i>Just remember</i>
<i>I sold incredible stocks for you.</i>

721
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,767
<i>That's who you are to me.</i>

722
01:02:11,351 --> 01:02:13,186
<i>TKU Technology?</i>

723
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:16,981
<i>The ruling and opposing lawmakers</i>
<i>involved in the TKU list...</i>

724
01:02:17,065 --> 01:02:20,360
<i>I know nothing about stocks,</i>
<i>but I know about TKU.</i>

725
01:02:20,443 --> 01:02:22,237
<i>It was a famous Pump and Dump.</i>

726
01:02:22,403 --> 01:02:24,781
<i>The CEO ends up running off abroad</i>

727
01:02:24,864 --> 01:02:26,532
<i>and the stock gets delisted.</i>

728
01:02:26,616 --> 01:02:28,409
<i>He sold Roijental,</i>

729
01:02:28,493 --> 01:02:30,203
<i>and bought TKU?</i>

730
01:02:30,995 --> 01:02:32,830
<i>I bought Roijental.</i>

731
01:02:32,914 --> 01:02:34,624
<i>And Park Min-hwan sold it.</i>

732
01:02:35,124 --> 01:02:37,335
Let's start the meeting for Team One.

733
01:02:37,877 --> 01:02:40,797
Bring the survey data for the new product.

734
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,382
Yes, sir.

735
01:03:00,233 --> 01:03:02,068
Wow, it went up again.

736
01:03:02,151 --> 01:03:04,237
<i>Hey. I sold my stocks.</i>

737
01:03:13,913 --> 01:03:16,207
What's bound to happen will happen.

738
01:03:24,882 --> 01:03:26,175
How's your injury?

739
01:03:28,636 --> 01:03:32,598
<i>It just needs to happen to somebody.</i>

740
01:03:32,682 --> 01:03:34,350
You're always getting hurt.

741
01:03:34,434 --> 01:03:36,686
I thought I was having a heart attack.

742
01:03:38,187 --> 01:03:39,605
Are you listening to me?

743
01:03:47,822 --> 01:03:48,823
Su-min.

744
01:03:52,327 --> 01:03:54,287
I have some trash to throw away.

745
01:03:55,163 --> 01:03:56,497
Will you do it for me?

746
01:03:57,707 --> 01:03:59,334
What are you talking about?

747
01:04:01,252 --> 01:04:02,253
Please.

748
01:04:03,046 --> 01:04:04,797
You're my other half.

749
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:09,302
Okay.

750
01:04:09,385 --> 01:04:11,763
In return, let's hang out this weekend.

751
01:04:14,057 --> 01:04:17,518
I found a yummy BBQ restaurant.
It's called Goseuljung.

752
01:04:26,652 --> 01:04:27,945
Yeah, let's do it.

753
01:04:32,867 --> 01:04:34,869
As long as you throw out my trash.

754
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:38,331
Okay.

755
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:44,420
Assistant Manager Kang and Ms. Jeong.
Hurry up.

756
01:04:44,921 --> 01:04:45,922
Coming.

757
01:05:02,772 --> 01:05:04,565
You've been coveting my trash.

758
01:05:12,657 --> 01:05:13,699
You take it out.

759
01:05:20,123 --> 01:05:22,083
Marry my husband.

763
01:05:44,313 --> 01:05:46,065
Ji-won, this is no fun.

764

766
01:05:48,985 --> 01:05:51,237
<i>you'd behave perversely. I knew that.</i>

767
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,030
Mr. Park, you're a competent man.

768
01:05:54,073 --> 01:05:55,741
What perfume do you use?

769
01:05:55,825 --> 01:05:56,701
You're dead today.

770
01:05:56,784 --> 01:05:58,703
That passionate love of yours...

771
01:05:58,786 --> 01:06:00,246
<i>I'll help make it come true.</i>

772
01:06:00,329 --> 01:06:02,039
Do you have plans this weekend?

773
01:06:02,123 --> 01:06:03,374
<i>You come first, Ms. Kang.</i>

774
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:05,209
<i>Just remember that you owe me.</i>

775
01:06:05,293 --> 01:06:08,838
<i>Did you dump me for Yu Ji-hyuk?</i>
<i>That crazy old fart.</i>

776

<i>I won't just take it anymore.</i>
