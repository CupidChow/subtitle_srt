{\an8}2005

2
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,010
- Yu Ji-hyuk!
- Yu Ji-hyuk!

3
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,511
- Congrats!
- Congrats!

4
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:54,764
- On your 100-day -
On your 100-day...

5
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,182
vacation!

6
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:10,112
Did you sign up for manual
labor instead of the military?

7
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:11,530
What's with your face?

8
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,616
I thought you
renounced the world.

9
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,076
Haven't you heard of sunscreen?

10
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,871
Of course, it was around
before you joined too.

11
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,332
What shall we eat now?

12
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,417
We spent a lot of money.

13
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:26,128
Let's buy soju and
go back to school.

14
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:27,755
It's a good night!

15
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,095
Thank you.

16
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,477
What's that?

17
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,690
Go.

18
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,652
She shouldn't have drank
so much. That scared me.

19
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,320
Sorry about that!

20
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,864
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,414
Is she alone? Shall we take her?

22
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,458
She's begging for it.

23
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,377
Ignoring her wouldn't be polite.

24
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,921
Absolutely. That
wouldn't be chivalrous.

25
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,381
Attack!

26
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,052
- Who's that?
- Who's that?

27
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:18,973
Are you okay?

28
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,266
A pole...

29
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,559
Sorry.

30
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,187
Are you okay?

31
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:28,941
Are you alone? Are
you with anyone?

32
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,901
I'm alone.

33
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,989
I'm completely alone.
Seriously alone.

34
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,203
My dad passed away on March 2nd.

35
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:42,413
So,

36
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,290
I'm alone.

37
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,961
Also, my boyfriend
and I broke up.

38
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,880
So I'm seriously alone.

39
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,050
What about a friend?

40
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,886
I'm sure you have a friend.

41
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:01,807
A friend...

42
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:29,209
People don't like me,
so I have no friends.

43
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:36,842
I smell alcohol.

44
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,231
What's wrong?

45
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,196
It smells good.

46
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:58,948
Excuse me?

47
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,730
{\an8}EPISODE 5

48
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,662
{\an8}What do you want to know?

49
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:52,501
{\an8}I want to know if
this is beer or soju.

50
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,629
{\an8}I have terrible vision.

51
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,174
{\an8}You can tell this is
beer with your eyes shut!

52
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:00,634
{\an8}If you can't tell that,

53
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:03,220
{\an8}then you probably
shouldn't drink any more.

54
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,560
{\an8}But I bought this beer.

55
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,354
Goodness.

56
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,398
Thank you.

57
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,608
Doesn't your forehead hurt?

58
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:17,818
It doesn't hurt.

59
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,949
But I really am allowed
to drink tonight.

60
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,452
Then drink at your place.

61
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,166
You want me to drink
alone? I'm always alone.

62
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:41,884
My dad passed away
three months ago.

63
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,052
March 2nd.

64
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,971
I know, and you broke up
with your boyfriend too.

65
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:50,642
Do you have other family? Where's
your mom? Do you have siblings?

66
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,271
I don't have siblings.

67
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,068
My mom left home 3,193 days ago.

68
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,112
I was in middle school.

69
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:05,282
Also, friends...

70
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,785
No one likes you, so
you have no friends.

71
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,162
How did you know?

72
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,086
Are you a fortune teller?

73
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,385
Here's your beer.

74
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:26,970
Thank you.

75
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,148
Beer's the best!

76
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,498
Actually, I do have one friend.

77
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,503
But I can't reach her

78
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:04,049
when I need her and am
having a really hard time.

79
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,510
Maybe she's busy.

80
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,514
I know. We have such bad timing.

81
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:15,060
I'm sure she wants
to be with me too.

82
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:16,311
I'm sure she's sad.

83
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,029
But...

84
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,366
I think if I was with Su-min

85
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,954
on a day like this,

86
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,957
I'd feel like a loser.

87
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,803
My boyfriend

88
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,389
suddenly started being busy,

89
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,726
and he said he was always tired.

90
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,607
When my dad passed,

91
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,317
he didn't even come.

92
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,279
That's when it hit me.

93
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,408
Still, I pretended not to know.

94
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,785
For three months at that!

95
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,705
Because...

96
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,585
being alone

97
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,214
would only be sadder.

98
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:39,853
So my boyfriend...

99
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:47,277
I noticed that he's been
smiling at Su-min a lot.

100
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,781
But that's natural.

101
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:56,286
Su-min's nice, pretty, and cute.

102
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:02,334
Also, she's my only friend.

103
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,092
Do you know that feeling?

104
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:15,347
I'm sure Su-min's nice,

105
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,434
pretty, and cute.

106
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,398
But when I stand beside her,

107
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,652
I feel so shabby.

108
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,491
Like a big fat loser.

109
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,413
If that's how she makes you
feel, don't be her friend.

110
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:43,208
Who cares if she's good or
bad? You're uncomfortable.

111
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,668
Isn't she bad for you?

112
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,928
Do you know what it means
to not have a family?

113
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,435
Have you been on a boat?

114
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,815
After my dad died,

115
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,485
it feels like I'm
on a boat every day.

116
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,825
My feet are firmly planted,
but the boat keeps rocking.

117
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,286
I feel anxious.

118
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,792
I want stability.

119
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,798
I want to step on solid land.

120
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:38,930
Su-min's the only one
who will be my land.

121
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,269
I only have her.

122
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,319
But this is because
I'm a loser. The end.

123
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,407
I guess that makes
me a loser too.

124
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,912
My mom passed away 15 years ago.

125
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,580
Exactly 5,328 days ago.

126
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:08,377
After some time, I got a
stepmother and a younger sibling.

127
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,006
They're good people,
but I feel strange.

128
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,925
I hate it.

129
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,345
Wow, you really are a loser.

130
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,433
I should get a grip.

131
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,520
The real loser was right here.

132
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,400
I mean, what happened
to your mom is sad,

133
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:35,404
but the fact that your dad could
start over is a good thing, right?

134
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,034
My dad should've done that.

135
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,120
If he had...

136
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,417
he wouldn't have died.

137
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,676
My dad was able to start
over, but he died too.

138
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,511
Don't think that way.

139
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:07,436
Cheers.

140
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,356
You're so warm.

141
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:32,169
Let's just say we're
both not losers.

142
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:39,009
Still, you're right about one thing.
My dad was happy before he died.

143
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:46,725
Your dad left you
with a new family.

144
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:47,851
Congratulations!

145
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,815
Congrats on having
a solid friend.

146
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,194
No.

147
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,909
You're able to have a
good and solid friend.

148
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,038
Congratulations.

149
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,776
STIR-FRIED ATHLETES
SPORTS CLUB

150
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,148
Yu Ji-hyuk wins!

151
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,276
Ji-hyuk.

152
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,491
Jo Dong-suk, a reserve
for the national team,

153
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,452
has been beaten by an
ordinary economics student.

154
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,041
Why?

155
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,628
Why are you going this far?

156
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,546
You're a civilian!

157
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,423
You're not a pro athlete!

158
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,801
You're a soldier.
Let's take ten.

159
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,052
What?

160
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,014
You want to go again?

161
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,724
I think he does.

162
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,185
Why did he go into
economics then?

163
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,360
I woke up,

164
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:29,406
and I was snoring beside an
unpleasant-looking old man!

165
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,204
I was so surprised.

166
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,458
I hope he doesn't
go to our school.

167
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,086
That would be so embarrassing.

168
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,504
I hate that.

169
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,799
But he was strange too.

170
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,843
Why do that with a drunk girl?

171
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,637
- I mean...
- True.

172
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,806
I need to get a grip.

173
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,434
I'm already 23.

174
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,768
When will I grow up?

175
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,903
She was an upperclassman?

176
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:16,453
Since we're at it, can you
beat Sin-u too? For real!

177
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,289
- I quit judo.
- Please, I'm begging you.

178
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,540
Well?

179
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,377
Why?

180
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,754
Is something wrong?

181
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,892
I was snoring beside an
unpleasant-looking old man!

182
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,145
Hey.

183
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,356
Am I an unpleasant-looking
old man?

184
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,400
Which part do you mean?

185
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,819
The unpleasant-looking
or old man part?

186
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,614
Do you want me to
recommend a sunscreen?

187
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,242
What about now?

188
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,495
- That's good.
- Good.

189
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,829
Really nice.

190
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,331
- You're so pretty.
- Yeah.

191
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,540
Yeah.

192
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,336
Hey, wait! Stop!

193
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,433
Hey.

194
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,605
You're eating well.

195
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,483
Here's four.

196
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,364
I'll give you nine. Eat it all.

197
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,660
Eat it slowly.

198
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:41,830
Drink some water.

199
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,755
You'll get fat if
you eat like that.

200
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,191
{\an8}CAT SNACKS

201
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,223
Ji-hyuk. Why are you always
here during your break?

202
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,269
- What is it?
- What is he doing?

203
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:32,982
- Did his senior ask him to make something?
- His service must be tough.

204
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,686
<i>Thinking back, I
had a few chances.</i>

205
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,737
<i>I didn't seize it
because I didn't know.</i>

206
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,618
<i>Or I couldn't seize it.</i>

207
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,832
2011 U&K FOOD THE MOST
INFLUENTIAL FOOD BRAND

208
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,668
I would like to
introduce our team.

209
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:34,961
Yes...

210
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:38,089
<i>- And if that wasn't it...</i>
- She's a Hankuk University alum.

211
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,590
Her name's Kang Ji-won.

212
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,217
Say hello.

213
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:46,055
As of today, Mr. Yu Ji-hyuk
will be our general manager.

214
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:51,227
Ji-won graduated from
Hankuk University,

215
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,896
but she slacks in
her work. Yeah.

216
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,899
I have to pay a lot
of attention to her.

217
00:21:56,983 --> 00:22:01,320
- What happened to the proposal plan?
- You said it was due tomorrow...

218
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,948
See? What did I tell you?

219
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,867
Let's keep moving.

220
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,243
Yeah, well...

221
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,920
<i>It was a chance I
shouldn't seize.</i>

222
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,773
<i>But it's different this time.</i>

223
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,904
APRIL 19, 2013

224
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,705
I do feel better.

225
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,211
What was that?

226
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:44,966
What?

227
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,389
What's with that smile?

228
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,600
Follow me.

229
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,777
Didn't I tell you?
He's interested in you.

230
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,572
What are you saying?
He has a girlfriend.

231
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,117
Is that what he said?
Did he say that himself?

232
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,869
You're acting so naive.

233
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,204
What does that matter?

234
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,206
Let me tell you about men.

235
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,750
All men cheat.

236
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,919
So he has a girlfriend?

237
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:25,548
He could have a wife and still
like someone else! That's men!

238
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,633
Do you know what a
guy's ideal type is?

239
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:30,428
An unfamiliar woman.

240
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,263
That's men! Okay?

241
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,849
<i>Are all men like you?</i>

242
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,602
Don't be foolish.

243
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,937
That's why you're the problem.

244
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:42,815
Guys are playing tricks
because you look easy.

245
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,528
You wouldn't do

246
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,823
something like that, would you?

247
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:54,327
What?

248
00:24:57,455 --> 00:24:58,539
Never mind.

249
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:01,667
I must've thought all
men were like you.

250
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,754
Yeah.

251
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,674
They're all like
that except for me.

252
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:09,759
That's why I know.

253
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,719
I'm telling you to be careful.

254
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,512
- You don't even know.
- Okay.

255
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,182
Ms. Kang?

256
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,560
- Bye.
- Yeah, okay.

257
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,689
I mean...

258
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:33,407
She's acting strange.

259
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:38,287
Strangely good.

260
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:40,915
She's prettier too.

261
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,013
This is revolutionary.

262
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,183
We didn't have this before!

263
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:02,186
This is what you call perks!

264
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:06,023
<i>Did you see those
broad shoulders!</i>

265
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:07,900
<i>His shoulders?</i>

266
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,486
<i>I was looking at
his waist and back.</i>

267
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,863
<i>I couldn't see his shoulders!</i>

268
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:16,117
<i>It'll take two days to
look at him closely.</i>

269
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,120
<i>Did you see how tall he
is? He has everything!</i>

270
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,456
<i>- He's insanely hot!
- He's insanely hot!</i>

271
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,005
Yes, hello.

272
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,339
<i>Mr. Yu.</i>

273
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:33,843
<i>The finance team has raised
your stock transaction details.</i>

274
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,386
<i>I called to check.</i>

275
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:39,098
Does it include
personal accounts?

276
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:43,352
<i>The amount was significant, and you
don't normally buy other stocks.</i>

277
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,647
<i>If you want, shall I advise
against reporting it?</i>

278
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:48,774
Please, thank you.

279
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:51,819
<i>Don't you usually avoid
unfamiliar fields?</i>

280
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,615
<i>That's right.</i>

281
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,705
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

282
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,666
That means he knows something.

283
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,543
Did you say it was Roijental?

284
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,588
Are you sure there's
nothing special?

285
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,465
Yes, there was a sharp rise,

286
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,676
but it's still
uncertain from our data.

287
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,429
It's not a company Ji-hyuk
is affiliated with.

288
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,557
But he still hasn't sold it?

289
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:23,851
Let's keep an eye on it.

290
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,771
And see if he has a
borrowed-name account.

291
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,315
Make sure he doesn't know.

292
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,317
Yes, I understand.

293
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,198
When something's changed,

294
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,368
what wasn't a problem in
the past could become one.

295
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,338
He was so sexy!

296
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,383
- I mean it, that bottom...
- He looked so tall!

297
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:01,263
Are we the only ones who don't
care about Mr. Yu's transformation?

298
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,057
Everyone's surprised by it.

299
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,018
That's not my type.

300
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:10,481
<i>People realize their partners aren't
their type once they start dating.</i>

301
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:13,109
I'm married. Getting
excited is illegal.

302
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,988
Anyway, let's talk
about the meal kit.

303
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:23,911
Green bell peppers are good nutritionally,
but there aren't many farms that sell it.

304
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,204
So...

305
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:29,166
About that, green bell peppers
aren't different bell peppers.

306
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,627
They're harvested
before fully ripening.

307
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,964
- They'll supply with a purchase guarantee.
- What?

308
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,174
That's right. I
just found out too.

309
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:41,679
I bet all you did
was study in school!

310
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,973
I grew up on a farm.

311
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,977
Which means I played barefoot
in the dirt when I was a kid.

312
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:49,645
Really?

313
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:55,526
We played in the dirt a lot too!

314
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,279
Wait, was it sand?

315
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:01,615
We played on the beach a lot.

316
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:04,827
This brings back memories.

317
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:09,081
Do you remember the lady that
sold <i>jjokja</i>? We ate so much!

318
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,417
<i>Jjokja</i>?

319
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,668
<i>Dalgona.</i>

320
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,796
Eating that at the
beach is so good.

321
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:19,341
You always broke yours,
so I did it for you.

322
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,971
Please take after Ji-won for me.

323
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,474
You have no idea how
high-maintenance she is.

324
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,768
I was upset when she
went to college in Seoul,

325
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,232
but she couldn't make any friends
and spent her time in the library.

326
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,402
I kept going back
and forth from Busan.

327
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:47,495
So did you come to Seoul to see Ms.
Kang while you went to school in Busan?

328
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,830
Yeah, every week.

329
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,540
It was so difficult for me!

330
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,584
I had classes four days a week.

331
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,586
I was in Seoul for
three days once.

332
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,671
Is that why she
couldn't make friends?

333
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,719
That's too far even for a
weekly visit to see a guy.

334
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,763
That's how close we were.

335
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:13,479
She's your other half. Friends
like that are hard to come by.

336
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:18,651
<i>"Friends like that"
shouldn't exist.</i>

337
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:22,112
Why did you go to school
in Seoul, Ms. Kang?

338
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:24,156
To go to Hankuk University.

339
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,201
You have to give it to her,
it's Hankuk University.

340
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,540
Are you here to have fun?

341
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:38,212
You should be working, but
you're all here chatting away.

342
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,423
Hey, Hankuk University.
Go move my car.

343
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,717
The parking spots all sucked.

344
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:47,638
I parked on the fourth basement
floor. The plate's 75NA 1109.

345
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:56,355
Why? Is it out of your league?

346
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,817
Do you want to
keep chatting here?

347
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:04,863
Women are all the same.

348
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:06,282
Hey, get back to work.

349
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:08,409
Get up right now!

350
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,746
I should blow up the breakroom.

351
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,010
There you are.

352
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:33,225
It's not your fault you
have a crappy owner.

353
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:46,572
<i>If my guess is right,</i>

354
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,449
<i>you'll be waiting for me.</i>

355
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,414
<i>Because you have to comfort me.</i>

356
00:31:56,957 --> 00:32:00,294
<i>To teach me that you're the
only one who's on my side.</i>

357
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,759
I was worried, so I waited.

358
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,432
Did you move the car well?

359
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,142
Yeah.

360
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:21,482
If you can't give me your
proposal, at least let me join.

361
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:25,527
I'll go to the farm and
factory. I'll work really hard.

362
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,905
I have to become a
full-time employee.

363
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,532
Please? Let me join.

364
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,576
I'll think about it.

365
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:39,249
You're not still
mad at me, are you?

366
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,252
I'm not just saying this.

367
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:49,593
Let's talk it out if you're mad.
You're going to hurt my feelings.

368
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:02,106
We're meant to be together
forever! It's our fate.

369
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:07,152
If I become a full-timer with
this, let's work here until we die!

370
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:10,072
Okay?

371
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:13,701
Hey, Ji-won! Get over
here if you're done.

372
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:26,922
When will I get the revised proposal?
You didn't report the team to me either!

373
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,509
I'm sorry. It's not done yet.

374
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:33,053
I'm sure. Yeah.

375
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:35,639
That's how far your skills go.

376
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,683
You can't do it alone,

377
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:41,103
I'll talk to Yang Ju-ran for
you. I already told Su-min.

378
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:44,106
Ms. Yang is already helping me.

379
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,984
- Hui-yeon is helping too.
- Is she useful at all?

380
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,902
What did she say? Forget it.

381
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,613
You already submitted
your proposal,

382
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,491
I didn't say anything but
it overlaps with mine.

383
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,618
Can I take you out of it?

384
00:33:58,454 --> 00:33:59,788
Once my name is on it,

385
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:02,583
it becomes a whole new level.

386
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,085
But I'm willing to add you.

387
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:07,296
So stop arguing.

388
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,380
Get out.

389
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,222
<i>Is this how it plays out?</i>

390
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,517
<i>Since I don't give
Su-min my proposal,</i>

391
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,519
<i>Kim Gyeong-uk will steal it.</i>

392
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,066
<i>Then he'll add
Su-min's name to it.</i>

393
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:33,363
Ms. Kang?

394
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:36,825
Hello, sir.

395
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,247
Are you free tonight?

396
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,083
Do you need something?

397
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,377
No, it's not that.

398
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:52,257
I want to buy you dinner.
Let's try to pick a time.

399
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:58,597
I have personal plans tonight.

400
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,350
If it's work-related...

401
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:06,688
tell me the TPO and I'll
schedule a time and place to eat.

402
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,026
No, you don't need
to do all that.

403
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,489
Okay.

404
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:17,366
Okay.

405
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,621
Personal plans?

406
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,854
Eun-ho, I think
you have a guest.

407
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,146
A guest?

408
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,153
Ji-won!

409
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:05,747
I thought this was just a
restaurant. Do you know this place?

410
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:08,917
Yeah, our restaurant makes
deals with this wine shop.

411
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:13,171
I wanted to show you a taste
that's out of this world.

412
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:22,097
Doesn't it smell good?
It's a Château Olrang 1999.

413
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,935
It was produced the year we
first met in high school.

414
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,855
It has notes of
cedar and cassis.

415
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,858
Also, it's not easy to
get rich blackberry notes.

416
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,611
I can really smell it!

417
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,363
I can smell grapes and trees.

418
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,119
- It's nice.
- Is it?

419
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,954
Wait a second.

420
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,414
The wholesale price

421
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:50,167
for all the wines here
are over a million won.

422
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,460
Let's try all of it.

423
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,712
Eun-ho.

424
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,298
To be honest, I came
out to buy you dinner.

425
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,382
Have you eaten?

426
00:36:58,467 --> 00:36:59,676
Me?

427
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:05,599
I tend to eat dinner
a little early.

428
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,517
I didn't think that far ahead.

429
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,604
No, that's okay. Come and sit.

430
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,648
It's been so long. Let's talk.

431
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:15,734
Okay.

432
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,338
What is she doing right now?

433
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:40,217
I wanted to take
care of her tonight.

434
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,302
She's got terrible luck.

435
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:46,890
Wait a minute.

436
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,877
Hey, Min-hwan.

437
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,212
Hi, Su-min.

438
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,381
Are you with Ji-won
by any chance?

439
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,008
I can't reach her.

440
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,551
Ji-won left earlier.

441
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,888
She looked pretty. She
kept looking in the mirror.

442
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:30,225
I figured she was going on a
date with you. Was I wrong?

443
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:31,685
What?

444
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,187
She looked pretty and left?

445
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:38,150
Min-hwan, you should
control Ji-won better.

446
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,277
<i>Control? Come on.</i>

447
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,696
She wouldn't run
off or anything.

448
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:45,991
Why not? She suddenly
changed her style too.

449
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,743
You never know with women.

450
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:51,413
Her mom found her soulmate
after she had Ji-won.

451
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:56,126
<i>Still, as a woman, I
think that's really cool.</i>

452
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,920
But it's a shame
for Ji-won though.

453
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,384
No, wait...

454
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:06,178
Ji-won's mom...

455
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:08,430
had an affair?

456
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:10,015
What?

457
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,143
Did you not know?

458
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,230
<i>What do I do?</i>

459
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:19,066
Did I make a mistake?

460
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,276
Never mind!

461
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,237
It wasn't Ji-won. It
was another friend...

462
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,406
I mean...

463
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:32,537
I just figured that
you already knew.

464
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,955
Yeah, well...

465
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,540
I know her mom left her

466
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:39,169
when she was just a kid.
I knew that already.

467
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:40,879
But the affair hit later...

468
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,881
I mean...

469
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:48,929
But you didn't know that she left
because she found true love, right?

470
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,810
What do I do?

471
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,689
This is driving me crazy.

472
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:02,275
Min-hwan?

473
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,070
<i>Just pretend like
you didn't hear that.</i>

474
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,155
<i>I made a mistake.</i>

475
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:11,201
Having an affair isn't genetics.
It's not a big problem.

476
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,411
Of course. Yeah.

477
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:15,122
It's not a problem.

478
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:22,587
I knew it. You're a
great guy, Min-hwan.

479
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:27,384
In return, I'll find out what
Ji-won did tonight and let you know.

480
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:30,095
I'm sure she's just
working though.

481
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:34,432
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah.

482
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,644
Okay, well. Call me.

483
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,271
<i>Okay.</i>

484
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,920
So you told me to never speak to you again
because you thought I turned you down?

485
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:13,638
I never want to
speak to you again.

486
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:16,183
No, no, no, no.

487
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:19,436
Don't bring that up.

488
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,898
You didn't just turn me down...

489
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,150
What did I say?

490
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:28,111
By any chance, do you have
the letter I wrote you?

491
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:32,574
Yeah, I do. You told me
to bring it, so I did.

492
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,368
Let's see.

493
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:42,751
DO YOU THINK EVERYONE LIKES
YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE POPULAR?

494
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,045
YOU MAKE ME VOMIT.
DON'T SPEAK TO ME!

495
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:46,128
KANG JI-WON

496
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,716
Isn't that your handwriting?

497
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:53,970
Yeah, it is.

498
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:58,433
But I really didn't write this.

499
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:04,731
<i>That means Su-min is able
to copy my handwriting.</i>

500
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,777
I can't believe it.

501
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:12,656
Are you cold?

502
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:15,200
Wait a second.

503
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,493
No.

504
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:19,788
I think the air
conditioning is strong here.

505
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,248
Shall we go?

506
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:23,375
Sure.

507
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,293
Let's do that.

508
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:35,929
Go ahead...

509
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:41,726
Eun-ho.

510
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,816
<i>I can see through Eun-ho at 31.</i>

511
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:50,735
<i>However...</i>

512
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,532
I have a boyfriend.

513
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:01,871
Really?

514
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:08,670
By any chance, is he tall and
wears horn-rimmed glasses?

515
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,339
Horn-rimmed glasses?

516
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,049
Yeah.

517
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:16,219
He wore a three button suit.

518
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:17,721
He wasn't fashionable...

519
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:26,396
I mean, he looked classic,
and he had an expensive watch.

520
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:29,441
Was it Mr. Yu?

521
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,820
How do you know him?

522
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:38,950
He's the one that told
me about the reunion.

523
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,620
How does he know you?

524
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:47,417
Come to think of
it, you're right.

525
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:52,213
I thought he was your boyfriend.

526
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:55,216
He was really worried about you.

527
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,364
You drank six bottles?

528
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:18,990
So six million won?

529
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:20,658
Then she turned you down?

530
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,623
- She didn't turn me down.
- Yeah, she did.

531
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:31,419
If she hadn't, you wouldn't be
sitting here sulking like this.

532
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:35,215
Before I give up on her,

533
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:36,925
she didn't turn me down.

534
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:39,719
Even if she has a boyfriend.

535
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,185
<i>Even if...</i>

536
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:50,271
another man has
feelings for her.

537
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:54,401
Did you even take her home?

538
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,779
- What?
- She turned you down.

539
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,114
Just give up.

540
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,617
Darn it...

541
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,623
Goodness.

542
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,807
{\an8}ASSISTANT MANAGER KANG JI-WON

543
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:49,956
{\an8}CALLING ASSISTANT
MANAGER KANG JI-WON

544
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:56,963
PARK MIN-HWAN

545
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,798
{\an8}PARK MIN-HWAN MISSED CALL

546
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,265
It's just stomach cramps.

547
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:10,143
It's not good to drink
wine on an empty stomach.

548
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:11,226
Okay.

549
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:16,733
Once the pain subsides, take
the medicine with warm soups.

550
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:18,568
Okay, here you go.

551
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,380
Wine isn't good on
an empty stomach.

552
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:16,251
You scared me!

553
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:21,631
Are you crazy? Why
are you overreacting?

554
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:24,342
Was it you?

555
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:26,427
Why?

556
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,597
Were you hoping it
was another man?

557
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,141
No...

558
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:36,521
Why would you follow me like that?
You could've just called out.

559
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:40,525
Why should I make you comfortable?
You don't even pick up my calls!

560
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:42,986
What?

561
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:44,737
Be real.

562
00:47:44,821 --> 00:47:47,198
You're being overly
self-conscious.

563
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:51,536
Men aren't interested
in you! Got it?

564
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:53,913
Still, seeing you scared

565
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:55,790
made it more fun.

566
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:57,750
Is this fun for you?

567
00:47:58,418 --> 00:47:59,419
Yeah, it's fun.

568
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:05,633
By the way...

569
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:07,677
Where were you?

570
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,931
Did you reapply
lipstick after work?

571
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:14,434
What are you saying?

572
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:15,685
See!

573
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:19,856
Why are your lips so red?

574
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:26,029
Who were you hitting on
now? What's on your face?

575
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,281
Is that blush?

576
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:30,325
Your face is rosy.

577
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:34,537
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

578
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:40,668
What did you just say?

579
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,546
What?

580
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,506
What did you just say, Min-hwan?

581
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,590
What?

582
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,718
I didn't say anything.

583
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,930
I'm only being like this
because you're being shady!

584
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:55,808
<i>It was Su-min.</i>

585
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:58,394
<i>She told him about my mom.</i>

586
00:48:58,478 --> 00:48:59,604
What?

587
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,648
You are acting strange lately.

588
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:03,775
You don't normally buy clothes!

589
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:05,693
What's this?

590
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:08,696
Is that perfume?

591
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:11,908
What perfume? It's soap!

592
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:16,037
Where'd you go after work?

593
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,206
Tell me the truth.

594
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:22,919
Let go of me!

595
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:26,964
That hurts.

596
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:28,549
This little...

597
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:31,636
I'll see what time
you clocked out.

598
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,137
So tell me the truth.

599
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:34,806
What did you do?

600
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,516
What the hell?

601
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,447
Is that you, Mr. Yu?

602
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,327
Sir?

603
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:03,251
What's your deal? So what if
you're the general manager?

604
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:06,045
What's going on between you?

605
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:08,131
Are you crazy...

606
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:11,217
Wait...

607
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:14,887
She was going to
die anyway, right?

608
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:17,807
Mr. Yu!

609
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,935
You can't do this!

610
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,234
Mr. Yu!

611
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:32,488
Let go of me!

612
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:35,283
Damn it...

613
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:38,703
Damn it.

614
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:02,477
Wait. Why did I run away?

615
00:51:04,187 --> 00:51:08,065
Yu Ji-hyuk, that bastard. I
could've taken him any other day...

616
00:51:14,614 --> 00:51:17,950
It's Yu Ji-hyuk. He has
no reason to follow me.

617
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:20,036
What?

618
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:24,040
But why didn't Ji-won follow me?

619
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,668
Is she out of her mind?

620
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:29,504
What?

621
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:31,047
Together?

622
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:33,299
Crap!

623
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,813
Leaving a woman behind
in a situation like this

624
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:49,565
was my husband.

625
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:58,157
How's your wrist?

626
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,079
But what are you doing here?

627
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:08,918
I had business in the area.

628
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:11,629
What business?

629
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:14,966
Well, the thing is...

630
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:23,432
you wouldn't answer your phone.

631
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,981
I figured nothing happened,
but just to be sure.

632
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:32,316
Why are you worried about me?

633
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:35,444
It's after work hours.

634
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:38,614
Even if something
were to happen to me,

635
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:42,243
- it has nothing to do with you.
- Yes, it does.

636
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,499
I'm worried

637
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,460
Mr. Park might hurt you.

638
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:59,886
Why would you think that way?

639
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:01,596
People don't change.

640
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,224
They repeat their actions.

641
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:09,520
<i>He does have violent tendencies,
did he catch on to that?</i>

642
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,773
<i>I didn't know before
I got married.</i>

643
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:16,319
- Min-hwan has never touched me like...
- I just saw him.

644
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,742
This isn't that bad.

645
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,870
No, don't say it like that.

646
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:29,081
No one is allowed to
touch you like that.

647
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:33,419
It's no big deal?

648
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:36,714
I should've broken
all of his fingers.

649
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:40,384
<i>I could tell he is
insightful because of NurTV.</i>

650
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,136
<i>The problem is...</i>

651
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,512
No.

652
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:48,351
It was fun seeing
Min-hwan so scared.

653
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:55,608
So that's not the problem.

654
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,616
What's going on?

655
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:08,162
I came to see her
fight with Min-hwan.

656
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,377
PARK MIN-HWAN

657
00:54:16,379 --> 00:54:17,379
SLIDE TO ANSWER

658
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:20,341
Hello?

659
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,176
Yes, Min-hwan?

660
00:54:24,637 --> 00:54:26,973
The way you're acting
is uncomfortable.

661
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,058
I'm just worried...

662
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,602
I don't want you to worry.

663
00:54:33,396 --> 00:54:35,731
Your feelings make
me uncomfortable.

664
00:54:38,234 --> 00:54:40,820
Do you know how I feel?

665
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:49,120
I don't like cheating
for personal reasons.

666
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:52,790
I don't think a person
should betray anyone.

667
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,711
I've taken care of that.

668
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,548
You what?

669
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:07,263
Is your girlfriend a
task to be taken care of?

670
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:10,641
- No, that's not...
- Wow, I didn't take you for that type.

671
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,977
You're worse than I thought.

672
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:18,774
Hui-yeon is a very
precious person to me.

673
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,445
Hui-yeon is so nice and pretty.

674
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:24,363
She's very lovable...

675
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:30,036
Forget it. I'm going
to talk to her myself.

676
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,248
No, wait, Ji-won. Just a second.

677
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:36,167
Calm down first.

678
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:39,503
Will you hear me out?

679
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:44,592
You think I'm dating Yu Hui-yeon

680
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,969
and I'm trying to cheat on her?

681
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:49,472
Because I have feelings for you.

682
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:51,182
Are you not?

683
00:55:52,892 --> 00:55:54,226
You're right.

684
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,397
Just the part about
me liking you.

685
00:56:02,902 --> 00:56:03,903
Now...

686
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,787
MOST BEAUTIFUL

687
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:20,127
<i>Why are you calling so
late at night? It's scary.</i>

688
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,755
- Hui-yeon.
- <i>This phone will self-destruct</i>

689
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:25,341
<i>in five seconds if you
don't get to the point.</i>

690
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:26,801
- <i>Five, four...</i>
- I love you.

691
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:32,306
Does she sound
like my girlfriend?

692
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:35,768
MOST BEAUTIFUL

693
00:56:38,104 --> 00:56:40,815
Just so you know, Hui-yeon
saved it like this.

694
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:49,198
<i>I shouldn't see you
for a month after that!</i>

695
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:52,034
<i>But I'll have to see
you at work tomorrow.</i>

696
00:56:52,118 --> 00:56:56,622
<i>Are you terminally ill or something?
Are you leaving the family register now?</i>

697
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,290
END CALL

698
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,544
I...

699
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:05,798
Wait...

700
00:57:07,258 --> 00:57:10,719
So, she's your sister!

701
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,264
Yu Hui-yeon.

702
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,640
Yu Ji-hyuk.

703
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:22,815
What do I do? I'm so sorry!

704
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:27,111
Please forget
everything I said today.

705
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:29,655
I have made a huge
misunderstanding.

706
00:57:31,574 --> 00:57:33,659
You didn't
misunderstand all of it.

707
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:36,620
I...

708
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:45,838
like you a lot.

709
00:58:09,195 --> 00:58:10,863
Thanks for bringing me home.

710
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:35,930
Mr. Yu...

711
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:39,225
Mr. Yu.

712
00:58:39,308 --> 00:58:40,392
Mr. Yu!

713
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,395
What do I do?

714
00:58:44,313 --> 00:58:45,481
Mr. Yu!

715
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:46,565
Mr. Yu?

716
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:50,361
Mr. Yu!

717
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,087
{\an8}<i>So for Ji-won's sake,</i>

718
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,463
{\an8}<i>you should break up.</i>

719
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,257
{\an8}<i>Don't you think
you're out of line?</i>

720
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:15,261
{\an8}<i>The first step to win is to get
on the mat and face your opponent.</i>

721
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:19,807
{\an8}<i>I have to stop letting shameless
people take things from me.</i>

722
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:23,352
{\an8}<i>He's the most decent
man Ji-won has ever met.</i>

723
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:24,435
{\an8}You're out.

724
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:28,315
{\an8}It'd be good to use Director
Wang's name to promote it.

725
00:59:28,399 --> 00:59:30,109
{\an8}You're capable of fighting well.

726
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:33,362
{\an8}<i>First, get on the mat
and face my opponent.</i>

727
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:35,781
{\an8}<i>The problem is,
how do I flip it?</i>

728
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,289
