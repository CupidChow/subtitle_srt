00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,070
My dear Ji Won

3
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,160
You are still beautiful

4
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,540
If you leave me, I won't forgive you

5
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,830
Don't forget that I am by your side

6
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,130
You want to live with me for a long time

7
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Thank you

8
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,840
I don't have good luck with my husband, but luckily I have good luck with my friends.

9
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,930
How can you say that?

10
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,770
Min Hwan is a very good husband

11
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,980
- That guy has another woman
-What?

12
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,020
He sent me messages saying he loved me and missed me

13
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,070
Then deleted it immediately

14
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,070
It must have been sent to the wrong person.

15
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,330
Don't be so sensitive

16
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,750
Do you want me to go talk to Min-hwan?

17
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,050
No need, I have you and that's enough for me

18
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,720
I only have you.

19
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,850
Just think positively, okay? My significant other

20
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,230
Ms. Jiang Zhiyuan, it's time to go to the injection room

21
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,614
This time the medicine doesn't hurt at all

22
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,657
You'll feel better after the fight.

23
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:22,453
Don't give up, never

26
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,860
I can't remember the last time
When do you feel happy?

27
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,280
Why do I miss you so much?

28
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,000
If we hurry, there are only six months left.

29
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,710
If a miracle happens, there are still 12 months left.

30
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,380
There will be no next time now.

31
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,440
Thank you for your hard work. You look beautiful today.

32
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,360
You are really beautiful

33
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,110
The wedding dress I picked for you is really suitable

34
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,160
Forget it, now you are married into the Park family

35
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,370
You are my daughter.

36
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,590
A distressing little thing

37
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,340
It's not your fault that you don't have a tutor.

38
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,930
Now, mom, let me teach you

39
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,430
Poor little thing

40
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,860
Our Min-hwan is the only son of the third generation of the Jinhae Park family.

41
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,030
Three generations of only son

42
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,070
How dare you cut off our family line?

43
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,320
sorry

44
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,240
I took in your useless thing.
Why can’t I have children?

45
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,200
What exactly can you do?

46
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,080
-Mom, please bear with it.
-Let me go

47
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,050
What a waste, sit down, why are you so angry?

48
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,010
(Duga Holdings)

49
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,010
What? You quit?

50
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,100
I want to invest in stocks

51
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,100
You remember Roy Gentar back then?

52
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,140
A few more bucks can turn your life around

53
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,060
I can't earn anything I can in order to work in a company.

54
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,270
This won't work.

55
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,400
We have to pay so much loan every month

56
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,150
Shouldn't you at least discuss this with me first?

57
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,400
Hey, are you kidding me?

58
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,700
Why should I discuss my affairs with you?

59
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,660
Mother

60
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,580
Mom, will I be successful? Will I make a lot of money?

61
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,420
Of course, my son is good at everything.

62
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,510
Is there something going on at home? Is it just you who has a family?

63
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,840
Everyone here has a family.

64
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,930
No wonder people say married women shouldn't work

65
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,760
What are you doing

66
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,770
sorry

67
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,090
You said you would fix the door lock today

68
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,130
I'm not playing

69
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,890
You think you work overtime every day?

70
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,970
Does it look like you are good at doing things?

71
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,560
That's because you're bad at work.
I'll be so busy that I'll be dizzy

72
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,140
You need to be self-aware

73
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,310
Didn't you hear the washing machine?

74
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,600
I put the clothes down to wash

75
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,730
- You should at least take out the laundry...
-hateful

76

Hello!

77
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,940
I've been working all day and I've just sat down

78
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,780

The situation is not optimistic

81
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,510
So pitiful, what should I do?

82
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,430
My son

83
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,980
Why marry that kind of person?

84
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,480
So I can't recognize people clearly.

85
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,280
Now things are finally on track.
How could I be so unlucky?

86
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,900
Mom, Kang Ji-won has cancer

87
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,360
Who's going to cook for me?

88
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,330
Are you too kind?
Why worry about such a thing?

89
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,200
People need to work to overcome illness

90
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,210
Technology is so advanced now, nothing will happen.

91
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,630
Isn’t it?

92
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,380
Don't even think about telling the company, just work until you can't go anymore

93
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,130
Don't be so emotional over there, saying you are sick.

94
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,380
That's asking for trouble.

95
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,300
Can't we just cut it off?

96
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,220
Technology is advanced, nothing will happen.

97
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,270

Don't mind your husband having an affair.

101

I'm older, it's better to not have a husband

102
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,670
If you are not feeling well, stop thinking about bad things.

103
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,050
Don’t you have a good friend?

104
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,850
She is so pretty and kind

105
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Yes, I have a good friend.

106
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,290
She is smart and capable

107
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,130
I am the section chief of U&K.

108
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,300

I haven't even calculated how much money I make to support my family.

128
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,170

141
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,010
That's not a bad word.

142
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,930
There's no benefit in living

143
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,890

149

So…

Just think of it as your dad giving you pocket money.
Keep it as a souvenir.

167
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,350
Then you will immediately become lively

168

Then invest the rest of the money in stocks
I plan to buy you a better bag

184
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,950
It's so kind of you

185
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,790
When Ji-won dies, we'll buy a house.

186
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,370
Buying a house is good

187
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,460
But that woman lasted longer than I expected.

188
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,260
I'm just afraid that she will do this, even if she is insured
I didn't ask her to see a doctor.

189
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,300
She's pretty tenacious.

190
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,480
Do you want me to take her out for some fresh air?
Push her secretly?

191
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,230
No, what if you fall down too?

192
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,570
How can it not work? I just need to push it gently.

193
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,820
No one will find out

194
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,360
What on earth did she eat to make her so tenacious?

195
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,490
Then you should eat with her.

196
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,910
I am strong without eating.

197
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,050
You two crazy people!

198
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,310
Ji Won

199
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,100
Honey, are you okay?

200
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,480
Spit it out

201
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,070
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine

202
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,990
You're committing insurance fraud.

203
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,200
I want to report you

204
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,620
Hello!

205
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,870
What are you doing?

206
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,660
Honey, are you okay?

207
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,210
-I'm fine
-Are you really okay?

208
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,290
-Um
-good

209
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,170
If you leave me, I won't forgive you

211
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,440
I'm going to kill both of you today.

212

I'm going to kill both of you!

213
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,360
Hello, Hello, Hello

214
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,190
Have you had enough?

215
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,110
Don’t you feel bored?

216
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,280
Ouch

217

218
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,170
Hello

219
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,880
What else can you do now?

220
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,510
Let's go

221
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,060
Get out of the way

222
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,690
Hello!

223
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,780
You really are

224
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,200

226
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,510
sorry

227
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,310
sorry?

228
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,150
It's done.

229
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,030
What can I do now?

230
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,280
The living must continue to live

231
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,740
You're going to die anyway.

232
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,830
Why do you always think only of yourself?

233
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,930
You really have it.

234
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,480
Won't you die?

235
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,440
Do you think you won't die?

236
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,610
- You will die too
-That's enough!

237
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,400
- Really
-Stop fighting!

238
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,490
Honey!

239
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,450
Hello

240
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,990
If you want to die, just die obediently, get out of here!

241
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,810
The happiness I desire is out of reach

242
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,570
And the familiar misfortune is right in front of us

243
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,370
Honey

244
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,750
She seems dead

245
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,000
She'll die anyway.

246
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,750
Does it matter how you die?

247
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,960
What should we do?

248
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,090
You be quiet

249
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,840
Anyway, she is a cancer patient and often faints.

250
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,260
She slipped herself

251
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,890
We are only seeing it now
I don't know what happened

252
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,640
Will we not be able to receive the insurance money in this case?

253
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,810
-Will it?
-what to do?

254
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,270
In short, six months

255
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,610
If a miracle happens, 12 months

256
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,070
I won't live as long as the doctor said.

257
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,070
I am dead

258
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,290
(April 12, 2023)

259
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,340
Honey, what are you doing?

260
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,930
Why do you look so distraught?

261
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,520
Why are you holding your glasses in your hand instead of putting them on?

262
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,450
Have you been to the doctor?

263
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,210
What did the doctor say?

264
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,680
Honey, what happened to you? It hurts.

265
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,140
it hurts

266
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,860

I don't know

279

287

Come out, let's go eat something

366
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,140
Ji-won, what's wrong with you?

367
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,890
You haven't answered the phone since you rushed out of the company

368
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,770
I'm worried about you

369
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,560
I'm on my way to your house

370
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,900
I'm not feeling well

371
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,150
Don't come over. I'm with Min-hwan now.

372
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,660
Oh no

373
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,580
Hello, Hello, Hello

374
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,340
You are really ignorant.

375
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,630
Okay, you have mixed feelings, that's okay.

376
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,470
Although I don't quite understand

377
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,640
But other girls say that, okay, I know

378
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,760
I see

379
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,970
But why do you want to work in the company?
Is it so obvious?

380
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,640
Isn’t this quite right?

381
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:54,230
What good will it do you to make things difficult for me?

382
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,030
Can you explain it so that I can understand?

383
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,740
When exactly is it?

384
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,120
We haven't done it recently.

385
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,460
How did you get pregnant?

386
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,630
Is that my child?

387
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,130
What?

388
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,010
Didn't you say you seemed pregnant?

389
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,140
I remember

390
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,930
Because I can't eat these days.
So I thought I was pregnant

391
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,350
It's actually stress gastritis

392
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,190
Did it start from this time?

393
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,860
Not only does it keep putting pressure on me until I die

394
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,860
And I fucked with my friend

395
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,530
I'm kidding.

396
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,990
You don't have the ability to do anything with other men

397
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,240
Don't misunderstand me

398
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,660
I'm just saying you're not young anymore.

399
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,330
If you stop now
I can't work anymore.

400
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,750
That's a career interruption.

401
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,380
You love your work and you know how to do it

402
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,470
I don't want to become a yellow-faced woman, staying at home all day.

403
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,760
If you were to have a baby now

404
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,390
It's like cutting
The wings of the birds flying outside

405
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,980
If I didn't know you would quit your job and stay at home to rely on me

406
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,850
What you said seems to make sense.

407
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,110
Take it away

408
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:20,730
Surgery fee...

409
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,490
good

410
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:25,900
I pay half

411
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,530
-half?
- You're going to take it off anyway

412
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,870
Wouldn’t it be better for your health if you removed it early?

413
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,370
And I don't want kids

414
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,000
There is no benefit in raising children in this era

415
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,840
Our Min-hwan is the only son of the third generation of the Jinhae Park family.

416
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
How dare you cut off our family line?

417
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,770
I am not pregnant

418
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,060
It is gastritis

419
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,280
You are not pregnant?

420
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,240
Gastritis? It turns out it's gastritis.

421
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,450
Then why are you so sensitive?

422
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,620
Let's break up

423
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,340
-What?
-You have nothing to say?

424
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,680
Are you done?

425
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:39,480
You went crazy on me at work today
I thought you were pregnant, trying to understand you

426
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,060
But you said you want to break up?

427
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,190
Let me go

428
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,570
You guy

429
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,030
Hey, did I say something wrong?

430
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,860
Why are you mad at me?

431
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,450
-I forgot
-Are you crazy?

432
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,870
Park Min-hwan is a madman

433
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,330
It doesn't matter if I die

434
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,870
But you can't stand me saying I want to break up

435
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,000
Let me go.

436
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,830
Why do you want to break up with me? Why do you?

437
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,250
I'm going to kill you

438
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,010
Tell me, what right do you have? Why?

439
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:11,970
You say it

440
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,300
Do you think you can break up with me?

441
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,760
Why do you tell me you want to break up?

442
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,470
Tell me, why?

443
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,560
Tell me what you say!

444
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,650
Is anyone there? Help!

445
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,740
Help!

446
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,530
Please save me!

447
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,530
Miss

448
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,120
You can't call the police just because a couple quarrels.

449
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,370
It's not a couple's quarrel. He just said to me...

450
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,710
I know, I know very well

451
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,040
But most of the girls who call the police

452
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,590
Afterwards, I always ask why I did that to my boyfriend.

453
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,470
How helpless would we be then?

454
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,380
Mr. Police

455
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,590
Girls are always extra sensitive for a few days.

456
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,890
I apologize for her

457
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,470
You weren't interrupted anywhere.

458
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,390
I see your boyfriend is an employee of a large company

459
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:07,070
You can't just come to the police station because you're angry...

460
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:07,980
gentlemen

461
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,360
Is this the place where I need to break off to get here?

462
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,110
never mind

463
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,160
Can you at least take me home today?

464
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,050
This can't go on any longer.

465
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,550
(Balance: 718,916 KRW)

466
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,100
What to do?

467
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,270
(Balance: 718,916 KRW
Payee: Park Min-hwan)

468
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,560
At this time, I was already afraid of breaking up

469
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,400
Do everything according to his wishes.

470
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,020
I have given him a lot of money.

471
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,280
He also used the cash advance feature on my credit card

472
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:52,900
what to do?

473
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,110
Can't think of a solution

474
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,280
I have already received my retirement benefits.

475
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,030
I want to escape with 700,000 won

476
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,370
Can't even last a month

477
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,170
I'm sorry for yelling at you just now.

478
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,540
-But you're also very wrong
-What?

479
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,340
I really meant what I said just now.

480
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,090
So I plan to make a lot of money from the stock this time

481
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:13,010
I'm going to buy you a bag.

482
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,300
I got a tip that Roy Gentar was going to buy

483
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,180
madman

484
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,550
If this one goes up, we'll get married.

485
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,150
I want to invest in stocks
You remember Roy Gental back then, right?

486
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,320
Roy Gental?

487
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,610
Roy Gental?

488
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,360
How could I not have thought of that?

489
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:38,660
Roy Gental

490
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,870
The only successful thing in Park Min-hwan's life

491
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,240
I figured out a way.

492
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,250
Let's use this to get through this stage first.

493
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:49,460
Although I can't remember

494
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,960
Everything that has happened since 2013

495
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,630
But I know exactly what will succeed

496
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,840
Give it a try

497
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,390
This time I really want to live a good life

498
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,690
(Scanning progress)

499
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:16,650
You see

500
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,240
It is not necessary to take a photo

501
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,660
It's just gastritis

502
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,990
It's a little serious. You need to take medicine properly.

503
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,290
Don't be stressed

504
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,210
good

505
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,880
very good

506
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,470
I want to maintain my current health

507
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,970
(“If you want to quit your job, please read this book”)

508
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:09,210
(“If you want to quit your job, please read this book”)

509
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,840
minister

510
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,880
“There’s nothing wrong with retiring on stocks”

511
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,800
"You want to be a salaried worker until the end of your life?"

512
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,680
"If you want to quit your job, please read this book"

513
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:25,470
Are you planning to quit your job?

514
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,720
No

515
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,480
Is this

516
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,150
The injury you got yesterday?

517
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,030
Sorry, I didn't notice, what should I do?

518
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,490
If you feel sorry, buy me a meal.

519
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,080
I like to eat soup rice

520
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,880
What's wrong?

521
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:05,720
What?

522
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,970
You said you wanted to come to Tang Restaurant

523
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,230
I didn't expect it to be this kind of place

524
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,190
Are there any other kinds of soup restaurants?

525
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,780
No

526
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,860
I've never talked to him before, so I didn't notice.

527
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:24,490
He is very...

528
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:25,700
Thanks

529
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,740
Feels like a rich young master

530
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,700
Please use it

531
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,180
How about it?

532
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,690
Much better than I thought

533
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,860
You haven't eaten yet?

534
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,480
What are you doing?

535
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,910
I mean soup rice

536
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:11,410
Thanks

537
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,580
So he is this kind of person?

538
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:21,550
He is more handsome and considerate than I remembered, and...

539
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,010
Have you been to the doctor?

540
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,180
Yes, I just went to see it.

541
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,180
On the way back, I stopped by the bookstore.

542
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,600
Thank you so much for yesterday

543
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,980
You take me home

544
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,610
I also bought cup noodles and chamomile...

545
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,440
You feel very different from usual.

546
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,440
Do I have it?

547
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,740
Do you really want to quit your job?

548
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,370
I'm actually considering

549
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:54,750
I feel like I can't go on like this anymore

550
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:59,670
I feel like it's time to make some changes.

551
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,090
-Are you getting married?
-What?

552
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,670
Because you also bought the interior decoration book
I guess you might be planning to get married.

553
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,090
("Follow the experts to do interior decoration")

554
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,760
Oh, this is...

555
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,890
Indeed, this year I started preparing
Marry Park Min-hwan

556
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,480
I am also considering getting married

557
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,020
I would rather die than get married.

558
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:31,200
actually…

559
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,950
(Other half)

560
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:57,850
It doesn't matter

561
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,110
My dear Zhiyuan, please reply immediately when you see this

562
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,030
Why doesn't she answer the phone?

563
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,320
She caused such a commotion in the company yesterday

564
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:24,540
I only have you, Jiwon

565
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,930
Where is she and what is she doing?
Why don't you answer the phone?

566
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,310
The scars are exactly the same

567
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,070
sorry

568
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:58,870
I see you seem badly injured.

569
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,620
No

570
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,710
let's go

571
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,760
good

572
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:15,890
Thank you for the treat

573
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:17,140
Now you don't owe me anything.

574
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,930
One meal is enough

575
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,810
OK

576
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:24,980
besides

577
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,530
You are a very capable person.

578
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,860
Although marriage is good, family is also important

579
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:35,820
But it's a shame you left.

580
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:39,450
As a boss, I think so

581
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,340
Thanks

582
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,470
Then I'll take my leave first.

583
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,630
good

584
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:19,530
(Work, instant meal kits, skyrocketing stocks)

585
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,160
(quick cooking meal package)

586
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:31,710
You are a very capable person.

587
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,800
(Chamomile tea)

588
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:38,090
Because he always had a stern face before.
I'm afraid of him.

589
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:41,220
I didn't expect him to be such a nice guy.

590
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:45,850
How does he know that I am capable?

591
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,730
I forgot all

592
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,150
I am good at doing things

593
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,070
I have a lot of things I want to do in the company.

594
00:51:57,410 --> 00:52:00,370
Things that no longer belong to me after marriage

595
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:04,250
Since I can't be stronger than Park Min-hwan
So the things that have never been fought for

596
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,540
What Kang Ji-won wants to do

597
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:17,720
(Kang Ji-won)

598
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,220
She really is

599
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,930
It makes me unhappy again

600
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:39,860
Why should I suffer like this for Park Min-hwan?

601
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,210
Let's start working quickly.

602
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,300
Ten minutes before work
You should be ready to start working.

603
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,720
I see it all

604
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,800
Work hard, you know?

605
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,350
Kang Ji-won

606
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:08,430
Kang Ji-won

607
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,240
(Roy Gental)

608
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,330
(Quantity: Full amount)

609
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:29,540
(Cash purchase)

610
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,000
(Are you sure you want to buy?)

611
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,250
Oh my god, it's up again.

612
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,090
How much will it increase?

613
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:38,880
Ji Won

614
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,520
I thought you were going to call me last night

615
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:52,850
What were you doing yesterday?

616
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:58,280
Me yesterday?

617
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,280
Do you know the MODU community?

618
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,030
I'm looking at that website.
Marriage, husband's family, wife's family

619
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,370
I forgot the time when I saw it.

620
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,580
So that's it

621
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:14,790
There is a girl who is in the terminal stage of cancer

622
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:18,960
She saw her husband having sex with her bestie

623
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,050
Oh my god, really? That's crazy.

624
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:25,430
Crazy, right?

625
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:30,310
I think her bestie is more disgusting than her husband.

626
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,810
How could she do this to her best friend?

627
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,560
That is to say

628
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:40,400
She probably meant that her best friend would die anyway.
So it doesn't matter.

629
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:49,660
If I die, you can take everything I have.

630
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,790
But if you die, I will die with you

631
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,960
-Kang Ji-won
-exist!

632
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,270
When will your runaway brain come back?

633
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:17,020
Is my proposal that bad?

634
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,440
Is it bad?

635
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,570
It's too good to say that this is bad.

636
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,360
The whole mess

637
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:30,580
(Proposal for quick-cooking meal kits in the one-person household era)

638
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:35,410
This proposal was rejected at this time.

639
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,960
However

640
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:41,130
Zheng Xiumin handed over the proposal without changing a word
But the section chief praised it and implemented it.

641
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,210
Ji Won

642
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,800
This is really good.

643
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,050
How about I make some minor revisions and submit it again?

644
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:53,350
Zheng Xiumin thus became a full-time employee and was promoted step by step

645
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,850
Is this reasonable?

646
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,560
One-person household? Homemade meal kits?

647
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,900
Living alone, who can cook for themselves?

648
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,940
It's troublesome to fill water and turn on the fire.

649
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:06,030
But you want to vacuum pack the green onions?

650
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:07,990
Freeze dried squid?

651
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:11,490
It takes until midnight just to unpack the packages one by one.

652
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,330
Do you think this makes sense?

653
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:16,830
The development team will definitely say
"Be yourself and do it"

654
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:20,460
-What should I do then?
- Section Chief Kim Kyung-wook

655
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,880
He is a rude and incompetent scoundrel.

656
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,550
He's also a relationship expert.

657
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:26,130
Who is that?

658
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,930
He has a connection with a very famous high-ranking person.

659
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,220
Who am I talking to now?

660
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:32,850
Agent Jiang

661
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:34,600
what's on your mind?

662
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:39,270
Please tell me if there is anything wrong, I will modify it immediately

663
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:43,070
Women have this problem, they are so dependent

664
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,480
Do your own thing

665
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:49,070
When you come to work
We should also consider other people's eyes.

666
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,450
How can a girl dress like this?

667
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,700
Agent Yang is a married woman.

668
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:56,040
You are still a lady.

669
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,660
How can we men survive like this?

670
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,710
This is all because women didn't join the army

671
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:05,340
Our country should also allow women to serve in the military

672
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:06,880
Right? Agent Park

673
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,800
Yes, that's right, I will push it forward

674
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,380
Right?

675
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,300
You do it again

676
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,580
Although she is Jin Jingxu's right-hand man
So we hardly talked.

677
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:42,960
But she's a very capable person.

678
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,800
Because Jin Jingxu blocked her promotion
She was just a permanent agent until she left.

679
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,090
But as usual
She is more than qualified to be a section chief now.

680
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,890
-that…
-Agent Yang

681
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,680
Section Chief Jin is looking for you

682
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:42,020
Very good

683
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,860
- Let's talk
- I have nothing to say

684
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:49,940
I have…

685
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,440
hateful

686
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:03,830
Oh my god

687
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,250
careful

688
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:08,840
Are you okay? You suddenly ran out

689
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,130
What's going on? Just now it seemed...

690
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:12,970
I'm fine, I'm sorry.

691
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,550
sorry

692
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,360
I'm sure I feel the same

693
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,400
And it's the same place

694
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:38,030
No

695
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,490
This is impossible, what am I thinking?

696
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:44,870
Hello

697
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,080
Hello

698
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,750
Hello, Kang Ji-won, hey!

699
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,880
Hello, Kang Ji-won

700
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:56,550
How are you?

701
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,310
I was still injured after all

702
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:10,610
Injury in the same area

703
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,240
Although I avoided it, I still couldn't avoid it

704
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:22,120
Then I won't...

705
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:29,920
don't want

706
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:34,130
But my scars are gone.

707
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:38,590
I used to be afraid that I was pregnant and I was shaking with worry.

708
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,640
I knocked over the coffee pot and got burned.

709
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,140
What does this mean? I should be able to figure it out.

710
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,490
(Marketing Team 1, Park Min-hwan
Send a photo)

711
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,300

714
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:29,020
You sold Roy Gental?

01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:30,520
Let's Talk

716
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,560
Are you ignoring me?

717
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:34,440
What kind of demeanor is this?

718
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:39,320
Hey, I sold my stock.

719
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:40,990
To pay you back

720
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:42,610
I have transferred the money to you, please confirm it

721
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,740
If TKU Technology surges

722
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:47,240
I will make more money, so I don't regret it.

723
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:50,080
But you have to remember that I sold the skyrocketing stocks for you

724
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:53,000
You are that kind of person

725
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,420
TKU Technology?

726
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,210
Regarding the so-called TKU list
Members of the ruling and opposition parties…

727
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:02,590
Even I, who don’t know much about stocks, know about TKU Technology

728
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,470
It is a famous hype stock.

729
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,010
After the company boss hyped up the stock

730
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,770
Flee abroad, stocks are delisted

731
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,640
He actually sold Roy Gental, which was skyrocketing

732
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:12,440
Bought TKU which will plummet?

733
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,060
Because I bought Roy Gental

734
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:16,860
So Park Min-hwan sold it

735
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,570
Marketing team came to the meeting

736
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:23,030
Remember to bring your new product survey information

737
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:24,620
good

738
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:44,300
Oh my god, it's up again.

739
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,470
Hey, I sold my stock.

740
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:58,440
What is supposed to happen will eventually happen

741
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,410
How is your injury?

742
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:14,830
But just let it happen.
No matter who it happens to

743
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,580
You're always getting hurt and that makes me worried.

744
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:18,920
I almost had a heart attack.

745
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,840
Are you listening to me?

746
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,060
Xiumin

747
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,520
I have trash to throw away

748
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,730
Can you help me throw it away?

749
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:41,570
What are you talking about?

750
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:44,490
Please

751
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,030
You are my other half

752
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,540
Okay

753
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:54,000
You're going to date me this weekend.

754
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:59,750
I found a delicious barbecue restaurant.
Guse Pavilion

755
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:10,180
OK, let's go

756
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,100
As long as you help me take out the trash

757
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,560
good

758
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,650
Agent Jiang Zhiyuan, clerk Zheng Xiumin, please come over quickly

759
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:28,160
good

760
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:46,800
You covet my garbage

761
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:55,930
Then you handle it.

762
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,320
Marry my husband.

763
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,170
I need someone to steal my destiny

764
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:26,460
If anyone stole my destiny, it should be you

765
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:28,300
Kang Ji-won is so boring

766
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,340
So annoying

767
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,130
It's not that I don't know

768
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:33,470
As long as it doesn't suit your taste, you will be scheming

769
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:35,260
Because you are very capable, Agent Park

770
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:37,970
What perfume do you use?

771
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:38,930
You're dead today.

772
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,940
You two love each other to death

773
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,480
I will help you get results quickly.

774
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,400
Do you have any dates this weekend?

775
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,520
You are the priority

776
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:47,440
Just remember that you owe me a favor.

777
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:51,070
You are here because of Liu Zhihe
Are you saying you want to break up with me? That crazy old man

778
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,450
I won't be bullied anymore.

779
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,080
