1
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:46,464
Please, wait here.

2
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:16,035
{\an8}6 DAYS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.

3
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:22,041
You look better in person.

4
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:25,836
Yeah, everyone says that
I look better in person.

5
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,049
By the way, have we met before?

6
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,759
You look familiar.

7
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,427
We've never met.

8
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,304
But we know the same person.

9
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,227
Kang Ji-won stole my fiancÃ©.

10
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,610
Goodness... Are you stupid?

11
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,446
How could you bring
up money first?

12
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,032
I said to work her
acting like a good mom!

13
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,450
<i>I tried!</i>

14
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,285
She just drew the line.

15
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:01,831
She confronted me right in my
face. She's really something.

16
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,708
Then you should've played dumb!

17
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,460
Forget it.

18
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,755
No wonder why you
live a crappy life.

19
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:11,632
Damn it.

20
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,800
MIN-HWAN

21
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,636
Where'd you get
Ji-hyuk's photos?

22
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,347
Took you long
enough to ask. Why?

23
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,349
<i>Where are you? It's late.</i>

24
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,685
I'm asking you a question!

25
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,312
Did you get those
in an envelope?

26
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,356
What did it say?

27
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:32,027
How do you know that?

28
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:40,911
"Friend"?

29
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:53,048
I guess a rich girl is upset
because someone stole her man.

30
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:58,178
But shrimps are
smart these days.

31
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,391
They know they'll only
suffer in a whales' fight.

32
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,143
Are you joking me?

33
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,185
Damn it...

34
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,358
Where am I? Why did
I follow her here?

35
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,738
People who think like you live
as shrimp all their lives.

36
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,073
Especially you, a
freshwater shrimp.

37
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:22,202
A bite-sized one who doesn't
know how big the ocean is.

38
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,247
You little... Say it again.

39
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:28,584
Then live like a loser
for the rest of your life.

40
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:33,339
Wondering why nothing goes your
way and feeling sorry for yourself.

41
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,882
Watch your mouth.

42
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,802
You must not know how scary
a shrimp can be, rich girl.

43
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:42,473
You'll bleed if a shrimp bites.

44
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,900
Don't just be a
shrimp that bites,

45
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,361
be a shrimp that
can beat a whale.

46
00:03:55,444 --> 00:04:00,282
Do you think Kang Ji-won's the only
one whose life can change overnight?

47
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,536
Why is that chance coming to me?

48
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,873
Because I'm angry.

49
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:11,627
She lives well after stealing
my man. It's not fair.

50
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,589
And people like me can't stand
feeling cheated, you see.

51
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:23,013
I get to blow off steam
and get U&K if I'm lucky.

52
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,686
You punish the woman who betrayed you,
and change your life with a fortune.

53
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,899
What do I have to do

54
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,110
to make that happen?

55
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,697
Well...

56
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,243
I'll tell you when you've
made up your mind, shrimp.

57
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,280
{\an8}EPISODE 13.

58
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,367
{\an8}The chef's on a business
trip to the States?

59
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,706
{\an8}No, I can adjust my schedule.

60
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,667
{\an8}If you could let me know
when he'll be available...

61
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
{\an8}Yes.

62
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,588
{\an8}To the company?

63
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,215
{\an8}No, that's fine.

64
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,427
{\an8}Yes.

65
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,139
{\an8}Have you checked the
proposal I sent you?

66
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,016
{\an8}The latest version.

67
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,022
What are you doing?

68
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:58,067
You're more ambitious
than I thought.

69
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,194
Yu Ji-hyuk.

70
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,155
How did you know he was
from the owner family?

71
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,326
He looks like a loser.
I couldn't tell at all.

72
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,621
You know now. I knew way before.

73
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,831
Don't you remember?

74
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,666
I was always better than you.

75
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,088
So when was it?

76
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,633
I'm getting sick of this.

77
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,259
Damn it...

78
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,845
The company benefits.
I should've known.

79
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,307
Did you two develop feelings
the night I proposed?

80
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,770
That's why you ruined the family
meeting and humiliated me at work.

81
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,772
Everything makes sense now.

82
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,150
When did you start
planning all this?

83
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,692
Tell me!

84
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,239
What the hell are you saying?

85
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,911
You're forgetting
one missing piece.

86
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,913
You cheated on me with Su-min.

87
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,582
That's the cause of all of this.

88
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,173
That little...

89
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:15,852
Ji-won!

90
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:19,897
Hi.

91
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,026
What brings you here?

92
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,571
Ji-hyuk sent me here.

93
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:29,158
Have this. I fried
it at my restaurant.

94
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,410
- Take it.
- Okay.

95
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,536
Thanks.

96
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,581
He said to continue judo.

97
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,877
If you're uncomfortable
because of him,

98
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,505
he asked me to
give you my number.

99
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,760
Ji-hyuk is a great guy.

100
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,599
He's really tall and
has a great personality.

101
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:58,812
Also, if I didn't meet him in our
club, I wouldn't be doing anything.

102
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,481
He's a decent and nice person.

103
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,526
Wait, that chicken...

104
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,652
Did you order chicken?

105
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:09,907
Did you order hot fried chicken, spicy
chicken, and salty soy sauce chicken?

106
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:13,785
Yes.

107
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,830
Something did feel off then.

108
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,418
And he's so athletic.
He's so good at judo.

109
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,672
Wait... The black mask.

110
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,764
Did these bastards play me?

111
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,643
Kang Ji-won.

112
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,775
I will make you regret it.

113
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,896
Do you want to come up?

114
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,272
What?

115
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,442
No, I don't like violence.

116
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,654
You're no fun. Why not?

117
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,574
You can cheat on your girlfriend
of seven years with her bestie,

118
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,660
but you can't throw a punch?

119
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:44,334
I'm old enough to know
what I can and can't do.

120
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,590
You can't do what we're
about to do without guts.

121
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,555
All right, then.

122
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,642
But no matter how rich you
are and how hard you trained,

123
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,353
men have the advantage.

124
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,275
You don't know how
scary men can be.

125
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,817
What?

126
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,370
Oh, I'm fighting him?

127
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,790
Stop glaring, dude.

128
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,254
Let's go.

129
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,770
This is boxing. Are
you allowed to kick?

130
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,772
There are no rules for winning.

131
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:50,192
Then you should've
told me beforehand!

132
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,947
I'm starting to like you
now. I can work with you.

133
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,996
I took care of the taxes today.

134
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,874
Now, Kang Ji-won has
unknowingly become

135
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,710
{\an8}one of the richest real
estate owners in Korea.

136
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,296
Is this really right?

137
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,215
Why not?

138
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,092
And here's a bigger problem.

139
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,262
I'm not sure about not
telling the chairman.

140
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,265
You're the one who said
I could do anything.

141
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:23,975
I did.

142
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,937
But what are you trying to do?

143
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:32,025
If I wasn't managing your health checkup
results, I'd think you were dying.

144
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:36,905
I can understand the cat, but why
prepare for Ms. Kang's future?

145
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,492
Didn't you two break up?

146
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,162
I just want to do this.

147
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:47,707
I just hope she'll live
a good life later on.

148
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,962
Since we're not
meant to be together.

149
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,798
<i>Ji-won has real
estate in her name.</i>

150
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,677
Buildings, land, apartments.

151
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,805
Worth about 80 billion won.

152
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,186
Kang Ji-won has 80 billion won?

153
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,281
What?

154
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,991
You shouldn't be surprised.

155
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,828
You'll get 100 times more
than that if she dies.

156
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,622
Wait, 100 times?

157
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,876
Your wife's relationship
with Ji-won is so fun.

158
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,546
They're not like sisters.

159
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,965
You could say they're
actually sisters.

160
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,471
{\an8}FRY ME JO DONG-SUK.

161
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,558
<i>I can explain this.</i>

162
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,560
<i>Because Ji-hyuk's
U&K's successor?</i>

163
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,061
Do you have any money?

164
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:58,987
<i>Dad.</i>

165
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,449
<i>I thought I could
do well this time,</i>

166
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,327
<i>but I don't know what to do.</i>

167
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,300
You kept a lot of
things from me.

168
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,262
Like what?

169
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,225
You used Ji-won's mom to
swindle her but failed.

170
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:31,353
How did you know that?

171
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,276
You dummy.

172
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,071
The person who
sent you the photos

173
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,157
wasn't suggesting you find
her mom to beg for money.

174
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,537
What's important right now is
that Ji-won has 80 billion won.

175
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,705
What? She has 80 billion won?

176
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,835
Yu Ji-hyuk gave it to her.

177
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,964
She's on another level.

178
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:10,725
Kang Ji-won...

179
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,321
But it's good for us.

180
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,783
If she dies,

181
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,452
her only family member
gets it, her mom.

182
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,122
We just wait until she dies?

183
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:34,958
And if she dies,

184
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,668
will her mom give it to us?

185
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,677
Su-min, you poor thing.

186
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:49,889
How hard has it been for you
not being able to tell me?

187
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,228
Your dad...

188
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,357
I know he's still alive.

189
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,823
<i>Bring the money!</i>

190
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,367
Why are you doing this?

191
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,539
Look. If you borrowed money,
you should pay it back.

192
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,792
You run a restaurant but
say you have no money.

193
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,212
What should we do?

194
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,840
I mean... Listen to me.

195
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,677
I'll get the money to you within
this month no matter what.

196
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,138
Are you joking me?

197
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:34,768
You should show sincerity if
you want to build trust with us.

198
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,897
Get us a 100 million won,
and we'll give you more time.

199
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,567
Where can I get
that kind of cash?

200
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,111
- I swear...
- Hey, hold him.

201
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:48,114
What are you doing?

202
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,909
You can live with one kidney.

203
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,702
- What?
- If you have half a liver,

204
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:53,786
it grows back.

205
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,707
- Look...
- Look at what?

206
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,086
Shall I break it?

207
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,260
What now?

208
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,143
Su-min.

209
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,564
What are you doing here?

210
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:30,407
Where's the lady you live with?

211
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,700
What?

212
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,648
It's a stock
transfer certificate

213
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,735
that can separate Cloud Air
and Kelite Tour from U&K.

214
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,029
You can take full control.

215
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,783
You had me curious.

216
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:17,871
It's a small price if it's
for that great love of yours.

217
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,957
And it's boring if you want
me to get lost with it.

218
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,461
You were never interested in me.

219
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,838
I'm asking you to live that way.

220
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,966
No, you weren't interested
in me, but weren't

221
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,177
going to call off
the engagement.

222
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:36,431
We would've gotten married
when time was right

223
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:40,226
and lived our own lives,
indifferent to each other.

224
00:17:58,495 --> 00:17:59,662
This is nice.

225
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,209
Like a jealous man afraid his
fiancÃ©e has another man...

226
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:08,546
I like it when a man's restless.

227
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,140
Do you want to try it?

228
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:25,063
Finding each other's weakness
and tormenting one another?

229
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,819
Don't forget that I can
do whatever you can do.

230
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,320
No...

231
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,073
Won't I be better at it?

232
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,586
Take this and stop
what you're doing.

233
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,384
I don't know why you
think I'd do anything.

234
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,470
Things you just said, it hurts.

235
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,306
Even without this,
I won't do anything.

236
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,309
I realized breaking off the
engagement was a mistake.

237
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,978
I just want to take it back.

238
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,024
Have your fun.

239
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:13,736
Love always comes to an end.

240
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:18,950
When yours does,
come back to me.

241
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,763
There's something you
need to look into.

242
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,229
Come out.

243
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,153
What... What just happened?

244
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,529
Wasn't that Ji-hyuk?

245
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,239
Are we caught?

246
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,494
Do you know how much Cloud
Air and Kelite Tour are worth?

247
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,203
What?

248
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,582
When combined,

249
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,543
about four trillion.

250
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,672
Four trillion won?

251
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,967
But he just gave it to
me. It's so upsetting.

252
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,392
Kill Kang Ji-won. I'll
clean up the mess.

253
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,939
You'll have enough money
for the rest of your life.

254
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,900
I'll get Yu Ji-hyuk.

255
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:39,072
And I'll make sure he regrets
offering me something like that.

256
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,707
It's 150 million won.

257
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,627
Pay off your urgent debts first.

258
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:55,421
I'll pay the rest
off when it's over.

259
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:58,174
And I'll make sure
you get a fortune.

260
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,428
Where... Where did
you get this money?

261
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,264
Do you think it's mine?

262
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,267
What did you ever do for me?

263
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,149
Listen up. This money

264
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:20,613
was given by someone who could
bury you without anyone knowing.

265
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:25,326
Do as you're told, and
this shitty life is over.

266
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,619
Or

267
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,747
we'll all die together.

268
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,212
Can you do it or not?

269
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,424
We can.

270
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,177
Yeah.

271
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:46,764
Okay, good job.

272
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:49,058
You didn't tell them
about me, right?

273
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,686
Yeah, they don't know
we're married anyway.

274
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,896
Let's not make
things uncomfortable.

275
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,065
I won't see them
again after this.

276
00:21:56,607 --> 00:22:00,111
Of course. We're telling them
what to do, step by step.

277
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,454
They said yes.
Shall I get started?

278
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,164
Yeah, good luck.

279
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:13,416
I'll trust you.

280
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,085
Okay.

281
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:20,965
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

282
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:35,146
Men are not wary of
women they slept with.

283
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:36,731
Why is that?

284
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,569
Ji-won's dad's death
anniversary is this weekend.

285
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,573
We can make that D-day then.

286
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,366
She'll go see her dad.

287
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,209
MEMORIAL ARBORETUM

288
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:14,143
I'm sorry I'm such a fool.

289
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:27,782
<i>Yes, Mr. Lee?</i>

290
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,201
Yu-ra hasn't made any moves.

291
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,912
But I think we made a mistake.

292
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:38,084
Ji-won's mother illegally rented a
dump truck under a borrowed name.

293
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,087
- That means...
- If she dies,

294
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,381
all of the real
estate in her name

295
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,924
will go to her mother.

296
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,969
Where's the dump truck now?

297
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,305
<i>According to the current GPS,</i>

298
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:53,266
<i>it's going down Route 424.</i>

299
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:22,628
<i>Ji-won's leaving
the arboretum now.</i>

300
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,304
What the heck?

301
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:35,433
What is this?

302
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,477
Yes.

303
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,439
Sin-u, stop Ji-won.
Don't let her drive.

304
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:45,568
<i>What? But Ji-hyuk, my car
broke down in the parking lot.</i>

305
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,320
Ji-won already drove off.

306
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,488
Route 424 is right
outside of here.

307
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:51,949
Hello?

308
00:24:56,537 --> 00:25:01,000
<i>There are times when things that
were foggy and unclear become clear.</i>

309
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,972
<i>Why did I come
back to this time?</i>

310
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,685
If I had, I'd have
protected her.

311
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:25,107
<i>So if I get a
chance, I'll take it.</i>

312
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:30,279
<i>If I can't be with her,
why did I come back?</i>

313
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,995
JI-WON

314
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:42,333
<i>The person you have
called is unavailable.</i>

315
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,585
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

316
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:50,049
I'll tell you something I didn't
expect to tell you like this.

317
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,304
I died in 2023.

318
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,808
<i>It was a car accident.</i>

319
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:05,982
And when I opened my
eyes, I was in 2013.

320
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,156
<i>Then I met you again.</i>

321
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,746
<i>I mistakenly believed
I could be happy.</i>

322
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:28,170
But I can't protect you forever.

323
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,176
I could die at any time.

324
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,940
<i>I couldn't resist the
temptation to be with you.</i>

325
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,113
I like you.

326
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,284
<i>I like you.</i>

327
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,165
I like you so much.

328
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,338
So...

329
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,302
I'm sorry.

330
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,345
<i>I came here to protect you,</i>

331
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,935
<i>but if I knew it'd
happen so soon,</i>

332
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:15,778
<i>I wouldn't have held your hand.</i>

333
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,820
<i>Don't blame yourself.</i>

334
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:02,533
<i>The inevitable just happened.</i>

335
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,985
<i>New voice message.</i>

336
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:44,408
<i>I died in 2023.</i>

337
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,537
<i>It was a car accident.</i>

338
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,918
Why won't he pick up?

339
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,838
All he had to do
was crash into her!

340
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:00,132
He should've called way earlier.

341
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:01,842
Why can't I reach him?

342
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:04,887
You're talking about your
daughter's life ending.

343
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,848
I guess you're not worried.

344
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:09,349
You brat.

345
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:12,061
You put it in such a mean way.

346
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,855
Do you know what's
scarier than blood?

347
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:15,939
It's money.

348
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,526
Don't make me laugh.

349
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,778
You wouldn't be
with my dad then.

350
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:25,574
He's pretentious, and
everything he says is a lie.

351
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:30,204
He offers you everything, but
he never does anything for you.

352
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:33,666
Listen to you, talking
about your father like that.

353
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:36,418
Do you have any idea

354
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,340
how much my dad
pretended to love me?

355
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:47,263
But when I think about it, he's
never actually done anything for me.

356
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,057
What about you?

357
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,769
I'm sure nothing
he does goes right.

358
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,814
Maybe you even
clean up his mess.

359
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,865
Why do you look like that?

360
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:15,666
Because he never
does anything right!

361
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,634
{\an8}You must be under
a lot of stress.

362
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:27,303
This part is so stiff.

363
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,471
You're good at this.

364
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:35,144
Mr. Yu cut in and got hurt, and
is now in Yuil Medical Center.

365
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,605
And the driver ran
from the scene.

366
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,399
How could Ji-hyuk be there?

367
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,818
I'm looking into it. I'm sorry.

368
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,530
It must be nice.

369
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:50,159
All you have to do is apologize
since I clean up the mess.

370
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,205
Wait.

371
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:58,250
Isn't the woman and his
daughter at the hotel?

372
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,878
Then the driver
must've gone there.

373
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:03,047
Search that area first.

374
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:08,761
Take your wife and go home.

375
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,471
Nothing happened.

376
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,973
Don't do anything until I call.

377
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:15,808
Okay.

378
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:21,440
Are you insane?

379
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,403
My dad abandoned me again.

380
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:29,531
He ran away with that woman!

381
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,827
What did I do wrong?

382
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,414
What did I do wrong?

383
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,834
It's all Ji-won's fault!

384
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:42,670
I'm going to kill them all!

385
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:45,839
It's Ji-won's fault!
I'll kill her too!

386
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,676
I'll kill everyone!

387
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:59,228
Jeong Su-min! Snap out
of it. It's not over yet.

388
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:02,314
That woman's on our side.

389
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,360
There's a world people
like us don't know about.

390
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,195
Let's just do as we're told.

391
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:11,865
She said she'd
clean up the mess.

392
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,368
We were home all night.

393
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,704
If the cops come,

394
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,331
you don't know about your dad.

395
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:21,834
Got it?

396
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:26,880
Well?

397
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:30,259
He arrived at the ER an hour
ago and went into surgery.

398
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,303
Top doctors are on him.
I'll explain with the chart.

399
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,854
OPERATION TIME, ANESTHESIA TIME

400
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,068
Isn't the surgery
taking too long?

401
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:50,863
What if my brother...

402
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:51,946
No.

403
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,324
The inevitable just happened.

404
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,619
That will never happen.

405
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:00,706
So don't think that way.

406
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,682
The driver's name
is Jeong Man-sik.

407
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:20,225
We must get him first.

408
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:23,812
And get information on Bae
Hui-suk too from the police.

409
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:27,900
Jeong Su-min could never
have done this on her own.

410
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:35,199
Did you just say Jeong Su-min?

411
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:40,579
It wasn't just a car
accident, was it?

412
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,967
But she won't gain
anything from killing me.

413
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:56,386
And she's not daring
enough to kill.

414
00:34:58,514 --> 00:35:02,059
<i>We're looking into it assuming
there's someone behind this.</i>

415
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:05,229
<i>And what they gain if you die is</i>

416
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,733
<i>something Ji-hyuk made.</i>

417
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,405
<i>It was supposed to be for you.</i>

418
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:31,964
<i>People don't change easily.</i>

419
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:37,052
<i>I came back after seeing the end,
but I tried to run away again.</i>

420
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,430
<i>I didn't get revenge.</i>

421
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:43,267
<i>I haven't done anything.</i>

422
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,853
<i>And Mr. Yu...</i>

423
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:52,359
We did everything we could.

424
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,446
But we don't know
when he'll wake up.

425
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,533
You have to save him.

426
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,204
What are you talking about? You
have to save him at all cost!

427
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:11,920
<i>But I can't protect you forever.</i>

428
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:15,716
<i>I could die at any time.</i>

429
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,691
<i>So forget all the bad things</i>

430
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,110
<i>and remember the good.</i>

431
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,738
<i>I hope you're happy.</i>

432
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,596
OTHER HALF

433
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:28,038
Can you really not
leave me alone?

434
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:37,214
I've wanted to ask you for
some time, and I finally can.

435
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,803
How could you think
of killing someone?

436
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,264
Was it for money?

437
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:49,768
What are you saying?

438
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,855
Why would you say
something so scary?

439
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,111
What about you?

440
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:02,072
Don't you know
what you did to me?

441
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,830
I...

442
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:17,963
miscarried because of you.

443
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,010
That's nonsense.

444
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,678
Pregnant?

445
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:26,930
Min-hwan has azoospermia.

446
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:29,725
He can't get anyone pregnant!

447
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,644
What? I was really pregnant.

448
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:35,105
I have an ultrasound
picture. I felt it.

449
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:37,523
That's enough!

450
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,696
Stop lying. You keep
lying and lying!

451
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,826
What's with you? Why are
you doing this to me?

452
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,039
What's wrong with you?

453
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,725
You asked if I could
leave you alone...

454
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,942
No, I can't.

455
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,571
Because you can't be happy.

456
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,494
You probably don't know.

457
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:34,873
When your mom had an affair
and left you when we were 14,

458
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,500
it was

459
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,127
with my dad.

460
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:44,883
You had no idea
and were so happy.

461
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:47,135
Because of that...

462
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:51,848
<i>Dad, why won't you come home?</i>

463
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:54,643
<i>Mom said you left because
you had an affair.</i>

464
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,853
<i>She said you abandoned us.</i>

465
00:39:56,937 --> 00:39:59,397
<i>Say anything. Just call me.</i>

466
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:03,735
<i>If you do this, I'll kill myself.
I'll be good, so take me with you.</i>

467
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:09,616
I told you to come and help.
Why are you at home right now?

468
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:11,660
I have to study!

469
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,037
God, you reek of fish.

470
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:15,956
You little brat.

471
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,958
Study, my foot.

472
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,253
Your dad might've been
sweet to you, but not me.

473
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,255
Wake up and know your place.

474
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,841
Or just go to your dad!

475
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,968
I can't stand you!

476
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,061
Someone's calling.

477
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,564
Who is it? Is it a woman?

478
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,066
No, it's my daughter.

479
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,569
I'm sick of this.

480
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,779
She's just like her mom.

481
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:51,074
I can't even begin to tell
you how tenacious she is.

482
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:53,702
You're not thinking
of raising her, right?

483
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:58,081
If you do, I'll bring mine too,
dump her on you, and run away.

484
00:40:58,165 --> 00:40:59,666
Why would I do that?

485
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:03,461
You're the only princess I need.

486
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:04,796
You're so gross.

487
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,381
Let's go.

488
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,803
<i>My dad's new princess
had a daughter.</i>

489
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,738
<i>Did you lose your wallet?</i>

490
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:33,533
<i>Goodness. You make it so obvious
that your mother ran away.</i>

491
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:35,452
Don't be so nosy.

492
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,166
Here.

493
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:43,835
Is it yours?

494
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:46,671
<i>So</i>

495
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,801
<i>we could've been good friends.</i>

496
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:53,887
Turn on the floor
heating. It's cold.

497
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,387
It's so cold.

498
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,142
What? It's warm.

499
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:00,268
Is it?

500
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:02,938
My dad turned it on.

501
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:07,692
You said a friend was
coming, so I warmed it up.

502
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:08,777
Dad.

503
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:11,279
Hello.

504
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:14,199
My goodness. You're so pretty.

505
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:18,912
I bought the cake that
young girls love these days.

506
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:22,999
Make sure to eat
it with milk, okay?

507
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,295
An allowance.

508
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:32,384
Your allowance.

509
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:36,137
- Thank you.
- I'm off.

510
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,014
Have fun.

511
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,605
He did it again.

512
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:48,400
Just a second.

513
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:53,363
Dad! I told you not to
draw on money like this.

514
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:54,656
Okay, fine.

515
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,367
I promise, I won't do it again.

516
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,953
Don't drive too fast. Go slowly.

517
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:03,331
When did you get so
pretty, Princess?

518
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:05,542
Don't call me that.

519
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:08,086
It's because I love you.

520
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:16,052
<i>Maybe if I didn't know that you
still had everything, unlike me.</i>

521
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,557
He thinks I might be

522
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:23,435
downhearted without a mom.

523
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,728
He overdoes it.

524
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:26,980
Don't mind him.

525
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,233
<i>That's when I started</i>

526
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:32,360
<i>to be bothered by you.</i>

527
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:37,574
<i>And started to want to
steal everything from you.</i>

528
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:44,414
Why are you always okay?

529
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,626
Why are there

530
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:52,589
always good things around you?

531
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:04,684
Do you get it now?

532
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,396
I've never liked you.

533
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,524
You were always
smiling without a clue.

534
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,736
Being happy is a sin.

535
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,614
You're so clueless.
It's annoying!

536
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,619
Do you know how
hard life can be?

537
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,580
Do you know how
hellish it can be?

538
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,751
You can't be happy
when I'm so miserable.

539
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,422
Now, I'll show you

540
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:37,092
how unkind the world can be.

541
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:39,761
How hellish

542
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:44,724
life can be.

543
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,361
Was that all?

544
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:05,620
"Your dad had an
affair with my mom."

545
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,081
"No one knew, but you did."

546
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:11,793
You think

547
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:15,630
you can make me suffer

548
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:19,342
and steal what's precious to
me for that reason? Really?

549
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:24,139
You're so full of yourself.

550
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:26,724
I hate it when you act
like a know-it-all.

551
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:28,977
Don't you feel sorry for me?

552
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,312
I feel so bad for myself!

553
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,480
Not at all!

554
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,941
I don't feel bad for you.

555
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:37,777
Because I knew too.

556
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:45,952
That your dad

557
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,414
had an affair with my mom.

558
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:51,958
I knew it too.

559
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,047
I thought it was a relief

560
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,096
that you didn't know.

561
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:11,644
Why do we have to do this?

562
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:15,482
My dad would've come to
school if he were alive.

563
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,320
Did he die two years ago?

564
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:23,615
- Yeah.
- I bet you miss him.

565
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,283
I miss him so much.

566
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:28,369
He loved me so much.

567
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:34,209
- Dad!
- Hi.

568
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,963
- Dad!
- Hey!

569
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,257
It's raining. Let's go.

570
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,218
Mom!

571
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:07,825
<i>I wanted to be good to you.</i>

572
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:11,037
<i>I thought we could
be happy together.</i>

573
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,752
<i>Even when I felt
like I was dying...</i>

574
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:30,431
I hoped you'd be happy
even when I was dying.

575
00:47:37,564 --> 00:47:39,274
Don't act like you cared.

576
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:42,777
You dumped Min-hwan
on me for a rich guy?

577
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,410
You dumped him on me!

578
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,414
You were always like this.

579
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:58,001
You pretend to be nice and
took everything in the end!

580
00:47:58,084 --> 00:47:59,961
You took everything!

581
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:04,966
I just realized

582
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,053
why you ended up like this.

583
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,850
You brought this upon yourself.

584
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:17,770
Also, it's not over yet.

585
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,274
A harsher hell awaits you.

586
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:24,652
I'll see to it.

587
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:34,120
Look forward to it.

588
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,665
It'll be different than before.

589
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:47,925
<i>I'll make sure my
fate goes to you.</i>

590
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,408
Go home and rest.

591
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:13,993
I'll stay here.

592
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,164
YUIL MEDICAL CENTER

593
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:27,799
<i>Ji-won, what are you
doing after work today?</i>

594
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,260
<i>Can we meet for a moment?</i>

595
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:33,429
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

596
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:37,350
<i>It's embarrassing to say,</i>

597
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:41,396
<i>but I think my husband's
cheating on me.</i>

598
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,148
This little...

599
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,288
PRINCESS PORK RIBS OPEN 24 HOURS

600
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,834
Should I just get it to go?

601
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:09,423
Ms. Yang...

602
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:12,635
Come here.

603
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:15,221
I told you, not here.
I can't believe you.

604
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:16,848
Why not?

605
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:20,977
I always walk on eggshells around
my sick wife and father-in-law.

606
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,584
Mr. Lee.

607
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:54,635
Put it on.

608
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:57,930
Snap out of it and put it on!

609
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:12,904
Go slap your husband if
you caught him cheating.

610
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:17,074
Kick him, claw his eyes out,
and crack his skull open!

611
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,161
Why are you running away?

612
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:23,164
How did you know?

613
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,334
Is that what's
important right now?

614
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,670
Do you want to go back?
Want to borrow my golf club?

615
00:51:30,797 --> 00:51:33,883
How have you lived to
be so upright like this?

616
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:36,052
Even when I'm so out of line,

617
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,555
why can't you get angry?

618
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:45,311
That's why he does it even
at your dad's restaurant.

619
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:06,123
Whether I can get angry or not,

620
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,794
isn't it wrong to
act out like that?

621
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:14,423
Isn't it wrong to disrespect me?

622
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:19,512
If someone's kind, shouldn't
you be kind back to them?

623
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:24,642
I'm good to him, and I wait.

624
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:27,270
I keep waiting.

625
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:30,815
Shouldn't he come to his senses?

626
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:38,698
The police agreed
to close the case

627
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:41,784
as an accident by a drunk
man who stole a truck.

628
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:45,872
Jeong Man-sik and Bae
Hui-suk are in Gyeonggi-do.

629
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,250
I'll catch them soon.

630
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:53,838
It's taking too long. I was
so worried that I lost sleep.

631
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:58,342
No loose ends, okay?

632
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,488
I'm Head Chef Baek Eun-ho.

633
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:21,824
How was your meal?

634
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,995
I heard you wanted
to speak with me.

635
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:34,295
The meal was great,
and I wanted to know

636
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:37,882
how you know Yu Ji-hyuk.

637
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:41,886
Yu Ji-hyuk?

638
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:52,563
I ought to...

639
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:25,388
OH YU-RA

640
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,258
You told me to use you anytime.

641
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,011
What is this?

642
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:14,520
Open your eyes, Ji-hyuk.

643
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:22,862
I mean...

644
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:24,864
You can't even do that.

645
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:33,664
By the way,

646
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,752
I've grown and
become much stronger.

647
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,337
I'm not the old Kang Ji-won.

648
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:43,382
So...

649
00:55:45,134 --> 00:55:46,134
Fate?

650
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:48,679
I'm not scared of it anymore.

651
00:55:54,477 --> 00:55:58,272
So I want you to
overcome your fate too.

652
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,154
I was always alone.

653
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:10,201
So I've counted the
days since my mom left

654
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:13,079
and since my dad died.

655
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:16,916
But now...

656
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,213
I want to count the
days of us together.

657
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:28,886
Come back to me.

658
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,224
Don't leave me alone.

659
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:38,062
Open your eyes. Please.

660
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:44,443
I want to hear your voice.

661
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:49,073
{\an8}VOICE MESSAGE

662
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:52,535
{\an8}I'll tell you something I didn't
expect to tell you like this.

663
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:56,330
<i>I died in 2023.</i>

664
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:09,509
<i>I like you.</i>

665
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:13,180
<i>I like you.</i>

666
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:15,641
<i>I like you so much.</i>

667
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,020
I like you too.

668
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:22,898
<i>So...</i>

669
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:24,859
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

670
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:14,867
I love you.

671
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:21,373
I love you too.

672
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:08,796
{\an8}<i>I think my fate
moved to Ms. Yang.</i>

673
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,047
{\an8}What's going on?

674
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,800
{\an8}If you touch her,
I'll make you pay!

675
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,927
{\an8}<i>Oh Yu-ra must be
looking for them.</i>

676
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,804
{\an8}It's a matter of who's faster.

677
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,931
{\an8}It's my first time
seeing someone die.

678
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:21,767
{\an8}<i>Hello, my name's Jeong Su-min.</i>

679
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,812
{\an8}<i>Kang Ji-won came to work
as if nothing happened.</i>

680
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:27,856
{\an8}<i>If she has 80 billion
won, I shouldn't kill her.</i>

681
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,316
{\an8}<i>If I seduce her again,</i>

682
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,694
{\an8}<i>that 80 billion won
will come to me.</i>

683
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:33,237
{\an8}<i>Because Min-hwan</i>

684
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,699
{\an8}<i>must have an affair and
not care if his wife dies.</i>

685
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:40,411
{\an8}<i>Ji-hyuk, I have to
seduce Min-hwan.</i>
