Park Min-hwan must marry Jeong Su-min?

18
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,755
Yes.

19
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:36,633
If I don't,

20
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:40,345
I'll have to marry Park Min-hwan,

21
00:01:41,513 --> 00:01:42,722
get cancer,

22
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:48,562
and get killed by my husband
and best friend.

23
00:01:52,232 --> 00:01:54,067
"The inevitable will happen."

24
00:01:57,821 --> 00:01:59,072
You didn't know?

25
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:05,036
I didn't. Maybe because
I haven't changed much.

26
00:02:06,162 --> 00:02:07,455
Just a few things.

27
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:13,128
For example, sending Baek Eun-ho
to the reunion to clear the air.

28
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:17,632
So that's why Eun-ho came...

29
00:02:21,094 --> 00:02:23,388
But how did you know about Goseuljung?

30
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:31,021
Because I went...

31
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:36,526
to your funeral.

32
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,161
My funeral.

33
00:02:54,377 --> 00:02:56,379
How was my funeral?

34
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,054
THE LATE KANG JI-WON

35
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,681
<i>It was sad.</i>

36
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:09,893
<i>A lot of people...</i>

37
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,897
had regrets.

38
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:18,318
You're lying.

39
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:21,196
I can just imagine it.

40
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:25,200
No one would be sad

41
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:27,702
or regret anything.

42
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:32,082
"I guess someone died."

43
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:37,003
"Right. I remember her now."

44
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,839
"She's gone now."

45
00:03:41,341 --> 00:03:42,592
Something like that.

46
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:49,474
Shall we talk somewhere else?

47
00:03:51,017 --> 00:03:52,394
It might take a while.

48
00:04:11,997 --> 00:04:14,958
<i>Is this his house?</i>

49
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:20,714
Getting out?

50
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:23,008
Oh, yes.

51
00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:39,816
Let's go in.

52
00:04:56,624 --> 00:04:57,917
No, don't.

53
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:00,879
- No.
- You can put him down.

54
00:05:00,962 --> 00:05:02,338
I love cats.

55
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:05,592
But he doesn't like people...

56
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:07,093
Hi.

57
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:08,887
Well, I thought he didn't.

58
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:13,099
You're so cute.

59
00:05:14,392 --> 00:05:15,477
Do you want tea?

60
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:18,396
I have everything. Coffee too.

61
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,106
Anything is fine.

62
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:27,030
You know, I'm good with cheese tabby cats.

63
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:30,116
You're so pretty.

64
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,924
Can it be avoided?

65
00:05:46,925 --> 00:05:48,301
What if you avoid it?

66
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:52,222
If you break up with Park Min-hwan
or cut ties with Jeong Su-min.

67
00:05:54,474 --> 00:05:56,059
I tried.

68
00:05:56,142 --> 00:05:57,185
But...

69
00:05:58,228 --> 00:06:03,358
Min-hwan would have a fit
if I tried to break up with him.

70
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:08,029
If he kills me in ten years,
who's to say he wouldn't now?

71
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:11,116
What if you run away?

72
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:13,827
I wanted to.

73
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:17,789
When I came back, everything was scary.

74
00:06:17,872 --> 00:06:21,543
I just wanted to forget everything
and run away somewhere.

75
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:24,087
But realistically, it was impossible.

76
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:27,382
You can pick up and leave

77
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:30,260
only when you have financial freedom.

78
00:06:30,927 --> 00:06:34,013
But you can run away now. I can help you.

79
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,391
That's right.

80
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,018
But I found out.

81
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:43,898
That I can't evade anything
by running away.

82
00:06:47,694 --> 00:06:51,406
You see, I used to have a scar here.

83
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,534
I was burned by a coffee pot.

84
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:03,251
You got hurt instead of me.

85
00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:08,965
The shape of this scar is
exactly the same.

86
00:07:22,437 --> 00:07:24,063
If I didn't get hurt,

87
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:27,192
eventually...

88
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:32,488
you would've gotten hurt?

89
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:37,744
Yes.

90
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,542
Avoiding it is not the answer.

91
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:49,505
Either way, the inevitable will happen.

92
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,260
If I don't give my fate to someone else.

93
00:07:55,428 --> 00:07:57,096
A wound for a wound,

94
00:07:58,014 --> 00:07:59,349
marriage for marriage,

95
00:08:02,852 --> 00:08:03,895
and a death...

96
00:08:04,812 --> 00:08:05,813
For a death.

97
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:18,868
So I'm not going to run away.

98
00:08:37,136 --> 00:08:38,680
THE LATE KANG JI-WON

TAXI
VACANT

100
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:05,850
I don't usually come to this area
even if I got a call.

101
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:08,227
This is amazing.

102
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:10,104
I was about to call it a day,

103
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:11,856
but I got this feeling.

104
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:14,150
Thank you.

105
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,074
You must've lost something precious.

106
00:10:23,284 --> 00:10:25,370
I don't even know if it was or not.

107
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:28,373
We barely knew each other.

108
00:10:29,082 --> 00:10:31,125
Goodness.

109
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:33,169
Why, though?

110
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:35,046
A man should be daring!

111
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:37,924
You should've seen it to the end
no matter what.

112
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,051
I should have.

113
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,304
I'm regretting it.

114
00:10:45,264 --> 00:10:47,767
I think I had a few chances.

115
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:51,562
Why did you miss them?

116
00:10:53,314 --> 00:10:55,441
I didn't know it was my chance.

117
00:10:58,486 --> 00:11:00,780
Other times, I thought it was wrong.

118
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:04,283
Honestly, I don't know.

119
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:08,621
I realized my feelings recently.

120
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:10,998
I was just living.

121
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:17,463
But when I heard that she had died...

122
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:30,518
If you get another chance,
what will you do?

123
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:33,438
There are no more chances.

124
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:34,605
No, if there was.

125
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:37,984
Will you take it?

126
00:11:40,445 --> 00:11:43,865
Seeing as how you missed
all those chances,

127
00:11:43,948 --> 00:11:45,450
maybe you just didn't.

128
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:48,494
Maybe something stopped you.

129
00:11:51,205 --> 00:11:52,248
I...

130
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:54,959
So don't regret it.

131
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,838
I'm sure there's a reason for your choice.

132
00:11:59,797 --> 00:12:00,882
Or...

133
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:05,761
Will you grab your true chance?

134
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:36,834
This might sound stupid,

135
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:40,796
but I didn't know how I felt.

136
00:12:45,593 --> 00:12:47,595
If I had, I'd have protected her.

137
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,561
So if I get a chance,

138
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:03,152
I'll take it.

139
00:13:08,616 --> 00:13:12,078
<i>By the way, how did you come back?</i>

140
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:14,830
<i>I thought I had died,</i>

141
00:13:14,914 --> 00:13:17,208
<i>but I woke up to 2013.</i>

142
00:13:27,677 --> 00:13:29,262
I fell asleep and woke up.

143
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:32,557
Then I was in 2013.

Another's misfortune...

150
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,551
Hey.

151
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:13,139
<i>I have an interview at seven today,
so I can't pick Yeon-ji up.</i>

152
00:14:13,222 --> 00:14:15,016
That's such a lame lie.

153
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:17,643
What company schedules an interview
at 7:00 p.m.?

154
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,689
What, do you know everything?

155
00:14:21,772 --> 00:14:23,399
I said it, so believe it.

156
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:26,819
<i>Besides, I heard your project has tanked.</i>

157
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:30,698
Daddy.

158
00:14:30,781 --> 00:14:32,033
What?

159
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,744
You didn't take her to daycare?

160
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:37,747
Whatever. I'm hanging up.

161
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:42,543
What?

162
00:14:48,382 --> 00:14:50,426
...will you join me?

163
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:52,261
<i>Shall I take you out instead?</i>

164
00:14:52,345 --> 00:14:53,888
If it weren't for me,

165
00:14:53,971 --> 00:14:57,975
who would get promoted for this?
You or Kang Ji-won?

166
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:05,900
Why is my life like this?

U&K HRD INSTITUTE JEJU

168
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:39,016
Personally, I hate people like you.

00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:44,271
MOST BEAUTIFUL

170
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:01,330
What?

171
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:30,151
<i>Isn't he the head of Strategic Planning?</i>

172
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:32,778
<i>- If he's here, there will be blood.
- For sure.</i>

173
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:34,363
<i>What's going on?</i>

174
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:44,457
General Manager Yu Ji-hyuk.

175
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:47,793
I heard about you.

176
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:02,099
You transfer to HR now?

177
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:05,895
I'm just a salary man. I do what I'm told.

178
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,981
This isn't for the sake of the company--

179
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:10,524
At U&K, the chairman...

180
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:13,444
can do whatever he wants.

181
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:16,655
Whether it's for the company
or his family.

182
00:17:20,993 --> 00:17:21,994
Did you

183
00:17:22,703 --> 00:17:25,372
really think he'd do nothing?

184
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,044
I didn't think he'd send you.

186
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:37,384
I didn't know she was your type.

187
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:41,222
I just meant it was unexpected.

188
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:42,890
More humble than expected.

189
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:45,810
She's not

190
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:47,770
humble.

191
00:17:48,395 --> 00:17:49,730
Maybe.

192
00:17:49,814 --> 00:17:51,649
A seven-year relationship.

193
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:55,069
But she started something with you.

194
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:56,320
It's not--

195
00:17:56,403 --> 00:17:59,281
You left work together,
and you went to your house.

196
00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:00,866
Was that overtime?

197
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:02,910
Are you tailing me?

198
00:18:02,993 --> 00:18:04,495
Only when it's needed.

199
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:06,247
You would to.

200
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,376
You didn't have to up until now,
but you're capable of anything.

201
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,920
You might want to soon.

202
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:20,219
Were you going to give the project to her?

203
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:25,182
If so, it seems you decided that
after a very improper night.

204
00:18:30,229 --> 00:18:31,647
General Manager Yu Ji-hyuk.

205
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,316
HR will investigate this properly.

206
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:37,361
It won't be swayed by public opinion.

207
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:41,031
Objectively and without
a woman's influence.

208
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:46,370
Until then, it seems inappropriate
that Ms. Kang leads this project.

209
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:49,999
Considering the circumstances,
she's directly involved too.

210
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:52,001
Until the results are clear,

211
00:18:57,673 --> 00:19:00,134
you should leave it to Ms. Yang.

212
00:19:00,718 --> 00:19:02,094
PERSONNEL RECORD
YANG JU-RAN

213
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:07,850
Kang Ji-won is allowed to join the team.

214
00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:25,492
If you can be unswayed
by public opinion, objective,

215
00:19:25,993 --> 00:19:28,412
and uninfluenced by a woman,

216
00:19:28,495 --> 00:19:31,874
you'll decide that Kang Ji-won
is best for this project.

217
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:36,629
I'm saying nothing happened last night.

218
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:46,847
From now on,

219
00:19:46,931 --> 00:19:49,266
the meal kit project will resume.

220
00:19:53,646 --> 00:19:54,980
The leader...

221
00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:00,110
will be Ms. Yang.

222
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,158
Kang Ji-won, Park Min-hwan,
and Jeong Su-min will assist.

223
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:09,244
That'll be all.

224
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,679
Mr. Yu.

225
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:29,932
Discuss the schedule with Ms. Yang.

226
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,228
You said Mr. Park and Su-min must marry.

227
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:36,772
Won't this be more comfortable?

228
00:20:36,855 --> 00:20:40,025
But it means
three assistant managers are on it.

229
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,824
You know what I can do.

230
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,297
I knew it, but still, Ms. Yang.

231
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:03,590
Congratulations.

232
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:05,384
But am I just lucky?

233
00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:08,012
I wasn't supposed to join this.

234
00:21:08,095 --> 00:21:10,681
It's because the meal kit team is
the dream team.

235
00:21:10,764 --> 00:21:12,057
It's our main project.

236
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:16,353
Maybe they formed the team this way
to keep it until next year.

237
00:21:16,437 --> 00:21:19,440
It makes no sense.
Three assistant managers on it?

238
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:23,944
Will I be asked to leave?

239
00:21:24,028 --> 00:21:26,071
That jerk... I mean...

240
00:21:27,322 --> 00:21:29,450
Is Mr. Yu sick or something?

241
00:21:30,826 --> 00:21:33,037
Thought it isn't like him,

242
00:21:34,496 --> 00:21:36,165
I'm sure he has a reason.

243
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,710
Well, let's work hard.

244
00:21:46,925 --> 00:21:47,926
Good luck.

245
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,096
Take this chance to get ahead of Hui-yeon.

246
00:21:52,181 --> 00:21:53,223
Thank you.

247
00:21:57,853 --> 00:21:59,104
This is good.

248
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:02,483
How did you know I like strawberry milk?

249
00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:04,651
I just bought it because I like it.

250
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:06,278
I got it right.

251
00:22:07,821 --> 00:22:11,116
Oh, right.
I think we're going to a workshop.

252
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,826
A workshop?

253
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:16,205
I've never been to one.

254
00:22:16,288 --> 00:22:18,165
We normally go twice a year.

255
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,920
But Mr. Yu is too individualistic.
He's so selfish.

256
00:22:23,003 --> 00:22:24,338
I see...

257
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:27,174
This is delicious.

258
00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:33,013
No, that's okay.

259
00:22:33,097 --> 00:22:36,141
I'll grill meat for you deliciously
at the workshop.

260
00:22:37,518 --> 00:22:38,811
And buy more milk.

261
00:23:09,675 --> 00:23:11,885
<i>Whenever my dad gave me an allowance,</i>

262
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:14,263
<i>he always drew a heart on it.</i>

263
00:23:14,346 --> 00:23:16,390
<i>Will you grab your true chance?</i>

264
00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:19,977
<i>The inevitable will happen.</i>

265
00:23:20,477 --> 00:23:21,478
And a death...

266
00:23:22,354 --> 00:23:23,772
For a death.

267
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:49,506
I started to work here today.

268
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,800
I'll be scared if you're here for me.

269
00:23:52,885 --> 00:23:55,846
And if it's a coincidence,
it'll feel like fate.

270
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,935
Do you know "Dynamite"?

271
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:13,280
You mean Nobel's invention?

272
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:17,910
And "Spring Day"?

273
00:24:23,582 --> 00:24:27,002
I know spring is from March to May.

274
00:24:27,085 --> 00:24:29,713
Though I don't know
if I need to know more.

275
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:35,052
You get to live
a smooth, long, happy life.

276
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:37,095
Congratulations.

277
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:44,561
I mean, I think
you have a lot of time left.

278
00:24:54,321 --> 00:24:55,322
Chef?

279
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,407
I'm going home.

280
00:24:57,491 --> 00:24:59,785
- Great job today.
- Thank you.

281
00:25:09,294 --> 00:25:10,295
Ji-hyuk!

282
00:25:14,258 --> 00:25:15,342
Mr. Yu!

283
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:19,513
Mr. Yu, you can't do this here.
Yu Ji-hyuk!

284
00:25:22,724 --> 00:25:24,559
Hello!

285
00:25:24,643 --> 00:25:26,478
Oh, right.

286
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:27,980
Hello.

287
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:31,400
I pressed the call button,
and the call was made to you.

288
00:25:31,483 --> 00:25:32,734
Right.

289
00:25:32,818 --> 00:25:36,238
I called him like crazy.
I guess my number was at the top.

290
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:39,866
This is my crazy brother and boss.

291
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,787
He left me out of the team,
then I couldn't reach him all day.

292
00:25:44,705 --> 00:25:47,207
But I don't know why he's wasted here.

293
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:48,375
This is a first.

294
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,378
Maybe it's puberty...

295
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:53,880
Or a quarter-life crisis?

296
00:25:57,301 --> 00:25:59,928
<i>Who's the person
that sent such a great cake?</i>

297
00:26:00,012 --> 00:26:02,597
<i>This is love itself!</i>

298
00:26:02,681 --> 00:26:04,766
- What?
<i>- It means it's good.</i>

299
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,601
Really?

300
00:26:06,685 --> 00:26:09,146
Get up, man in crisis.

301
00:26:09,229 --> 00:26:10,355
By any chance,

302
00:26:11,064 --> 00:26:13,025
do you know Kang Ji-won?

303
00:26:13,734 --> 00:26:14,735
What?

304
00:26:18,071 --> 00:26:19,323
Oh, Werther!

305
00:26:19,406 --> 00:26:21,700
The Basque cheesecake that was made

306
00:26:21,783 --> 00:26:26,204
with the fresh milk from a mountain goat
in New Zealand that just gave birth

307
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:32,085
Unbelievable.

308
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,133
I really enjoyed it.

309
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:39,217
Thanks.

310
00:26:52,773 --> 00:26:54,441
You know what I can do.

311
00:27:02,449 --> 00:27:03,867
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

312
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,970
<i>The person you are calling...</i>

313
00:27:59,506 --> 00:28:00,882
Hangover soup?

314
00:28:00,966 --> 00:28:03,051
You came home on Hui-yeon's back.

315
00:28:03,135 --> 00:28:05,887
Now you're drinking on an empty stomach.

316
00:28:12,978 --> 00:28:13,979
Thank you.

317
00:28:14,646 --> 00:28:15,981
Chairman Yu's asking for you.

318
00:28:31,997 --> 00:28:34,040
You must've drank something nice.

319
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:36,960
I'm sure you gargled, but you still reek.

320
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:39,546
There's nothing cheap here.

321
00:28:44,342 --> 00:28:47,846
Yu-ra took care
of Director Wang's incident very well.

322
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:49,222
She's good.

323
00:28:49,306 --> 00:28:51,266
OH YU-RA
VICE PRESIDENT OF CLOUD AIR

324
00:28:51,975 --> 00:28:53,935
I heard you had an argument with Mr. Lee.

325
00:28:55,061 --> 00:28:55,896
That's not true.

326
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:58,732
Yes, it is. Though he denied it too.

327
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:03,570
It seems you have other eyes and ears
at the company.

328
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:09,951
I'm sure you'll cut off
my eyes and ears eventually,

329
00:29:10,702 --> 00:29:11,828
but not Mr. Lee.

330
00:29:12,537 --> 00:29:14,498
Make him your person at all cost.

331
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:16,374
He's worth it.

332
00:29:20,378 --> 00:29:22,047
Goodness.

333
00:29:22,714 --> 00:29:24,716
I spoke with Oh Gang-cheol.

334
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,760
You take care of Yu-ra.

335
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:31,515
Gang-cheol can't complain
after everything I've done for him.

336
00:29:32,307 --> 00:29:35,936
I thought you wanted me to marry Yu-ra.

337
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:38,647
What if that's what I want?

338
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:44,444
Look at yourself.

339
00:29:45,237 --> 00:29:48,615
You even skipped puberty,
but now you clash with my person.

340
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:51,576
And you get carried home.

341
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,870
Now you're drinking in the morning.

342
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,791
But still,

343
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:02,337
I can't force you to do something
just because of what I want.

344
00:30:05,465 --> 00:30:08,635
I know that you two
never wanted this marriage.

345
00:30:09,427 --> 00:30:10,679
But it's a promise.

346
00:30:10,762 --> 00:30:13,181
It's not right to call it off.

347
00:30:13,265 --> 00:30:14,599
From our side at that.

348
00:30:16,893 --> 00:30:20,855
So try your best to look sincere

349
00:30:21,606 --> 00:30:22,816
and take care of it.

350
00:30:29,864 --> 00:30:31,616
When can I see that girl?

351
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:37,581
Why won't you answer me?
You caused this mess.

352
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:43,587
I don't think you can.

353
00:30:45,297 --> 00:30:47,340
I feel the same as you.

354
00:30:49,718 --> 00:30:51,219
You want me to be happy,

355
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:54,723
and I want the same for her.

356
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:22,751
<i>My time already ended then.</i>

357
00:31:31,134 --> 00:31:32,177
<i>But at least...</i>

358
00:31:34,262 --> 00:31:35,930
<i>I can protect her this time.</i>

359
00:31:37,474 --> 00:31:38,725
THE LATE KANG JI-WON

360
00:31:42,812 --> 00:31:44,064
<i>I won't run away.</i>

361
00:31:46,107 --> 00:31:48,318
<i>I won't regret not doing anything.</i>

362
00:31:51,196 --> 00:31:55,033
<i>Even if I'm not in her happiness...</i>

363
00:32:11,716 --> 00:32:15,136
Roijental! I wish I'd bought it.

364
00:32:16,304 --> 00:32:18,807
I should have when it seemed too late.

365
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,059
Did you see Roijental?

366
00:32:21,142 --> 00:32:25,021
I should've bought it.
I thought about it for six months!

367
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:27,649
Don't look at that. I sold it months ago.

368
00:32:27,732 --> 00:32:30,193
I want to kill myself for it now.

369
00:32:30,777 --> 00:32:32,445
Did you hear?

370
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:35,115
That's the stock I sold for you.

371
00:32:35,198 --> 00:32:36,282
Do you even know?

372
00:32:38,368 --> 00:32:41,746
I'm only with you
because I still have TKU.

373
00:32:47,127 --> 00:32:48,670
ROIJENTAL

374
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:54,843
EARNINGS RATE
701%

375
00:32:57,804 --> 00:32:59,848
Ji-won, come out for a bit.

376
00:33:13,111 --> 00:33:14,571
What was she looking at?

377
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,769
ROIJENTAL

378
00:33:21,853 --> 00:33:26,733
So Ji-won had this stock
without Min-hwan knowing?

379
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,486
She pretends to be busy all the time.
That sly fox.

380
00:33:33,531 --> 00:33:35,950
Why hasn't she sold it, though?

381
00:33:38,036 --> 00:33:40,163
Does she think it'll increase more?

382
00:33:45,168 --> 00:33:47,003
PURCHASE

383
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:50,923
Remember the restaurant I went with Su-min
with your credit card?

384
00:33:51,007 --> 00:33:52,133
It was good.

385
00:33:52,216 --> 00:33:54,344
I kept thinking about you.

386
00:33:55,678 --> 00:33:57,221
I wanted to take you too.

387
00:33:57,972 --> 00:33:58,973
And that's today.

388
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,562
Did you think about me?

389
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,981
I always

390
00:34:08,566 --> 00:34:10,318
think about you.

391
00:34:12,528 --> 00:34:13,905
Are you free tonight?

392
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,033
By the way,

393
00:34:18,701 --> 00:34:19,744
you got money?

394
00:34:21,287 --> 00:34:22,538
Yeah, that's right!

395
00:34:22,622 --> 00:34:26,668
The money I gave you
after I sold the hot Roijental stocks.

396
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:28,461
Let's use that.

397
00:34:30,713 --> 00:34:33,800
<i>Before we marry, I need to make something
happen with Su-min.</i>

398
00:34:33,883 --> 00:34:37,261
<i>And I think I'll have to spend some money.</i>

399
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:39,722
<i>How could I not have known this?</i>

400
00:34:39,806 --> 00:34:44,477
<i>He talked about going to fancy places,
but it was just a trick to get something.</i>

401
00:34:45,436 --> 00:34:47,689
I'm such a dummy!

402
00:34:47,772 --> 00:34:51,901
Why? Dummy?
Did you do something with that money?

403
00:34:52,443 --> 00:34:57,031
I didn't tell you,
but I spent it all to take out insurance.

404
00:34:57,532 --> 00:34:58,491
What?

405
00:34:58,574 --> 00:35:02,912
But I can't even get half of it
if I cancel it now.

406
00:35:02,995 --> 00:35:07,625
But it'll increase by ten percent
in ten years.

407
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:09,836
Hey, you dummy! Are you stupid?

408
00:35:09,919 --> 00:35:11,087
Are you possessed?

409
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,881
It's all a scam!
It benefits insurance companies.

410
00:35:14,507 --> 00:35:17,635
I thought you were smart. You're so dumb!

411
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,679
Damn it! I can't believe this!

412
00:35:22,974 --> 00:35:25,268
Should I sell TKU?

413
00:35:28,187 --> 00:35:30,732
<i>Ruling and opposing lawmakers
involved in the TKU...</i>

414
00:35:30,815 --> 00:35:33,901
But I think it'll go up. This is nuts!

415
00:35:34,902 --> 00:35:36,654
Still, I earned a lot.

416
00:35:37,238 --> 00:35:38,990
This is driving me crazy!

417
00:35:39,782 --> 00:35:41,075
How much do you need?

418
00:35:42,994 --> 00:35:45,413
I have a savings plan that matures soon.

419
00:35:48,374 --> 00:35:49,208
What savings?

420
00:35:50,418 --> 00:35:54,464
You sold Roijental for me.
I'd feel so bad if you sold TKU too.

421
00:35:54,547 --> 00:35:55,757
Right.

422
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,762
Don't sell it. I'll lend you the money.

423
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:04,015
Babe.

424
00:36:05,475 --> 00:36:08,644
Also, instead of eating out tonight,

425
00:36:08,728 --> 00:36:11,606
let's go somewhere this weekend
with Su-min.

426
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:20,990
Look at the sky! It's so nice! So pretty!

427
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:22,700
I wish I had sunglasses!

428
00:36:26,245 --> 00:36:28,414
The weather said it'd be cloudy.

429
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:30,500
I knew it'd be okay with you here.

430
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:32,835
Since you're a weather fairy.

431
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:35,588
You sure know me so well.

432
00:36:37,173 --> 00:36:40,384
Ji-won, stop working so hard.

433
00:36:40,468 --> 00:36:42,220
You got rid of your bosses.

434
00:36:42,303 --> 00:36:43,596
You want to be CEO?

435
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:46,891
Everyone at work praises you,

436
00:36:47,391 --> 00:36:49,519
but that's not charming to men.

437
00:36:50,186 --> 00:36:51,229
You dummy!

438
00:36:51,312 --> 00:36:55,024
Min-hwan, don't say things like that.
You'll get in trouble.

439
00:36:57,568 --> 00:37:00,238
Su-min, why don't you have some cold beer?

440
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,371
You want one too?

441
00:37:09,831 --> 00:37:10,998
I want snacks too!

442
00:37:11,082 --> 00:37:12,083
Snacks!

443
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:26,264
When I think about it,
you're both precious to me.

444
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:30,977
I met Su-min in middle school,
and we're still close.

445
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:32,895
And Min-hwan...

446
00:37:34,355 --> 00:37:37,233
We met at work
and have been together ever since.

447
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:42,947
Our relationship is incredible.

448
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,658
Right?

449
00:37:50,496 --> 00:37:52,081
We're a family.

450
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:56,669
Maybe I'll take her out for some air
and push her off somewhere.

451
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,590
You and me...

452
00:38:01,674 --> 00:38:02,967
And Min-hwan.

453
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:06,470
Let's be happy.

454
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:13,853
I'll have to do a good job.

455
00:38:14,395 --> 00:38:17,607
To keep two princesses happy, right?

456
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,862
Ji-won, well? How does it feel...

457
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:25,406
to have me?

458
00:38:30,453 --> 00:38:31,495
Damn it!

459
00:38:33,873 --> 00:38:35,791
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

460
00:38:37,043 --> 00:38:37,919
What?

461
00:38:41,172 --> 00:38:43,174
No, it was a bug.

462
00:38:43,257 --> 00:38:45,092
What? A bug? Where?

463
00:38:45,176 --> 00:38:46,427
- I'm scared!
- Come here.

464
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,179
- Where's the bug?
- Where's it?

465
00:38:48,262 --> 00:38:49,347
Bugs scare me!

466
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:52,934
I'll chase it away! I'll do it.
Don't come near here!

467
00:38:53,476 --> 00:38:55,436
- Min-hwan!
- Are you okay?

468
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:56,646
A bug! Bug!

469
00:38:56,729 --> 00:38:58,898
I'll get it for you!

470
00:38:59,565 --> 00:39:00,691
Are you okay?

471
00:39:02,652 --> 00:39:04,904
It reminds me of when we were a thing.

472
00:39:04,987 --> 00:39:08,699
You looked so cool
chasing the bug away for me.

473
00:39:09,492 --> 00:39:10,743
Did I do that?

474
00:39:12,954 --> 00:39:13,788
When?

475
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,293
Su-min's scared of bugs too.

476
00:39:19,377 --> 00:39:21,212
I'm glad you're here.

477
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:22,254
Right.

478
00:39:31,472 --> 00:39:34,183
After riding this, let's go on a trip.

479
00:39:35,476 --> 00:39:36,727
How's that?

480
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:38,312
Shall you go alone?

481
00:39:38,396 --> 00:39:39,397
Go over there!

482
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,940
There you go! That's it.

483
00:39:50,324 --> 00:39:51,200
Yes, Ms. Yang?

484
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,494
What?

485
00:39:54,412 --> 00:39:55,454
I'm on my way.

486
00:39:57,123 --> 00:39:58,207
What?

487
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,458
Work again?

488
00:40:01,794 --> 00:40:06,173
Goodness. She's such a workaholic.

489
00:40:06,257 --> 00:40:08,217
She's working on the weekend?

490
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:11,220
I only have her.

491
00:40:11,762 --> 00:40:14,682
But she's too busy to hang out with me.

492
00:40:14,765 --> 00:40:16,517
I can't see her often either.

493
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,228
She thinks it's her project. Jeez.

494
00:40:22,982 --> 00:40:25,735
Su-min, do you know how to ride a bike?

495
00:40:25,818 --> 00:40:27,987
I've never ridden one before.

496
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,572
I'm scared of it.

497
00:40:29,655 --> 00:40:31,323
It's not scary!

498
00:40:31,407 --> 00:40:32,950
I'll teach you. Let's go.

499
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:34,618
- Really?
- It's not scary.

500
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:37,163
<i>Hey, Ji-won.</i>

501
00:40:37,246 --> 00:40:38,539
Sorry about that.

502
00:40:38,622 --> 00:40:40,750
I wanted to leave here,

503
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,209
and you just called...

504
00:40:42,293 --> 00:40:43,711
- Did I startle you?
<i>- What?</i>

505
00:40:43,794 --> 00:40:45,254
No.

506
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:47,882
So you're not coming?

507
00:40:47,965 --> 00:40:49,425
I'm waiting for you.

508
00:40:50,092 --> 00:40:50,926
What?

509
00:40:51,677 --> 00:40:52,762
Where are you?

510
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:19,163
Here.

511
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:23,751
Wow, thanks.

512
00:41:26,629 --> 00:41:29,048
But shouldn't I be giving you flowers?

513
00:41:29,131 --> 00:41:30,966
I heard you work near here now.

514
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,427
Yeah, it's really close.

515
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,389
So make sure to come by.

516
00:41:43,187 --> 00:41:45,147
There's a dinner reservation today.

517
00:41:45,898 --> 00:41:47,441
- So I should go.
- What?

518
00:41:48,734 --> 00:41:49,902
Yeah, okay.

519
00:42:17,555 --> 00:42:19,431
I have something to tell you.

520
00:42:19,515 --> 00:42:21,392
That's good. So do I.

521
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:23,060
Take a seat.

522
00:42:28,065 --> 00:42:29,567
Why did you come to work?

523
00:42:30,151 --> 00:42:33,445
I wanted to get Min-hwan and Su-min
on a date today.

524
00:42:33,529 --> 00:42:36,157
So we came out together,
and I ditched them.

525
00:42:39,451 --> 00:42:42,830
I missed two things
during my succession process in 2021.

526
00:42:43,706 --> 00:42:46,458
One is the Cloud Air and Kelite Tour.

527
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:48,586
I remember.

528
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,715
They were affiliates of U&K
but became independent.

529
00:42:54,216 --> 00:42:55,551
And the other is...

530
00:42:56,635 --> 00:42:57,803
Mr. Lee Seok-jun.

531
00:42:59,638 --> 00:43:02,725
My grandfather wanted him
to stay by my side,

532
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:06,353
but he resigned
when I became the chairman.

533
00:43:07,897 --> 00:43:09,356
Why did he do that?

534
00:43:11,025 --> 00:43:13,027
Either way, he's uncomfortable.

535
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,570
He can't be controlled.

536
00:43:16,614 --> 00:43:20,201
It's why I couldn't make you
the leader of the project.

537
00:43:24,663 --> 00:43:25,915
I'll help with everything.

538
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:28,792
Whatever you need.

539
00:43:30,419 --> 00:43:31,378
Everything.

540
00:43:47,144 --> 00:43:50,648
You always arrived early
when you worked at the far branch.

541
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:52,983
But now you live close to work, but...

542
00:43:53,567 --> 00:43:55,069
I wasn't late.

543
00:43:55,152 --> 00:43:56,946
You arrived three minutes ago.

544
00:43:57,029 --> 00:43:58,864
If you start acting out...

545
00:43:58,948 --> 00:44:00,241
I wasn't late.

546
00:44:00,324 --> 00:44:01,951
Okay.

547
00:44:03,369 --> 00:44:05,246
As long as you're on time.

548
00:44:05,329 --> 00:44:06,413
Anyway,

549
00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:08,791
that man came again.

550
00:44:22,554 --> 00:44:24,181
I'm seeing you often.

551
00:44:24,265 --> 00:44:25,975
I want to get to know you.

552
00:44:27,101 --> 00:44:28,936
To see if you're a player.

553
00:44:29,019 --> 00:44:31,313
If you have qualities to be solid land.

554
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:38,529
I hope you drink in moderation today.

555
00:44:39,029 --> 00:44:40,906
To see how desperate you are.

556
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:43,826
Why would you do that?

557
00:44:46,036 --> 00:44:47,496
I think it's why I came.

558
00:44:49,373 --> 00:44:51,000
Stop the food show.

559
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,462
No need to attract women.
You're skilled enough to make money.

560
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,300
What do you care?

561
00:45:05,347 --> 00:45:06,682
I won't drink anymore.

562
00:45:07,766 --> 00:45:09,101
There's something I must do.

563
00:45:20,863 --> 00:45:24,450
There will be a marketing workshop
to improve teamwork.

564
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:26,869
Be careful not to get hurt, and...

565
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:33,751
That'll be all.

566
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:50,100
Ms. Yang.

567
00:45:53,062 --> 00:45:56,315
How about we get Hui-yeon to prepare
the workshop?

568
00:45:57,358 --> 00:45:58,192
Sounds good.

569
00:45:58,650 --> 00:45:59,526
Hui-yeon.

570
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:03,906
Do you want to prepare the workshop?

571
00:46:04,948 --> 00:46:05,949
Me?

572
00:46:07,576 --> 00:46:08,827
Prepare it myself?

573
00:46:12,998 --> 00:46:17,544
U&K FOOD AUTUMN WORKSHOP

574
00:46:17,628 --> 00:46:20,589
WE ARE ONE! MARKETING TEAM!

575
00:46:43,904 --> 00:46:46,698
It'll suck if we get this sleeping bag.

576
00:46:48,075 --> 00:46:50,994
Why decide on accommodations
by a treasure hunt?

577
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:54,123
I can't sleep in a place like this.

578
00:46:54,206 --> 00:46:56,291
Just work hard in the game!

579
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:59,044
It's more fun than just drinking!

580
00:46:59,753 --> 00:47:03,173
Also, when else
would we do something like this?

581
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:09,805
Put it over there.

582
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,477
I was nervous when I heard Hui-yeon
will be the one planning the workshop.

583
00:47:15,561 --> 00:47:18,981
We have to play the name tag game too!
This is crazy.

584
00:47:19,064 --> 00:47:20,441
Still, I'm glad.

585
00:47:20,524 --> 00:47:23,694
Her sense of loss from the project
must be gone.

586
00:47:24,194 --> 00:47:27,990
Yes. And we're always sitting.
It's nice doing something new.

587
00:47:28,073 --> 00:47:30,200
Don't get ahead of yourself.

588
00:47:30,284 --> 00:47:31,910
You suck at treasure hunts.

589
00:47:32,578 --> 00:47:34,246
We'll see.

590
00:47:34,329 --> 00:47:35,539
I'll try hard.

591
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:38,083
You can't do this after you die.

592
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:39,751
Die?

593
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:46,091
I mean,

594
00:47:46,925 --> 00:47:49,303
everyone dies one day, right?

595
00:47:49,386 --> 00:47:51,930
Women should just sit back for this.

596
00:47:52,014 --> 00:47:54,141
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

597
00:47:54,224 --> 00:47:55,559
Do you trust me?

598
00:47:55,642 --> 00:47:57,519
I'll find the number one flag,

599
00:47:57,603 --> 00:47:59,271
and then find the rest for you all.

600
00:48:02,733 --> 00:48:03,734
Number one...

601
00:48:04,902 --> 00:48:05,903
Let's do this.

602
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:08,322
PARK MIN-HWAN

603
00:48:08,405 --> 00:48:10,199
Hey, wait!

604
00:48:17,539 --> 00:48:19,124
I screwed up.

605
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:22,252
<i>If I remember correctly,
Min-hwan gets number five.</i>

606
00:48:22,336 --> 00:48:24,171
<i>He sleeps in a sleeping bag.</i>

607
00:48:24,254 --> 00:48:26,507
<i>I found number four and hid.</i>

608
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,091
<i>I ended up in a tent.</i>

609
00:48:31,053 --> 00:48:32,054
<i>Jeong Su-min...</i>

610
00:48:39,853 --> 00:48:41,104
Here, Su-min.

611
00:48:41,772 --> 00:48:43,023
Anything else?

612
00:48:43,106 --> 00:48:44,233
Let's take a photo.

613
00:48:44,316 --> 00:48:45,651
Sounds good.

614
00:48:49,821 --> 00:48:53,867
<i>Strangely,
Su-min always got the best things.</i>

615
00:48:54,618 --> 00:48:56,036
Hide!

616
00:48:58,038 --> 00:49:02,000
Don't you think
we hid number one too well?

617
00:49:02,084 --> 00:49:03,877
Well, I'm the one who hid it.

618
00:49:03,961 --> 00:49:05,963
Which means it can be found!

619
00:49:06,046 --> 00:49:08,674
But you're completely wild.

620
00:49:08,757 --> 00:49:10,300
Who'd go in the water?

621
00:49:10,384 --> 00:49:13,345
Yeah, the water's so cold...

622
00:49:13,428 --> 00:49:14,638
Water?

623
00:49:15,305 --> 00:49:16,431
That's hard.

624
00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:19,893
Mr. Kim would help if he was here.

625
00:49:20,894 --> 00:49:22,688
Where's Min-hwan? Can he swim?

626
00:49:23,522 --> 00:49:25,524
Why? Will you ask him to find it?

627
00:49:26,191 --> 00:49:29,861
Of course! It must be
the stream up there. It's dangerous.

628
00:49:30,612 --> 00:49:33,282
Just ask for help.
Don't take the hard way.

629
00:49:39,204 --> 00:49:41,373
Why? Because he's your boyfriend?

630
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:44,501
No, it's not that.

631
00:49:45,168 --> 00:49:46,878
Then can I borrow him?

632
00:49:50,215 --> 00:49:54,970
Ji-won, you need to do anything you can
to get what you want.

633
00:49:55,053 --> 00:49:57,931
For me,
that's what it means to truly want it.

634
00:50:06,019 --> 00:50:09,481
<i>Was that how she got
everything she wanted?</i>

635
00:50:15,028 --> 00:50:20,367
<i>Jeong Su-min sure
got everything she wanted in 2023.</i>

636
00:50:33,588 --> 00:50:34,464
I like you a lot.

637
00:50:34,548 --> 00:50:35,799
I'll help with everything.

638
00:50:35,882 --> 00:50:38,885
Just ask for help.
Don't take the hard way.

639
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,348
Did you find number one?

640
00:50:43,432 --> 00:50:47,018
- I'd find it for you if I knew--
- Hui-yeon hid it in the stream.

641
00:50:48,228 --> 00:50:49,354
Can you help me?

642
00:50:50,021 --> 00:50:51,773
- Of course.
- No.

643
00:50:52,274 --> 00:50:53,859
Not that. Something else.

644
00:51:02,367 --> 00:51:06,538
Can I just be honest with you?

645
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,546
Then don't think of me as someone strange,

646
00:51:14,629 --> 00:51:17,048
don't hate me, and just listen to me.

647
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:21,762
Be that person for me.

648
00:51:25,265 --> 00:51:30,353
I know you're willing to do everything
to help me.

649
00:51:33,607 --> 00:51:35,400
But I want to do it on my own.

650
00:51:37,903 --> 00:51:42,741
Until the media announced
that you would be the successor to U&K,

651
00:51:43,408 --> 00:51:46,077
you always did the right thing.

652
00:51:46,953 --> 00:51:48,497
I don't want you to do

653
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,628
something you wouldn't because of me.

654
00:51:56,797 --> 00:51:57,798
I...

655
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,425
You said I was a competent person.

656
00:52:02,135 --> 00:52:04,095
I can really do anything.

657
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:09,100
So...

658
00:52:11,353 --> 00:52:13,605
just let me be honest with you

659
00:52:13,688 --> 00:52:15,315
from time to time.

660
00:52:17,692 --> 00:52:20,487
We're the only two people living

661
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,114
these moments again.

662
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:25,867
Things I can't say to others.

663
00:52:27,035 --> 00:52:28,787
Let me confide in you.

664
00:52:43,677 --> 00:52:45,220
Didn't you say your dad

665
00:52:46,221 --> 00:52:48,098
drew a heart on your allowance?

666
00:53:04,656 --> 00:53:07,200
Why is that...

667
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:16,543
Your dad's allowance.

668
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:22,757
<i>I should listen to you.</i>

669
00:53:22,841 --> 00:53:24,301
I'll do everything you want.

670
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,439
So you can use me all you want.

671
00:53:40,442 --> 00:53:41,318
It's okay.

672
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:58,251
I don't have to spend it, right?

673
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,381
I just want to talk with it.

674
00:54:06,051 --> 00:54:07,177
And...

675
00:54:09,888 --> 00:54:12,432
I want my allowance to be happy.

676
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:19,147
Is there anything you want to do
in your second life?

677
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,693
- Ji-won...
- Mr. Yu.

678
00:54:23,777 --> 00:54:25,612
Is there something you want?

679
00:54:31,117 --> 00:54:32,118
I want...

680
00:54:35,246 --> 00:54:36,831
to be happy.

681
00:54:41,169 --> 00:54:42,420
On my own.

682
00:54:43,797 --> 00:54:44,881
With my strength.

683
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:48,510
I am going to be happy.

684
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,795
Did he spend all of his time working out?

685
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:27,298
This isn't good enough.

686
00:55:28,633 --> 00:55:29,676
My back!

687
00:55:30,635 --> 00:55:33,805
If it wasn't for my disc problems,
they'd all be dead.

688
00:55:34,305 --> 00:55:35,765
My L4 and L5.

689
00:55:39,394 --> 00:55:40,562
What?

690
00:55:40,645 --> 00:55:42,814
Su-min, are you okay?

691
00:55:42,897 --> 00:55:43,898
What's going on?

692
00:55:43,982 --> 00:55:47,861
I got caught on a branch.

693
00:55:48,737 --> 00:55:49,863
Let me see.

694
00:55:51,906 --> 00:55:53,783
Oh, no. This is bad.

695
00:55:53,867 --> 00:55:55,326
That hurts.

696
00:56:08,173 --> 00:56:10,717
You should apply ointment.

697
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,177
Let's go to base camp.

698
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,054
It's okay. I put saliva on it.

699
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:20,393
By the way, can you help me
with something?

700
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:22,687
With what?

701
00:56:23,563 --> 00:56:26,441
I know where the stick for number one is.

702
00:56:27,233 --> 00:56:28,568
But it's in the water.

703
00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:33,031
What if I go in the water
and this gets worse?

704
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,408
Right. Okay.

705
00:56:40,914 --> 00:56:42,874
KANG JI-WON

706
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:58,431
That's far.

707
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:15,115
Ms. Yang, I just asked the master.

708
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:18,827
He said the water's deep and to not go in.
There's moss too.

709
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,746
Let's get over there.

710
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:24,541
Wait, let's call the safety officer first.

711
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:52,110
Are you insane?

712
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:54,696
You're not even prepared.

713
00:57:54,779 --> 00:57:56,364
The water could be deep!

714
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:01,369
Mr. Yu, I'm fine.

715
00:58:01,452 --> 00:58:02,829
Nothing is fine!

716
00:58:04,497 --> 00:58:05,957
You could just tell me.

717
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,001
Why is that so hard?

718
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:11,212
Just ask for help! Why take the hard path?

719
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:16,176
I'm not Su-min.

720
00:58:18,553 --> 00:58:21,139
Because she's wrong and I'm right.

721
00:58:23,725 --> 00:58:25,351
I won't live like her.

722
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:29,022
I'm going to get everything on my own!

723
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,194
That's the right thing to do.

724
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:36,362
That's what Kang Ji-won would do!

725
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:38,489
Because that's me.

726
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:10,980
Mr. Yu.

727
00:59:15,693 --> 00:59:17,862
Is there something you want?

728
00:59:21,908 --> 00:59:23,243
I want...

729
00:59:24,744 --> 00:59:26,204
Have you been on a boat?

730
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:29,832
After my dad died,

731
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:33,628
it feels like I'm on a boat every day.

732
00:59:33,711 --> 00:59:37,423
My feet are firmly planted,

733
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:39,217
but the boat keeps rocking.

734
00:59:40,551 --> 00:59:41,636
I feel anxious.

735
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:46,933
I want stability.

736
00:59:50,895 --> 00:59:52,855
I want to step on solid land.

737
01:00:10,456 --> 01:00:12,000
I want to be solid land.

738
01:00:28,696 --> 01:00:31,696

<i>I won't let them marry.</i>

740
01:00:45,825 --> 01:00:47,368
<i>It's all over now.</i>

741
01:00:47,452 --> 01:00:49,370
<i>Focus on one thing today.</i>

742
01:00:49,454 --> 01:00:50,913
<i>Kang Ji-won won.</i>

743
01:00:50,997 --> 01:00:52,415
<i>If we had more time,</i>

744
01:00:52,498 --> 01:00:54,834
<i>I would've fallen for you completely.</i>

745
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,836
<i>But this fate puts the brake down.</i>

746
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:58,296
You can't get a cent?

747
01:00:58,379 --> 01:01:00,631
I even took out a private loan.

748
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:05,887
<i>But at this rate, I don't think
he'll give up marrying you.</i>

749
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:06,929
Shall we get married?

750
01:01:07,013 --> 01:01:10,975
<i>What a crappy way to say you'll sponge off
me for life. You call that family?</i>
