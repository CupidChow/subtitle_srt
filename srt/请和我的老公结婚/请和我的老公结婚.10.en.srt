TO ACTUAL PEOPLE, PLACES, INCIDENTS,

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,723
Ji-won, that little...

6
00:00:15,806 --> 00:00:18,350
Kang Ji-won!

7
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:20,018
Damn it!

8
00:00:20,728 --> 00:00:22,354
Why was that for? It hurts!

9
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:25,232
It's your fault.
Why are you throwing a tantrum?

10
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:27,693
-Stop acting like a child.
-What did I do?

11
00:00:27,776 --> 00:00:29,403
Are you serious right now?

12
00:00:29,486 --> 00:00:32,948
How could you bring such an impudent brat?

13
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:36,493
She's normally nice!

14
00:00:36,577 --> 00:00:39,538
She must have been possessed. Whatever!

15
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:41,081
Goodness...

16
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:44,501
You just got hit by a woman.
You still run your mouth.

17
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:46,503
You see one, you've seen it all.

18
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:50,340
I told you home discipline was important
countless times!

19
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:53,177
This happened
because you didn't listen to me.

20
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,721
What will you do about this?

21
00:00:55,804 --> 00:00:57,806
-God...
-What will you do?

22
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,974
<i>Stop it!</i>

23
00:01:00,684 --> 00:01:03,187
Darn it. She doesn't know anything.

24
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,315
Ji-won went crazy.
What does she expect me to do?

25
00:01:09,526 --> 00:01:11,320
Ji-won, you're dead.

26
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:14,782
Ji-won, come out!

27
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:17,576
Did you think I'd just let it go?

28
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:21,705
I've been too easy on you!
Know your place! Stop messing around!

29
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:24,208
I know you're inside.

30
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,543
Come out! Now!

31
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:30,547
Hello...

32
00:01:31,548 --> 00:01:33,842
Ms. Kang, what are you wearing?

33
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:35,010
Was I bad?

34
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:37,638
Are you punishing me?
Like in a naughty way.

35
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:39,223
No, it's not that...

36
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,686
I had something to refund today, so...

37
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,313
Then the outfit's perfect.

38
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:47,981
-Was it a success?
-Yes.

39
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,613
This is his first time to a housewarming.

40
00:01:54,696 --> 00:01:58,116
So I told him to buy
tissues and detergent as gifts.

41
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:01,662
I don't know about those flowers, though.

42
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:04,581
I love flowers.

43
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:16,802
What... What the hell?

44
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:20,013
What uncultured fool yells like this?

45
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:24,560
Wait a second...

46
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,145
This is the right number.

47
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:29,606
-Ji-won's brother?
-What are you saying?

48
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:32,067
Yes, hello, sir.

49
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,777
You were working out.

50
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,780
This is where my girlfriend lives.

51
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,658
I think I was mistaken.

52
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:40,826
Girlfriend?

53
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:44,121
The last tenant was a woman.

54
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:45,205
Wait...

55
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:47,708
The last tenant?

56
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:51,169
It's the perfect size for newlyweds.

57
00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:53,297
But why rent?

58
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,425
Mr. Park went on about
how a man should own a house.

59
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:01,722
I hear you pay the rent to my brother.

60
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,266
Don't pay it.

61
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:06,894
He won't know.
He doesn't check his account.

62
00:03:06,977 --> 00:03:08,645
This place was for me anyway.

63
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,648
That's different.

64
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:16,278
Why here of all places, though?

65
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:19,948
Your boss lives in the building.
It'll be so uncomfortable.

66
00:03:20,657 --> 00:03:22,034
This to the bedroom?

67
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:23,368
Yes. Thanks.

68
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:51,021
Take it easy, okay?

69
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:53,231
-Bye!
-Get home safely.

70
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:55,025
Bye, Hui-yeon!

71
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:04,076
Bye.

72
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:21,259
Even though you were born into a life
where you can't live your own way,

73
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:24,012
I didn't think
a business marriage was right.

74
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:29,184
So when you called the wedding off
with Yu-ra, I was glad.

75
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:33,939
Is there another reason?

76
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,530
I mean, Ji-hyuk, by any chance,

77
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:43,740
if you have feelings for someone

78
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:45,701
who's very important to me...

79
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:47,202
What are you worried about?

80
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:49,705
I might do something with Ji-won?

81
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:51,248
Well...

82
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:54,668
Do what? She's getting married.

83
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:56,962
There. Now, go home.

84
00:04:58,213 --> 00:04:59,089
Ji-hyuk...

85
00:05:04,886 --> 00:05:07,514
Nothing's going on,
and I won't do anything.

86
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:10,017
She's a good person, so I want to help.

87
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,895
Also, I'm grateful that she's nice to you.
Happy now?

88
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,774
Go home.

89
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:26,158
But I've never seen him like that.

90
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:41,506
Damn it...

91
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:44,760
Mr. Park.

92
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:45,927
What's wrong?

93
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:49,639
-Did you have a good weekend?
-Yeah.

94
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:50,849
You look great.

95
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:00,233
Hey, Ji-won. You...

96
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:04,988
Are you insane?

97
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:07,199
-What's going on?
-Oh, no.

98
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:09,367
Why are you hitting me?

99
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:10,994
Why you...

100
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:16,124
That's enough.

101
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,293
You did nothing when she hit me.

102
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:20,337
Why are you so unfair?

103
00:06:21,963 --> 00:06:25,383
Did you share your love with two women
because you like being fair?

104
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:32,641
Ms. Kang, let's go.

105
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:34,351
Just a minute.

106
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:36,311
I should confront the cheater.

107
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:44,820
-What?
-Panties?

108
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,325
Whose is this?

109
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:52,911
I found it in your car.

110
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:05,549
How could you go through my car?

111
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:16,852
How dare you shout? You cheater!

112
00:07:53,377 --> 00:07:59,480
MARRY MY HUSBAND

113
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,438
Did you hear about Park Min-hwan?

114
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:03,607
-He cheated on Kang Ji-won.
-Really?

115
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,233
You know Park Min-hwan, right?

116
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:06,359
From marketing!

117
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:08,069
-He cheated.
-What?

118
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:10,322
And they did it in a car...

119
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:11,406
What?

120
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:13,658
A car? They did it in a car?

121
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:15,785
Big news!

122
00:08:17,746 --> 00:08:19,581
I can't believe it.

123
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:21,917
Rumors spread to HR?

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,668
That's huge news.

125
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:25,921
I swear...

126
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:27,422
What will they do?

127
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:29,925
"Man cheats in seven-year relationship."

128
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:31,343
"Panties were thrown."

129
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,180
When Mr. Park tried to hit her,

130
00:08:35,263 --> 00:08:37,057
-Mr. Yu stopped him.
-Red panties.

131
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,351
Everyone, U&K's icon...

132
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:41,645
has returned.

133
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,188
It was red.

134
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:45,190
It's like a soap opera.

135
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:50,028
I don't watch TV. I get my fix here.

136
00:08:53,657 --> 00:08:56,534
So that's why she did that to my mom.

137
00:08:58,286 --> 00:08:59,704
What do I do?

138
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,415
Girls like her are scary.

139
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,088
You can't manage your panties?

140
00:09:08,171 --> 00:09:09,256
They're not mine.

141
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:11,716
What?

142
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,218
Those aren't yours?

143
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:18,223
But I did it only with you in my car.

144
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:23,520
If they're not yours, why were they there?

145
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:25,689
What the hell is going on?

146
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:27,524
What happened?

147
00:09:27,607 --> 00:09:28,733
Whose are they?

148
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:30,277
What are you saying?

149
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:32,153
Damn it!

150
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:37,993
<i>I knew he'd take the bait.</i>

151
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:41,204
<i>They don't belong to Su-min,</i>

152
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:43,707
<i>but I chose panties you'd love.</i>

153
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,836
Are you okay?

154
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:50,171
I'm so sorry.

155
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:55,552
Just a moment.

156
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:00,098
Hey, Eun-ho.

157
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:04,436
I'm at work right now.

158
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,812
I'll call you later.

159
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:07,856
Okay.

160
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:15,155
We had the family meeting
at Eun-ho's restaurant.

161
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:18,283
He saw me upset and was worried.

162
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:19,659
Yesterday?

163
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:23,413
So you went knowing everything?

164
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,626
Is that why you dressed that way?

165
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:33,340
You should've told us.

166
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:35,884
I bet you were so upset.

167
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:41,598
Anyway, do you know who she is?

168
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:49,606
This makes no sense.

169
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:52,901
Ji-won didn't get in my car.
How did she find them?

170
00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:54,903
I have to ask.

171
00:10:57,322 --> 00:11:01,159
Ask where she found it?
That won't change that you cheated.

172
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:03,787
Hey! What the hell?

173
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:06,206
Stop screaming!

174
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,209
You just fell in love.

175
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:11,753
It's not right, but it happens.

176
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:13,088
People change.

177
00:11:15,673 --> 00:11:18,927
And she should've acted right
to prevent it.

178
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:22,472
That's just great.

179
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,151
Look who it is.

180
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:38,696
The great Ji-won
who does all the company's work herself.

181
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:40,448
Mr. Kim!

182
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:42,117
Mr. Kim!

183
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,244
-You'll get in trouble.
-That little...

184
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:47,038
Look at how she acts!

185
00:11:47,122 --> 00:11:49,874
-That's why men cheat on her!
-Stop it.

186
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,128
I can't believe her. Goodness.

187
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:56,673
For men, it's important what kind
of women they meet.

188
00:11:56,756 --> 00:11:59,134
They can meet a fox, but not a bear.

189
00:12:00,343 --> 00:12:02,512
-That's men.
-That's right.

190
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:06,850
Yeah.

191
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:09,227
It's been a while.

192
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:14,649
Many people get married
and divorced these days.

193
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:16,568
You just followed your heart.

194
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,696
So don't worry about it.

195
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:21,114
We must not waver.

196
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:31,708
It seems you're mistaken right now.

197
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:33,710
Jeong Su-min.

198
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:37,088
You're not marriage material.

199
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:42,093
Kang Ji-won graduated
from Hankuk University.

200
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:46,681
She saved quite a lot of money
and is very self-sufficient.

201
00:12:47,348 --> 00:12:48,266
What about you?

202
00:12:51,686 --> 00:12:53,521
What else do you have

203
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:55,273
besides being pretty?

204
00:12:58,109 --> 00:12:59,402
What do you have?

205
00:13:01,863 --> 00:13:04,407
That we slept together?
Sure, it was great.

206
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:07,494
But let's be realistic.
I'm not in my twenties.

207
00:13:07,577 --> 00:13:08,620
Marry you?

208
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:12,332
Know your place.

209
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:15,627
What?

210
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:17,712
What?

211
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,631
Hey!

212
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:22,300
You...

213
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:25,386
You bastard!

214
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,679
What?

215
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:28,056
-Hey!
-What?

216
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:31,309
Mr. Kim.

217
00:13:31,392 --> 00:13:32,644
Mr. Kim, wait...

218
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:36,022
How could you do that to Su-min?

219
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:38,066
How could you?

220
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:41,986
How could you? Let go!
How could you do that to Su-min?

221
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,821
How could you do that?

222
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:45,198
Mr. Kim, come here.

223
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:48,243
What's wrong? Stop it.

224
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:50,495
Su-min...

225
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:52,747
Let go of me!

226
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,165
How could you do that?

227
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:55,708
Mr. Kim!

228
00:13:55,792 --> 00:14:00,213
So the woman Mr. Park cheated with
is Jeong Su-min, right?

229
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:01,881
Kang Ji-won's best friend?

230
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:05,009
Wow, it's like a jungle.

231
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:07,053
What's happening at work?

232
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:08,179
What? Why?

233
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,017
-Big news!
-Gather around!

234
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:14,477
What is it?

235
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:15,895
Park Min-hwan...

236
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:17,981
-And Jeong Su-min?
-You knew?

237
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:19,357
-You knew?
-Yeah!

238
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:23,653
And they've been
best friends since middle school!

239
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:25,196
Isn't that crazy?

240
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:28,992
Poor Ji-won!

241
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:34,163
THE CHEATING LEGEND

242
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:36,583
<i>-Tell me about it.</i>
<i>-Panties Park!</i>

243
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,084
<i>Panties Park?</i>

244
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:39,627
<i>I want to quit!</i>

245
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:42,255
CHEATED WITH HER BEST FRIEND

246
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:45,258
PRETENDS TO WORK OVERTIME TO MEET

247
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:47,427
THE CHEATING LEGEND

248
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,650
OTHER HALF

249
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,744
<i>Ji-won, did you move?</i>

250
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:14,579
<i>I think we should talk.</i>

251
00:15:14,662 --> 00:15:16,372
<i>I'm in front of your place.</i>

252
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:18,583
<i>You don't believe others, do you?</i>

253
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,084
<i>You have to believe me.</i>

254
00:15:28,217 --> 00:15:29,636
LEE WOO FOOD MEAL KIT TASTING

255
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:33,640
It's the data
from last weekend's tasting event.

256
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:35,141
And I have concerns.

257
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:37,268
Can you take a look?

258
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:42,190
Lee Woo Food had a meal kit event?

259
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:45,693
Then shouldn't we have run a booth too?

260
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:50,907
By the way, where's our product?

261
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:51,991
I don't see it.

262
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:54,661
If you take a look,

263
00:15:55,828 --> 00:15:58,623
it's in the back like this.

264
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:04,671
The tasting event went well,
so I thought it'd be displayed up front.

265
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,723
MARKETING TEAM 1
PARK MIN-HWAN, JEONG SU-MIN

266
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:20,728
U&K BERMUDA PARK MH'S SCANDALOUS BEHAVIOR

267
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:26,109
PRETENDS TO WORK OVERTIME TO MEET

268
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:27,193
WITNESSES AT WORK

269
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:33,324
Oh, my God!

270
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:35,451
How could you do this?

271
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:38,287
Even if there was an incident,
why cover it?

272
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,084
Pardon? What...

273
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:46,504
Jomart. I heard about
the allergen sign issue.

274
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:48,756
Why didn't you report it?

275
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:51,300
How did you know?

276
00:16:54,095 --> 00:16:58,391
Instead of apologizing to Jomart,
you yelled and said it was their mistake?

277
00:16:59,058 --> 00:17:01,519
Yes, but it was true.

278
00:17:01,602 --> 00:17:06,566
While we were away for just a second,
their employee started the tasting event.

279
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:08,109
Both of you?

280
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:10,778
Why were you both away?

281
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:13,239
Well...

282
00:17:13,322 --> 00:17:16,909
Mr. Park and Ms. Jeong
were in charge, right?

283
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,501
What a bastard.

284
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:29,088
What a bastard.

285
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:34,343
No!

286
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:36,262
What are you all thinking?

287
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:40,016
Ji-won.

288
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:47,356
Mr. Park handled it well
with the customer,

289
00:17:48,107 --> 00:17:50,109
but not reporting it is an issue.

290
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,196
Well...

291
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:07,293
GIRLFRIEND'S BEST FRIEND, CHEATER, ANIMAL

292
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:10,630
THEY DID IT DURING WORK HOURS

293
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:14,550
FILTER BY: PARK MIN-HWAN, BERMUDA

294
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:20,306
The situation in marketing
is being shared through company email.

295
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:24,519
So I've banned key words
like "Mr. Park," "Bermuda Park,"

296
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:26,020
and "Park Min-hwan."

297
00:18:27,063 --> 00:18:29,482
Right. "Panties Park" as well.

298
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:36,113
All company emails containing
these words won't be sent.

299
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:38,157
And the same with messengers.

300
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:46,082
I guess I can avoid
being talked about at work.

301
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,667
However,

302
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:53,256
these protective measures will only be
valid if you accept being transferred.

303
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:56,467
To a different department?

304
00:18:57,593 --> 00:19:00,638
It's hard to make you
a full-time employee now.

305
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:02,348
The contract isn't up yet,

306
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:06,686
but the company wants to let you go
after you work until today.

307
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:11,774
Do you consent?

308
00:19:28,624 --> 00:19:30,751
Ji-won, please pick up.

309
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:40,052
MODU ISSUE

310
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:48,728
B CHEATS ON A WITH C, HER BESTIE. B AND C
WERE INVOLVED IN THE JOMART INCIDENT.

311
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,022
MEN CAN'T REFUSE A WOMAN'S SEDUCTION

312
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:53,399
Why are they all after me?

313
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:58,321
Who do they think they are?
What the hell do they know about me?

314
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:02,241
Ji-won and I are...

315
00:20:05,786 --> 00:20:07,580
OTHER HALF

316
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:30,394
No way.

317
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:32,480
The company has a system.

318
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:36,025
How could Yang Ju-ran become my boss?

319
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:42,239
Ms. Yang's successfully running
the meal kit project that could've failed.

320
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,533
The company's grateful.

321
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:48,829
On the other hand, in addition
to related cases, your work capacity,

322
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:52,917
attendance, peer-to-peer evaluation,
and misogyny are disappointing.

323
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,336
What...

324
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:57,880
Misogyny? What does that even mean?

325
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:03,719
This is a notice.

326
00:21:03,803 --> 00:21:07,598
If you can't accept it,
can I take it as your will to resign?

327
00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:27,827
MANAGER KIM GYEONG-UK

328
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:34,166
Damn it! Yang Ju-ran.

329
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:37,628
You change my seat.

330
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:41,882
Yes, sir.

331
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:44,468
Ms. Yang.

332
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,506
You can't smoke...

333
00:22:25,092 --> 00:22:27,511
Oh, you weren't.

334
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:35,895
Why are you here?

335
00:22:38,814 --> 00:22:43,778
I come here to think in peace alone.

336
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,405
The company's a place of work.

337
00:22:46,947 --> 00:22:48,741
It's not a place to think.

338
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,789
Didn't you come here
to think on your own too?

339
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,460
You don't seem like the type
to come to storage yourself.

340
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:03,214
Again...

341
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:06,050
A know-it-all.

342
00:23:09,095 --> 00:23:13,307
Aren't you the type to be cold

343
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,726
to those you care about the most?

344
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:18,896
U&K HRD INSTITUTE

345
00:23:20,815 --> 00:23:22,358
Those who think they know

346
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:24,735
and judge people rashly...

347
00:23:25,444 --> 00:23:27,613
Personally, I hate people like you.

348
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:33,577
You were promoted but don't look happy.

349
00:23:34,328 --> 00:23:36,705
If it's because of Mr. Kim, don't worry.

350
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:40,584
With your performance,
you should've been promoted sooner.

351
00:23:41,127 --> 00:23:44,630
Is the meal kit
a big chunk of that performance?

352
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:50,427
This is Kang Ji-won's project.

353
00:23:51,095 --> 00:23:53,806
The idea, planning, and execution.

354
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:57,518
If someone should get promoted for this,

355
00:23:58,227 --> 00:23:59,478
it's Ms. Kang.

356
00:24:04,483 --> 00:24:06,152
I feel better after saying that.

357
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:12,575
Please take that into consideration.

358
00:24:16,704 --> 00:24:17,746
Kim Gyeong-uk...

359
00:24:18,956 --> 00:24:21,375
also got promoted with your proposal.

360
00:24:26,672 --> 00:24:28,215
You're the losing type.

361
00:24:29,758 --> 00:24:31,260
Those who think they know

362
00:24:32,094 --> 00:24:33,721
and judge people rashly...

363
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:40,394
I personally like them.

364
00:24:41,353 --> 00:24:42,771
If they are right.

365
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:46,859
And you're right.

366
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,236
I'm a pushover.

367
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:51,697
That makes me comfortable.

368
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:03,542
Why did you tell HR that?

369
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,337
We worked together.

370
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,215
And I think it's right you get promoted.

371
00:25:11,592 --> 00:25:13,302
I don't like feeling uneasy.

372
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:16,347
I was uncomfortable being the leader.

373
00:25:18,265 --> 00:25:20,100
This project is yours.

374
00:25:20,935 --> 00:25:25,606
I'm sorry.
When Mr. Kim wanted to exclude you,

375
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:28,025
I should've fixed it then.

376
00:25:30,277 --> 00:25:32,238
I learned while working with you

377
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:35,157
that you're such a great person

378
00:25:35,658 --> 00:25:39,328
and how much fun work can be
when working with good people.

379
00:25:43,582 --> 00:25:46,710
I don't know what HR will decide,

380
00:25:47,544 --> 00:25:50,839
but you're the coolest to me.

381
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:58,889
You're the coolest to me too.

382
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:03,519
Ms. Yang, Ms. Kang.

383
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:08,023
I think you should go downstairs.

384
00:26:08,107 --> 00:26:09,108
What?

385
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:12,820
Kang Ji-won, come out!

386
00:26:12,903 --> 00:26:14,822
Why are you blocking me?

387
00:26:15,572 --> 00:26:17,283
I almost died!

388
00:26:18,325 --> 00:26:22,413
Who is Kang Ji-won?
Why would she say this?

389
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:25,958
I want to see if she knows
what she's talking about!

390
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:30,754
She revealed her name.
Doesn't that mean she's confident?

391
00:26:30,838 --> 00:26:33,340
-So why block us?
-Calm down.

392
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:34,717
Hello.

393
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,845
I'm Kang Ji-won of Marketing Team 1.

394
00:26:39,972 --> 00:26:43,225
-All right.
-Are you Kang Ji-won?

395
00:26:53,736 --> 00:26:54,570
Nice.

396
00:26:58,032 --> 00:27:02,411
Hey. We pretended to be dying
because we liked free things?

397
00:27:02,494 --> 00:27:05,247
Do you think allergies are a joke?

398
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:07,833
You people messed up, but we let it go.

399
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:10,002
My husband almost died!

400
00:27:10,085 --> 00:27:11,170
He almost died!

401
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:21,972
I'm sorry, but may I see your phone?

402
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:34,526
<i>Hello.</i>

403
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:38,322
<i>I'm Kang Ji-won, the person involved</i>
<i>in the scandal at U&K.</i>

404
00:27:39,198 --> 00:27:42,576
<i>I'm trembling, so I'll put it simply.</i>

405
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:46,538
<i>First, the triangle relationship</i>
<i>is completely false.</i>

406
00:27:46,622 --> 00:27:50,709
<i>It's true that the man I was</i>
<i>about to marry fell for my friend.</i>

407
00:27:50,793 --> 00:27:54,171
<i>However, my friend didn't reciprocate</i>
<i>his feelings.</i>

408
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:56,840
<i>She's such an attractive woman,</i>

409
00:27:56,924 --> 00:27:59,927
<i>so I'm trying to accept it as unavoidable.</i>

410
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:04,932
<i>And the incident at Jomart</i>
<i>was a typical case</i>

411
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:07,810
<i>where problematic consumers</i>
<i>schemed to get freebies.</i>

412
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:10,521
<i>They ate it</i>
<i>without checking the ingredients.</i>

413
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:13,482
<i>It can't happen to those</i>
<i>with serious allergies.</i>

414
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:15,818
<i>My friend is innocent.</i>

415
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:17,945
"My friend is innocent."

416
00:28:18,695 --> 00:28:21,782
<i>It pains me that she's blamed.</i>

417
00:28:21,865 --> 00:28:23,117
KANG JI-WON

418
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,918
No one in their right mind
would write such a thing!

419
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,964
I didn't write this.

420
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:39,258
But it is my handwriting.

421
00:28:40,634 --> 00:28:41,718
I know someone

422
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:45,139
who has the same handwriting as me.

423
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,145
Jeong Su-min, stop!

424
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:04,658
Ji-won.

425
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:07,327
I won't let it go this time.

426
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:09,621
You fix what you did.

427
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,834
Wait, Ji-won.

428
00:29:22,676 --> 00:29:23,719
Ji-won...

429
00:29:23,802 --> 00:29:25,888
What are you doing? Don't do it.

430
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:29,183
Don't forget that I know as much

431
00:29:30,476 --> 00:29:32,561
about you as you know about me.

00:29:58,837 --> 00:30:00,839
Why is someone else's name here?

434
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:03,342
As a U&K employee,

435
00:30:03,425 --> 00:30:05,969
I am very sorry about this incident.

436
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:10,349
However, you deserve an apology
from the right person.

437
00:30:14,603 --> 00:30:16,230
Honey.

438
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:17,940
She's that woman.

439
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,610
The one who was
with the guy named Mr. Park.

440
00:30:26,907 --> 00:30:28,158
So it was a frame-up?

441
00:30:28,992 --> 00:30:32,204
So she stole her man
and used her to defend herself.

442
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:34,790
Because no one would believe her.

443
00:30:48,804 --> 00:30:50,430
I'm very sorry.

444
00:30:51,765 --> 00:30:53,392
The situation...

445
00:30:53,475 --> 00:30:56,270
It was moving in such a bad direction,

446
00:30:56,353 --> 00:30:59,356
so I needed an excuse,
but I crossed the line.

447
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:02,526
I wasn't trying to insult you two.

448
00:31:03,193 --> 00:31:06,446
You must be very offended,
but I didn't think that far.

449
00:31:07,072 --> 00:31:09,825
It's all my fault. I was wrong. I'm sorry.

450
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,619
Miss.

451
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:14,037
I'm sorry.

452
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,708
-I apologize.
-I'm fine.

453
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,004
I felt like I was going insane!

454
00:31:24,923 --> 00:31:26,925
I know I shouldn't have.

455
00:31:29,845 --> 00:31:30,887
But...

456
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:34,266
I'm so emotional these days.

457
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:37,686
I know I'm a terrible person.

458
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:39,229
But I thought

459
00:31:41,189 --> 00:31:46,194
I might end up doing something I'd regret.
That's why I did it.

460
00:31:54,953 --> 00:31:55,912
Ji-won.

461
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:58,665
I'm really sorry.

462
00:32:02,544 --> 00:32:05,589
Can you please forgive me?

463
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:10,427
I...

464
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,014
can't live without you right now.

465
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:25,275
Ji-won.

466
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,075
I'm pregnant.

467
00:32:48,507 --> 00:32:50,509
Pregnant...

468
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:04,564
Let's get this straight.

469
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:07,108
Park Min-hwan...

470
00:33:08,193 --> 00:33:09,319
Park Min-hwan...

471
00:33:10,862 --> 00:33:11,863
is me.

472
00:33:13,114 --> 00:33:14,908
And Kang Ji-won...

473
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:17,619
is crazy.

474
00:33:19,662 --> 00:33:21,080
And Jeong Su-min...

475
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,333
has lost it.

476
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:33,551

Hey, do I look like a man who cheated
his fiancé and got another girl pregnant?

482
00:33:59,244 --> 00:34:00,245
Do I?

483
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:11,839
God, I think I got hit by a car.

484
00:34:31,776 --> 00:34:33,194
What's going on?

00:34:33,278 --> 00:34:34,904
What is this? Hey!

Who are you punks?
What do you think you're doing?

00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,291
Punks?

488
00:34:46,874 --> 00:34:48,418
I guess I do look young.

489
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:50,503
Yeah, you look quite young.

490
00:34:50,587 --> 00:34:52,297
Right? I look young.

491
00:34:53,047 --> 00:34:54,924

00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:57,385
This is the Republic of Korea! What the--

493
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:03,850
I'm just worried something bad
will happen to you, sirs!

494
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,438
By chance, where are you from?

495
00:35:08,521 --> 00:35:11,190
Are you from Snake Loans?

496
00:35:13,192 --> 00:35:16,112
Or is it Viper Financial?

497
00:35:16,195 --> 00:35:17,280
Where?

498
00:35:17,363 --> 00:35:18,948
Goodness.

499
00:35:19,616 --> 00:35:21,367
You borrowed from Snake too?

500
00:35:22,535 --> 00:35:26,080
They don't hit people.
I hear they like to cut, right?

501
00:35:26,164 --> 00:35:27,999
-Cut?
-Yeah. They do.

502
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,501
-Here.
-Yeah.

503
00:35:31,377 --> 00:35:32,462
-Here?
-Yeah.

504
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:40,219
Hey! I'll pay you back! I will!

505
00:35:40,303 --> 00:35:42,555
-What?
-Go easy.

506
00:35:44,182 --> 00:35:47,268
You said you had no money.
You suddenly got some?

507
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:48,936
I don't have money.

508
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,313
But my parents do.

509
00:35:50,396 --> 00:35:53,483
As soon as I get married,
they'll get me a house!

510
00:35:53,566 --> 00:35:56,778
I'll pay you back with that. Yes!

511
00:35:56,861 --> 00:36:00,365
They always have money
when their lives are on the line.

512
00:36:00,448 --> 00:36:01,949
When's the wedding?

513
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:03,284
Right away!

514
00:36:03,368 --> 00:36:04,786
The woman I'll marry...

515
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:09,666
I have a pregnant woman.
Yeah, I impregnated her.

516
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:13,503
I'll get it, and I'll pay you back.

517
00:36:32,772 --> 00:36:34,065

518
00:36:34,148 --> 00:36:35,942
-Hello, Ji-hyuk.
-It's cold.

519
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:38,486
You should've waited at the store.

520
00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:41,489
I'm sorry I asked you to do this.

521
00:36:41,572 --> 00:36:43,991
You can ask us to do anything.

522
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:47,787
Isn't that the guy we took the chicken to?

523
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,498
What's going on? He's got a lot of debt.

524
00:36:55,962 --> 00:36:58,131
Ji-hyuk, we haven't finished yet.

525
00:36:58,214 --> 00:36:59,716
We'll go finish now.

526
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:01,092
We'll be right back.

527
00:37:01,175 --> 00:37:05,096
It's so cold.

528
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:13,813
Kang Ji-won will become happy.

529
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:18,818
She'll be happy.

530
00:37:30,621 --> 00:37:31,581
Mom.

531
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:35,543
You said you'd get me a house
if I got married.

532
00:37:36,294 --> 00:37:38,796
Can you do that for me now?

533
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,591
All you got me was red long johns.

534
00:37:41,674 --> 00:37:43,593
Why would I get you a house?

535
00:37:43,676 --> 00:37:45,803
Maybe if you give me a grandchild.

536
00:37:46,304 --> 00:37:49,223
I'm not kidding around, Mom!

537
00:37:50,141 --> 00:37:52,101
It's urgent for me.

538
00:37:52,185 --> 00:37:53,770
Do you trust me?

539
00:37:53,853 --> 00:37:55,646
Don't you love me?

540
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:59,275
I'm your son! Park Min-hwan.
Your one and only son.

541
00:38:03,404 --> 00:38:06,532
Where the heck are you going?

542
00:38:06,616 --> 00:38:08,284
Damn it!

543
00:38:12,955 --> 00:38:14,832
My God! What the heck?

544
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:20,505
Hey, what are you doing there?

545
00:38:22,673 --> 00:38:23,633
Hey.

546
00:38:25,176 --> 00:38:27,720
Hey, Su-min?

547
00:38:28,763 --> 00:38:30,515
What are you doing?

548
00:38:32,308 --> 00:38:36,229
You said I was just a pretty face,
so why are you here?

549
00:38:39,232 --> 00:38:43,277
Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant?

550
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:47,240
Does that change anything?

551
00:38:53,788 --> 00:38:58,084
Right. I was a bit harsh, wasn't I?

552
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:03,214
I didn't really mean that, but I...

553
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:07,635
You know how guys are, right?

554
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:12,431
So it does changes things.

555
00:39:14,725 --> 00:39:16,561
Not with Ji-won though.

556
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:20,606
She won't even talk to me.
Even though I'm pregnant.

557
00:39:21,148 --> 00:39:22,191
Dummy.

558
00:39:22,275 --> 00:39:24,735
You seem smart,

559
00:39:25,278 --> 00:39:27,154
but you're strangely sloppy.

560
00:39:27,822 --> 00:39:30,616
That's my baby. Of course, that hurts her.

561
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,535
She likes me so much.

562
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:36,080
Really?

563
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:39,584
I'm pregnant.

564
00:39:43,754 --> 00:39:45,131
Of course.

565
00:39:45,214 --> 00:39:47,967
She's spiteful,
so she doesn't let it show,

566
00:39:48,676 --> 00:39:50,177
but you know it too.

567
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:52,305
She's fragile inside.

568
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:56,267
I'm sure she's hurt and upset
ever since she learned about us.

569
00:39:56,851 --> 00:39:58,311
And now you're pregnant.

570
00:39:58,895 --> 00:40:00,771
She's probably a mess.

571
00:40:03,691 --> 00:40:04,942
You think so?

572
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,823
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

573
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:15,494
Wow, the gods have helped.

574
00:40:15,578 --> 00:40:19,290
Ms. Kang, what if you knew nothing
and actually got married?

575
00:40:19,373 --> 00:40:20,791
Throw that trash away.

576
00:40:21,459 --> 00:40:24,420
It's funny, I think the trash
hates the trashcan.

577
00:40:25,171 --> 00:40:28,090
Did you see Mr. Park's face
when she said it?

578
00:40:30,384 --> 00:40:33,804
<i>Pregnant? Su-min,</i>
<i>what are you trying to pull?</i>

579
00:40:33,888 --> 00:40:36,390
<i>I'm sure Park Min-hwan has azoospermia.</i>

580
00:40:36,474 --> 00:40:37,892
How's the food?

581
00:40:37,975 --> 00:40:39,769
It's so good.

582
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:41,646
Need anything else?

583
00:40:42,605 --> 00:40:44,482
No, this is already so great.

584
00:40:44,565 --> 00:40:45,566
Thanks.

585
00:40:46,233 --> 00:40:47,526
That's good.

586
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,945
Have a good time.

587
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:52,907
<i>Still...</i>

588
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:58,371
I thought Ji-won would take my side
in the end.

589
00:41:00,456 --> 00:41:01,624
It's understandable

590
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:05,503
that she was mad at me
and ignored my texts.

591
00:41:07,588 --> 00:41:11,342
But if she saw people treating me harshly,

592
00:41:12,843 --> 00:41:15,262
I thought she would take my side.

593
00:41:18,015 --> 00:41:20,101
She always did.

594
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:22,019
Even if it was strange.

595
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,022
Even if it was wrong.

596
00:41:25,106 --> 00:41:26,649
Even if she was mad.

597
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,696
Still, in the end,

598
00:41:32,321 --> 00:41:34,782
she always forgave me and understood.

599
00:41:38,411 --> 00:41:39,662
I think...

600
00:41:40,788 --> 00:41:43,290
I have to be that person to you now.

601
00:41:45,543 --> 00:41:47,586
Break away from her now.

602
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,338
It's not like you're dating.

603
00:41:51,549 --> 00:41:53,134
Let's let her go.

604
00:41:55,011 --> 00:41:56,721
Let's only think about us.

605
00:41:58,681 --> 00:41:59,724
Us?

606
00:42:08,315 --> 00:42:09,316
Shall we...

607
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:12,903
get married?

608
00:42:18,576 --> 00:42:20,411
I said terrible things to you,

609
00:42:21,454 --> 00:42:23,164
trying not to like you.

610
00:42:25,124 --> 00:42:26,834
But I think you're the one.

611
00:42:33,632 --> 00:42:35,009
Shall we...

612
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,220
Shall we get married?

613
00:42:39,221 --> 00:42:40,806
We'll be...

614
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:45,603
But we'll be
a better family tomorrow than we are now.

615
00:42:47,188 --> 00:42:48,397
I promise.

616
00:42:51,484 --> 00:42:53,861
...a better family tomorrow
than we are now.

617
00:42:56,197 --> 00:42:57,490
I promise.

618
00:43:04,038 --> 00:43:05,623
A family?

619
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:08,000
Yes.

620
00:43:19,637 --> 00:43:22,765
INCIDENT REPORT,
NOTICE OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION

621
00:43:22,848 --> 00:43:25,893
So the problem wasn't Kang Ji-won

622
00:43:25,976 --> 00:43:28,104
but her fiancé and friend?

623
00:43:28,187 --> 00:43:29,063
Yes, sir.

624
00:43:30,231 --> 00:43:32,566
But the employee is pregnant,

625
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:35,194
so the customers decided to let it go.

626
00:43:35,694 --> 00:43:37,696
HR took action on the two employees.

627
00:43:38,405 --> 00:43:42,535
And Ms. Kang Ji-won was right
about the meal kit case as well.

628
00:43:42,618 --> 00:43:45,579
It's common for managers
to steal proposals.

629
00:43:47,414 --> 00:43:49,667
So Kang Ji-won's the victim.

630
00:43:50,334 --> 00:43:51,752
I need to meet her.

631
00:44:09,478 --> 00:44:10,312
Let's go.

632
00:44:17,153 --> 00:44:21,782
I heard you went through a lot recently.

633
00:44:22,616 --> 00:44:26,787
I've decided to face the obstacles
that are bound to happen.

634
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:33,127
I guess there are
many difficult people around you.

635
00:44:36,255 --> 00:44:38,090
There aren't that many,

636
00:44:38,716 --> 00:44:41,635
but there are some tough ones.

637
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:46,724
Am I one of them?

638
00:44:49,727 --> 00:44:51,395
I think so.

639
00:44:55,524 --> 00:44:58,986
So what are you going to do from now on?

640
00:45:04,533 --> 00:45:06,869
-Right now?
-Yes, go quickly.

641
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:14,668
-Grandfather!
-My goodness.

642
00:45:15,336 --> 00:45:17,338
You're scaring my guest.

643
00:45:24,178 --> 00:45:26,680
The chairman didn't say much.

644
00:45:26,764 --> 00:45:28,724
So you don't have to worry.

645
00:45:28,807 --> 00:45:31,560
I'll make sure this won't happen again.
I'm sorry.

646
00:45:32,478 --> 00:45:34,188
Why would you be sorry?

647
00:45:36,023 --> 00:45:39,693
Anyway, it's amazing
that I got to see him in person.

648
00:45:40,444 --> 00:45:42,988
And he wasn't as difficult as I'd thought.

649
00:45:44,073 --> 00:45:45,574
Yes, he is.

650
00:45:47,201 --> 00:45:49,578
I told him the truth.

651
00:45:49,662 --> 00:45:52,081
That when my boss stole my proposal,

652
00:45:52,164 --> 00:45:54,750
maybe I should've just let it slide,

653
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:56,377
but I don't regret it now.

654
00:45:58,254 --> 00:46:00,005
That's an answer he'd like.

655
00:46:03,425 --> 00:46:07,221
And he brought up my private life first.

656
00:46:07,888 --> 00:46:12,184
He said I shouldn't blame my foot
for stepping on crap.

657
00:46:19,525 --> 00:46:21,360
SECOND HAND MARKET

658
00:46:21,443 --> 00:46:24,363
<i>Buying a positive pregnancy test</i>
<i>and sonogram photo.</i>

659
00:46:26,657 --> 00:46:27,825
POSTED

660
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,537
Family.

661
00:46:35,124 --> 00:46:36,375
A new start.

662
00:46:38,127 --> 00:46:40,921
<i>Park Min-hwan and Jeong Su-min</i>
<i>will marry soon.</i>

663
00:46:41,005 --> 00:46:42,673
You can start over now.

664
00:46:43,424 --> 00:46:44,383
Right.

665
00:46:45,009 --> 00:46:45,926
Well...

666
00:46:47,136 --> 00:46:50,389
I'll feel relieved
once they actually decide to.

667
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,435
They'll do it.

668
00:46:54,518 --> 00:46:57,354
There's no other way for him to get money.

669
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:00,399
What do you mean?

670
00:47:00,983 --> 00:47:03,527
I checked his financial situation.

671
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:06,405
His stock credit is bad,
and he took out loans.

672
00:47:07,031 --> 00:47:08,782
He's under pressure to pay.

673
00:47:10,242 --> 00:47:12,202
He already received his severance pay.

674
00:47:12,286 --> 00:47:16,498
And he was demoted due to the recent
incident, so his salary was cut.

675
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:20,544
How did you check all that?

676
00:47:21,712 --> 00:47:23,005
Remember what I said?

677
00:47:23,922 --> 00:47:25,924
I used to only do what was right.

678
00:47:27,384 --> 00:47:28,635
It's not true.

679
00:47:30,262 --> 00:47:31,847
My grandfather knew

680
00:47:33,057 --> 00:47:34,224
that I just...

681
00:47:35,768 --> 00:47:37,227
didn't want anything.

682
00:47:42,649 --> 00:47:43,859
Want to shoot a gun?

683
00:47:49,406 --> 00:47:51,658
<i>I had a lot of things to do.</i>

684
00:47:52,701 --> 00:47:54,953
<i>And I'd come here to pull the trigger.</i>

685
00:47:56,205 --> 00:47:58,290
<i>Because I could do things I hated</i>

686
00:47:58,374 --> 00:47:59,666
<i>after thinking,</i>

687
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:03,087
<i>"The bullet's already shot.</i>
<i>It can't be undone."</i>

688
00:48:04,129 --> 00:48:05,589
<i>"Let's just do it."</i>

689
00:48:14,556 --> 00:48:18,060
<i>But it's so hard to resist</i>
<i>what I want right now.</i>

690
00:48:32,116 --> 00:48:34,493
There are many things I can do.

691
00:48:35,702 --> 00:48:37,121
What's changed

692
00:48:37,621 --> 00:48:40,874
is that now I'm doing something
that can help you too.

693
00:48:44,128 --> 00:48:46,088
Hold on tight and lean on me.

694
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,172
You're amazing!

695
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:29,883
You fix a meal so easily.

696
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:31,802
I have no talent for cooking.

697
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,137
But this package is so easy.

698
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,807
You don't eat at home, do you?

699
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,309
No, I always order in since I live alone.

700
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:42,270
Don't do that. Think of your health.

701
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:46,983
I messed up my stomach once,
so I try my best to eat what I cook.

702
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:52,489
It tastes so good.

703
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,616
You're perfect.

704
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,662
Will you marry me?

705
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,997
I'll never get married.

706
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,667
No, you have to.

707
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:05,961
Even if that's true,

708
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:09,214
an ex being happy with another woman
is so annoying.

709
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,425
So you have to be happy first.

710
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,095
What's your type? A handsome face? Body?

711
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,019
I'll get it.

712
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,149
It's Baek Eun-ho.

713
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,068
No, don't answer it. I'll call back.

714
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,445
Just take it.

715
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:35,115
A call from a handsome man on Christmas
should be answered.

716
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,619
Hey, Eun-ho.

717
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,498
What?

718
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,607
-Hey.
-Hey.

719
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,276
-Were you waiting long?
-No.

720
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,446
-Hello.
-Hello.

721
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:17,199
You drive so carefully.

722
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,075
Well...

723
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,453
I don't drive often, so...

724
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,538
This is my first time since then.

725
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,958
-Since when?
-He drove us home

726
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:30,754
after my brother passed out drunk
at his restaurant.

727
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:34,049
I was so flustered, but he saved me.

728
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,344
Mr. Yu got drunk and passed out?

729
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,097
At Eun-ho's restaurant at that?

730
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:45,435
But if Kang Ji-won is
the one wrong sentence in it...

731
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,647
How would you feel?

732
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,777
I know, right? He comes often.

733
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,572
Because he's got high standards for food.

734
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,535
So, what do you want to do?

735
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,702
Where shall we go?

736
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,874
You're not coming?

737
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,376
Come on.

738
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,461
It's Christmas! I have plans.

739
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,757
Go ahead. Have fun!

740
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:18,552
Okay.

741
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,695
It's Christmas, and I have no plans!

742
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,619
They looked so good together.

743
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:53,670
Oh, my.

744
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:56,965
You're eating ice cream?
You look human for a change.

745
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,383
Give me some.

746
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,470
What?

747
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,223
You told me to help them get closer.

748
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:06,975
I did such a great job.

749
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,560
So why do you look upset?

750
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:10,979
Does he seem decent?

751
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,898
Yes.

752
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:18,111
He may be kind of boring,

753
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:21,031
but he's comfortable.
He's handsome and stable.

754
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,201
Ms. Kang acts strong, but she has anxiety.

755
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,958
And most importantly,
there's love pouring from his eyes.

756
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:40,508
What? Why? Why do your actions
not match your words?

757
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:43,345
You said nothing was going on with her.

758
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:46,806
You said to set her up with a decent guy!

759
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,239
Eat it like this?

760
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:19,422
I mean, she should meet a decent guy soon.

761
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:22,842
I think she dreams
of spending Christmas with family at home.

762
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:27,681
Twinkling lights and gifts under the tree.

763
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,766
A cake and a music box.

764
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,894
Maybe some Santa hats and stockings.

765
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:04,342
You must be cold.
Want something warm to drink?

766
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,137
I'll be right back.

767
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:31,244
<i>Will I be able to live like this</i>
<i>if they get married?</i>

768
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:59,314
The restaurant is busy on Christmas night,
so I have to go.

769
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:00,440
Sorry.

770
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,025
Don't be sorry.

771
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,694
Thanks for spending time with me.

772
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,113
No.

773
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,866
I really enjoyed today.

774
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:15,205
I'm glad if it cheered you up a little,

775
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,873
and next time...

776
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:18,041
Eun-ho.

777
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,297
You're a great friend.

778
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:39,729
I'm so happy I met you again.

779
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,273
You shouldn't be like that.

780
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,567
<i>That I got to...</i>

781
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,403
I never want to speak to you again.

782
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,448
<i>...see the real you.</i>

783
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,699
I...

784
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,494
had a crush on you!

785
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,502
Thank you.

786
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:11,761
I'll be a great friend to you too.

787
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,320
Yeah.

788
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:31,865
Thanks.

789
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,950
My first love.

790
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,209
Here.

791
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,536
The wrong sentence in your novel

792
00:58:19,495 --> 00:58:20,830
must not be me.

793
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,565
Mr. Yu?

794
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,575
What are you doing out here?

795
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,953
I came out for some air.

796
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,913
I was about to go in.

797
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,004
It seems you got a lot of air.

798
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,132
No, well...

799
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:18,930
I...

800
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,820
Mr. Yu.

801
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:40,285
I have something to tell you.

802
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,205
Can you come to my place?

803
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,957
Or shall I go to your place?

804
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,921
What were you going to do
if I didn't ask to talk?

805
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,760
I would've asked you to.

806
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:49,145
To be honest with you,
I went on a date with Eun-ho today.

807
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,438
My first love.

808
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:58,279
Also, he told me he liked me.

809
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,492
I heard.

810
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,537
I stood there for a while.

811
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:15,129
Why did you turn him down? He seems nice.

812
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,052
He is a nice guy.

813
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:22,720
That's why I liked him.

814
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,558
But...

815
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:32,063
I don't feel the same way.

816
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:46,869
Do you remember when I asked you
to let me be honest with you?

817
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,541
Just let me be honest with you
from time to time.

818
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:58,089
I've never once
been honest about my feelings.

819
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,431
I want to be honest now.

820
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:14,522
When I was with Eun-ho,

821
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,317
I kept thinking about someone else.

822
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:23,281
Someone I thought I knew everything about,

823
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,283
but I didn't at all.

824
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:29,912
I'm sure there's more
I don't know about him.

825
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:33,124
But...

826
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,297
he's someone only I can know.

827
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,592
And...

828
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,097
he knows me the best.

829
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000

838
