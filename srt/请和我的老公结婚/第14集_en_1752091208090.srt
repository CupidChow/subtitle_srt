EPISODE 14

2
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,920
谢谢
Thank you.

3
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,720
地板很滑，小心
The floor's slippery. Careful.

4
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,630
没关系，你不用忙
It's fine. You don't have to.

5
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,800
我就叫你别动了
I told you not to move!

6
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,440
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

7
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,350
没有关系
It's fine.

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,520
医生们只是爱担心才帮我用这些东西，其实我根本不需要
The doctors were just worried. I don't need all that.

9
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,110
才不是，医生们学问好才会这么要求
The smart doctors know what they're doing. Listen to them.

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,990
往后你都不要自作主张，知道吗？
Don't do anything on your own from now on, okay?

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,330
真不听话
You don't listen.

12
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,630
肚子饿吗？
Are you hungry?

13
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,930
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

14
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,550
就这样一下子吧
Let's just stay like this.

15
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,740
当我以为走到尽头的时候，我非常后悔
When I thought it was the end, I regretted it so much.

16
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,950
即使给了我机会，我却还是无法坦诚
I was given another chance but wasn't honest again.

17
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,210
你不会死
You won't die.

18
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,420
对不起，我没能即早相信你
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

19
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,180
我更抱歉
No, I'm sorry.

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,570
吴宥拉不好对付
Yu-ra isn't an easy opponent.

21
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,360
在我得知她的真面目超乎想象之后
Even after I saw her unimaginable true colors,

22
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,990
还是花了超过三年的时间，才有办法和她断绝关系
it took over three years to end it with her.

23
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,790
某个人超乎想象…
Someone being beyond your imagination...

24
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,790
我懂那是什么意思
I know what you mean.

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,920
跟一个人相处久了
When you spend a long time with someone,

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,260
就会看不清那个人
it's hard to see that person properly.

27
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,130
心想不可能会是那样
You try not to believe it.

28
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,310
都要等到看到结局才会明白
You only realize it after you see the end.

29
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,390
你的前未婚妻要杀了我
Your ex-fiancée is trying to kill me,

30
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,190
等我死了，朴敏焕和郑秀敏就可以拿到钱
and Min-hwan and Su-min get paid if I die.

31
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,480
他们携手合作了
They joined forces.

32
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,490
杨科长的丈夫有外遇
Ms. Yang's husband's having an affair.

33
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,540
我的命运好像落到杨科长身上了
I think my fate moved to Ms. Yang.

34
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,130
事情不是到郑秀敏和朴敏焕结婚，就结束了
It's not over with their marriage.

35
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,050
在那之后还有什么，我得找出答案
There's something more. I have to find that out.

36
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,050
才能保护杨科长
To protect Ms. Yang.

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,430
你陪在我身边就好
Just stay by my side.

38
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,140
目的地纪录
RECENT DESTINATIONS

39
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,530
等等我
Wait for me.

40
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,200
不要这样啦
Stop it!

41
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,500
禁忌之爱咖啡厅，第二次真正最后的爱餐厅
CAFE FORBIDDEN LOVE DRIVE-IN THEATER

42
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,170
杨平汽车电影院，孤单旅馆
CAFE LOVE AFFAIR HOTEL LONELY

43
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,850
警方认为是醉汉造成的事故，正在追查中
The police think a drunk driver caused the accident.

44
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,350
他们永远逮不到人
They'll never catch her.

45
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,810
虽然派人跟踪了吴宥拉，朴敏焕和郑秀敏
We put someone on Yu-ra, Min-hwan, and Su-min.

46
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,610
如你所见，找不到任何把柄
But we haven't caught anything yet.

47
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,200
由于是在事故后才派人跟踪，查不出什么东西
We put people on them after the accident, so there's no lead.

48
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,120
要是你事前已经知道些什么，那你应该要先跟我商量啊
If you knew in advance, you should've discussed it with me first.

49
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,880
我当时无法确定你完全是我的人
I wasn't sure that you were on my side.

50
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,850
对不起，哥
I'm sorry, Seok-jun.

51
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,860
我没有那么生气，需要你这样
Don't. I'm not that angry.

52
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,700
现在唯一的办法，就是找到郑万植和裴熙淑
The only way is to find Jeong Man-sik and Bae Hui-suk.

53
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,580
他们肯定是往仁川那边去了
They must be heading for Incheon.

54
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,710
吴宥拉肯定也在找他们
And Oh Yu-ra must be looking for them.

55
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,250
应该是
I'm sure.

56
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,090
问题就在于谁先找到
It's a matter of who's faster.

57
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:11,050
不过你的手要戴着这个到什么时候？
By the way, how long do you have to wear the sling?

58
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,640
直到姜智媛要我不要戴为止
Until Ji-won tells me to stop wearing it.

59
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
其实可以拿下来了
Honestly, I can take it off now.

60
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,520
不过她答应我，在我戴着的期间都会照顾我
But she promised to take care of me while I had it on.

61
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,210
志赫
Ji-hyuk.

62
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,420
你还有没有想起以前的车祸，当天发生什么事？
Do you remember anything more from the accident?

63
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,880
没有耶
Not really.

64
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,430
我就是去了你的葬礼
I went to the memorial hall to see you.

65
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,430
车子在那里故障了
The car broke down there.

66
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,890
就只有那样？
Is that all?

67
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,810
也许不是，但我现在什么也想不起来
Maybe not, but I can't think of anything right now.

68
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,940
-智媛 -嗯？
-Ji-won? -Yeah?

69
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,410
-蛋卷 -好
-Eggs. -Okay.

70
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,120
还要什么？
What else?

71
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,870
那我走了，好好休息，明天见
I should go. I'll see you tomorrow.

72
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,170
今天也谢谢你
Thanks for today.

73
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,840
怎么了？
What's wrong?

74
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,800
智媛
Ji-won.

75
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,220
又在痛了吗？
Does it hurt again?

76
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,650
对不起
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,400
我能想到的就只有这个
It's the only thing I could think of.

78
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,820
搞什么啦？真是的
I can't believe you.

79
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:02,950
今天…
Can you...

80
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,000
可不可以睡在这里？
stay the night?

81
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,420
晚安
Good night.

82
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,380
我来关灯
I'll get the light.

83
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,940
部长，你在做什么？
Mr. Yu, what are you doing?

84
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,360
我明白你的意思，我抱着你睡就好
I understand what you mean, so I'll just hold you.

85
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,240
还会痛，真的
It still hurts. I swear.

86
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,500
永远陪在我身边
Always be by my side.

87
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,300
不管你有没有在做什么
No matter what you do,

88
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,260
陪在我身边
do it by my side.

89
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,060
这样就好了
That's all I need.

90
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,950
你起来啦？我才刚要去叫醒你
Are you up? I was going to wake you.

91
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,490
你要不要吃草莓？这真的很好吃，这是我吃过最好吃的…
Do you want strawberries? It's so good. It's the yummiest I've had...

92
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,880
怎么了？你做了什么梦吗？
What? Did you have a nightmare?

93
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,970
怎么？你的手不痛吗？已经好了吗？
Wait. Does your arm not hurt? Is it okay now?

94
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,310
会痛
It hurts.

95
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,520
不是啊，你刚才都好好的…
No, you were just...

96
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,980
哇哦，你现在还会说谎啦
Wow. You know how to lie now.

97
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,820
是真的
It's true.

98
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,450
你做了什么梦？
What did you dream about?

99
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,830
秘密
It's a secret.

100
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,000
虽然我们都是代理，不过我是科长职务代理
I know we're both assistant managers, but I'm acting manager,

101
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,010
所以我身为管理者必须说句话
so I have to say this.

102
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:06,640
你动不动就请假，一副你是业主家的人一样
You take a day off too often, as if you're part of the owner's family.

103
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,760
我家里有事
I had some issues at home.

104
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,520
你家有事？这里其他人没有家吗？
You did? Is there anyone here who doesn't have a home?

105
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,850
其他人都没有家吗？
Is there anyone here who doesn't have issues at home?

106
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,860
唉，偏偏要在出事的时候，做出人事决定
Darn it. Why did the personnel decision have to be made now?

107
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,900
这个讨厌鬼真是运气好
That jerk is just so lucky.

108
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,450
事情已经堆积如山，比天还高…
There's so much work piling up around us...

109
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,870
总之就是这样
Unbelievable.

110
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,330
要我帮忙吗？
Shall I help?

111
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,250
-杨科长 -杨科长
-Ms. Yang! -Ms. Yang!

112
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,960
你可以来工作吗？
Is it okay to work now?

113
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,720
-你没事吗？-嗯，我没事
-Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm okay.

114
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,190
干嘛？
What?

115
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,150
你在做什么？为何都联络不上你？
What are you doing? Why couldn't I reach you?

116
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,230
姜智媛今天来上班了，一副什么事都没有的样子
Kang Ji-won came to work as if nothing happened.

117
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,490
现在到底是怎么回事？
What the hell is going on?

118
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,490
刘志赫出院了，所以她就去上班了吧
Ji-hyuk's been discharged. That must be why.

119
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,280
我叫你装作什么事没发生过的样子
I told you to act like nothing happened.

120
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,410
你想她会怎么样？
What do you think she'll do?

121
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,290
想打架就冲过去揪住对方的头发，大吼大叫很容易
It's easy to pull her hair and yell if you want to fight.

122
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,750
但是要懂得忍耐才不会活得像个乞丐
Be patient if you don't want to live like a bum.

123
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,090
你等会要不要来健身房？
Will you come to the gym later?

124
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,760
边运动边谈谈，你就会好多了
You'll feel better after we talk while working out.

125
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,680
这丫头讲话还真没礼貌
This brat is so rude.

126
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,980
我不该跟这种素质低的人牵扯在一起
I shouldn't get involved with such low-standard people,

127
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,190
可是我不亲自出面，事情都办不成
but nothing gets done if I don't do it myself.

128
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:46,490
找到郑万植和裴熙淑了，他们说太害怕了，所以躲起来
We found Man-sik and Hui-suk. They were scared, so they tried to hide.

129
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,370
您好，我是郑万植
Hello, it's Jeong Man-sik.

130
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,410
我找你们找得好辛苦
It was hard to find you.

131
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,250
你们为什么要躲起来？我们在同一艘船上啊
Why did you hide? We're in the same boat.

132
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,170
不是啦，我不是不相信您
No, it's not because we couldn't trust you.

133
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,340
是我女儿不能信任
We can't trust my daughter.

134
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,380
从现在起，相信我就好
Just trust me now.

135
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,260
我不是个会背弃家人的人
I never abandon my family.

136
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,140
你们要不要到中国去一阵子？
How about going to China for a while?

137
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,940
上海很美
Shanghai is beautiful.

138
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,730
你们还可以到附近的杭州和苏州，去玩玩水
You can also have some fun in the water in Hangzhou and Suzhou.

139
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,750
我真的很悲哀吧？
Aren't I pathetic?

140
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,340
到了这个年纪，觉得不安焦虑的时候
At this age, when I feel anxious,

141
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,720
却无处可去，到公司来上班
I have nowhere to go but work.

142
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,260
那是因为你在公司有朋友
Because you have friends here.

143
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,930
我很担心你，正打算要去看你
I was worried and going to go see you anyway.

144
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,520
不用了，我今天晚上要冲进去
No, I'm barging in tonight.

145
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,900
我报警了，打算提告通奸罪
I reported it to the police for adultery.

146
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,490
哦，这时候通奸罪还没废止
Right. This was before the law was abolished.

147
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,570
只要我去住院
Whenever I was admitted to the hospital,

148
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,410
那家伙就会把她带回家
he brought her home.

149
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,500
所以我今天跟他说我要去住院
So I told him I was being admitted today.

150
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,920
那两个疯子
His car dashcam

151
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,050
在车上做的肮脏事，都被行车纪录器给录下来了
caught them doing dirty things in the car.

152
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,720
可是也许是故障了，没有影像
But there's no video. I think it's broken.

153
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,260
警方说只有声音，证据不足
And the police said audio wasn't enough proof.

154
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,060
行车纪录器没有影像？
The dashcam video's not working?

155
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:41,930
很离谱吧？
Ridiculous, right?

156
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,150
我本来真的不想做到这种程度的
I really didn't want to go this far,

157
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,490
不过我还是铁了心，今天出门时把门锁弄坏了
but I made up my mind and broke the door lock on my way out.

158
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,370
杨科长
Ms. Yang.

159
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,830
我可以跟你一起去吗？
Can I come with you?

160
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,590
是那个人吗？
Is that her?

161
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,880
对
Yes.

162
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,260
好，你先生已经进去30分钟了
Okay, your husband went in 30 minutes ago.

163
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,720
我们十分钟后进去
Let's go in 10 minutes.

164
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,290
天啊，你们是什么人？
Who are you people?

165
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,040
什么？怎样？
What? What is it?

166
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,210
这是怎样？
What's going on?

167
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,100
嗯？
What?

168
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,310
喂
Hey.

169
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,480
你这时候怎么会在这里？
Why are you here at this hour?

170
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,230
什么？
What?

171
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:22,160
他说你住院了，所以我就拿小菜过来给他
He said you were in the hospital. I came to give him some side dishes.

172
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,160
看来是我不知分寸
Maybe I was out of line.

173
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,210
因为经常在店里看到他，我就把他当作家人在关心
I see him at the restaurant often, so I considered him family.

174
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,580
喂
Hey.

175
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,340
你怀疑我吗？
Did you suspect me?

176
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,550
因为我在你家的店里上班，你就看不起我吗？
Do you look down on me since I work for your dad?

177
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,140
-你们… -我们怎样？怎样啊？
-You two... -What? What is it?

178
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,270
唉
Whatever.

179
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,770
算了，请你们都出去
Forget it. Just leave, all of you.

180
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,020
你们出去，喂，你也出去
Get out. Hey, you too.

181
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,030
别再说担心我，带那种东西来
Don't bring anything here saying you're worried.

182
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,240
你让我变得很可笑
Wow, you're making a joke of me.

183
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,820
对不起，很抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

184
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,790
请你出去
Get out.

185
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,460
你也走吧，我跟他谈谈
You should go too. I'll talk to him.

186
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,800
你不出去吗？
You're not leaving?

187
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,490
我出去，我会出去
I'm leaving, but before I go...

188
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
搞什么？
What's she doing?

189
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,460
什么？你要做什么？
What? What are you doing?

190
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,660
干嘛？
What?

191
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,900
不要打我
No, don't hit me.

192
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,990
要是你敢动她，我不会放过你
If you touch her, I'll make you pay!

193
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,370
你根本是个疯子
You're crazy!

194
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,500
我全都会向你求偿
I'm going to charge you for this!

195
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,080
正巧你是跟警察一起来的吧？
You came with the cops!

196
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,710
警察先生，这个…
Sir, this...

197
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,510
这样是损坏器物吧？这个女的用高尔夫球杆…
Isn't this property damage? This woman used the golf club...

198
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,800
够了！
Stop it!

199
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,810
你真的是很不要脸
You're so shameless.

200
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,820
你很高兴没有被现场逮到吧？
Are you happy you weren't caught?

201
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,950
不，你在车上做了什么鬼事，我全都知道
No, I know what you did in the car.

202
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,490
什么？你在想我死了的话，保险金会有多少？
What? You wonder how much insurance money you'll get if I die?

203
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,080
你们在那里嗤嗤笑，你们还是人吗？
You laughed about it. Are you two even human?

204
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,460
什么？
What?

205
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,000
妍芝也会坐那辆车
That's the car Yeon-ji rides.

206
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,460
你看到她不会觉得丢脸？
Aren't you ashamed?

207
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,920
你真的是个坏人
You're a terrible person.

208
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,390
你在说什么？
What are you saying?

209
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,560
没有证据就在血口喷人
You don't even have any proof.

210
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,060
喂，你这样…
Hey, that's--

211
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,900
可恶
Why you...

212
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,920
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

213
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,380
不要
No, don't.

214
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,970
你这个混账疯子！
You crazy bastard!

215
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,470
等等，不可以这样
No, wait! You can't do this.

216
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,390
-请拦住她 -请你忍住
-Hold her tight. -Please calm down. Hold her.

217
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,600
请冷静，不可以这样
Calm down. Please. You can't do this.

218
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,610
智媛，你还好吗？
Are you okay, Ji-won?

219
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,580
我明天下班会再过来，在那之前什么都不要做
I'll come back after work tomorrow. Don't do anything until then.

220
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,460
谢谢你，亲爱的
Thanks, Ji-won.

221
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,720
不过这是我的事，我自己会处理
But it's my business, so I'll handle it by myself.

222
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,390
从他的反应看来，他应该不会轻易离婚
I realized earlier. I don't think he'll break up that easily.

223
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,100
我要找律师
So I'll see a lawyer.

224
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,690
不
No...

225
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,900
绝对不可以单独跟他见面
Don't ever meet him alone.

226
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,980
你找我吧，我一起过去
Just call me. I'll come.

227
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,360
你在说什么？怎么说那么奇怪的话？
Why are you saying such strange things?

228
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,030
你有点怪怪的
You're acting weird.

229
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,660
我知道我怪怪的
I know that.

230
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,210
可是刚才要不是我，你差点就要受重伤了
But you would've gotten hurt badly if it weren't for me earlier.

231
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,500
请你再听我的一次
Just do as I say this once.

232
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,050
我来陪她
I'll be by your side.

233
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,680
你不是说，你要找律师吗？
You said you'd meet a lawyer.

234
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,520
你跟我谈就行了
You can talk with me.

235
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,330
杨珠兰科长可以相信李室长
Ms. Yang can trust Mr. Lee.

236
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,460
他不曾说到没有做到
He always does what he says.

237
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,130
命运转移这件事
My fate going to someone else...

238
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,010
似乎不是偶然
I don't think it's a coincidence.

239
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,640
假如癌症是来自于，冷漠丈夫带来的压力
If the stress from her indifferent husband caused her cancer,

240
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:25,190
那么被丈夫给杀害的命运，到底是来自哪里？
where did the fate of being killed by him come from?

241
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,940
坏掉的门锁
The broken door lock.

242
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,530
红色高跟鞋
The red high heels.

243
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,070
还有糖果罐
And the candy tin.

244
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:41,080
也许是丈夫和熟识的人有外遇
Husband having an affair with someone close...

245
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:47,790
或者是那些人渣觊觎保险金？
Or are those scumbags after the insurance money?

246
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,430
等我老婆死了，我就让你过上好日子
I'll take care of you when my wife dies.

247
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,690
我知道我该做什么了
I know what I have to do.

248
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,610
志赫
Ji-hyuk,

249
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,940
我得诱惑朴敏焕
I have to seduce Min-hwan.

250
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:25,210
因为必须要让朴敏焕有外遇，认为自己的老婆死了也无所谓
Because Min-hwan must have an affair and not care if his wife dies.

251
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,760
郑秀敏，智媛的朋友
JEONG SU-MIN, JI-WON'S FRIEND

252
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:52,020
不，要让他认为必须杀了老婆
No, I have to make him think that he needs to kill her.

253
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,880
我知道你肯定会不高兴，但是我必须要这么做
I know it'll upset you, but I have to do it.

254
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:16,880
如果不把被外遇丈夫杀害的命运，转移给郑秀敏
If I don't give the fate of being killed by a cheating husband to Su-min,

255
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,430
杨科长会死
Ms. Yang will die.

256
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,570
我能这么做吗？
Can I do this?

257
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,040
好
Okay.

258
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,000
你想怎么做就怎么做，尽情去做
Do whatever you want.

259
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,800
我会全力帮你
I'll help you.

260
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,050
-金泰亨代理 -是，部长
-Mr. Kim. -Yes, sir?

261
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,550
往后由你来负责快煮料理包的专案
You take over the meal kit project.

262
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,600
什么？可是现在负责人是…
Pardon? But the person in charge is...

263
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,940
你已经进来组上好一阵子了，也该有个自己的专案才会有归属感
You joined the team. You need a project of your own.

264
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,230
你能做到吧？
You can do it, right?

265
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,730
大家多帮忙他
I want you all to help.

266
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,030
部长，这样不对吧
This isn't right, Mr. Yu!

267
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,240
你收了钱，答应跟我分手的时候，没想到会这样吗？
You chose money over me. Did you not see this coming?

268
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,410
你别想全都拥有
You can't have it both ways, Ji-won.

269
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,710
我明白了，我会离职
Fine. I'll find a new job.

270
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:19,090
但是请让我做完，这个快煮料理包专案再走
In return, let me finish the meal kit project.

271
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,720
这是我和杨科长的专案
This project belongs to Ms. Yang and me.

272
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,300
这是公司的专案
It belongs to the company.

273
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,050
部长，你应该要公私分明…
Don't let personal matters--

274
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,930
当初把快煮料理包专案交给你，就已经是公私不分了
I gave you the meal kit project because of my personal feelings.

275
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,060
我不想再见到你，你可以请假
I don't want to see you. Take the day off.

276
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,650
立刻递辞呈会更好
Resigning would be better.

277
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,580
姜智媛收了钱，然后跟他分手？
She took the money and broke up with him?

278
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,430
吴宥拉
OH YU-RA

279
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,980
算了
Forget it.

280
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,700
你怎么自己一个人在做这个？
Why are you doing this alone?

281
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,160
你在说什么？
What?

282
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,500
还不是因为某人，我在公司的地位变得跟狗屎一样
My position turned to crap because of someone.

283
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,840
之前我就说过
As I said before,

284
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,720
假如你没跟郑秀敏在一起，就不会发生这种事了
none of this would've happened if you didn't see Su-min.

285
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,640
开什么玩笑？
Don't be ridiculous.

286
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,390
明明是你要勾搭刘志赫才搞我
You screwed me over to switch to Mr. Yu.

287
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,480
没错
You're right.

288
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,650
没错？
I am?

289
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,150
不过情况有点变了
But the situation has changed.

290
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,080
待会要不要一起喝一杯？
Do you want to have a drink with me later?

291
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,050
八百亿韩元？
Eighty billion won?

292
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,430
会长说做为让我跟部长分手的条件，这样不算多
The chairman said he'd gladly pay me that much if I broke up with him.

293
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,310
当然不全都是现金
Of course, it's not all cash.

294
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,940
还有不动产之类的
There's real estate too.

295
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,770
他把税金全都处理好了
He took care of all the taxes too.

296
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,730
所以我也不清楚我到底有多少
So I don't even know how much I have.

297
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,900
资产管理师？我还有这种专人
An asset manager? I have that too.

298
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,870
部长很生气我背着他收会长的钱
Mr. Yu is pretty angry with me for taking money from the chairman.

299
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,040
我夹在他们俩中间，该怎么办才好？
But what else was I supposed to do?

300
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,590
很合理
It makes sense.

301
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:09,840
就算他钱再怎么多，只是交往，就平白给她八百亿韩元也太奇怪了
No matter how rich he is, it'd be strange to just give her that much.

302
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,470
不过如果是要她拿了钱就滚，以分手为条件给她
But if it's under the condition that she stops seeing him,

303
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,890
这样就说得通了
that makes more sense.

304
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,350
不过还是有点多
Still, that's a lot...

305
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,440
郑秀敏，智媛的朋友
JEONG SU-MIN, JI-WON'S FRIEND

306
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,320
她也太不识相了，干嘛打给我？
Why does she have to call now?

307
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,000
敏焕哥
MIN-HWAN

308
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,090
什么事？
What is it?

309
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,440
结婚的女人可以吃饭时间不在家吗？
Shouldn't you be at home at this hour?

310
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,070
你应该很忙，感谢你抽空过来
I know you're busy. Thanks for making time for me.

311
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,700
我一直很想见你一面
I've wanted to see you.

312
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,330
好久没看到你
When I saw you last time,

313
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,660
让我想起在公司上班的时候
I was reminded of working together.

314
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,050
再见，郑秀敏
Bye, Su-min.

315
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,890
爱过你的我…
I loved you.

316
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,810
今天死了
I die today.

317
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,980
你结婚之后，感觉变得不太一样
You seem different now that you're married.

318
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,240
女人一副永远不会变的样子，结婚之后都会变
Women act like they won't change, but they change after marriage.

319
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,370
没结婚的姜智媛变得一天比一天漂亮
Ji-won, who's not married, gets prettier.

320
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,950
郑秀敏
Jeong Su-min.

321
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,120
你必须要有警觉
You should be alert.

322
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,080
朴敏焕和姜智媛在公司…
Min-hwan and Ji-won...

323
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,290
他们就是很合才会在一起七年
They dated for seven years since they're a good fit.

324
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,420
更何况在公司会经常碰到面
Besides, they see each other often at work.

325
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,720
说不定就会旧情复燃，然后…
Old feelings could come back, and...

326
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,980
你记得我之前住的套房附近
Do you remember the all-you-can-eat restaurant

327
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,150
那间吃到饱的烤肉店吗？
near my old place?

328
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,650
我们以前很常去
We went there often.

329
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
嗯
Yeah.

330
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,620
只要我们要去那里的那天，你都不让我吃早餐
On days we went there, you wouldn't let me eat breakfast

331
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,750
吃的时候也不让我喝水，以免我会饱
or drink water in case I'd feel full.

332
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,920
你怎么会记得那种丑事？
Why would you remember something so pathetic?

333
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,380
怎么会是丑事呢？很可爱啊
Why is that pathetic? It's cute.

334
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,890
那时候一切都很珍贵，所以更加珍惜
Back then, everything felt precious and priceless.

335
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,350
我跟你交往的时候，我不怎么重视钱
Money wasn't that important to me when I was with you.

336
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,150
你也知道我曾经很喜欢你
You know I really liked you.

337
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,190
嗯，没有像你这样的人了
Well, there was no one like you.

338
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,030
是你才能受得了我的脾气
You could put up with me too.

339
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,450
所以…
So...

340
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,750
你跟刘志赫彻底分手了吗？
you and Yu Ji-hyuk really broke up?

341
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,250
我以为是这样，可是…
I thought so, but...

342
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,920
其实我之前差点遭遇大车祸
Actually, I almost had a big accident recently.

343
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,840
车祸？
Accident?

344
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:45,390
对向是翻斗车，当时我真的是死定了
It was with a dump truck, so I would've died.

345
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,020
可是部长突然冲出来…
But Mr. Yu came out of nowhere and...

346
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,810
一切都变得错综复杂
Everything got complicated then.

347
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,980
错综复杂？
Complicated?

348
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,820
而且是极度复杂
Yes, horribly complicated.

349
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,160
你知道那辆翻斗车的驾驶是谁吗？
Do you know who the driver of that truck was?

350
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,250
我怎么会知道？
No, how would I know that?

351
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,800
是郑秀敏的爸爸
It was Su-min's dad.

352
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,760
她果然都知道
She knew everything.

353
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,940
别再说谎了
Stop lying.

354
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,980
那该死的谎言！
You keep lying and lying!

355
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,940
我也不想
I want to.

356
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,200
我也不想再说谎了
I want to stop it too.

357
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,960
你在哪里？你应该要告诉我，现在是什么情况吧？
Where are you? Shouldn't you tell me what's going on?

358
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,580
我每天都在家里要疯了
I'm going crazy stuck at home.

359
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,210
你为什么不回家？
Why won't you come home?

360
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,010
你该不会是跟姜智媛在一起…
Are you with Kang Ji-won...

361
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,260
他们就是很合才会在一起七年
They dated for seven years since they're a good fit.

362
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,770
不
No.

363
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,520
不可能
No way.

364
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,730
他都想要杀她了
He wanted to kill her...

365
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:16,900
这是怎样？让开
What's going on? Move!

366
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,280
你真的是我女朋友吗？
Are you really my girlfriend?

367
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,360
牛油果
Avocado!

368
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,360
姜智媛
Kang Ji-won.

369
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,950
我爱你
I love you.

370
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,370
你不知道郑秀敏会这么夸张吧？
You didn't know she'd stoop so low, did you?

371
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,210
我也不知道
I didn't either.

372
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,800
就算她再怎么讨厌我，怎么会想要杀了我？
I get she hates me, but how could she try to kill me?

373
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,340
她根本就是个疯子
She's crazy.

374
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,800
经由这起车祸，我不只看到郑秀敏的真面目
I didn't just see her true colors with this accident.

375
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,470
还有部长
Mr. Yu...

376
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,680
他派人跟踪我
put someone on me.

377
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,310
要不然我们分手后都没见过面，他怎么会突然出现在那里？
If not, how could he have shown up? We hadn't met since we broke up.

378
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,730
这不合理啊
It doesn't make sense.

379
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,950
我真的快疯了
I think I'm going crazy.

380
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,160
我感觉随时被监视，我好害怕
I feel like I'm being watched. I'm so scared.

381
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,580
这种时候我该怎么办才好？
What do I do in this situation?

382
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,580
那你没来上班是因为…
So you haven't come to work because...

383
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,290
他是因为我才受伤，我不能放着他不管啊
It was because of me. I couldn't just leave him.

384
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,130
幸好他伤得不重
Fortunately, he wasn't hurt that badly.

385
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,470
所以出院了
So he's been discharged.

386
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,890
可是我说不愿意复合
But when I told him we were through,

387
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,390
他就要我辞职
he told me to resign.

388
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,230
她说的是真的
She's telling the truth.

389
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,740
本来还觉得奇怪，原来是这样
Something felt off, and this was it.

390
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:53,870
对啊，刘志赫是富三代的话，那她当然会换成跟他在一起
Yes, Yu Ji-hyuk is rich, so she was right to switch over to him.

391
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:58,670
不过要是给她八百亿韩元，那当然是要分手
And she was also right to break up with him for 80 billion won.

392
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,880
她也不是当富家少奶奶的料
She wouldn't make a good wife for a rich guy.

393
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,840
而且要是她有八百亿韩元，那我不能杀了她
If she has 80 billion won, I shouldn't kill her.

394
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:10,760
假如她死了，还得分给她妈妈等身边的人
If she dies, her mom and the others will split the money.

395
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,680
我就只能分到一丁点
Nothing will come to me.

396
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,020
可是如果我再次勾引她，八百亿韩元就会直接进到我口袋里
But if I seduce her again, that 80 billion won will come to me.

397
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,860
你不能跟郑秀敏分手吗？
Can you break up with Su-min?

398
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,480
什么？
What?

399
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:26,190
你现在已经知道她是多么可怕的人了
You know how scary she is now.

400
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,280
回到我身边
Come back to me.

401
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,910
我自己一个人什么也做…
I can't do this alone...

402
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,540
算了，我先走了
Never mind, I should go.

403
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,090
智媛
Ji-won.

404
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:56,930
我再联络你
I'll call you.

405
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,380
对不起，你很不高兴吧？
I'm sorry. I'm sure you hated to see that.

406
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,030
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

407
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,950
没做什么
Nothing.

408
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:00,120
只是我若不这么做，我会无法正常思考
If I don't do this, I don't think I can keep sane.

409
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,050
其实你很喜欢我，对吧？
You like me a lot, don't you?

410
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,890
没有啦
No, well...

411
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,310
刚才朴敏焕好像真的在后悔，自己犯的错
Earlier, Min-hwan seemed to be regretting what he did.

412
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,770
朴敏焕吗？
Min-hwan?

413
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,690
他现在应该正在脑中计算着
He's probably crunching numbers in his head right now.

414
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,790
-喂？-你今天不来吗？
-Hey. -Are you coming today?

415
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,750
我正要打给你
I was just about to call.

416
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:48,460
事情好像变得容易了
I think things will get easier.

417
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,590
刚才我跟姜智媛见面
I just met with Kang Ji-won.

418
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,760
她完全不知道我有参与此事
She has no idea I was involved.

419
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,970
所以你只要解决掉姜智媛的妈妈
So you just have to take care

420
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,350
还有郑秀敏的爸爸就可以了
of Ji-won's mom and Su-min's dad.

421
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:01,060
那么拥有八百亿韩元的姜智媛，就会到我这边来
Then she'll come to me with 80 billion won.

422
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,900
而你看是要得到U&K或刘志赫，随便你怎么做
And you can get U&K or Yu Ji-hyuk. Do whatever you want.

423
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,270
我们就是彼此永远的后盾
We'll become each other's support forever.

424
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,110
哦，这样啊
Yeah, I see.

425
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,860
很好，很简单
That's nice and easy.

426
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,870
他太小看前女友姜智媛了
He underestimates his ex-girlfriend.

427
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,620
我不是说过吗？
I told you, didn't I?

428
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:28,790
男人对自己睡过的女人没有戒心
Men aren't wary of the women they've slept with.

429
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,550
郑万植和裴熙淑在哪里？
Where's Jeong Man-sik and Bae Hui-suk?

430
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,300
你年轻的时候
When you were younger,

431
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,770
跟那个演员长得很像
you looked just like that actor.

432
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,480
我更好看
I looked better.

433
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,520
你确实是长得帅
You were handsome.

434
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,650
我们去中国要做什么？
What shall we do in China?

435
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,860
杀了他们
Let's kill them.

436
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,820
什么？
Pardon?

437
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,660
因为朴敏焕说的话，就要杀了他们？
Is it because of what Min-hwan said?

438
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,780
不是，是因为没有坏处
No, nothing bad can come from it.

439
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:03,500
假如姜智媛真的想回到朴敏焕身边
If Ji-won wants to return to Min-hwan,

440
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,750
最好不要让她知道他曾想要杀了她
she shouldn't find out that he tried to kill her.

441
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,210
就算她是在耍什么花招
And even if she's up to something,

442
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:12,300
没有郑万植和裴熙淑，她也无法证明任何事情
she can't prove anything with those two gone.

443
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,720
而且要让他们偷渡还比较麻烦
Also, it's easier than stowing them away.

444
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,800
我们离婚吧
Let's get a divorce.

445
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,480
反正我们也没有孩子
We don't have kids.

446
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,190
我没有理由要继续跟你生活在一起
Honestly, I have no reason to live with you.

447
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,320
跟你在一起也没有什么好处
Nothing good came from being with you.

448
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,070
对了
Oh, right.

449
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,820
还是联络不上你爸吗？
You still can't reach your dad?

450
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,700
你是不是…
Did you

451
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,670
跟姜智媛见面了？
meet Kang Ji-won?

452
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:55,460
哦，我在公司有见到她啊
Yeah, I saw her at work.

453
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,340
你干嘛突然问起她？
Why do you ask?

454
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,220
我想过了
I thought about it.

455
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:06,890
假如你和智媛复合
If you and Ji-won get back together...

456
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,400
最后损失的就只有我而已
then only I'll get screwed over.

457
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,200
停业
OUT OF BUSINESS

458
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,750
这是怎么回事？
What's going on?

459
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,790
你有接到电话吗？
Did you get a call?

460
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,090
老板不像是会这样的人，怎么会突然停业？
He wouldn't do something like this.

461
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:36,960
他应该要跟我们说一声啊
He could've told us.

462
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:39,380
我们被炒了吗？这是怎么回事？
Are we fired? What's going on?

463
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,800
恩浩，真抱歉
Eun-ho, I'm sorry.

464
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:47,020
由于一些个人因素，我把维特给收起来了
I had to close Werther for personal reasons.

465
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:51,270
与你共事很美好，希望有天能再见面
It's been great working with you. I hope we meet again one day.

466
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,440
他把维特给收了？
He closed Werther?

467
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:55,980
这么突然？
Suddenly?

468
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,070
-太疯狂了吧 -这是怎样？
-This is insane. -What the hell?

469
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,360
各位
Everyone,

470
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:06,740
我在不得已之下，将维特给关了，我已经将资遣费汇给你们了
I had to close Werther. Your severance pay has been wired.

471
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,500
-关店？-很抱歉
-Closed? -I'm sorry.

472
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,580
你收到什么？
What did you get?

473
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,460
他说给了一个月的薪水…
He'll pay a month's salary...

474
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,670
我们一夜之间失业了吗？
We're unemployed.

475
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,750
这是怎样？
What's going on?

476
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,750
这是怎么回事？
How did this happen?

477
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,300
有人出来了
Someone's coming.

478
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,930
怎么会从店里出来？
Why were they in there?

479
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,940
这位主厨，进来吧
Chef? Come on in.

480
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,280
两倍
Double the pay.

481
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,280
这里的老板答应
Your boss here suddenly

482
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,330
突然将自己的餐厅卖给我的价格
decided to sell me the restaurant

483
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:50,160
是市价的两倍
at double the market price.

484
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,920
这是很好的选择
It was a good choice.

485
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,500
你也可以做出选择
It's a choice you can make too.

486
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,760
只要你帮我，这家两倍价格的餐厅
If you help me, this expensive restaurant

487
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,720
就是你的了
will become yours.

488
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,220
我要做什么呢？
What do I have to do?

489
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,310
你有两个选择
You have two choices.

490
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:17,980
第一个，得到餐厅
One, take the restaurant.

491
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,990
第二个，失去工作
Two, lose your job.

492
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,040
白主厨！
Chef!

493
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:33,000
你居然说要等我来，害我差点小鹿乱撞
My heart fluttered when you contacted me!

494
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,290
我被智媛拒绝，很难过的时候
When Ji-won turned me down,

495
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,420
很高兴你能安慰我
it was nice to get comforted by you.

496
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:46,180
你怎么了吗？
Is something wrong?

497
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:50,350
我失业了
I'm unemployed now.

498
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,850
为什么？
Why?

499
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:58,810
就是失业了
Just because.

500
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,820
唉唷
Come on!

501
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,200
不过你很有名又长得帅
Still, you're famous and handsome...

502
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,950
最重要的是你做的菜超级好吃
Most importantly, your food tastes so good!

503
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,490
所以说
So...

504
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,080
即使你暂时失业了
you may be unemployed for a second,

505
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,210
-也很快… -这个圈子很小
-but you-- -This industry's small.

506
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,170
餐厅突然关门
The restaurant suddenly closed.

507
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,290
喜欢八卦的人
So all the gossipers will

508
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,340
肯定会说闲话
talk about me.

509
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,170
我知道，我的工作也是这样
I know that. It's the same with me.

510
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:31,100
人们都不相信我们的话，也不去了解实际情况
People don't believe us without even trying to know the story.

511
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,100
要是能有个不错的主厨出现…
If only a decent chef appeared...

512
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:52,660
姜代理
Ms. Kang.

513
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,250
-你来啦？-嗯
-Hey! -Hey.

514
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,460
我怎么会没有想到你呢？
Why didn't I think of you?

515
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,800
可是我不晓得我能不能帮上忙
But I don't know if I can be of any help.

516
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,210
你在说什么？我们才要感谢你
What are you talking about?

517
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,800
我们可以私下谈一下吗？
Can we talk privately for a second?

518
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,270
-好 -走吧
-Sure. -Let's go.

519
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,690
所以说是个女人，对吧？
So it was a woman?

520
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:24,610
对
Yeah.

521
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,450
谢谢你告诉我
Thanks for telling me.

522
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,700
还有真的很对不起，我不会造成你的困扰
And I'm so sorry. No harm will go to you.

523
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:40,370
我不是为了这样才告诉你
That's not why I told you.

524
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:51,010
对了，我没有告诉熙妍这件事
Anyway, I didn't tell Hui-yeon.

525
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:58,270
吴宥拉买下维特餐厅，是为了要请恩浩帮忙
Oh Yu-ra bought Werther and asked Eun-ho to help her.

526
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,190
恩浩拒绝之后，她马上就把他解雇
He said no, and she fired him.

527
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:03,810
她没明确说是要他帮什么忙
And she didn't tell him what she needed help with.

528
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,030
我知道是怎么回事了，你不用担心
I know what it is. Don't worry.

529
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:11,740
我等一下再打给你，我正在跟人见面
I'll call you back later. I'm with someone right now.

530
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,920
你有两个选择
You have two choices.

531
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,760
第一个，帮我
One, help me.

532
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,800
第二个，和吴宥拉一起垮台
Two, go down with Oh Yu-ra.

533
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,770
如果你不傻，应该很清楚该怎么选择
I'm sure you know which to choose if you're not a fool.

534
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:52,490
我要做什么呢？
What do I have to do?

535
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,170
我是行销一组的姜智媛
This is Kang Ji-won, Marketing Team 1.

536
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,550
姜社长好，我是U&K行销三组的朴敏焕
Hello, this is Park Min-hwan from U&K Marketing Team 3.

537
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:18,510
我想请问您今晚是否能见个面
I was wondering if you could meet me tonight.

538
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,520
之前我有些做得不好的地方
For the mistakes I've made,

539
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,020
我想要郑重向您道歉
I want to treat you.

540
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,560
我非常感激
I'd be grateful.

541
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:30,570
我随时都准备好了
I'm always ready.

542
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:34,450
这代表着重新开始，您可以期待一下
I hope it marks a new beginning. You can look forward to it.

543
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:39,700
好
Okay.

544
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:41,540
刘志赫部长
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

545
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,120
-请稍等一下 -好的
-Just a moment. -Sure.

546
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,370
喂？
Yes?

547
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,540
朴敏焕已经有女人了
Park Min-hwan already has a woman.

548
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:51,800
什么？
What?

549
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:55,380
这是怎样？不是说买不到吗？
You said you couldn't get them!

550
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:58,050
因为您心情好像不太好，我就到处打听
You seemed down, so I asked around.

551
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:58,970
奥森迪克

552
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,730
所以我送了限量版的红色高跟鞋过去
So I sent limited-edition red high heels.

553
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,230
还有你说的糖果罐
Along with the candy tin you spoke of.

554
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:14,530
这是什么？
What's this?

555
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:18,240
今天有人拿过来的，要丢掉吗？
Someone brought it today. Shall I get rid of it?

556
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:27,830
不用，放着吧，这让我想起了从前，很好
No, just leave it. It reminds me of the old days.

557
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:35,800
那至少我不用再陪朴敏焕玩了
Then I don't need to play with Min-hwan anymore.

558
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:43,970
感谢您的等待
Thanks for waiting.

559
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,060
不过晚餐可能没有办法
But I don't think I can do dinner.

560
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,610
如果是因为工作的关系，那也没办法
If it's because of work, it can be helped.

561
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:53,150
不过我明晚有空
I'm free tomorrow too.

562
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,110
周末也有空，全都有空
I'm even free on the weekends.

563
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:57,950
我是要和姜社长见面
I'm meeting with you after all.

564
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,110
我当然都有空啊
I'm free whenever.

565
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,620
不
No.

566
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,200
我的意思是…
What I mean is...

567
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:05,910
永远不会再与您有生意往来
I'll never do business with you.

568
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,080
什么？
What?

569
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:13,540
您唯一会的就只有油腔滑调
The only thing you know how to do is sugarcoat things.

570
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:17,090
不管做什么事都搞砸，最后还觊觎家人的保险金
You ruin everything you touch, and aim for insurance fraud.

571
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:19,300
我没必要和这种没能力的人合作
You're too incompetent to work with.

572
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,300
对了，尤其是您管理人力的方式，令我十分惊讶
What really surprised me is your HR method.

573
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:26,310
您招募女性人员的能力特别优秀
You especially excel at recruiting female talent.

574
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:29,020
我很讶异，毕竟您才刚结婚没多久
I was surprised, since you just got married.

575
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,690
您真是在各方面都很了不起
You're amazing in many ways.

576
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,070
往后也请您继续加油
Good luck in the future.

577
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:46,870
哪个客户这么糟糕？
What client is such a scumbag?

578
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,980
智媛，妈妈真的没脸见你…
JI-WON. I'M SO ASHAMED OF MYSELF...

579
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:22,450
你还在干嘛？要我点火吗？
What are you waiting for? Shall I light the fire?

580
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,090
我第一次看到有人死掉
It's my first time seeing someone die.

581
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,640
比想象中还无聊
But it's boring.

582
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,480
不过至少我心情变好了
Still, I feel better.

583
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,240
我好像跟韩国不太合
I don't think I fit in Korea.

584
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,870
没一件事情顺利
Nothing goes right here.

585
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,370
对了，那间餐厅，要怎么办？
Right. About that restaurant, what do I do with that?

586
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,210
要把它给砸了吗？
Shall I tear it down?

587
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:23,880
好，我们离婚吧
Okay, fine. Let's divorce.

588
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:37,650
吴
OH

589
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,520

喂？我是吴宥拉

00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,870
你好，我是郑秀敏
Hello, my name's Jeong Su-min.

593
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,930
好了
There.

594
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:07,890
这样刚刚好
It fits perfectly.

595
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,220
为何一切突然进展得这么顺利？
Why is everything working out so well?

596
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:23,610
五分钟后到，你可以准备下来了
I'll be there in five minutes. Finish up and come down.

597
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,130
喂？我是行销一组的姜智媛
Yes, this is Kang Ji-won of Marketing Team 1.

598
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,630
喂？
Hello?

599
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:57,940
请问是哪位？

抱歉，因为你没接手机

615
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,540
所以说女人不中用
This is the problem with women.

Then I'll pick it up.

621
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:15,590
可恶
Damn it...

622
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,340
滑动来关机

我也爱钱

625
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:33,610
但是你不觉得那些有钱人很恶心吗？

627

你竟敢耍我？
How dare you mess with me?

629
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,100
放开我，放手！
Let go of me! Let go!

630
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:11,360
为什么？你怕啦？
What? Are you scared?

631
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,570
那你为什么要玩弄别人的真心？
Why did you make a mockery of me?

632
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:16,740
智媛

633
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:20,820
我真的打算回到你身边，我真的想要对你好

是你视我如粪土！

一个轻易就杀别人的人，这么宝贝自己的性命吗？

00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,930
我想过要怎么让你付出代价
I thought about how to pay you back.

640
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:45,010
对于郑秀敏，我只要把你送给她就好，但是我要怎么送你下地狱才好？
I could just give Su-min to you, but how do I send you to hell?

641
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:47,850
什么？
What?

642
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,060
地狱？
Hell?

643
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:53,230
你找死啊？
Do you want to die?

杀了我啊
Kill me.

646
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:04,700
不过这次要彻底杀了我
But kill me for sure this time.

647
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:07,040
不然我会杀了你

648
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:20,380
去死

650
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,310
你在笑？

00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,140
去死

653

智媛，你还好吗？
Ji-won, are you okay?

654
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,640
智媛，你醒醒
Ji-won, wake up.

655
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:13,770
智媛
Ji-won.

656
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,350
智媛，你醒醒
Ji-won, wake up.

657
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:17,440
智媛！
Ji-won!

658
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:26,370
那个恶心的家伙
You disgusting bastard.

659
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:35,420
我的命运终究是要，死在朴敏焕手上吗？
Was I destined to die in Park Min-hwan's hands?

660
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:02,440
智媛！
Ji-won!

661
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:04,780
你不能因为比我会打架就这样
You can't do this because you fight better.

662
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,070
其实我不喜欢出力
I hate using my strength.

663
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,570
可是你真的太过分了
But not to you.

664
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:13,120
-志赫 -对不起，全都是我不好
-Ji-hyuk. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything.

665
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,870
你打算要杀了姜智媛吧？
Did you try to kill Ji-won?

666
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,920
为什么大家都只在找姜智媛？
Why is everyone looking for Kang Ji-won?

667
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,710
我来让朴敏焕行动
I'll try to move Min-hwan.

668
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:23,960
我来解决郑秀敏，让她不会再来烦你
I'll take care of Su-min so she won't bother you.

669
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:28,180
只要郑秀敏消失在这个世界上，就不会有人威胁你了
If Su-min disappears, there won't be anyone to threaten you.

670
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,850
我得先解决掉你才能重新开始
I have to take care of you to start over.

671
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:38,850
