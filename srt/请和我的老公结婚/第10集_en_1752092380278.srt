1
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,750
Kang Ji-won

2
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,380
Kang Ji Won!

3
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,040
Damn it!

4
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,380
Why did you hit me? It hurts.

5
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,260
You are the one who is wrong, how dare you lose your temper?

6
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,720
- Like a little kid. - What's wrong with me?

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,430
How dare you say that?

8
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,970
Why would you bring someone with such poor manners?

9
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,520
Jiang Zhiyuan was originally a very well-behaved person

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,560
She must have been possessed by some evil spirit recently, I don’t know what’s going on!

11
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,110
Ouch

12
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,530
You, the guy who got beaten by a woman, only has a mouth left

13
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,530
See the big picture from the small details

14
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,370
How many times have I said that family education is important?

15
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,200
You didn't listen to me and did this.

16
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,750
How are you going to deal with it?

17
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,830
-Ouch. - What are you going to do?

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, my god!

19
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,210
Oh, mom doesn't understand at all, damn it.

20
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,340
Jiang Zhiyuan is crazy, what can I do?

21
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,345
Jiang Zhiyuan, you are dead.

22
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,807
Jiang Zhiyuan, come out!

23
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,601
You don't think that things can just end like this, do you?

24
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:44,730
I am too tolerant of you, and you have no self-awareness to act insolently in front of me

25
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,230
I know you're in there, come out

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,570
Come out, come out!

27
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,570
Hello…

28
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,870
My benefactor, what's the matter with the way you are dressed?

29
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,040
Am I doing something wrong?

30
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,660
Are you going to punish me? It seems a bit wild

31
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,250
No, that's not the case.

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,710
I have something to return today.

33
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,340
Then this outfit is suitable

34
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,010
- So did you succeed? - Yes

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,640
This is my brother's first time visiting someone else's new home.

36
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,140
I told him that the housewarming gift should be toilet paper roll and laundry detergent

37
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,690
But I don't know when he prepared the flowers.

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,610
I like flowers

39
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,830
Oh my god, what?

40
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,040
Who is so rude to yell at someone's door?

41
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,590
Wait, here...

42
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,170
This is number 410, right?

43
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,630
-You are Ji-won's brother... -What are you talking about? Explain it to me clearly.

44
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,090
Oh, ok, hello

45
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,800
Sir, you are exercising.

46
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,810
This is my girlfriend's house...

47
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,680
I must have made a mistake.

48
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,850
girlfriend?

49
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,150
The former tenant was indeed a girl.

50
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,230
etc.

51
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,730
Former tenant?

52
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,190
This is just the right size for a new home.

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,320
But why rent it?

54
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,450
Agent Park clearly boasted that a man should have his own house

55
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,750
I heard you want to pay rent to my brother.

56
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,290
Don't pay

57
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,920
He won't know whether you have paid or not, he doesn't even check the account

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,670
Anyway, this was supposed to be my place to live.

59
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,670
These are two different things.

60
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,300
There are many houses in other places, why choose here?

61
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,970
It's too inconvenient to live in the same building with my boss at work.

62
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,060
Is this for the bedroom?

63
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,390
Yes, thank you.

64
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,050
Don't get too tired of organizing

65
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,260
-Goodbye. -Go carefully.

66
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,050
Goodbye, Hee-yeon

67
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,100
You go

68
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,280
Even if you were born in a position where you can't live your life as you wish

69
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,040
But I still think that political marriages are not right in the 21st century.

70
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,210
So when you cancelled your engagement with Oh Yoo Ra, I thought you were finally acting like a human being.

71
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,960
Was there any other reason why you called off the engagement?

72
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,560
Brother, I mean if

73
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,770
If you are someone very important to me

74
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,730
If you have ulterior motives...

75
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,230
What are you worried about?

76
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,730
Are you afraid of what I might do to Kang Ji-won?

77
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,270
that…

78
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,690
What can I do? She's getting married.

79
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,990
That's right, go home.

80
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,110
elder brother

81
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,540
I have nothing to do with Jiang Zhiyuan and I can't do anything

82
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,040
She's a good person and I really want to help her.

83
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,920
I also thank her for loving you so much. Are you satisfied?

84
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,800
You go

85
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,180
But it was the first time I saw him show that expression

86
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,530
hateful

87
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,790
Park Agent

88
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,950
What’s wrong with you?

89
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,660
-How was your weekend? -Very good.

90
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,870
you look beautiful

91
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,260
Hello, Kang Ji-won, you...

92
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,010
Are you crazy?

93
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,220
- What's going on? - Oh my god.

94
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,390
Why do you keep hitting me?

95
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,020
You really are...

96
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,150
Let's stop here, both of you.

97
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,320
When I was beaten, you didn't move.

98
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,360
Why are you so unfair?

99
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,410
Do you like fairness so much that you want to share your love equally between two women?

100
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,670
Agent Jiang, come out with me

101
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,380
Please wait a moment

102
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,340
What needs to be said about the cheating bastards

103
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,850
- What? - Underwear?

104
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,350
Who is this for?

105
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,940
I found it in your car.

106
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,570
How can you just flip over someone else's car?

107
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,880
How dare the cheating guy be so loud?

108
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,460
Park Min-hwan is so exaggerated

109
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,630
-He cheated on Kang Ji Won -Cheating?

110
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,260
You know Park Min-hwan, right?

111
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,380
Marketing Group

112
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,090
-I heard he cheated on me.-Is that true?

113
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,350
And still in the car...

114
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,430
What?

115
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,680
In the car? In the car?

116
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,810
Big news!

117
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,610
God

118
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,940
Has the news reached the HR department?

119
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,690
This is really great news.

120
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,950
Really

121
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,450
What should they do?

122
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,950
"A couple who had been dating for seven years, the man cheated on her

123
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,370
The woman threw her underwear and things got out of control.”

124
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,210
He was going to beat Agent Jiang

125
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,080
-Stopped by Minister Liu-Red Underwear

126
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,380
Ladies and Gentlemen, U&K Representatives

127
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,670
I'm back

128
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,210
Red underwear

129
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,220
This is a weekend drama.

130
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,050
I don't watch TV, this is enough

131
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,560
That's why Kang Ji-won treated my mom like that.

132
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,730
What should I do?

133
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,440
It's scary when a nice person goes crazy.

134
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,110
How come you can’t even take care of your underwear?

135
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,280
That's not mine

136
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,740
What?

137
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,240
Isn't that your underwear?

138
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,250
But I've only been with you in the car in my life

139
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,550
If that pair of underwear wasn't yours, how did it end up in my car?

140
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,710
How could such a weird thing happen?

141
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,550
What's going on?

142
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,760
Whose underwear is that?

143
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,300
What nonsense are you talking about?

144
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,180
Damn

145
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,020
I knew you'd take the bait, Park Min-hwan

146
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,230
Although it's not Zheng Xiumin's

147
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,730
But I picked out the style you like.

148
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,860
How are you?

149
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,200
What is going on?

150
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,580
Excuse me

151
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,120
Hello? Eunho

152
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,460
I am in the company

153
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,840
I'll call you later

154
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,880
good

155
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,180
I met my parents yesterday at Eun-ho's restaurant.

156
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,310
He must be worried about me after seeing me break up.

157
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,680
Yesterday?

158
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,440
So you knew this before you met the parents?

159
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,650
Is that why you dress like that?

160
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,370
You should tell us

161
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,910
You must be sad on your own

162
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,620
But do you know who the other party is?

163
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,630
This is unreasonable.

164
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,930
How could Kang Ji-won have found that pair of underwear if she didn’t take my car yesterday?

165
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,930
I'm going to ask her

166
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,180
Ask her where she found her underwear? Either way, you are a cheating man.

167
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,810
Damn it, really!

168
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,230
Stop shouting!

169
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,230
You just fell in love

170
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,780
Although it is wrong, it is understandable

171
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,110
People's hearts will change

172
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,950
She should be more attractive.

173
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,500
That's great.

174
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,180
Look who this is.

175
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,720
Isn’t this the excellent agent Kang Ji-won who takes care of all the company’s affairs by herself?

176
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,470
Section Chief!

177
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,140
Oh, Chief.

178
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,270
-Today is a good day for you to start over.-That guy is really...

179
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,060
Because of her appearance

180
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,900
-Only men can't stand cheating-Okay

181
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,150
Really

182
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,700
Men, they all look at women's performance

183
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,160
Even if I were to date a fox, I would never date a bear.

184
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,540
- That's a man. - Yeah.

185
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,880
good

186
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,250
haven't seen you for a long time

187
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,670
In this era, even if you get married, you will get divorced.

188
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,590
You just follow your heart

189
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,720
So don't care about other people's opinions.

190
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,140
We must not waver.

191
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,730
You seem to have made a mistake.

192
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,740
Zheng Xiumin

193
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,110
You are not suitable for marriage

194
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,120
Jiang Zhiyuan graduated from Korea University

195
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,710
I have saved a lot of money and I am very capable in living.

196
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,290
But what about you?

197
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,550
You are not only beautiful

198
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,300
Anything else?

199
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,430
Do you have it?

200
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,430
Sleeping with you? I admit, it felt good.

201
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,520
But realistically, I'm not in my 20s anymore and I'm not crazy

202
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,650
Why would I want to marry you?

203
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,360
You should be self-aware

204
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,650
What?

205
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,740
how?

206
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,660
Hello!

207
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,330
you…

208
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,410
You bastard!

209
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,700
What?

210
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,080
-Hey! -What's going on?

211
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,330
Section Chief

212
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,670
Chief, oh

213
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,050
How could you do this to Xiumin?

214
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,090
How could you?

215
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,010
How could you? Let go. How could you do this to Xiumin?

216
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,850
How could you do this to her?

217
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,220
Chief, come over here.

218
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,270
What's wrong with you? Stop it.

219
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
Xiumin

220
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,770
Let me go!

221
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,190
How could you do this to Xiumin?

222
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,730
Come on, Chief.

223
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,240
So the person Park Min-hwan cheated with was Jung Soo-min, right?

224
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,910
That best friend of Kang Ji-won?

225
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,030
Oh my god, it's like a jungle.

226
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,080
How can it happen in the company...

227
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,200
How? What happened?

228
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,040
-Big news-Come here quickly

229
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,500
What's wrong?

230
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,920
Park Min-hwan and…

231
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,010
- Jung Soo Min? - You know?

232
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,380
- You know? - Yes.

233
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,680
They have been good friends since junior high school.

234
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,220
Isn’t that too exaggerated?

235
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,020
Ji Won is so pitiful

236
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,190
U Food Cheating Legend

237
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,610
-That's what I mean-Underwear Park!

238
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,110
Underwear Park?

239
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,650
I really want to quit

240
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,280
Cheating Girlfriend

241
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,280

The Other Half

244
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,770
Ji-won, have you moved?

245
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,600
I think we should talk

246
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,400
I'm at your house now

247
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,610
You don't believe what others say, do you?

248
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,110
You have to trust me

249
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,660
Liyou Foods Quick Cooking Meal Pack Tasting

250
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,670
This is a video footage shot by an on-site investigator at a supermarket last weekend.

251
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,170
But there is one part that worries me a little

252
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,290
So I want you to take a look

253
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,220
Is Liyou Foods holding a promotion for quick-cooking meal packs?

254
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,720
Should we set up a stall as well?

255
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,930
But where are our products displayed?

256
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,020
Didn't see it

257
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,690
Look

258
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,650
Like this, it's completely tucked in the back.

259
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,700
The results of the last food tasting were quite good. I thought it would be displayed at the front.

260
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,750
Park Min-hwan is the agent of Marketing Team 1, and Jung Soo-min is the staff member

U&K Bermuda Park Triangle's Shameless Behavior

262
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,130
Someone saw them pretending to work overtime and staying

263
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,220
Secret date in the office

264
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,350
I was scared to death!

265
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,480
How could you get into such trouble?

266
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,310
Even if you get into trouble, how can you hide it?

267
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,110
What? What is…

268
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,530
Joe's supermarket, because of not informing the allergens, there was an accident

269
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,780
Why didn't you report this?

270
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,330
How do you know?

271
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,420
Not only did you not apologize to Trader Joe's, you loudly accused their employees of being at fault?

272
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,540
Yeah, but that's the fact.

273
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:19,590
When we were gone for a while, the supermarket staff started the food tasting activity.

274
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,130
You two?

275
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,800
Why did both of them leave?

276
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,260
that…

277
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,930
The responsible persons are Park Min-hwan agent and Jung Soo-min staff

278
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,530
Dog mongrel

279
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,110
Really a bastard

280
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,370
No

281
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,290
What are you guys thinking about?

282
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,040
Ji Won

283
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,380
Park Min-hwan seems to be handling the customer part well.

284
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,130
The problem is that there is no report

285
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,220
that…

286
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,320
Girlfriend's best friend, cheating, beast

287
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,660
I'm doing that even during work hours.

288
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,580
Banned words: Park Min-hwan, Bermuda…

289
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,330
Now everyone also shares the marketing team's news through the company's email

290
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,540
So I will first put "Park Agent, Park Min-hwan Bermuda Park" etc.

291
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,050
Set as banned words

292
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,510
Oh, and "Underpants Park"

293
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:49,140
Company emails containing prohibited language cannot be sent

294
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,180
Messages cannot be sent

295
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,110
This should avoid being discussed within the company.

296
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,690
However

297
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:06,280
This protection will only take effect after you accept the department transfer

298
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,490
Department transfer?

299
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,660
In this case, it will be difficult for you to become a full-time employee.

300
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,370
Although the contract has not expired

301
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,710
The company has specially considered your situation and allowed you to work until today.

302
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,800
Do you agree?

303
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,060
Female staff lounge

304
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,780

306
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,750
Our company's B guy cheated on his girlfriend A's best friend C, and the two got into trouble again in Joe's supermarket

307
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,050
To be honest, men can't resist the temptation of women.

308
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,420
Why is everyone scolding me?

309
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,350
Why should they? They don't know me.

310
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,270
Ji-won and I...Ji-won...

The Other Half

312
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,420
How is this possible?

313
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,510
The company also has a system

314
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,050
How can I be the agent and Yang Zhulan be the section chief?

315
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,260
Agent Yang Zhulan is successfully carrying out the quick-cooking meal package project which might otherwise be idle.

316
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,560
She is a talent that the company is very grateful for.

317
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,850
On the contrary, in addition to the relevant cases, you are

318
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,940
Absenteeism, gender sensitivity and peer evaluations are very disappointing

319
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,360
this…

320
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,910
I have never read sexually sensitive publications in the company

321
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,740
This is a notification

322
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,620
If you don't accept it, I'll take it as your intention to resign.

323
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,850
Section Chief, Kim Kyung-wook

324
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,190
Damn it, hey, Yang Zhulan!

325
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,650
Please help me change my seat.

326
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,910
yes

329
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,530
You can't smoke here...

330
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,540
Oh, it's not

331
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,920
what are you doing here?

332
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,800
This is where I go when I want to be alone and think quietly.

333
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,430
A company is a place to work

334
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,770
This is not a place for you to think.

335
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:07,810
Didn't you come here just to be alone and think quietly?

336
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,490
You are not the kind of person who would go to the warehouse to pick up printed materials yourself.

337
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,240
You...

338
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,080
Pretend to understand

339
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,330
Do you care more about the other person?

340
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,750
The type who becomes colder the more he speaks?

341
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,920
U&K Talent Development Institute

342
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,380
I think I can recognize people quickly

343
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,760
People who judge others hastily

344
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,640
I personally really hate your type.

345
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,600
You don't look very happy about being promoted to section chief.

346
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,730
If it's because of Kim Kyung Wook, you don't have to care

347
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,610
Based on your performance, you should have been promoted to section chief long ago.

348
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,660
In the performance, the cooking kits should account for a large proportion this time, right?

349
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,450
This is a project that Kang Ji-won represented.

350
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,830
From idea, planning to execution

351
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,540
If someone deserves to be promoted to section chief based on this

352
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,500
That should be Agent Jiang.

353
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,180
After speaking it out, I feel much more relaxed.

354
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,600
Please use this as a reference for personnel decisions

355
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,770
Isn’t Jin Jingxu also…

356
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,400
Will you be promoted to section chief based on your business plan?

357
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,240
You are the type who suffers

358
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,290
I think I can recognize people quickly

359
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,750
People who judge others hastily

360
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,420
I personally like this type

361
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,800
If what they say is true

362
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,880
You are right.

363
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,260
I am the victim

364
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,720
It feels more comfortable to be a sucker

365
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,570
Why do you need to tell HR this?

366
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,360
We do the work together.

367
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,240
I also think you deserve the promotion.

368
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,330
I don't like the feeling of being sorry.

369
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,370
I always felt that it was awkward for me to be a team leader.

370
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,130
This project is yours

371
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,630
I'm sorry, when Chief Jin said he wanted to exclude you

372
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,050
I should correct him immediately.

373
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,260
After working with you, I realized

374
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,180
What a good person you are

375
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,350
And how much fun it is to work with good people

376
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,740
Although I don't know what decision the HR will make

377
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,860
But to me, you are the best

378
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,910
To me, you are much better

379
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,540
Agent Jiang

380
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,050
I think you should go to the first floor.

381
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,130
What?

382
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,850
Tell Jiang Zhiyuan to come out!

383
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,850
Why stop us?

384
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,310
I almost died

385
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:35,440
Who is Jiang Zhiyuan? How could she say such a thing?

386
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,980
I wonder if she knows what she's talking about.

387
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:43,780
Doesn't the fact that she disclosed that she is from the marketing team and used her real name mean that she is very confident?

388
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,370
- Then why are you stopping us? - Please calm down.

389
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,740
Hello

390
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,870
I am Jiang Zhiyuan, the agent of the marketing team.

391
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,250
-Oh- Are you Kang Ji-won?

392
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,600
Oh yeah

393
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:15,440
Hey, do you think we are playing dead just to get free compensation?

394
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,270
Do you think allergies are a joke?

395
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,860
We didn't say anything more if you guys didn't do your job well.

396
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,030
My husband almost died.

397
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,200
He almost died.

398
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,000
Excuse me, can I see your cell phone?

399
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,550
Hello everyone

400
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,350
I am Kang Ji-won, the key figure in the UK&K scandal

401
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,600
Since I am shaking, I will just explain

402
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,560
First of all, there is a misunderstanding about the triangle relationship.

403
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:03,730
It is true that the person I am going to marry falls in love with my friend

404
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:07,200
But my friend did not respond to his pursuit

405
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,870
She was a very charming person.

406
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,950
I'm trying to accept that this is inevitable.

407
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,960
The thing about Joe's supermarket is totally typical

408
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,840
The example of a bad customer who wanted free compensation

409
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,550
Eat the food you tasted without looking at it carefully

410
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,510
This is something that someone with severe allergies would never do, right?

411
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,840
My innocent friend is being blamed

412
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,970
My innocent friend is being blamed

413
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,810
It makes me feel very painful

414
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,140
Kang Ji-won

415
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,940
What on earth were you thinking when you uploaded this kind of article?

416
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,990
This is not the article I wrote

417
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,280
But the handwriting is mine.

418
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,740
Among the people I know

419
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,160
There is a person whose handwriting is exactly like mine.

420
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,170
Zheng Xiumin, stop!

421
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,680
Ji Won

422
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,350
I won't let it go easily this time.

423
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,650
You clean up the mess you made.

424
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,860
Wait, Ji-won

425
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,740
Ji Won

426
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,910
Why are you doing this? Don't

427
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,210
Don't forget how much you know about me

428
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,590
How much do I know about you?

429
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,180
MODU community, U&K Foods agent Jiang Zhiyuan

430
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,860
Why use someone else's name?

431
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,370
As an employee of U&K

432
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,990
I'm very sorry about this.

433
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,370
But someone else should apologize to you.

434
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,260
Wife

435
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,970
She is the girl from before.

436
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,640
Girls who are with Park Agent or someone else

437
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,180
So that was fabricated?

438
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,230
She stole her friend's boyfriend and used her friend's name to open an account to defend herself

439
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,820
Because no one would believe her in her own name

440
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,460
I'm really sorry

441
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,420
Due to the situation…

442
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,300
Going in a very bad direction

443
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,380
So I went too far in order to justify myself.

444
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,550
I definitely don't mean to scold you two.

445
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,470
I know you must be very unhappy, but I didn't think that far ahead.

446
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,850
It's all my fault. I was wrong. I'm sorry.

447
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,640
Miss

448
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,060
sorry

449
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,730
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

450
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,030
I really feel like I'm going crazy

451
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,950
I know I shouldn't do this.

452
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,910
But…

453
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,290
I've been having a lot of mood swings lately.

454
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,710
I know I'm a bad woman

455
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,250
But I'm afraid this will continue

456
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:59,220
I really can't think straight, so I do this

457
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,940
Ji Won

458
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,690
Ji-won, I'm sorry.

459
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,610
Can you please forgive me?

460
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,450
I…

461
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,040
I can't live without you now

462
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,300
Ji Won

463
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,100
I am pregnant

464
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,530
Pregnant…

465
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,800
I want to see it

466
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,340
Park Min Hwan…

467
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,550
Park Min-hwan is…

468
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,100
It's me

469
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,140
Kang Ji-won…

470
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:29,850
Going crazy

471
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,310
And Jung Soo Min...

472
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,570
Going crazy

473
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,780
My life is ruined!

474
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,750
Viper Cash Repayment Notice

475
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,290
Viper Financial Slaughterhouse

476
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,670
The pauper capital ultimatum

477
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,970
Not fun at all

478
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,390
Hey, do you also think I look like someone who got another woman pregnant behind his fiancée's back?

479
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
Yeah?

480
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,070
Oops, I seem to have been hit by a car

481
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,430
What is this?

482
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,140
What is this? Huh?

483
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:57,190
Who are you guys? What are you doing?

484
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,520
Brat?

485
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,650
I look pretty young, don't I?

486
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,740
Yes, you do have a baby face.

487
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,530
Right? I have a baby face.

488
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,160
What era is it now?

489
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,620
This is the Republic of Korea, you are...

490
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,080
I'm afraid something will happen to you. I'm afraid you'll be in trouble.

491
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,670
Where are you from?

492
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,420
Are you guys from Viper Cash?

493
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,350
Or someone from Viper Finance?

494
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,510
Where from?

495
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,180
Ouch

496
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,600
Are you still borrowing money from Viper Cash?

497
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:38,310
They don't beat people but cut them, right?

498
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,230
- Kill someone? - Yeah, yeah

499
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,730
-Here-Yes

500
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,700
-Is it still here? -Yes

501
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,450
Sir, I will pay it back! I will pay it back!

502
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,790
- What? - Be gentle.

503
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,500
Aren't you broke? Is there any way to suddenly become rich?

504
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,170
I have no money

505
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,550
But my parents have

506
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,720
As long as I get married, they will buy me a house

507
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,010
I'll pay it back in cash, right away, yes

508
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:12,600
They always have to see the coffin before they can have money

509
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,180
So when are you going to get married?

510
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,520
End soon

511
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,020
I have a daughter who is getting married...

512
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:21,900
I have a pregnant woman, yes, the woman who is pregnant with my child

513
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,740
I'll pay you back as soon as I get the house.

514
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,300
Big Brother

515
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,180
-Brother, you are here. -It is cold outside.

516
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,720
Why don’t you wait in the store instead of coming here?

517
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,720
I'm sorry to ask you two to do something weird.

518
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,220
As long as you need us, we can do anything

519
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,020
Is he the guy I went to get the fried chicken last time?

520
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,730
What's going on? He's in a lot of debt.

521
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,360
Brother, we're not done yet.

522
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,950
Let's go pack up and come back

523
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,330
We'll be back soon.

524
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,330
Very cold

525
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,050
Kang Ji-won will be happy

526
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,050
She will be happy

527
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:43,810
mom

528
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,780
Didn’t you say you would buy me a house when I get married?

529
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,030
Can you buy it for me now?

530
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,820
You only gave me red hygienic clothes.

531
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,830
Why should I buy you a house?

532
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,040
When you give me a grandson, I might buy it for you.

533
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,460
Mom, I'm not kidding now.

534
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,330
I'm in urgent need now

535
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,000
Do you believe me?

536
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,880
Don't you love me?

537
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,510
I am your son, Park Min-hwan, your only son

538
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,770
Where are you going, little brat?

539
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,520
Really

540
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,070
Oh my god, I'm so scared! What the hell?

541
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,740
Hey, why are you squatting there?

542
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,870
Hello

543
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,950
Hey, Jung Soo Min

544
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,750
what are you doing here?

545
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:48,460
I'm nothing special except that I'm pretty, so what are you doing in my house?

546
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:55,510
Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant?

547
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,470
Will anything change if I become pregnant?

548
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:10,320
Yes, I was a bit too harsh, wasn't I?

549
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,450
I really didn't mean that, really.

550
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,870
All men are like this, right?

551
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,660
It seems that there has really been a change

552
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,790
Kang Ji-won wasn't like this originally

553
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,840
Even when I told her I was pregnant she didn't want to talk to me

554
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,420
fool

555
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,970
You seem to be very smart

556
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,390
But in an unknown place, it's stupid

557
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,850
Your child is my child, of course she is hurt.

558
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,770
She likes me so much

559
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,310
Is that so?

560
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,820
I am pregnant

561
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,360
Of course

562
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,200
Although she is very cruel, she doesn't show it, but I know

563
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,410
Don’t you know that too?

564
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,540
She's fragile inside.

565
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,500
Since I found out about your relationship with me, I've been hurt and scared.

566
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,540
Plus you said you were pregnant

567
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,000
She must be in a bad mood.

568
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,180
is that so?

569
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,060
-Cheers-Cheers

570
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,730
Oh my god, this is really God's help

571
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:31,520
Agent Jiang, wouldn't it be terrible if you got married without knowing it?

572
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,020
Garbage should be thrown into the trash can

573
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,650
But the funny thing is that the garbage and the garbage can seem to hate each other

574
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,320
Did you see Park Min Hwan’s expression when he heard she was pregnant?

575
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,040
Pregnancy? Zheng Xiumin, what are you planning?

576
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,620
Park Min-hwan must have azoospermia

577
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,130
Is the meal to your liking?

578
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:52,000
Very delicious

579
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,880
Do you need anything else?

580
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,720
No, it's great right now.

581
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,800
Thank you

582
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,760
Very good

583
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,180
Have a nice meal!

584
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,140
But…

585
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,600
I thought Ji-won would stand by me in the end.

586
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:13,860
She's probably angry.

587
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:17,740
So just pretend you didn't see my message.

588
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,580
But when she saw that others were too harsh on me

589
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,500
I thought she would stand by me.

590
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,330
She has always been like this

591
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,250
Even if it's a little strange

592
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,260
Even if it's not quite right

593
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,880
Even if she is angry

594
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,930
But in the end

595
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:47,020
She still forgives me and understands me

596
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,900
I think…

597
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,520
Now it's my turn to be your person

598
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,820
You graduated from Kang Ji-won, right?

599
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,570
You're not in love.

600
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,370
Let's both let go of Kang Ji-won

601
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,950
Just think about the two of us.

602
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:11,960
us?

603
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,550
us…

604
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,140
Do you want to get married?

605
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,640
I said cruel words to you

606
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,400
I want to try not to like you

607
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,070
But I think I only love you

608
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,240
us…

609
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,450
Should we get married?

610
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:53,040
Our Family…

611
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,840
Our family will be better tomorrow than today

612
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,630
I promise you

613
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,090
Tomorrow will be better than today

614
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,720
I promise you

615
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,860
family?

616
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:20,230
right

617
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:35,000
Incident reporting, personnel disciplinary notification

618
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,130
So Kang Ji Won has no problem

619
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,340
The problem is her fiancé and her friend?

620
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,300
right

621
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,800
But luckily the employee in question said she was pregnant

622
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,430
The customer forgave her and the matter came to an end

623
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:49,930
The relevant employees were also given personnel sanctions.

624
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,770
The investigation results of the quick-cooking meal package project are also the claims of Kang Ji-won, the agent.

625
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:57,810
It is common to steal the plans of subordinates.

626
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,900
So Kang Ji Won is the victim

627
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:03,990
I have to see her.

628
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:22,550
Come in

629
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:34,020
I heard you've been having a lot of trouble lately.

630
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:39,020
I told myself that what was bound to happen must be faced even if it was difficult.

631
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,360
It seems like you have a lot of difficult people around you.

632
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:50,320
There aren't many difficult people.

633
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:53,870
But there are still many strong people.

634
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,960
Am I included?

635
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,630
I think so

636
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,220
So what are you going to do in the future?

637
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:19,100
- Now? - Yes, please go over and take a look

638
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,900
-Grandpa- Ouch, you scared me

639
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,570
You'll scare the guests, little brat.

640
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:38,910
The president didn't say anything.

641
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,960
So you don't have to worry

642
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,790
I won't let this happen again, sorry.

643
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,420
Why are you sorry?

644
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,930
I feel so magical to be able to see the president so close

645
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,220
But he's not as unapproachable as I thought.

646
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:57,810
He should be hard to get close to.

647
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:01,810
I told him frankly

648
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,310
When I said my boss stole my project proposal

649
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,980
I once thought about whether I should just not care about it

650
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:08,610
But I don't regret it now

651
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:12,240
This is the answer my grandpa would like.

652
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,450
And he brought up my private life first

653
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:24,420
He said it wasn't my fault I stepped in poop

654
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,590
Second-hand market

655
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,600
Purchase two-line pregnancy test stick and ultrasound photo

656
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,060
Your article has been published

657
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:43,770
family

658
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,610
A new beginning

659
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,150
Park Min-hwan and Jung Soo-min seem to be getting married soon

660
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,910
You should have a new start.

661
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,620
oh

662
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,160
Um…

663
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:02,620
I can't feel at ease until they say they want to get married.

664
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,670
They will get married

665
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:09,590
Because if he doesn't get married, he has no money.

666
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:12,630
What does that mean?

667
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,760
I checked Park Min-hwan's financial situation.

668
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,640
The stock credit is very bad, and I also borrowed a lot of high-interest loans.

669
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,020
Therefore, he is under great pressure to repay his debts.

670
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,440
He has already paid off his severance pay.

671
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,730
Because of this incident, he was demoted to an ordinary employee and his salary should be reduced.

672
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:32,780
How did you check?

673
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:35,240
You once said

674
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,160
I'm a person who only does the right thing

675
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,870
Actually, it is not the case

676
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,080
My grandpa knows

677
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:46,460
I just...

678
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,460
Nothing I wanted before

679
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,090
Do you want to try shooting?

680
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,890
I'm a person with a lot of things to do.

681
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,190
Whenever I need to do something, I come here and pull the trigger.

682
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,520
When I thought the bullet had already flown

683
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:11,900
It's irreversible

684
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:15,320
Just do it, after thinking this

685
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,820
Even if you don't want to do something, you can still do it.

686
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:30,290
But now I can't help doing what I want to do

687
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,730
I am a person who can do many things

688
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,350
Now it has changed

689
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:53,110
I'm just doing what I can to help you.

690
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,320
Hold tight and lean against me

691
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,200
My benefactor, you are awesome.

692
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,910
It's really easy to make a quick meal.

693
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:43,830
I don't have a talent for cooking.

694
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:46,160
But this set is very simple

695
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,830
You don’t cook at home, do you?

696
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:51,330
Yes, I always order takeout when I'm alone.

697
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,290
This won't work. You have to eat healthier.

698
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,010
I once had a stomachache so I try to cook at home

699
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,510
It's delicious

700
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,640
You are really perfect

701
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,690
Benefactor, will you marry me?

702
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,020
I don't plan to get married

703
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,690
This won't work.

704
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:17,980
Even if you don't have that intention

705
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:21,240
Your ex-boyfriend feels like he lost when he gets along well with someone else first. It's annoying.

706
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,450
You have to be happier than them first.

707
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:27,120
Which type do you like? Do you look at the face or the figure?

708
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,040
I'm going to answer the phone

709
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:39,170
It's Bai Enhao calling.

710
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,090
No, don't answer it. I'll call him later.

711
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,470
Just take it

712
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:47,140
If a handsome guy calls me on Christmas, I will answer the phone.

713
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:51,640
Hello? Eunho

714
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,520
What?

715
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,630
-Hello. -Are you coming?

716
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,300
-Did you wait long? -No

717
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,470
-Hello. -Hello.

718
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,220
You drive very carefully.

719
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:31,100
oh

720
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:33,480
Because I seldom drive

721
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,560
After that, I drove for the first time

722
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:38,980
- That time? - My brother

723
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,780
We got drunk in his shop and he gave us a ride back home

724
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:46,070
This was the first time I encountered such a thing and I was at a loss. He saved me.

725
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:49,370
The minister was drunk?

726
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:53,120
And it was in Eun-ho’s shop?

727
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:57,460
If Kang Ji-won is the only one who wrote with his left hand

728
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,670
What do you think will happen?

729
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,800
Yes, he comes often.

730
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:09,600
Because my brother has such a sophisticated taste, the food he makes is delicious.

731
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:13,560
So what do you want to do?

732
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,730
Where are we going?

733
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:19,900
Aren’t you going with us?

734
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,400
Oh, Agent Jiang

735
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,480
Do I look like someone who doesn’t have a date for Christmas?

736
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:27,780
Let’s go, have fun!

737
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:30,580
All right

738
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:48,720
I'm the kind of person who doesn't have a date on Christmas.

739
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,640
But they look really good together.

740
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:05,690
Ouch

741
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,990
You're eating ice cream? That's a bit human.

742
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:10,410
I want to eat too

743
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:14,490
What's the matter?

744
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,250
Didn’t you say that her classmate should be a good man and asked me to help them get together?

745
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:19,000
I did super well.

746
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,580
What's wrong with the temperature? Is the heating off?

747
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,000
Does he seem like a nice guy?

748
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:24,920
Um

749
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:30,130
I think he might be a little bored.

750
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,050
But it's comfortable to get along with him. He's handsome and stable.

751
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:37,220
Although the benefactor appears to be very strong, he is actually often anxious.

752
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:43,980
And most importantly, his eyes are full of love

753
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:52,530
How? Why? Why don’t your actions match your words?

754
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:55,370
You said you have nothing to do with my benefactor and you can't do anything

755
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:58,830
You said you wanted her to be happy and asked me to introduce her to a good man as soon as possible.

756
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,260
You want me to eat like this?

757
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:31,450
I hope my benefactor can meet a good man soon.

758
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:34,870
She seems to dream of spending Christmas at home with her family.

759
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:39,700
Bright light bulbs and gifts under the Christmas tree

760
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:41,790
There are cakes and music boxes

761
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:44,920
And the decorations like Christmas hats and socks

762
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:16,370
Isn't it a bit cold? Would you like something hot to drink?

763
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,160
I'll buy it

764
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:43,270
Can I live this kind of life as long as the two of them are married?

765
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:11,340
Dinner is a popular time on a day like Christmas. I have to go.

766
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:12,460
Feel sorry

767
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:14,050
What is there to be sorry about?

768
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,720
Thank you for spending time with me

769
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,140
No

770
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,890
I really had a great time today

771
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:27,230
It would be great if it could make you forget some of your sadness

772
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:28,900
Then next time...

773
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,060
Eun Ho

774
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:36,320
You are a really good friend.

775
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:51,750
I'm really glad to see you again.

776
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,300
You really shouldn't do that.

777
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,590
I'm glad I don't have any misunderstandings about you anymore.

778
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:59,430
Don't talk to me anymore.

779
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:02,470
See the real you

780
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,720
I used to...

781
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,520
Like you!

782
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,530
Thank you

783
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:23,780
I will also be your good friend

784
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:41,340
good

785
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:43,890
Thank you

786
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:45,970
My first love

787
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,230
Come

788
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,560
The line you wrote with your left hand

789
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,850
It seems not me

790
00:58:58,590 --> 00:58:59,590
minister?

791
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,600
Why don't you go in? What are you doing here?

792
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,980
I came out to get some fresh air

793
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:13,940
I'm planning to go back now.

794
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,030
You seem to have been breathing for a long time.

795
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:25,160
No

796
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:30,950
that…

797
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:45,840
minister

798
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:52,310
I have something to tell you

799
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:56,230
You want to come over to my house?

800
00:59:56,310 --> 00:59:57,980
Or should I go to your house?

801
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,940
What would you have done if I hadn't said I had something to tell you?

802
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,780
I'll tell you I have something to tell you

803
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,170
Actually, I went on a date with Eun-ho today.

804
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:02,460
He is my first love

805
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:10,300
And he said he likes me

806
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:14,520
I heard

807
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,560
I stood there for a long time

808
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,150
But why did you reject him? He seems like a nice guy.

809
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:33,080
He's a very nice guy.

810
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,740
That's why I liked him before

811
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,580
But…

812
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:44,090
My heart doesn't think so

813
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:58,890
Do you remember that I asked you before so that I could be honest with you?

814
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:03,560
Please let me be honest with you sometimes.

815
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:10,110
I've never confessed my feelings.

816
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,450
This time I want to try to confess

817
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,550
When I was with Eun-ho

818
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:30,340
I keep thinking of someone else

819
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,300
I thought I knew it all

820
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,310
But people who don't understand

821
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:41,940
There are still many people I don’t understand.

822
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:45,150
But…

823
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:51,320
He is the only one I can understand.

824
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:54,620
and…

825
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:00,120
He is the one who knows me best

826
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:28,710
After hearing your thoughts

827
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:31,340
I guess that's why I came back.

828
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:33,550
I know you like Kang Ji Won

829
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:36,930
But I don't think you're the type to interfere with Park Min-hwan and Jung Soo-min

830
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:39,930
Whatever concerns Ji-won concerns me.

831
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,350
What went wrong?

832
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:43,640
minister

833
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,850
I'm not a person suitable for love

834
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:47,980
Because I want you to be happy

835
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:50,270
I want to help you collect the wedding money.

836
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,940
The man and family of Kang Ji-won

837
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:54,320
It's all mine now.

838
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:59,320
Congratulations on picking up my trash
