1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,130
I used to...

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,040
Like you!

3
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,500
So

4
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,120
I…

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,670
Feel sorry

6
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,880
(Minister Liu Zhihe)

7
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,260
- Hello? Minister?
- Sorry for calling you on a weekend night

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,930
But I think I need your help

9
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,010
Do you have time to help?

10
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,060
It is about the group's publicity budget
I'm at the Winton Hotel

11
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,060
Hello? Agent Jiang?

12
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,820
Oh, okay

13
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,070
I should be there in 30 minutes.

14
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,240
OK, see you later.

15
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,950
good

16
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,380
Sorry, I really have to go.

17
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,640
Oh, okay

18
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,180
Can that

19
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,600
Can you tell me your phone number?

20
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,990
Wait

21
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,005
I'm leaving first

22
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,179
goodbye

23
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,213
Episode 4

24
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:38,385
The minister never seemed to come to me unexpectedly on weekends.

25
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,320
Sorry, I'm late

26
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,860
I'm not late, thank you for coming.

27
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,450
I'm sure this has never happened before

28
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,860
We walked and talked

29
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,080
Winner Planning is currently holding an exhibition

30
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,660
They proposed to convert the group's marketing expenses into
A considerable amount of money has been transferred to online marketing

31
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,210
- There will be a big change in the promotion strategy
- A very bold proposal

32
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,630
This means that the proportion of online marketing will increase.

33
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,220
However, the group's conservative
Many people think it's too early

34
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,890
How can I help?

35
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,510
Support my opinion

36
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,870
This is NurTV, it's amazing

37
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,210
This will become a
A platform used by all age groups

38
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,300
Wow, this...

39
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,140
I sensed an opportunity

40
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,480
But someone may have a different idea

41
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,860
Minister Liu, you are here.

42
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,910
Sorry, I'm late.
This is Agent Jiang Zhiyuan from the Marketing Team.

43
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,330
So at this time
U&K's whack-a-mole bully is still in the company?

44
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,500
Don't you know who I am?

45
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,750
Known as the whack-a-mole manager
Video of violence against flight attendant on plane

46
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
The post went viral on social media, causing quite a stir

47
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,630
What are you looking at? Is there anything good to see?

48
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,850
Good morning

49
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,560
It's amazing to see you here...

50
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,690
I mean it's an honor.

51
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,230
Minister Liu, you really understand

52
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,990
Hire such a beautiful female employee

53
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,460
It's fun to work, right?

54
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,830
I remember

55
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,460
Jin Jingxu's backer is the general manager of whack-a-mole
They really look alike.

56
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,130
For you, work would be boring.

57
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,980
I want you to be nicer to Ji Won.

58
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,940
Hello, are you really a contract employee of U&K?

59
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,370
Who said that? Ji-won?

60
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,740
Yes, Ji-won said you were a contract employee.
She is an agent

61
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,370
While we're on this subject, show us your business card.

62
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,170
Kang Ji-won is an agent, so what are you?

63
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,500
I'm just an ordinary employee.

64
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,340
Ji-won gets promoted quickly

65
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,260
- I will soon...
- Are you kidding?

66
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,970
You put her in the company.
How could she be promoted faster than you?

67
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,680
You were introduced to the company by someone you know.

68
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,520
But he taught me autobiography and interview skills
How about asking me to treat you to a meal?

69
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,980
You said that big companies have to go through
First, second and third round interviews

70
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,860
Each one has to deal with it differently

71
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,530
Even if these
But what about your past relationship with Eun-ho?

72
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,280
Eun-ho cannot be contacted
Why on earth did you come to the class reunion?

73
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,080
You guys are still talking about this?

74
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,040
That was when I was a kid.
We are both 31 years old now.

75
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,840
-Don't mention it again
- Are you kidding?

76
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,340
We have been fooled by your lies.

77
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,720
Did you really give Ji-won a fake item?

78
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,930
That's not Jiwon learning from you.

79
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,640
You gave her that
It's obviously fake stuff.

80
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,850
How come she even said something like that?

81
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,070
Have you been trying to frame her all along?

82
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,870
Why would I do that?

83
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,280
I'm Jiwon's friend.

84
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,910
indeed

85
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,250
Jiang Zhiyuan was scolded throughout high school
It's all because of you.

86
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,290
You said he coveted your man and imitated your dressing style
I want everything from you

87
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,790
You are the one who is whining there all day long!

88
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,130
I didn't ask you to scold her.

89
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,010
You guys bullied her yourselves, why are you blaming me?

90
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,690
Really creative.

91
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,150
Crazy Woman

92
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,570
I'm going to the toilet

93
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,360
- Really
-Oh my god

94
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,540
When did I ask them to scold her?

95
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,040
Why blame me?

96
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,750
A bunch of rotten people

97
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,890
(Other half)

98
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,200
The number you dialed cannot be answered...

99
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,410
hateful

100
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,280
Why did Bai Enhao show up now?

101
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,570
Ouch

102
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,940
Is this a joke?

103
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,450
Why should I pay you?

104
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,740
Do I have to see it before I can decide?

105
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,410
sorry

106
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,790
But this is quite…

107
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,750
Pretty good...

108
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,130
I haven't been to this site before.

109
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,800
What's good about it? It's all pornographic stuff

110
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,390
It seems that the target audience is set very accurately
That's called an algorithm

111
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,060
It's probably because this is your first time visiting that website.

112
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,940
What?

113
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,900
When I first visited the site

114
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,860
There was also "That Guy is Delicious"

115
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,740
I think it was to attract attention at the beginning.

116
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,330
That’s why I recommend more sensational content first.

117
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,750
After using it for a long time

118
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,330
We will recommend content that interests you.

119
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,960
That function is very useful.

120
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,170
You don't have to see things that you are not interested in.

121
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,960
Hello

122
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,590
You just need to stand there and smile, just be a vase

123
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,180
Why are you so arrogant and talkative?

124
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,810
Her name is not "Hey", she is Agent Kang Ji-won

125
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,060
What? Minister Liu

126
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,730
I want to hear from this promising employee
So I bring her here even on weekends

127
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,570
No, I...

128
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,240
Minister Liu is praising you

129
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,370
Yeah, this is the first time I heard him say that.

130
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,700
Minister Liu...

131
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,870
It's hard to get close to people, and I won't keep people around.

132
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,130
Of course, good people who can do things should be kept around

133
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,720
Were you laughing? Are you crazy?

134
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,970
Do you have a brain?

135
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,150
minister

136
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,070
Thank you for speaking well for me just now

137
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,160
Because you are a nice person

138
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,960
If it's not good, I won't say that.

139
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,840
You said you can get girls by going camping

140
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,630
sure

141
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,640
You can't even get your girlfriend.

142
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,720
After failing to seek love, Park Min went home and changed

143
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,900
What else? Is your wife any different?

144
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,110
My wife only thinks about me.

145
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,940
As long as I leave home

146
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,360
She would keep calling and texting me

147
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,240
Say something like "I miss you so much, what are you doing?"

148
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,830
"Have you eaten yet?" I'm so annoyed

149
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,120
Once upon a time

150
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,160
I really can't understand

151
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,870
I was only out for five minutes.

152
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,000
- She called me right away
- What is this? It's delicious.

153
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,790
-Isn't that delicious?
-Um

154
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,920
My wife prepared it for me.

155
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,760
She told me to stop drinking coffee and use delicious food to wake me up

156
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
very nice

157
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,100
It's different from your girlfriend who doesn't look for you.

158
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,180
hateful

159
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,180
I think your girlfriend has another man.

160
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,900
And keep you for marriage

161
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,480
You're not the only one who can do this.

162
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,150
You don't understand at all

163
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,070
She doesn't have that ability.

164
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,400
You figure it out...

165
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,410
Damn

166
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,330
You lunatic, why did you take them all?

167
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,700
Because it tastes good, I want to use this to pick up girls

168
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,580
-parking
- Really

169
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,880
Get in the car

170
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,840
No, it's okay.

171
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,460
It matters to me

172
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,550
You come to work on weekends
I heard nonsense that I didn't need to hear.

173
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,840
I even thought I should treat you to a meal.

174
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,660
If you keep looking at my face
We're going to have dinner.

175
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,080
What's wrong?

176
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,960
Because that's all you're sorry about.

177
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,840
Someone who is really mean to me.
But I don't feel sorry for me at all

178
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,220
Don't be too used to cooperating with others

179
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,430
good

180
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,850
I learned not to be nice to people who are mean to me.

181
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,860
But I will be twice as good to good people

182
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,570
Good idea

183
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,530
Now you just need
Just be able to recognize the eyes of a good person.

184
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,990
How do you know I don't judge people?

185
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,540
I thought I had, but I didn't.

186
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,130
It looks like that.

187
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,170
So what do you think I am?

188
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,220
Good Guy

189
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,720
It seems that I am not completely blind.

190
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,390
But

191
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,190
Is “That Guy is Delicious” good?

192
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,900
no

193
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,280
I just wanted to save face for the general manager.

194
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,200
But what you said feels very real

195
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,500
Tell me, should I watch it?

196
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,620
It's not like that, really.

197
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,500
I didn't watch it either.

198
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,130
So unfair

199
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,670
I think you should watch it carefully.

200
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm really wronged.

201
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,880
I really haven't seen it

202
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,760
(Other half)

203
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,100
(Remind me later, one hour later)

204
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,690
(Reject call)

205
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,320
If you have an appointment, I can take you there.

206
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,740
No

207
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,040
Sorry, I said I would wait.
But I contacted you again.

208
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,250
Because I haven't seen you for a long time, I can't calm down

209
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,710
Looks like someone said something interesting.

210
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,340
A friend of mine

211
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,180
who?

212
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,970
He is my classmate

213
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,720
I went to a class reunion today.

214
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,310
We exchanged phone numbers after a long separation.

215
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,980
Seeing childhood friends I haven't seen for a long time
It will be fun for a while indeed.

216
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,820
Even though it's all in the past

217
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,820
I used to like him very much

218
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,990
He is my first love

219
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,120
that…

220
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,460
Seeing your first love again may bring back old feelings

221
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,670
But people say it's dangerous

222
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,510
So let the past feelings go...

223
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,300
Not that kind of feeling

224
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,340
I have a boyfriend now

225
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,280
(Park Min-hwan)

226
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,450
(Remind me later, one hour later)

227
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,360
(Reject call)

228
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,040
Agent Jiang

229
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,120
Um?

230
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,450
Recently, even cats and dogs are driving good cars

231
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,450
You shouldn't be able to see inside the car from outside.

232
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,740
No

233
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,830
I'm not because of that

234
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,040
-Don't you want to be seen?
-No, why wouldn't I want to?

235
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,400
Xiumin?

236
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,080
Park Agent

237
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,500
What's going on? Why are you here?

238
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,960
that…

239
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,050
What?

240
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,380
That...

241
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
What's wrong?

242
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,360
Um?

243
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,570
There seems to be something wrong

244
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,370
The password is the date when Ji-won and I started dating

245
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,830
0622

246
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,290
Isn’t it?

247
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,750
June 22, yes

248
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,330
I'll call Ji-won to check.

249
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,630
She doesn't answer the phone

250
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,970
The number you dialed cannot be answered...

251
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,260
She's not usually like this.

252
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,470
It doesn't matter

253
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,020
I'll continue waiting outside

254
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,850
Don't be like this. I'm here to see Ji Won, too.

255
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,980
But this...

256
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,480
This is really...

257
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,870
Let's go get something hot nearby and chat.

258
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,750
Tell me what's going on.

259
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,830
Stop crying

260
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,170
So shall we go out?

261
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,260
good

262
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,650
The minister noticed that I was behaving strangely.

263
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,940
How should I explain this?

264
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,160
Thanks

265
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Really delicious, and warm

266
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,560
Since I and Park Min-hwan are agents
They are recognized as office lovers

267
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,390
You probably have a lot of questions.

268
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,730
But this is my private life, I don't want to explain

269
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
That's it

270
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,820
Although I want to ask, but if you don't want to say it, don't say it

271
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,790
As long as you're making a decision that's good for you

272
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,910
That's enough

273
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,830
I can be sure of this.

274
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,630
I've recently realized something

275
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,300
I have always been cooperating with others

276
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,140
So I don’t know myself very well

277
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,640
So you know something about yourself?

278
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,640
I'm learning

279
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,110
I am also writing a project for a quick-cooking meal package

280
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,280
Quick cooking meal kit?

281
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,360
right

282
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,620
Show me when you finish writing.

283
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,580
No

284
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,450
I'm looking forward to it, better sooner rather than later

285
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,120
If that's the case

286
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,830
good

287
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,710
What else do you want to do?

288
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,590
I also want to...

289
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,340
I also want to do interior decoration

290
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,260
I also want to learn self-defense

291
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,980
Self-defense? You want me to teach you?

292
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,400
Do you want me to learn self-defense?

293
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,440
Why do you react this way?

294
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,240
No

295
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,700
It feels very different from your image.

296
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,410
Is it a long way off? I used to be a sports person.

297
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:54,040
Judo, Aikido, Special Martial Arts
Taekwondo, Muay Thai, Kickboxing…

298
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,460
Really

299
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,890
I've had this feeling since last time.

300
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:16,100
Would you consider wearing contact lenses?

301
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,910
(Dried pollack, grilled pollack)

302
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,710
Drink slowly, or you'll get drunk.

303
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,630
I don't know why things have become so complicated.

304
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:46,090
I'm so afraid that Jiwon will misunderstand

305
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,680
No

306
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,180
You also know Ji Won is not that kind of person

307
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,430
She's been a little weird lately.

308
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,980
I feel like she's getting farther and farther away from me

309
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:02,320
Our relationship isn't like that. It shouldn't be like that.

310
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,360
She is indeed a little strange

311
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,700
Wait, is there really something going on between her and Yoo Ji Hyuk?

312
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,450
Impossible

313
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,280
Kang Ji Won will like me

314
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,120
She understands a man's appearance and style

315
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,750
She must be busy with work recently.

316
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,380
She is a deadbeat.

317
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,380
Only think about one thing at a time

318
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,420
-Is that really the case?
-Of course

319
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,970
No one doesn't know

320
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,300
What's your relationship with her?

321
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,970
Should that be the case?

322
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,720
right

323
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,900
Fortunately, I met you, Agent Park

324
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,570
If it weren't for you, I would definitely be very sad today

325
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,080
Thank you so much

326
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,370
You are the best, so handsome

327
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,750
No

328
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,380
Not handsome

329
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,180
this…

330
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,790
arrive

331
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,340
Thank you for driving me back

332
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,210
- I'm in
-Do you want me to walk you to your door?

333
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,760
What?

334
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,380
No

335
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,930
Ms. Kang Ji-won

336
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,350
I think before getting married

337
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,600
Try to get in touch with more people.

338
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,820
You're more open than I thought.

339
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,660
I wasn't originally, but now I'm starting to...

340
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,410
wrong

341
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,910
I won't do this from now on.

342
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,420
I don't think you have to get married anyway.

343
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,880
You seem to be a non-marriageist.

344
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,510
No, I want to get married.

345
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,800
So what I want to say is...

346
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,470
that…

347
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:40,890
oops

348
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,480
Really

349
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,740
minister

350
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,740
It's nice to see you smile

351
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,060
Interior decoration proposal for the happiness of benefactors

352
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,570
She's so cute

353
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,170
If you want to do all of this, I recommend moving.

354
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,010
move place

355
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,260
This is also a good idea

356
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,700
(Other half)

357
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,030
(missed call)

358
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,830
I can't contact you

359
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,250
I really don't know about the class reunion
Why do students behave like that?

360
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,300
I know if I told you in advance that it was a class reunion
You won't come

361
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,510
I just want to find a way to solve it.

362
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:46,020
I think this matter should not be discussed via text message or phone call

363
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,270
We'll talk tomorrow

364
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,900
(Park Min-hwan)

365
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,620
Ji Won

366
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,630
Xiumin is crying now

367
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,630
It sounds like you guys have a misunderstanding.
Where are you?

368
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,300
Fortunately, you are with her.

369
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,720
Please take care of her and send her home.

370
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,770
I have mixed feelings and need time to think

371
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,730
-Are you okay?
-And you?

372
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,940
Well, I'm fine.

373
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,910
After all, I can't do this for a long time.

374
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,410
So you two should get married soon, please!

375
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,810
-Hello?
-oh

376
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,820
I'm not an impatient person.

377
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,820
But I still called you

378
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,700
Sorry, I got home late and couldn't call you.

379
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,030
Oh, no, it won't be late.

380
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,750
I'm a little anxious.

381
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,880
But it feels a bit strange to talk to you on the phone like this

382
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,800
Is that so?

383
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,670
Have we never talked on the phone?

384
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,430
Yes, you want me to stop following you...

385
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,260
fine

386
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,850
What's up?

387
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:54,850
No...No

388
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,270
Don't say

389
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,190
How many times are you going to say no?

390
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
Okay

391
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:08,240
You asked me not to talk to you anymore.

392
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,740
That's why it's like this

393
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,120
Hello! Kang Ji-won

394
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,470
Hello! Kang Ji-won

395
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:37,980
What happened to me?

396
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,400
You really shouldn't do that.

397
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,280
Don't talk to me anymore.

398
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,880
What happened to him? I didn't say anything.

399
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,220
Sorry, Ji-won.

400
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,930
I told him you were interested in him.

401
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,560
Did I like him making him so unhappy?

402
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,490
That's because you rejected me harshly

403
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,330
I reject you?

404
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,830
yes

405
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:42,960
I still have that letter.

406
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,710
-letter?
-right

407
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,170
Your reply

408
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,970
I wanted to throw it away, but I couldn't.

409
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,470
So you wrote to me and confessed

410
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,220
And did I reply?

411
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,140
Have you forgotten?

412
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,610
I wrote a letter to confess to you

413
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,820
Stayed up late

414
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,900
Oh, forget it.

415
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,030
- Eun Ho
-Um?

416
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,910
Should we meet?

417
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,500
You can bring

418
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,920
Is my reply coming?

419
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,430
Why hasn't she come yet? She usually comes early.

420
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,000
Agent Jiang, what's going on?

421
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,670
I thought you were an artist.

422
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,080
What day is today?

423
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,130
No, that's not the case.

424
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,760
Wow, you are so beautiful

425
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,590
Actually, Xiyan and I went shopping on Sunday

426
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,140
So by the way...

427
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,390
well done

428
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,060
Right? You're so beautiful.

429
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,980
-Ji Won
- What's going on? Get out of the way.

430
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,270
Honey

431
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,020
Are you really my girlfriend?

432
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,570
I can hardly recognize it.

433
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,490
I want to give you a surprise

434
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,400
It scares me

435
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,200
Honey

436
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,500
You look like a different person without glasses, very beautiful

437
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:46,210
You talk like you've never seen it.
She doesn't wear glasses.

438
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,580
Ouch

439
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,130
How could I not have seen it?

440
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,960
It just looks different.

441
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,300
It's really different

442
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,480
What?

443
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,650
Feel sorry

444
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,610
Feel sorry

445
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,290
Minister, I'll clean up.

446
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,450
I'll leave it to you.

447
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,290
Hmm? But...

448
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,840
Today you...

449
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,090
I don't look like I'm dressed for work.

450
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,550
What?

451
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,630
Oh, I...

452
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,930
Looks perfect for work, why...

453
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,810
Are you going to blame her?

454
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,810
Maybe I haven't seen her without glasses.
That's the feeling

455
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,730
Then I'm sorry.

456
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,440
Did you watch it yesterday?

457
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,900
What?

458
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,490
Yesterday was the weekend, and it was the first time I saw it at work.

459
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,080
What?

460
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,250
I noticed you were wearing contact lenses too.

461
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,470
Oh, yeah

462
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,260
minister

463
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,090
That's much more handsome.

464
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:27,770
No wonder it feels a little different

465
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,020
Looks good…

466
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,150
that…

467
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,660
Do you guys go get contact lenses together?

468
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,200
What are you talking about?

469
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,660
Why…

470
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,740
Aren't you going back to your seat?

471
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:49,870
No

472
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,290
Don't do this

473
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,590
Agent Park, you are awesome.

474
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,050
We are discussing Agent Jiang

475
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,430
Agent Park, you have a really good eye.

476
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,310
No one knew that Agent Jiang was such a beautiful woman

477
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,350
You don't know, she is a beauty.

478
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,940
- I think you need to defend well.
-What?

479
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:20,030
Many people in our group said
Having a goalkeeper doesn't mean there won't be goals

480
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,490
Seo Jin-su

481
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,160
He has been talking about Agent Jiang all day today

482
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,660
That's right

483
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,870
Oh, no.

484
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,830
The ball doesn't like this.

485
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,080
That ball only has me in its eyes...

486
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,680
here

487
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,260
What's the matter?

488
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,220
I'm going out on a business trip later.

489
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,020
It doesn't matter for a while.

490
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,440
This is for you. Have some coffee.

491
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,730
Thanks

492
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,860
Did you take a break?

493
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,900
How are you feeling?

494
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,870
I was not good on Friday.

495
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,910
Attending the class reunion
Are you feeling better?

496
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,830
that…

497
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,130
Speaking of which…

498
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,550
What happened to you meeting with Liu Zhihe yesterday?

499
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,680
Oh, that one

500
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,060
I'm sorry for always taking advantage of the minister.

501
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,810
He has something urgent to ask me to come over

502
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,560
That's why I left the class reunion in a hurry.

503
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,110
That guy is such a jerk.

504
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,320
I see Liu Zhihe

505
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,990
Seems to be interested in you

506
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,540
That's not the case.

507
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,960
No, as a man I know

508
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,170
This is male instinct.

509
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,420
Regardless of whether it is urgent or not, why should he look for you?

510
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,800
He also had an issue with your outfit this morning.

511
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,430
Because you are so beautiful

512
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,970
It made him crazy

513
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,350
It's so annoying

514
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,690
Say

515
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,610
You are so beautiful today

516
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,870
You are so beautiful, a bunch of flies are staring at you
Makes me so angry

517
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,950
I should be the only one who can see it.

518
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,580
You are mine, right?

519
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,170
What's this?

520
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,790
There's something here

521
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,550
Oh my God, what should I do?

522
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,760
What should I do? Go to the toilet immediately.

523
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,720
Go to the toilet quickly.

524
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,020
My underwear is wet

525
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:56,980
Borrow

526
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,150
Ji Won

527
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,040
You wouldn't misunderstand me, would you?

528
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,670
I really don't know why they do that.

529
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,170
That was more than ten years ago. How naive!

530
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,640
How could I not believe you?

531
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,220
If I hadn't seen the ending, I might

532
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,020
Don't believe you?

533
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,650
I might have misspoken.

534
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,400
You know I often make mistakes.

535
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,240
Well, I was a little angry yesterday.

536
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,750
But after I thought about it, I found it strange

537
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,660
You have no reason to lie

538
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,880
Pretend you're dating Eunho
And I want you to break up with Eun-ho

539
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,800
Unless you want to bully me
Makes me look like a freak

540
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,680
But

541
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,850
It's crazy for anyone to do that.

542
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,890
Yeah, I can't do that.

543
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,400
Xia Ruizhi and his gang
In the past, he often bullied me with strange excuses.

544
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,610
Now it seems it's your turn.

545
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,570
Um

546
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:33,450
But I won't let it go.
We are not in high school anymore.

547
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,370
I want to meet with Enhao and ask him clearly

548
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,830
Are you going to meet Eun-ho?

549
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,290
Yes, he gave me his phone number yesterday and said he wanted to meet

550
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,170
Don't worry, my significant other.

551
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,590
this time

552
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,470
I really won't let it go.

553
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,350
good

554
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,770
But will Min-hwan be unhappy?

555
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,270
If you meet another man

556
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,730
Min Hwan is not that kind of person

557
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,740
He said I'm happy.

558
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,740
besides

559
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,290
The stock market has soared recently and he has made a lot of money.

560
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,130
Are stocks rising sharply?

561
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,880
He wants me to look forward to our new home.

562
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:34,930
very nice

563
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,520
It's been a while since you got off work on time, right?

564
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,910
Isn't that right? Agent Jiang

565
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,620
I haven't gotten off work early in a long time.

566
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,080
Anyone want to go eat fried chicken?

567
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,710
I have to pick up the kids.

568
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,800
I have to meet a client.

569
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,920
-I can…
- Really

570
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:16,340
The company should give Jiwon a bonus

571
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,390
You're the one doing the work

572
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,580
Excuse me

573
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Feel sorry

574
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,810
This hairstyle really suits you

575
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,190
Everyone is talking about you today

576
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,900
Everyone said they envied Agent Park

577
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,980
No

578
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:15,740
Agent Jiang, you and Agent Park are a perfect match.

579
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,450
So envious

580
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,050
Agent Jiang

581
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,840
Yes, Minister.

582
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:48,350
Why are you dressed like this for work today?

583
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:55,650
Do I look weird today?

584
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,940
No, that's not the case.

585
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:03,700
It's ok, I shouldn't ask

586
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,750
Because you are considering wearing contact lenses
So I wore it today.

587
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,300
So I want to know if you are doing this for someone too

588
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,800
Or because of someone's relationship?

589
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,390
This makes me feel good.

590
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:32,440
This is the first time I dress like this, and I feel very happy.

591
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,400
And because I dress like this
Other people's attitudes toward me have also changed.

592
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,570
It's not that you shouldn't dress like that.

593
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:44,740
Has the attitude towards you changed?

594
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,620
That's right

595
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,120
But there are people like this

596
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:57,340
I want to deal with people like this
This is how it should be done

597
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,380
Start now

598
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:03,510
I won't be so foolish as to stick to just one form anymore

599
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,260
For myself

600
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,140
For yourself?

601
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,600
right

602
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:19,320
But you look really different when you smile

603
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,280
I hope you can smile more often in the future

604
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,790
besides

605
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:31,370
Although I still don't quite understand

606
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:36,420
But make some changes in clothing style

607
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,460
It should be better

608
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:41,010
I recommend you do this, then I'll take my leave.

609
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:47,890
right

610
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,390
Don't be so foolish as to stick to just one form

611
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,360
Hello? Where are you?

612
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,650
I'll leave it to you, Agent Jiang.

613
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,320
You can take the bus in front of the shopping mall

614
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,410
OK, thank you for your hard work.

615
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,750
Because you are considering wearing contact lenses
So I wore it today.

616
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,630
Liu Zhihe seems to be interested in you

617
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,470
Oh yeah, I bought it!

618
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,480
This is mine!

619
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,230
It's Hee Yeon

620
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,190
Oh yeah!

621
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,280
What's wrong with her?

622
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,070
Hee Yeon…

623
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,530
What are you doing?

624
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:49,490
-How did you do that?
- I'm very happy

625
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,410
Oh yeah, this is mine.

626
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:55,200
Okay, I know you are happy, stop making trouble

627
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,460
Thanks

628
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:02,250
I will never forget
You gave me this limited edition favor

629
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,510
I would also appreciate it if you could calm down.

630
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,930
-Please
-Wait a minute

631
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:20,610
Rumor has it that the Minister and Hee-yeon had an affair

632
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,900
(Personnel changes, staff Liu Xiyan)

633
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,240
Kim Kyung-wook claimed that they had an improper relationship

634
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:33,950
So she was transferred.

635
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,620
No wonder

636
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:41,500
That's why we always meet
Because Xiyan and I became familiar with each other

637
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,250
I didn't expect this.

638
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,260
Oh my god

639
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,760
It almost happened.

640
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,060
Park Min-hwan is a useless guy

641
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,180
What is male intuition?

642
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,270
Minister Hee Yeon

643
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:08,650
Are boyfriend and girlfriend

644
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,910
Sure enough, the heirs of U&K are different.

645
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,080
I always have to queue up to get in.

646
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:24,590
I went straight to the VIP room.

647
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,050
"What did you say you wanted?
Give her everything she wants."

648
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,800
That's what he said

649
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:34,550
- You are excited
-I haven't been this happy in a long time.

650
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,600
And he pretended to be uninterested in brand names

651
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,350
Really handsome, grandpa

652
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,390
There are always a lot of things I want to buy

653
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,610
I looked at clothes, bags and shoes
I want my brother to buy them all for me

654
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,530
I bought clothes, bags, shoes and coats.
Anyway, it's my brother who swipes the card

655
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:52,410
He bought them all for me, which is really cool.

656
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:57,240
I want to stay longer.
I'm sorry to leave so early.

657
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:58,870
It doesn't matter

658
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,710
-Hello, Director Lee
-Um

659
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,880
You stay with grandpa all day.
What should the Strategic Planning Office do?

660
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,340
Because he is my right-hand man.

661
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,130
No, I am grandpa's right-hand man.

662
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,850
Grandpa, please take care of your health.
I'll see you again

663
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,100
OK, come play again.

664
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,480
-The same to you
-good

665
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:27,520
-Brother, will you take me back?
- We're going in opposite directions

666
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,400
What are you talking about? Of course you have to give her a ride

667
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,740
It’s so late, you want her to go back by herself?

668
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,780
- Get in the car now
- Grandpa, I'm leaving.

669
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:35,700
good

670
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,040
good

671
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,420
Goodbye Grandpa

672
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,020
Have you asked about that woman?

673
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:05,310
I put the information in your study.

674
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:14,030
(Bomb me)

675
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,250
Brother Zhihe?

676
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,380
Hello?

677
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,880
Now?

678
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,260
If you want to teach girls self-defense

679
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,090
Is judo really the best?

680
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,800
You treat him like this

681
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:24,180
Is it to teach others self-defense?

682
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,560
Wait, that hurts.

683
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,520
You've worked hard

684
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,940
He's so ruthless

685
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,340
Every time my dad gives me pocket money
Draw a love heart

686
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,360
Yes, I know

687
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,440
I didn't expect it to be so difficult

688
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:21,910
But I can't tell the truth
Makes everything complicated

689
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,450
What would you do?

690
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,870
Should I tell Ji-won everything?

691
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,250
Tell her that Park Min Hwan will have an affair with Jung Soo Min
Then hurt her

692
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,010
No, if I were to say

693
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:45,550
I had to tell her
I'm living my second life

694
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:54,360
Will she believe it? I can't believe it myself.

695
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,820
I still haven't figured out what's going on.

696
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,350
(April 13, 2023)

697
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:55,000
Mr. Park Min-hwan, you are suspected of murdering Kang Ji-won
We're going to arrest you.

698
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,210
Ms. Zheng Xiumin, please come with us

699
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:00,710
What?

700
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,340
hateful

701
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,630
stop!

702
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,010
Why?

703
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,930
Why are you taking me away?

704
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:12,060
Why do you have to do this? Let me go

705
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,930
You can exercise your right to remain silent

706
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,900
Everything you say will be used as evidence in court

707
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:21,900
-Did you hear that clearly?
-What do you mean by murder? How could I have killed anyone?

708
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,400
How could I kill someone?

709
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:28,280
It was an accident, at most it was manslaughter!

710
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:29,450
Okay?

711
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:32,870
Anyway, if I leave her alone, she will die.

712
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:34,500
Anyway, you have this suspicion

713
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:37,540
Zheng Xiumin was also arrested as an accomplice

714
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:40,540
If you have something to say, please go to the police station.

715
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:41,840
-What?
-take away

716
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,300
Why are you taking me away?

717
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,550
I didn't, it wasn't me

718
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:46,880
Take it away

719
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:50,470
-I didn't, I didn't kill him!
-Let me go!

720
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:51,560
Let me go!

721
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,150
What's going on?

722
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:09,240
So Zheng Xiumin
Are you having an affair with Kang Ji-won’s husband?

723
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,200
It's really exaggerated.

724
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,790
But how dare she

725
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,830
You suddenly want us to come over?

726
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:19,580
To be honest, I came here because I felt bad.
Was that ten years ago?

727
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:21,630
We held a class reunion at Guse Pavilion

728
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:24,630
At that time, it seemed that we were too harsh on her.

729
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:30,970
Yes, Ji-won really wants Xiu-min
Break up with Bai Enhao?

730
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,010
- I don't know
-Ji Won

731
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,850
say what?

732
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,560
Eun-ho? Why are you here?

733
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:41,860
Hey, come here quickly, it's a mess here

734
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,950
What were you talking about?

735
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:51,570
Don't mention your ex-girlfriend Zheng Xiumin

736
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:54,740
-She conspired with Ji-won’s husband…
-etc

737
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:57,040
I have never dated Zheng Xiumin

738
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,870
Really?

739
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,790
You really haven't dated?

740
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,250
Really?

741
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:09,380
What I heard about Kang Ji-won's life that day
Leave me speechless

742
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:11,890
then

743
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:14,970
I regret everything madly

744
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:18,480
But…

745
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,230
I got a second chance

746
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,980
(April 19, 2013)

747
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:28,210
Looking back, I had a few chances.

748
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,510
But this time it's different

749
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,630
I am in a good mood indeed.

750
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,720
Ji-won, I tell you, men

751
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,260
All will cheat

752
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:38,470
Min-hwan, you need to take care of Ji-won

753
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,020
If something has changed

754
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,190
Things that weren't a problem before
It may become a problem

755
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,190
Where did you go after get off work? Tell me the truth.

756
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:49,320
I'm worried that Park Min-hwan will hurt you

757
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,820
Are you crazy?

758
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,740
minister!

759
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,330
