THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL,
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,660
TO ACTUAL PEOPLE, PLACES, INCIDENTS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND SETTINGS

12
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:00,745
This place sucks whenever I come here.

13
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:12,965
I'm Prosecutor Choi Tae-su
from Criminal Division 3.

14
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:25,019
You were born with a silver spoon.
You're pretty and probably well-mannered.

15
00:01:26,103 --> 00:01:29,440
Everyone treats you nicely,
so nothing's hard for you.

16
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:34,904
But things are different now.

17
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:39,909
Everyone thinks
this is just a formality, but...

18
00:01:39,992 --> 00:01:43,078
It is.
This investigation is just a formality.

19
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:47,458
Look here, Ms. Oh Yu-ra!

20
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,043
Look here, Prosecutor!

21
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:53,172
It's not the time for a mere prosecutor
to act up.

22
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:57,885
Do I look like a fool who'd be scared
after seeing you rush in here?

23
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:04,350
You're not sure about anything.

24
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:14,318
Would it be faster for me to say
what you want to hear out of fear,

25
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,155
or to get out of here on my own?

26
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:23,744
Do you want to bet?

27
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:45,099
- Goodbye, ma'am!
- Goodbye, ma'am!

28
00:02:52,398 --> 00:02:54,275
The world must be going crazy.

29
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:57,444
Everyone keeps crossing the line.

30
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:02,658
This is for the best.
They can't do anything with that file.

31
00:03:16,755 --> 00:03:20,634
You didn't have to come here.

32
00:03:21,427 --> 00:03:23,804
There was a misunderstanding.

33
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:28,517
I guess I'm not a great judge
of character.

34
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:29,643
Oh Yu-ra.

35
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:33,772
You crossed the line this time.

36
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:37,192
Turn in your resignation.

37
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:43,198
Don't think about exercising your rights
over the airline and tour company shares.

38
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:45,910
Soon,

39
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:49,830
U&K Foundation will send
a volunteer group to Africa. Join them.

40
00:03:49,914 --> 00:03:53,375
Go and volunteer and volunteer some more.

41
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:59,757
And once you've built character,
you can return then.

42
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,719
I gave you the position,
and it ruined you.

43
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:09,350
Still, it's a big privilege
to have another chance.

44
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:11,185
Keep that in mind.

45
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:15,272
No.

46
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:21,111
Why would I resign?
Why should I volunteer?

47
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,697
Africa?

48
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:31,080
Right. You must like her. Don't you?

49
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:37,044
Ji-hyuk is family after all,
so you want to let him do what he wants.

50
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:44,885
Do it, then.

51
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:52,851
But don't touch me.

52
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:54,770
What did I do wrong?

53
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:58,065
You're pretending to be fair.

54
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:00,442
But you're not.

55
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:19,586
I told him it'd be no use,
but he didn't know you at all.

56
00:05:21,797 --> 00:05:23,549
What the hell are you saying?

57
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:27,970
I'm exhausted. Let's talk tomorrow.

58
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:32,141
You shouldn't have messed with Ji-won.

59
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:37,896
What?

60
00:05:39,064 --> 00:05:40,774
What did I do?

61
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:45,237
No. Even if I did do something,
do you have proof?

62
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:47,573
Yes.

63
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:50,409
I do.

64
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,315
What's wrong? Did you see a ghost?

65
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:25,235
<i>What do I have to do?</i>

66
00:06:25,944 --> 00:06:27,780
Tell me what I don't know.

67
00:06:37,081 --> 00:06:38,874
- Are you crazy?
- Hurry!

68
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,101
Pay for what you did.

69
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:01,313
Your problem is thinking
you can do anything you want.

70
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,108
Stop trying to get away with it.

71
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:05,943
Pay properly.

72
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,695
Jeong Man-sik, Bae Hui-suk.

73
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:11,740
You're under arrest for attempted murder.

74
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:16,036
Yeah, yeah.
I'll tell you everything. Everything.

75
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,921
Now that Jeong Man-sik's showed up,
I'd like to talk to you again, Ms. Oh.

76
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:39,522
MARRY MY HUSBAND

77
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,249
Mom!

78
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,460
- Ju-ran.
- Princess.

79
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,137
Goodness.

80
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,307
Jeong Su-min did something like that?

81
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:08,190
Mr. Park's funeral was held
just downstairs, but I had no idea.

82
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:10,400
It feels strange.

83
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:12,986
If I had known, I would have--

84
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,863
You still shouldn't have.

85
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:18,825
You can't go to a funeral
before a major surgery.

86
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:23,497
You're nagging again.

87
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,415
The surgery went well.

88
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,584
Because the surgery went well.

89
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:31,129
You got scared and cried before.
Shall I keep going?

90
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,802
Anyway, since the SD card's data
was recovered,

91
00:09:36,885 --> 00:09:38,262
things got easier.

92
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:43,642
The court will take recent threats
into account seriously as well.

93
00:09:44,226 --> 00:09:45,352
It'll all work out.

94
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:49,523
You might be able to get
both parental rights and custody.

95
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,819
Well, let's make him
lose visitation rights as well.

96
00:09:54,945 --> 00:10:00,367
Then Yeon-ji will lose his father
for good.

97
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,043
You don't have to if you don't want to.

98
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:15,882
The choice is yours.

99
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,845
I'm happy about it.

100
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:29,229
When I got the surgery,

101
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:33,400
it felt like I was dying once.

102
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:38,030
Do I look like a bum?

103
00:10:38,113 --> 00:10:39,364
Do I play all day?

104
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:42,576
I couldn't see the end, so it was so hard.

105
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:46,246
Stop it!

106
00:10:48,498 --> 00:10:51,001
<i>I was even betrayed.</i>

107
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:58,508
But...

108
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,596
I got a new chance.

109
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,230
Lee Jae-won, that bastard.

110
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,026
He'll probably try to milk Yeon-ji later.

111
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,695
He'll never be helpful for her.

112
00:11:20,238 --> 00:11:22,407
I can't let her suffer like that.

113
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,701
He's nothing but a birth father.

114
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:28,747
I...

115
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,584
will stay strong.

116
00:11:34,503 --> 00:11:37,631
I'll try a little harder too.

117
00:11:56,191 --> 00:11:59,027
FINAL EPISODE

118
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:23,135
God, you scared me.

119
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:27,514
I'm sorry. I was just happy to see you.

120
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:34,563
Well, Ji-won wanted to finalize
the factory manufacturing recipe today.

121
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:38,066
She wanted to discuss that.
That's why I came.

122
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:40,068
Did she go somewhere?

123
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:44,156
Ms. Kang's meeting with
the development team is running late.

124
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:48,743
Sorry to disappoint you, but I'll explain.
Follow me this way.

125
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:58,044
The spinach pasta with sea snails,
the perilla cream pasta,

126
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:01,798
and the sweet pumpkin soup.
Please check the recipes again.

127
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,468
Also...

128
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:09,764
By the way,
did I do something wrong to you?

129
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:11,683
What?

130
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,270
I mean,
you weren't here when I came last time.

131
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,608
And you're being kind of unfriendly today.

132
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:22,569
I'm happy to see you.

133
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:28,909
I'm clueless,
so I wouldn't know if you don't tell me.

134
00:13:30,535 --> 00:13:34,581
So if I did something wrong, I'm sorry.

135
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,043
Even if didn't, I'm sorry.

136
00:13:39,878 --> 00:13:42,047
Did you notice I was away?

137
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,340
Of course.

138
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:45,133
I looked for you.

139
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:48,345
Why would you?

140
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:50,639
What?

141
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:54,559
Well...

142
00:13:54,643 --> 00:13:59,814
Right. I brought a Basque cake I made
last time and the time before.

143
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:01,650
Because...

144
00:14:03,235 --> 00:14:06,446
I remembered how you loved it.

145
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,324
Who's the person
that sent such a great cake?

146
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,535
This is love itself!

147
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:17,123
I bought a new oven,
and it's insanely good, you know.

148
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:22,087
So whatever dish I make,
it tastes three times as good.

149
00:14:22,587 --> 00:14:25,715
I guess it's why I kept cooking.

150
00:14:26,758 --> 00:14:28,593
By the way, your ears...

151
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:30,971
are so big and pretty.

152
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,308
What are you doing?

153
00:14:36,935 --> 00:14:39,854
You can't touch someone's ear like that.

154
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,315
Why not?

155
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:45,110
What? I don't know.

156
00:14:45,193 --> 00:14:47,195
But you can't do it.

157
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:49,406
Can I touch your hands, then?

158
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:53,243
Of course. You can touch my hands,
but my ears are sensitive...

159
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:11,886
I think I like you.

160
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:14,180
What?

161
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:40,498
When it comes to life,

162
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:43,084
you can't have both.

163
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:45,211
What I mean is,

164
00:15:45,962 --> 00:15:48,798
as long as he inherits U&K,

165
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,301
it won't be easy to harmonize

166
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:56,389
your personal happiness
and his social responsibilities.

167
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:04,481
What?

168
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:08,068
It's just that...

169
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:13,365
The way you speak is
very similar to the way Ji-hyuk does.

170
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,662
He does talk kind of like Grandfather.

171
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,833
See! Look at that!

172
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:27,295
See! They have the same tastes!
Look at their pick.

173
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:29,381
I'm disappointed in you, Grandfather.

174
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:36,763
I'll try very hard.

175
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:42,018
I know I was given a precious opportunity.

176
00:16:42,686 --> 00:16:47,232
I'll make sure to be less greedy
and more generous in life.

177
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:51,403
Do you think it's that easy?

178
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:54,864
If it doesn't work...

179
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:01,371
I'll try harder!

180
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:15,844
Can I continue eating now?

181
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:18,847
Sure, eat up.
I guess I spoke for too long.

182
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:24,269
I'm sorry. I talked too much.

183
00:17:39,617 --> 00:17:40,827
Thank you.

184
00:17:41,453 --> 00:17:44,247
Now, let's toast to Chef Eun-ho's success!

185
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,207
And to a successful divorce!

186
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,793
And to successful love! Let's go!

187
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:50,253
Cheers!

188
00:17:57,385 --> 00:17:59,304
Beer tastes the best this way.

189
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:04,893
Don't be surprised. This must be
his first time eating food like this.

190
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:09,272
What are you talking about? He eats
pork <i>gukbap </i>with tons of <i>jeongguji</i>.

191
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:15,653
Tons of what? What's that?

192
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:19,824
She doesn't know what it is.
It's no use talking to her.

193
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:21,242
You're right.

194
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,624
I really feel like
I came back from the dead.

195
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,836
I'm surprised by you two,
but how are you two siblings?

196
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:35,215
They don't look alike at all.

197
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:38,968
What? You said we did!

198
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,512
- I did?
- Yeah.

199
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:42,597
- When?
- You don't remember?

200
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:49,103
It's strange that you're here too,
Mr. Lee.

201
00:18:51,022 --> 00:18:54,609
Let me be clear.
I'm not here for you, Ms. Yang.

202
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:58,446
- I work for the U&K family--
- Yes. That's what I meant.

203
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:04,869
You're an incredible person
to the U&K family.

204
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:08,623
But Mr. Yu is a member of the family,

205
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:12,752
thus you're here. That's very surprising.

206
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:20,093
Wait, am I being too comfortable now?

207
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:25,265
I'm part of the owner's family too.

208
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:30,645
Also, Mr. Lee wouldn't come to an occasion
like this even if the owner told him to--

209
00:19:34,357 --> 00:19:38,486
It's part of my job to make sure
the owner's family watch what they say.

210
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:48,329
Is he always like that?

211
00:19:55,378 --> 00:19:56,462
It's so good.

212
00:19:56,546 --> 00:19:58,089
We ordered everything in.

213
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,634
<i>- Bye.
- Get home safe.</i>

214
00:20:01,718 --> 00:20:02,760
<i>It's raining.</i>

215
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:08,808
What do we do?

216
00:20:08,892 --> 00:20:11,144
We only have two umbrellas.

217
00:20:11,227 --> 00:20:13,313
I drove here, so I'm good.

218
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:17,233
It's on my way...

219
00:20:20,528 --> 00:20:22,447
What's on your way?

220
00:20:23,072 --> 00:20:25,992
If you mean my home,
you could give me a ride.

221
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:31,164
I can just run and catch the bus.

222
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:35,460
Why don't I give you a ride?
If that's okay with you.

223
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:37,337
It's the opposite direction.

224
00:20:40,882 --> 00:20:42,342
Shall I?

225
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:43,426
That works out.

226
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,054
The elevator's here.

227
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:50,350
Thanks for coming today.

228
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:51,517
Get home safe.

229
00:20:51,601 --> 00:20:53,269
Have a good rest, Ms. Kang.

230
00:20:54,062 --> 00:20:56,272
And Ji-hyuk, you rest or whatever.

231
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:04,906
But why are
Eun-ho and Hui-yeon going together?

232
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:08,701
And toasted for successful love.
What was that about?

233
00:21:08,785 --> 00:21:11,037
My goodness, you're so clueless.

234
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,374
I'm going in.

235
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:21,714
Eun-ho likes Hui-yeon? Why?

236
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,468
I don't understand.

237
00:22:32,744 --> 00:22:34,037
Be careful.

238
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,038
What are you doing?

239
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,999
Are you up?

240
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:23,544
It would've been better
to stay unconscious.

241
00:23:30,468 --> 00:23:32,762
Fire spreads more because of curtains.

242
00:23:34,388 --> 00:23:36,432
Sturdy buildings are insulated...

243
00:23:42,897 --> 00:23:45,441
You need to study to do anything.

244
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,791
Ji-won.

245
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:05,878
I'm sorry.

246
00:24:06,462 --> 00:24:07,755
I'm sorry.

247
00:24:09,674 --> 00:24:11,050
We can't do anything about it now.

248
00:24:11,134 --> 00:24:12,635
We can't do anything about it now.

249
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:14,387
You always think only about yourself.

250
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,305
You always think only about yourself.

251
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,196
You really do live up to my expectations.

252
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,825
What?

253
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:41,914
I was worried
that you'd be a little smarter.

254
00:24:41,998 --> 00:24:43,124
But...

255
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:46,002
I overestimated you.

256
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,382
This is the best you can do.

257
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:54,886
Seeing you hit rock bottom like this...

258
00:24:57,054 --> 00:24:59,849
It suits you more than anything.

259
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:07,857
Stop acting tough.

260
00:25:08,816 --> 00:25:10,526
You're the worst here.

261
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:14,322
You dumped Min-hwan on me
knowing he was trash.

262
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:16,532
Look at you now.

263
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:21,245
You threw me in the garbage
and took everything good for yourself.

264
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:25,499
Is that why you killed Min-hwan?

265
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:27,752
Why shouldn't I?

266
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:31,422
He tried to kill me first.

267
00:25:32,882 --> 00:25:35,301
It doesn't matter. There's no proof.

268
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:42,183
I'll turn myself in. I'll say
it was an accident and I ran out of fear.

269
00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:45,686
If I pretend to regret it so much,

270
00:25:47,563 --> 00:25:52,902
as always, people will take pity on me.

271
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:57,823
Right.

272
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,993
You're good at playing the victim.

273
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,251
I did it.

274
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,839
I won.

275
00:26:27,061 --> 00:26:30,189
No, I won.

276
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:53,379
I learned so many things because of you.

277
00:26:54,463 --> 00:26:56,340
You knew I was coming?

278
00:26:57,216 --> 00:27:00,261
You dragged me around
and took everything from me.

279
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:04,056
I felt so sorry for myself.

280
00:27:05,141 --> 00:27:08,269
So I decided to face you this time
instead of running.

281
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:16,902
Don't hide behind me
or anyone else anymore.

282
00:27:18,988 --> 00:27:20,948
You face the consequences

283
00:27:21,532 --> 00:27:23,034
of your actions now.

284
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:26,495
Face the consequences?

285
00:27:28,622 --> 00:27:30,124
I'll get manslaughter.

286
00:27:34,211 --> 00:27:35,338
Just you wait.

287
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:40,509
It's not manslaughter anymore.

288
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:44,847
You...

289
00:27:46,682 --> 00:27:50,269
just made the evidence
with your own mouth.

290
00:28:09,372 --> 00:28:12,083
PENSION MURDER CASE

291
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:14,126
MURDER SUSPECT ON THE LOOSE

292
00:28:15,086 --> 00:28:18,255
I first met her in the bathroom at work.

293
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:22,426
When I got out of the stall,
she covered me with her cardigan.

294
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,636
I thought,

295
00:28:24,178 --> 00:28:25,721
"I found my sister."

296
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:27,556
- Stop it.
- It was that moment.

297
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:31,977
But my brother said he liked her, so...

298
00:28:32,061 --> 00:28:34,271
Jeong Su-min bought thinner?

299
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:38,609
Yes, the police are strengthening
their search around there.

300
00:28:38,692 --> 00:28:41,112
I asked them to watch the house too.

301
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:44,031
We'll add more security as well.

302
00:28:46,784 --> 00:28:48,327
It's better you don't.

303
00:28:50,037 --> 00:28:52,498
She's coming for me. Let her.

304
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:56,836
I'm against this.

305
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,797
When I said I'd do everything you wanted,

306
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,550
I didn't mean
I'd let dangerous things happen.

307
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,844
I'm not saying to stand aside.

308
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:08,097
She bought thinner.
That means she'll set a fire.

309
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,433
What's the use of
stopping her from coming?

310
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:12,977
- Ji-won.
- How long will you block her?

311
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,728
How long will we run away?

312
00:29:18,607 --> 00:29:20,776
When I got another chance at life,

313
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,154
I promised not to run away anymore.

314
00:29:24,613 --> 00:29:26,365
Then I'll do it.

315
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:27,741
I'll lure her and...

316
00:29:27,825 --> 00:29:30,244
Do you think she'll show herself to you?

317
00:29:33,831 --> 00:29:36,876
She's trying to ruin me.

318
00:29:39,253 --> 00:29:40,838
I have to deal with her.

319
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:53,851
I'll go crazy because of you.

320
00:30:22,171 --> 00:30:24,298
You want me to practice this?

321
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:26,967
- Now, one!
- One!

322
00:30:27,051 --> 00:30:30,763
<i>We did what you wanted.
Let me do what I want this time.</i>

323
00:30:30,846 --> 00:30:32,431
- One.
- Two.

324
00:30:35,392 --> 00:30:37,061
Next, one!

325
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:39,605
Two!

326
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:46,695
It's okay. One more time. Shout properly.

327
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:48,739
- One!
- One!

328
00:30:48,822 --> 00:30:49,907
Two!

329
00:31:05,756 --> 00:31:09,009
This is the price for your sins
and hell I made for you.

330
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,221
Take it.

331
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:20,354
Ms. Jeong Su-min.

332
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,692
You're under arrest for murder
and attempted arson.

333
00:31:24,775 --> 00:31:27,903
You have the right to an attorney,
to defend yourself,

334
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:31,156
to file a false arrest suit,
and to remail silent.

335
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,411
What are you doing? Take her.

336
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:36,328
No.

337
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:39,540
It wasn't me.

338
00:31:39,623 --> 00:31:41,333
Kang Ji-won set this up!

339
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:42,626
It wasn't me!

340
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:46,589
It was her! It was Kang Ji-won!

341
00:31:47,256 --> 00:31:48,257
It wasn't me!

342
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,466
We'll call you.

343
00:31:58,434 --> 00:31:59,727
It's all over now.

344
00:32:18,983 --> 00:32:21,820
Only good things will happen from now on.

345
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:25,949
I'll make sure of that.

346
00:32:33,248 --> 00:32:34,874
I'll protect you forever.

347
00:32:40,255 --> 00:32:42,465
So don't think about it anymore.

348
00:32:45,677 --> 00:32:48,972
You took back what was rightfully yours.

349
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:54,894
And I got an opportunity that wasn't mine.

350
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,193
That's why I have you in my arms.

351
00:33:08,575 --> 00:33:11,119
So you have to be better to me.

352
00:33:13,288 --> 00:33:15,081
How can I do that?

353
00:33:21,588 --> 00:33:22,630
Like this?

354
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:26,384
Or...

355
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,221
like this?

356
00:34:02,629 --> 00:34:05,131
Prosecutor Choi applied
for your travel ban.

357
00:34:05,632 --> 00:34:07,592
You must leave the country today.

358
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:09,010
What time's the flight?

359
00:34:09,093 --> 00:34:13,389
Flights three and four hours from now.
I booked each one. Let's hurry.

360
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:19,020
You can't do anything right.

361
00:34:20,063 --> 00:34:21,064
You're fired.

362
00:34:23,107 --> 00:34:24,359
Give me the tickets.

363
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:20,415
DAD

364
00:36:24,687 --> 00:36:25,688
Ji-won.

365
00:36:28,232 --> 00:36:30,318
What is it? Is something wrong?

366
00:36:34,948 --> 00:36:36,199
It's gone.

367
00:36:54,842 --> 00:36:57,387
<i>Former Vice President Oh Yu-ra
of Cloud Air</i>

368
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:00,473
<i>was in a car accident
near Incheon Airport.</i>

369
00:37:00,556 --> 00:37:04,018
<i>She was transferred to the hospital
but ended up dead.</i>

370
00:37:04,102 --> 00:37:06,771
<i>She was being investigated
by the prosecution</i>

371
00:37:06,854 --> 00:37:09,732
<i>for the dump truck attempted murder case.</i>

372
00:37:09,816 --> 00:37:12,777
<i>She denied the charges
and pled not guilty,</i>

373
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:17,865
<i>but the prosecution secured the evidence
and applied for Oh's travel ban.</i>

374
00:37:17,949 --> 00:37:22,620
<i>After the accident, her family accused
the prosecution of unreasonable methods.</i>

375
00:37:22,704 --> 00:37:26,916
<i>The prosecution has expressed
their regret over Oh's death</i>

376
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,211
<i>but said
they'd get to the bottom of the accident.</i>

377
00:37:37,927 --> 00:37:42,140
SEOUL ADMINISTRATIVE COURT

378
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:53,609
Congratulations on your divorce.

379
00:37:56,487 --> 00:37:57,488
Hooray!

380
00:38:00,033 --> 00:38:03,202
Thank you. It was all thanks to you.

381
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:22,555
It's hot outside. Do you want a ride?

382
00:38:23,598 --> 00:38:28,019
No, I'm spending my first day as a single
with my friends.

383
00:38:30,104 --> 00:38:31,481
I should go.

384
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:47,455
I'll buy you a meal.

385
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:49,540
Nothing too expensive.

386
00:38:49,624 --> 00:38:51,292
A moderately expensive meal.

387
00:38:52,752 --> 00:38:53,669
Can I do that?

388
00:39:00,218 --> 00:39:01,511
Thanks.

389
00:39:01,594 --> 00:39:05,306
CAMELLIA
GRAND OPEN

390
00:39:05,389 --> 00:39:08,017
- Hi.
- Ms. Yang!

391
00:39:08,851 --> 00:39:09,852
Come on.

392
00:39:09,936 --> 00:39:12,105
- This is nice.
- Right?

393
00:39:13,356 --> 00:39:15,483
Okay, since my precious friend

394
00:39:15,566 --> 00:39:19,278
opened a new restaurant,
I'll buy the most expensive dish!

395
00:39:20,571 --> 00:39:22,198
Are you sure?

396
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:25,326
Then, to all the special people
who helped me make

397
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:28,579
the most successful
and best meal kit I could,

398
00:39:28,663 --> 00:39:31,707
I'll give you the most expensive dish
on the house!

399
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:35,878
If Eun-ho's paying, what shall we pick?

400
00:39:35,962 --> 00:39:37,338
No.

401
00:39:37,421 --> 00:39:42,260
To celebrate my divorce, I'm paying.
So let's have the most expensive dish.

402
00:39:42,343 --> 00:39:44,053
Good days deserve good food.

403
00:39:46,013 --> 00:39:47,849
It's so beautiful here.

404
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:49,851
It's the best.

405
00:39:50,393 --> 00:39:52,645
- I'll get you good wine.
- Okay, thanks.

406
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:21,257
The turkey looks too full.
Isn't that too much?

407
00:40:22,383 --> 00:40:23,718
It's not.

408
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:25,720
Just wait.

409
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:28,890
I have my own method for this.

410
00:40:28,973 --> 00:40:31,392
My father taught it to me.

411
00:40:32,185 --> 00:40:35,563
And when I have kids later,
I'll teach them too.

412
00:40:38,024 --> 00:40:39,150
That's right.

413
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:41,611
Have you thought of cute baby names?

414
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,423
I'm not saying
we should have kids right away.

415
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:04,675
Well... I just thought

416
00:41:04,759 --> 00:41:10,389
it'd be nice to take our time
thinking of good names together.

417
00:41:11,474 --> 00:41:13,643
I know,

418
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:17,063
but we don't know what will happen.

419
00:41:17,647 --> 00:41:20,942
And thinking about baby names beforehand
is a little...

420
00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:22,443
It's so significant...

421
00:41:29,283 --> 00:41:31,077
You don't know what will happen?

422
00:41:43,756 --> 00:41:45,258
Look at us right now.

423
00:41:49,262 --> 00:41:50,263
We do this.

424
00:41:52,265 --> 00:41:53,266
We do this too.

425
00:41:56,769 --> 00:41:57,812
We even do this.

426
00:41:59,397 --> 00:42:00,523
You really don't know?

427
00:42:01,899 --> 00:42:03,234
Shall I tell you?

428
00:42:04,235 --> 00:42:05,486
Shall I teach you?

429
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:09,073
<i>Dad, I'm so happy now.</i>

430
00:42:09,156 --> 00:42:11,242
BAEK EUN-HO SELLS 5 MILLION MEAL KITS

431
00:42:13,411 --> 00:42:15,538
10TH SUPPLY BATCH SOLD OUT

432
00:42:17,957 --> 00:42:20,876
Marketing Team 1.
Let's go taste the new products.

433
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:25,589
<i>It's not that I've become someone great.</i>

434
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:28,759
<i>I'm still just Kang Ji-won.</i>

435
00:42:38,185 --> 00:42:39,895
This should be had with beer.

436
00:42:41,272 --> 00:42:42,481
It's good.

437
00:42:42,565 --> 00:42:45,192
This is salty and spicy.

438
00:42:45,276 --> 00:42:48,279
I think it'll be good
with <i>makgeolli</i>. Right?

439
00:42:48,362 --> 00:42:49,780
- Yeah.
- Right?

440
00:42:49,864 --> 00:42:52,450
I think we can use storytelling

441
00:42:52,533 --> 00:42:55,036
as the marketing point for this product.

442
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,622
The story of the sisters who developed it
is interesting.

443
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,712
I'll look into it.

444
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,553
This is delicious.

445
00:43:12,636 --> 00:43:14,472
Aren't we working right now?

446
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:20,061
But Ms. Yang told me to bring beer.

447
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,488
Ms. Kang.

448
00:43:31,197 --> 00:43:32,198
I...

449
00:43:35,284 --> 00:43:37,411
Thanks for entrusting me with the snack.

450
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,748
You work hard lately.

451
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:42,333
No, wait.

452
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,338
About the meal kit project...

453
00:43:48,381 --> 00:43:50,591
I interfered in the middle and...

454
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,679
I wanted to say sorry.

455
00:43:57,765 --> 00:43:59,016
I knew.

456
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:03,771
But we gained better results from it,
so I decided to let it go.

457
00:44:06,899 --> 00:44:10,152
But you're incredible.
I didn't think you'd admit to it.

458
00:44:10,903 --> 00:44:12,530
I misjudged you.

459
00:44:13,823 --> 00:44:15,324
When it comes to people,

460
00:44:16,575 --> 00:44:18,744
they change for sure with age.

461
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:23,916
I believed in love, but it failed me.

462
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:27,086
After everything that happened,

463
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:29,922
I reflected on myself...

464
00:44:31,424 --> 00:44:35,719
I pondered who I was as a person,

465
00:44:37,346 --> 00:44:38,639
and figured it out.

466
00:44:39,473 --> 00:44:41,851
Mr. Kim. Shall we go to your seat?

467
00:44:41,934 --> 00:44:43,102
- Shall we?
- Sure.

468
00:44:43,185 --> 00:44:45,062
Shall we smoke first?

469
00:44:45,146 --> 00:44:47,606
<i>But a lot of things have changed.</i>

470
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:51,026
Here we go.

471
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:52,445
It's hot.

472
00:44:54,864 --> 00:44:56,782
- Thank you for the meal!
- Wait.

473
00:45:01,704 --> 00:45:03,914
You need to add a lot of <i>jeongguji.</i>

474
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:07,835
Well?

475
00:45:08,794 --> 00:45:11,464
You don't know how to eat pork <i>gukbap</i>.

476
00:45:14,884 --> 00:45:15,885
I'll try it.

477
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:28,981
I know this taste.

478
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:35,404
Is this from the restaurant we went to?

479
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:39,033
Nothing gets past your tastebuds.

480
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:42,244
After the restaurant was gone,

481
00:45:42,328 --> 00:45:45,456
I looked for restaurants
that made it like them.

482
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:48,042
I couldn't find anything similar.

483
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:51,962
I was like, "It's Busan!
Why can't these restaurants make it?"

484
00:45:55,382 --> 00:45:57,426
"Why are they all different?" And...

485
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:04,892
You don't have to gobble it up.
You can eat it whenever you want now.

486
00:46:07,853 --> 00:46:11,815
They opened a branch in Seoul.
Just five minutes from here.

487
00:46:16,904 --> 00:46:17,821
No way...

488
00:46:18,948 --> 00:46:23,619
I thought of stopping the redevelopment.
But this method was much easier.

489
00:46:24,703 --> 00:46:26,330
That's okay, right?

490
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:33,212
Aren't you so impressed?

491
00:46:33,963 --> 00:46:37,508
No, I was thinking about telling you
what I want to eat next.

492
00:46:37,591 --> 00:46:38,592
What?

493
00:46:38,676 --> 00:46:40,553
I was just kidding.

494
00:46:40,636 --> 00:46:43,222
Thank you so much.

495
00:46:43,305 --> 00:46:44,598
Eat slowly.

496
00:46:44,682 --> 00:46:46,141
I'll eat it every day.

497
00:46:46,684 --> 00:46:47,893
It's so good.

498
00:46:50,187 --> 00:46:51,522
Right, Ji-hyuk.

499
00:46:52,481 --> 00:46:54,400
What are you doing this weekend?

500
00:46:55,568 --> 00:46:57,653
I want to go somewhere with you.

501
00:47:23,637 --> 00:47:29,059
<i>When I was young,
I always felt anxious and lonely.</i>

502
00:47:31,437 --> 00:47:32,438
But...

503
00:47:34,273 --> 00:47:38,152
I'm not anxious or lonely anymore.

504
00:47:42,448 --> 00:47:44,325
Since I have you beside me.

505
00:47:47,453 --> 00:47:49,413
It's no surprise.

506
00:47:49,496 --> 00:47:52,499
I'm the best allowance your dad picked
to give you.

507
00:47:59,798 --> 00:48:00,799
This...

508
00:48:02,635 --> 00:48:04,762
is where we started.

509
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:11,602
I want to start our new start here too.

510
00:48:21,403 --> 00:48:22,404
Ji-hyuk.

511
00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:30,829
Will you marry me?

512
00:48:46,762 --> 00:48:48,222
I can't believe you.

513
00:48:55,938 --> 00:48:57,147
No, I mean...

514
00:48:58,524 --> 00:49:01,110
That's just how I feel now.

515
00:49:01,193 --> 00:49:04,697
You don't have to give me an answer now.

516
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,658
How could you just leave like that?

517
00:49:07,741 --> 00:49:12,663
I thought everything was back,
but he's still himself.

518
00:49:21,338 --> 00:49:23,006
You can do whatever you want

519
00:49:24,174 --> 00:49:25,634
but not a proposal.

520
00:49:45,112 --> 00:49:47,114
I've been carrying it for so long.

521
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,578
I wanted to propose all this time.

522
00:50:05,382 --> 00:50:06,383
Wil you...

523
00:50:11,263 --> 00:50:12,473
marry me?

524
00:51:00,835 --> 00:51:04,213
<i>Of course,
there are things that didn't change.</i>

525
00:51:04,297 --> 00:51:06,466
A BETTER TOMORROW, CORRECTION OF HOPE

526
00:51:06,549 --> 00:51:08,259
<i>I don't know why.</i>

527
00:51:10,664 --> 00:51:12,374
Why Ji-won wants

528
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:18,004
to take everything I have.
Why she wants me to be miserable.

529
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,716
It's because you're too nice.

530
00:51:21,258 --> 00:51:24,469
People like her only go after nice people.

531
00:51:24,553 --> 00:51:25,804
You have to nip them

532
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,764
in the bud.

533
00:51:29,015 --> 00:51:31,184
How could a person do that?

534
00:51:32,102 --> 00:51:35,188
I could endure all of that.

535
00:51:35,856 --> 00:51:36,857
However...

536
00:51:39,067 --> 00:51:40,736
Do you remember

537
00:51:42,946 --> 00:51:46,241
when I told you
about Ji-won being delusional?

538
00:51:47,367 --> 00:51:49,911
She kept saying I was gaslighting her.

539
00:51:49,995 --> 00:51:53,123
That I was harassing her
and ruining her life.

540
00:51:53,206 --> 00:51:55,250
She acted like a victim,

541
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:57,419
and that's why I ended up here.

542
00:51:57,502 --> 00:52:00,505
Goodness, not only is she crazy,

543
00:52:00,589 --> 00:52:02,507
she's also so pathetic.

544
00:52:03,341 --> 00:52:04,551
I know, right?

545
00:52:05,761 --> 00:52:07,304
But what can I do?

546
00:52:07,387 --> 00:52:10,265
I'm her only friend.

547
00:52:10,348 --> 00:52:12,350
I'll talk to her when I get out.

548
00:52:17,731 --> 00:52:19,149
<i>Inmate 2574, visitor.</i>

549
00:52:25,614 --> 00:52:27,157
Why are you so surprised?

550
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,581
You...

551
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:43,757
You didn't die?

552
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,551
I did. That's why I'm here.

553
00:52:50,972 --> 00:52:51,932
One billion won.

554
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:57,145
Now that I'm dead, the benefit
of one billion won will be paid.

555
00:53:00,565 --> 00:53:01,775
Can you...

556
00:53:03,568 --> 00:53:05,028
give this to Ji-won?

557
00:53:08,532 --> 00:53:09,574
What?

558
00:53:13,245 --> 00:53:14,538
No.

559
00:53:15,372 --> 00:53:16,998
Why is it Ji-won again?

560
00:53:17,082 --> 00:53:19,584
- I'll kill her!
- <i>Executive Director Yu Ji-hyuk,</i>

561
00:53:19,668 --> 00:53:22,045
<i>the grandson of U&K Group's Chairman Yu,</i>

562
00:53:22,128 --> 00:53:25,298
<i>- is getting married at Winton Hotel.</i>
- I only had Ji-won!

563
00:53:25,382 --> 00:53:27,384
She felt the same!

564
00:53:27,467 --> 00:53:30,387
I only had Ji-won!

565
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:31,680
Quiet!

566
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:34,641
Ma'am, please let me go! Please!

567
00:53:35,225 --> 00:53:37,102
Let me out of here! Please!

568
00:53:39,855 --> 00:53:41,439
Ji-won can't be happy.

569
00:53:42,023 --> 00:53:45,652
She can't be happy without me!

570
00:53:45,735 --> 00:53:47,279
She can't!

571
00:53:59,708 --> 00:54:02,085
WEDDING
YU JI-HYUK, KANG JI-WON

572
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,794
Here come the bride and groom.

573
00:56:38,867 --> 00:56:41,077
<i>Everything got a little better.</i>

574
00:56:41,786 --> 00:56:43,621
<i>I believe that.</i>

575
00:57:20,366 --> 00:57:22,535
<i>I wish you were here.</i>

576
00:57:24,954 --> 00:57:29,292
<i>You would be so happy
to see me this happy.</i>

577
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:35,590
Hey. You all came too.

578
00:57:36,633 --> 00:57:39,010
No, we didn't come.

579
00:57:40,887 --> 00:57:43,389
I paid a lot for her congratulatory gift.

580
00:57:43,473 --> 00:57:44,849
I applauded a lot too.

581
00:57:45,683 --> 00:57:47,227
But I didn't eat anything.

582
00:57:52,107 --> 00:57:55,193
The more I think about it,
the sorrier I feel.

583
00:57:55,276 --> 00:57:57,529
And I truly hope she's happy.

584
00:57:59,572 --> 00:58:02,534
But that's the only thing I can do.

585
00:58:03,076 --> 00:58:04,410
You truly regret it.

586
00:58:07,872 --> 00:58:10,208
One, two, three.

587
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:12,961
<i>Dad, are you watching?</i>

588
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:17,924
Let's go!

589
00:58:22,345 --> 00:58:24,889
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

590
00:58:43,616 --> 00:58:47,537
APRIL 2016

591
00:58:53,001 --> 00:58:58,882
Hello, I'm Kang Ji-won, the director
of U&K's Second Chance Foundation.

592
00:59:01,593 --> 00:59:04,637
Our foundation's planning
to gradually contribute

593
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:08,725
20 billion won through
major affiliated companies by next year.

594
00:59:09,684 --> 00:59:10,852
From there,

595
00:59:10,935 --> 00:59:15,607
U&K plans to initiate systematic
and continuous donations to the society

596
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:19,319
as a company that understands
the meaning of sharing.

597
00:59:22,238 --> 00:59:26,826
Even in moments
when everything seems to be over,

598
00:59:27,493 --> 00:59:29,829
I believe there's another path.

599
00:59:30,872 --> 00:59:32,874
That path could even be better.

600
00:59:36,502 --> 00:59:38,963
There must be a second chance.

601
00:59:39,047 --> 00:59:41,382
No, it must be given.

602
00:59:41,466 --> 00:59:45,261
To those suffering
because of one wrong choice they made,

603
00:59:45,345 --> 00:59:49,849
I hope our foundation can be of help.

604
00:59:51,726 --> 00:59:52,644
Thank you.

605
01:00:04,989 --> 01:00:07,575
<i>I'm doing well this time, right?</i>

606
01:00:09,494 --> 01:00:10,370
<i>But...</i>

607
01:00:10,453 --> 01:00:14,791
OCTOBER 2017

608
01:00:35,937 --> 01:00:38,398
Do babies really not sleep like this?

609
01:00:41,734 --> 01:00:42,819
Ji-won.

610
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,989
Seeing the baby cry like this,

611
01:00:46,489 --> 01:00:49,242
I think he's sick.
Let's take him to the hospital.

612
01:00:50,118 --> 01:00:51,160
Let me see.

613
01:00:55,873 --> 01:00:57,208
He's fine.

614
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:03,089
He pooped.

615
01:01:12,515 --> 01:01:14,142
- Number two.
- He pooped a lot.

616
01:01:14,225 --> 01:01:15,143
Hurry.

617
01:01:19,897 --> 01:01:21,607
Why won't you sleep?

618
01:01:22,483 --> 01:01:24,527
Did you poop?

619
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:27,155
Daddy will change your diaper.

620
01:01:27,238 --> 01:01:30,575
<i>I've never done this before,
so it's not easy.</i>

621
01:01:30,658 --> 01:01:32,744
<i>But I think I'm doing a good job.</i>

622
01:01:49,677 --> 01:01:54,057
<i>I am definitely moving forward
little by little now.</i>

623
01:01:56,768 --> 01:02:01,189
<i>I'm not walking in place.
I'm walking forward.</i>

624
01:02:07,528 --> 01:02:09,697
I want to be land.

625
01:02:09,781 --> 01:02:11,991
I want to be land.

626
01:02:12,075 --> 01:02:15,370
- What are they saying?
- What? Land? Lamb?

627
01:02:16,454 --> 01:02:18,831
But why does it sound familiar?

628
01:02:18,915 --> 01:02:20,958
Where are our mom and dad?

629
01:02:22,293 --> 01:02:25,338
I don't know.
They said it was their anniversary.

630
01:02:25,421 --> 01:02:28,007
A super important
and once-only anniversary.

631
01:02:29,634 --> 01:02:30,510
Grandfather.

632
01:02:32,845 --> 01:02:35,390
So you can play with your aunt!

633
01:02:41,145 --> 01:02:42,146
Come here!

634
01:02:42,772 --> 01:02:43,773
This way!

635
01:02:44,774 --> 01:02:46,692
Grandfather, save us!

636
01:02:46,776 --> 01:02:47,902
Help us!

637
01:02:47,985 --> 01:02:50,905
OUR FAMILY MOTTO:
BECOME EACH OTHER'S STURDY LAND!

638
01:02:50,988 --> 01:02:52,407
I WANT TO BE LAND!

639
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:58,955
APRIL 12, 2023

640
01:03:10,383 --> 01:03:15,430
<i>And today is the day that all the seasons
I have spent before ended.</i>

641
01:03:17,181 --> 01:03:22,061
<i>I can't believe I can spend
the same season so differently like this.</i>

642
01:03:31,988 --> 01:03:33,739
This is the middle of spring.

643
01:03:37,743 --> 01:03:39,245
It's beautiful.

644
01:03:40,455 --> 01:03:43,040
I've always liked this artist.

645
01:03:43,124 --> 01:03:46,043
But I think the painting style
has changed a bit.

646
01:03:46,836 --> 01:03:50,590
The painter worked so hard
until the work was acknowledged.

647
01:03:52,091 --> 01:03:55,553
Thanks to our foundation,
the painter could work at ease.

648
01:03:57,096 --> 01:03:58,973
It's back to normal now.

649
01:04:00,099 --> 01:04:01,934
This was how it should've been.

650
01:04:03,311 --> 01:04:07,231
It could've been this beautiful.

651
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:13,237
<i>I'm living properly now, Dad.</i>

652
01:04:21,287 --> 01:04:22,288
Thank you.

653
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:28,377
For making April 12, 2023

654
01:04:30,254 --> 01:04:32,131
a completely different day.

655
01:04:38,638 --> 01:04:39,847
Thank you...

656
01:04:44,143 --> 01:04:47,188
for making me look forward to tomorrow.

657
01:05:14,924 --> 01:05:16,259
I'm so happy.

658
01:07:02,572 --> 01:07:06,939
WE HOPE IT WAS A HOPEFUL EIGHT WEEKS
FOR EVERYONE WHO NEEDED A SECOND CHANCE

659
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:09,794
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
