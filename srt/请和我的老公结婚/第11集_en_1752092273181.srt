1
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,100
What is supposed to happen will eventually happen

2
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,150
Ever since my dad passed away

3
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,740
I feel like I'm on a boat every day

4
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,950
I want to be happy

5
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,590
I want stability

6
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,340
I want to step on the land

7
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,400
I'm not a person suitable for love

8
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,030
Because I want you to be happy

9
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,790
You will regret it

10
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,000
I won't regret it

11
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,240
Episode 11

12
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,060
Original work: NAVER online novel series, "Marry My Husband" by Cheng

13
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,030
Hello everyone

14
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,910
Hello, Yang Zhulan

15
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,700
Are you coming to work now?

16
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,030
That's terrible.

17
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,620
Yang Zhulan, you can't do this

18
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,710
Section chief is a management level

19
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,210
You have to come first

20
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,540
First turn on the computer

21
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,671
And I didn't want to say this.

22
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:36,634
You wrote in your business email at Trader Joe’s, “Let me know if you need anything.”

23
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,971
So, if someone asks you to do something, you will do it all? Is that right?

24
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:45,059
Well, women have this problem anyway.

25
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,860
If you act like this, not only will you harm yourself, but also our entire team.

26
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,690
I'm speechless.

27
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,070
Section Chief Jin... No, he is now Agent Jin

28
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,660
When Agent Jin was the section chief, I never saw him turn on the computer first.

29
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,410
I think you have to point out his attitude problem once.

30
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Now the official personnel order has come down.

31
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,210
But from Chief Kim's perspective...

32
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,460
What is Chief Jin? He is Agent Jin

33
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,800
For the sake of harmony in the group, it is still necessary to clarify the upper and lower levels

34
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,890
Even if you don't mind, it will be difficult for new people to adapt to the group.

35
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,850
Excuse me

36
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,650
Jin Jingxu is really annoying

37
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,400
-Yeah, that guy is really

38
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,740
How can he be so confident? On what basis can he be so confident?

39
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,410
Doesn't he have any sense of shame?

40
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,490
He must be crazy, otherwise he wouldn't be like that.

41
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,290
You are too outrageous.

42
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,660
I was promoted to section chief.

43
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,710
How could I possibly leave at five?

44
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,130
The working time is six o'clock...

45
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,500
My benefactor, you may not know

46
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,460
I had a really bad temper when I was a kid.

47
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,550
My grandfather always stressed to me the importance of patience.

48
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,180
I took his words to heart...

49
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,850
When did I look down on you?

50
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,720
I'm not playing

51
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,890
Is this delicious?

52
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,560
Mm, delicious, a lot like coffee

53
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,280
-Thank you. -I want one too.

54
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,570
Cheer me up

55
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,570
I think I'll have to come after get off work.

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,420
Can't your parents help?

57
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,630
You look so tired

58
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,010
My husband is at home, how can I ask my parents for help?

59
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,970
But you're the one doing everything.

60
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,730
-Are you afraid that your husband will be... -Then my husband will...

61
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,270
You've seen through me.

62
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,690
Because you're just like me

63
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,740
I am also afraid that my husband will be scolded...

64
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,450
No, I mean my boyfriend.

65
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,160
In the end, I was the only one who collapsed

66
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,170
Honey

67
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,300
I learned a lot, but being considerate has its limits

68
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,090
You are considerate to bad people, they don't even know

69
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,730
Didn’t the minister come to work today?

70
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,150
Yes, do you have anything to report?

71
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,030
The minister is not feeling well today, so he is taking a leave.

72
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,990
He seems to have a bad cold

73
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,780
The weather is really cold recently. He has never asked for leave before.

74
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,560
Come on, open your mouth

75
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,360
Hey, I said no.

76
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,570
Why do you insist on cooking porridge?

77
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,530
You're not doing that for my own good.

78
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,740
You are satisfying yourself, I just said I hate eating porridge

79
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,410
But you should take another bite.

80
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,250
Oh, go to your porridge

81
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,840
I really haven't changed

82
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,780
Is he not at home?

83
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,290
20130419

84
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,160
This is my door password

85
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Little pong?

86
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,130
minister!

87
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,060
minister

88
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,890
minister

89
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,730
Minister, please get up, you need to see a doctor

90
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,070
It's Kang Ji-won

91
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,670
I shouldn't keep seeing you.

92
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,960
How are you?

93
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,840
The doctor has been here

94
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,470
I've taken medicine too.

95
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,230
You still...

96
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,980
Feeling uneasy?

97
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,320
Feeling shaky?

98
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,580
I hope you don't feel like you're still on that boat.

99
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,260
I feel like I'm on a boat every day

100
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,220
I stood firmly and straight, but the boat kept shaking.

101
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,060
I feel uneasy

102
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,770
Although I cannot be your land...

103
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,900
I want stability

104
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,990
I want to step on the land

105
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,740
I want to be the land

106
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,420
But I want you to feel safe and happy

107
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,170
Because you are a good person

108
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,650
Are you the boy from before?

109
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,500
You are too much

110
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,290
When I saw you again, I recognized you at once

111
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,550
I've always liked you

112
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,490
Hello!

113
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,750
You and your brother really look alike.

114
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,460
What? Did I?

115
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,510
It's too insulting.

116
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,880
Too much

117
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,720
I'm here to tell you how to capture my benefactor

118
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,600
I happen to have two tickets for a musical, you two can go together...

119
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,190
that…

120
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,190
Ji Won…

121
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,530
Um?

122
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,530
I thought I was fine

123
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,160
I am not written by Ji Won with his left hand...

124
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,540
That line

125
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,880
What? Left hand? What do you write with your left hand?

126
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,370
Oh, are you okay?

127
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,500
Your fever has subsided, fortunately.

128
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,710
I'm going to work

129
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,760
Did anything happen yesterday?

130
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,100
Wouldn’t you…

131
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,150
Is it true that what happened last night was a mistake?

132
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,400
No, that's not the case. I just took some medicine and I'm not in my right mind.

133
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,240
I thought I was dreaming when I saw you

134
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,200
Do you remember that?

135
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,290
What did I say yesterday?

136
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,580
Did you know that you have a very surprising side?

137
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,420
You are not in your right mind. Don't use honorifics.

138
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,800
sorry

139
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,630
You said you wanted me to feel stable and happy

140
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,760
And you said you recognized me immediately when you saw me again

141
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,140
and…

142
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,860
You said you always loved me

143
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:35,030
So you want to be my land

144
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,570
Ji Won, I...

145
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,950
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

146
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,420
Maybe I will regret it

147
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,760
But even if we regret it, we have to regret it together

148
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,560
Then it should be fine.

149
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,990
Actually, after hearing your feelings yesterday

150
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,570
I guess that's why I came back.

151
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,830
To believe in someone again like this

152
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,410
Like someone

153
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,420
and feel happy

154
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,800
Can I do this?

155
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,870
What are you going to do next weekend?

156
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,460
We? Do what you want.

157
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,060
"us"?

158
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,500
Talk to me

159
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,670
Say it here

160
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,220
We need to work together

161
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,090
You have been treating me as a transparent person, making everyone embarrassed

162
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,390
You're embarrassed.

163
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,520
If you are afraid of embarrassment, you shouldn't have done that in the first place.

164
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,780
hateful!

165
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,740
Let me go, you bastard!

166
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,750
I will break up

167
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,710
Because I feel like things between us aren't the same as before.

168
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,630
I want a relationship that everyone admires

169
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,260
hateful

170
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,010
What went wrong?

171
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,780
Are you the only girls in your group?

172
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,530
I screwed up one of the group before.

173
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,370
Now I brought another one back

174
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,490
I'm honest

175
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,420
I never thought of letting my son get married like this

176
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,880
But at least you graduated from a Korean university

177
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,140
She graduated from the Department of Business Administration, she is smart and capable

178
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,220
And she said she would return to work after giving birth, isn’t that great?

179
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,930
I used to love reading, Mom Park

180
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,730
People say that sons will look like their mothers.

181
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,400
Please don't be too sad

182
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,990
My mother never thought I would get married like this

183
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,320
But I convinced her.

184
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:33,030
And she likes Min Hwan hyung very much

185
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,290
yes

186
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,120
You said your father used to do business in Busan?

187
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,040
Is your mother a teacher?

188
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,960
right

189
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,050
Before my dad passed away

190
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,800
Our family is very harmonious

191
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,300
I really want to live like my parents.

192
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,810
They both love each other very much

193
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,430
She also raised me very carefully.

194
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,610
Judging from your performance in the cooking class, you seem to be quite capable.

195
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,150
I still have a lot of shortcomings, please teach me more, Mom Park

196
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,820
A woman has to meet the right man.

197
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,660
Judging from the way you choose men, you have a very good brain.

198
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,670
- You guys eat quickly. - Okay

199
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,250
You're right when you say that sons will look like their mothers.

200
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,960
So our family's Minhwan inherited my

201
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,670
So quite clever

202
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,720
That's what I mean, Mother Park

203
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,310
- Mom, bye. - Okay, I'm leaving now.

204
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,020
Mother Park, be careful on the road

205
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,150
Yeah, okay

206
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,070
Um?

207
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,200
Korean university?

208
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,990
Why would you tell that lie?

209
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,370
I'm doing this for your own good.

210
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,120
Jiang Zhiyuan graduated from Korea University

211
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,080
If I say you graduated from a reputable university, my mom would like you.

212
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,920
Didn't you say you wanted to start over? Why did you lie like that...

213
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,090
lie?

214
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,380
Does your mother like me very much?

215
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,430
I have never even met her, how could she like me?

216
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:17,930
Really

217
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,600
Let's not confront each other over this kind of thing.

218
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,980
Let's just let things go smoothly.

219
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,280
I think you got past my mom.

220
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,570
I'll tell you later when we arrange a date for the parents to meet.

221
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,660
-See you then. I'm leaving.-What?

222
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,090
Busan

223
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,800
Did they book a wedding venue?

224
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,380
They don't seem to be telling the company

225
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,130
-But the venue seems to be called Crown... -Crown Wedding Hall

226
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:55,890
Yes, that's right there.

227
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,760
I got married there too.

228
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,020
It's the worst place a girl could imagine.

229
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:09,980
Looks like it's all over now.

230
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,910
Great news

231
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,950
My parents want my husband to work at their steakhouse

232
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,500
When you quit your job, we didn't say anything.

233
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,250
That is because we believe that in this era, it does not matter who is in charge of the outside world or the inside world.

234
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,170
But!

235
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,760
My daughter goes to work.

236
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,720
Yanzhi's mother is doing the childcare, while your wife is doing the housework.

237
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,390
All of this is done by our Zhulan.

238
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,230
I should go to work

239
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:51,820
The head of the household takes care of the children and does housework, which is not very…

240
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,360
That's why I want you to work at our steakhouse.

241
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,320
Our steakhouse is huge and there is a lot to do, including cleaning the grill pans and washing a lot of dishes.

242
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,240
Got to get the meat, delivered the food, and cleaned up.

243
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,080
Father-in-law, please listen to me

244
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,790
I'm not the type to do that.

245
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,000
No way

246
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,590
What are you talking about?

247
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,510
What you shouldn't do that?

248
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:18,340
-So what kind of things should you do? -Housework and childcare?

249
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,640
That's it.

250
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,060
You get up early in the morning, send Zhulan to work, and then take Yanzhi to work at the steak house.

251
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,730
Do you know you are amazing?

252
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:36,820
Section Chief Yang Zhulan is a person who is used to being patient. You let that kind of person take a step forward.

253
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,370
Isn't it great here? Does it make you feel more relaxed?

254
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,920
When I was a student and felt sad, I would come here

255
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:01,090
This way I can get the strength to hold on.

256
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,020
This is the first time I come here with a happy mood

257
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,320
Wow, I didn't expect I'd get to eat this again.

258
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,650
Is this a famous restaurant?

259
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,950
For me it is

260
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,030
This store will disappear in a few years due to urban renewal.

261
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,040
Do You Recall?

262
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,000
We had eaten soup rice together before

263
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,880
I was pretty brave back then, right?

264
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,880
And I was really scared.

265
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,930
I didn't expect that a soup restaurant could be so high-end

266
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,010
You also exuded the aura of a rich young master at that time.

267
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:48,890
Not at all

268
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,770
Even the way you are making rice now

269
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,650
It is also full of the atmosphere of a rich young master

270
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,860
You should add lazy dishes

271
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,320
Oh, yes, lazy food

272
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,250
wrong

273
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,750
I'm kidding.

274
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,720
It's leek

275
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,890
This is not a side dish, but is to be added to soup

276
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,980
But people in Seoul eat it by grabbing it

277
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,740
You have to add all of it and eat it

278
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,740
good

279
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,830
Then eat it with meat

280
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,920
good

281
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,380
How is it? It tastes much better, right?

282
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,220
Spicy and delicious

283
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,550
Eat now

284
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,720
Minister, when you were in love before, you would say that today is the first day of our relationship.

285
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,060
That kind of thing?

286
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,560
I'm wondering when you're going to ask me to be the minister.

287
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,030
Um…

288
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,860
When you are promoted to director?

289
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,320
I'm kidding.

290
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,120
What did your ex-girlfriends call you?

291
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,380
I never need to say, today is the first day of dating

292
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,880
I don't remember what they called me.

293
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,050
That's not important.

294
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,710
Because I know only one name

295
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,840
Kang Ji-won

296
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,930
Ji Won

297
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,560
Only Kang Ji-won

298
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,140
What is he like?

299
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,020
Look there. What is he like?

300
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,350
Don't know

301
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,140
What?

302
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,350
Isn't he tired like that?

303
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,150
He's still the same, he hasn't changed

304
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,360
I am coming

305
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,170
Hello, Section Chief

306
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:45,540
I am Kim Taehyung, who was assigned to the marketing team from today.

307
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,750
Please give me more advice

308
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,010
good

309
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,590
I was the section chief.

310
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,010
Oh, you are here?

311
00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:02,730
Wow, this chair knows its owner and fits my ass perfectly

312
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,020
Agent Yang

313
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,320
no

314
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,030
Chief Yang, this position will be returned to its owner soon.

315
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,240
So you have to use it with caution, you know?

316
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,620
- Hey, behave yourself. - Yes

317
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,830
good

318
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,580
Gold Agent

319
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,340
Why hasn’t the business plan been submitted yet?

320
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,590
You said you would hand it in before today...

321
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,930
What did you just say?

322
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,850
Your ideas are bad, and if you are not diligent, then it will be difficult for me to deal with it.

323
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,520
Oh, don't worry.

324
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,900
It won't end.

325
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,320
It's just a little bit bad

326
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,150
Are you crazy?

327
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,950
What are you doing?

328
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:58,330
You know the rank and rank better than anyone else

329
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:02,200
You also understand the workplace ecology. Now you are not the section chief anymore.

330
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,670
Don't you feel awkward sitting here?

331
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,630
I need to know your standards so I can cooperate with you

332
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,100
Why are you suddenly not speaking honorifics to me?

333
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,520
Because you didn't use honorifics to address me, I thought that was OK.

334
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,020
My position is higher than yours anyway.

335
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,610
If I say honorifics and you don't

336
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,400
Isn’t it strange?

337
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,110
What can you do? Respect each other?

338
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,330
Or do you want me to be casual with you?

339
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,560
Section Chief

340
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,690
Only men can take care of men.

341
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,160
Anyway, those women...

342
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,740
How could those women destroy the friendship between men?

343
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,700
- Insolent - Yes.

344
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,330
Park Agent

345
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,710
Let's go drink some soju today and go to the sauna.

346
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,920
Today, Agent Yang's father is treating us to a grilled steak...

347
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,460
But I can't go

348
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,260
I have something going on at home, so today is not convenient for me.

349
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,220
Is that so?

350
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,390
but…

351
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:48,940
You and Xiumin aren’t really in that kind of relationship, are you?

352
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,690
No

353
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,320
good

354
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,740
The weather is great

355
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,910
Marketing team darling Yang Zhulan becomes section chief

356
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,160
Chief, congratulations!

357
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,340
Eat as much as you can, drink as much as you can!

358
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,470
Yang Zhulan Show!

359
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,100
Isn't that right? I prepared this specially.

360
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,060
So cool

361
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,770
Wow, you're awesome.

362
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,900
-Thank you for your hard work. -Congratulations

363
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,650
Thank you

364
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,490
Thank you very much

365
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,790
How about a toast?

366
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,080
cheers

367
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,880
-Cheers-Cheers

368
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,040
Everyone!

369
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,380
I prepared the best beef for the best marketing team

370
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,190
I prepared a full meal with special cuts

371
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,520
Please enjoy!

372
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:19,400
-Yang Zhulan! -Yang Zhulan!

373
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,280
Okay, everyone.

374
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,610
Please take good care of our princess.

375
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:28,830
Long live Princess!

376
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,710
-Princess! -Princess!

377
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:35,130
- Yang Zhulan! - Dad

378
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,130
Don't call me princess.

379
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,710
Daughter, please don't say that.

380
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,220
Wife

381
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,390
-Princess, don't do this.

382
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,140
Really

383
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,270
I will do everything for my princess

384
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:54,350
This is what I really want, Dad.

385
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,560
Not alone

386
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,650
Standing firmly on the ground, no matter how strong the wind and waves are, they will not be shaken.

387
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,160
It turns out this is an easy thing

388
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,780
As long as there's someone standing by my side, that's enough.

389
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:14,410
I think I really have it now.

390
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,760
You go in first

391
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,640
- How? - Your lips

392
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,480
Okay, you go in.

393
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,020
Go ahead

394
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
husband

395
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
Where have you been?

396
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,750
You need to say hello to everyone...

397
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,670
Director Li

398
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,550
Come in

399
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,020
Come over and say hello

400
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,480
Hello everyone

401
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,610
I am Ju-ran's husband, Lee Jae-won

402
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,280
that…

403
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,620
Please take good care of my family.

404
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,030
good

405
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,290
Thanks

406
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,630
-Section Chief-Hmm?

407
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,430
Why is Director Li here?

408
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,050
I invited him here.

409
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:56,390
I became the section chief because he trusted me.

410
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,980
Excuse me

411
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,110
Director Li

412
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,610
- Let me raise a toast to you. - He was invited?

413
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:11,990
That uncle?

414
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,120
Really

415
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,620
So annoying

416
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,330
- I can't stand it. - I can't stand it.

417
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,960
- What the hell? - What?

418
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,920
Scare me

419
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,760
It's a mess.

420
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,010
Next time we'll have some men's time

421
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,970
What is he like?

422
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,320
I will never tell the company, okay?

423
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,150
What are you talking about?

424
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,990
-Hello. -Hello.

425
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,910
Isn’t the house here nice?

426
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,950
It's hard to find a good house if you need to rent one urgently

427
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,410
Fortunately, there happened to be one

428
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,580
Wait, renting a house?

429
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,880
Mom, why rent a house? Didn't you say you would buy me a house?

430
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,460
I'll buy it for you after you've lived here for two years.

431
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,970
- What? - You two are such a lucky couple.

432
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,550
- Let's go in. - Okay.

433
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,390
Why did it suddenly become a rental house?

434
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,060
Southeast Asia is pretty good recently, I also recommend Hawaii

435
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,140
Domestic honeymoon trip

436
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:24,690
She is pregnant, so it is not good to take a plane. There are many good places in Korea.

437
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,770
Bulguksa Temple?

438
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,860
Gold, silver, gemstone and watch specialty stores

439
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,240
What are you doing? Why don't you go in?

440
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,950
Hello

441
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,870
Give me a drink

442
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,000
This color is nice

443
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,330
This is how I put on makeup

444
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:45,000
-Okay. -Wedding dress...let me see it.

445
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,550
This is too revealing. No.

446
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:52,510
This is good. This is very dignified. Good.

447
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,090
Give us this wedding dress

448
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,510
We are getting married

449
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,020
marry

450
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,850
Respectfully Invited

451
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,770
What is this?

452
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:10,610
Who chooses this kind of wedding invitation these days? What's wrong with your mom?

453
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,240
Then go tell her.

454
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,280
You can only smile in front of mom and dare not say anything, why are you angry with me?

455
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,080
No, how can I tell her?

456
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,740
You have to tell her.

457
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,950
Ouch

458
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,170
Wow, you can get treasure for free

459
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,210
Really

460
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,260
Zheng Xiumin

461
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:42,270
We are getting married, Park Min-hwan and Jung Soo-min

462
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:44,230
We are getting married

463
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:53,150
Minister Liu Zhihe

464
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,440
Ji Won

465
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,170
Is this reasonable?

466
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,880
Are they real?

467
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:20,260
-Oh my god. -I can't believe it.

468
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,430
U&K Inbox, company internal announcements

469
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,540
Agent Park, I think you should receive this letter.

470
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,000
Do you want to receive the letter?

471
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,340
Office of the Minister of Personnel

472
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,850
Minister, what's the matter with that letter?

473
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:04,970
Whoever...

474
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,430
Send out a company announcement letter?

475
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,900
Which person from which department?

476
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:13,730
The marriage announcement letter of Park Min-hwan, a staff member of the marketing team 3, has been sent out

477
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,690
Aren’t you going to get married?

478
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,780
Um...I am going to get married, but...

479
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,370
The employee was going to get married

480
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,500
An announcement and gift money will be issued

481
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,750
And to encourage team members to attend weddings, they will provide leave

482
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,710
You need to take leave to go on your honeymoon

483
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,760
These are all true, but...

484
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,840
As the person involved, I didn't say anything!

485
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,760
I didn't ask you to make an announcement.

486
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,640
I'm really going crazy

487
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,520
He probably canceled his engagement with Kang Ji-won

488
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,060
Then she married her friend, so the situation was a bit awkward

489
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,730
This is really not glorious.

490
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,090
I know you like Kang Ji Won

491
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,470
but

492
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:27,260
I don't think you're the type to interfere with Park Min-hwan and Jung Soo-min

493
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:31,730
Even if they are scum, it has nothing to do with you.

494
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,850
Whatever concerns Ji-won concerns me.

495
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,750
He is laughing

496
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,130
I've never seen him with this expression, it's kind of touching

497
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,920
Let you?

498
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,970
It's really rare

499
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,560
I really look at him differently.

500
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,810
I understand your intention

501
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,810
But I actually think Ji Hyuk is boring

502
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,980
He didn't want anything in particular.

503
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,070
Just keep suppressing your emotions

504
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:26,160
Anyway, he has everything, so he doesn't necessarily need me.

505
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,280
But this time...

506
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,500
For the first time, he looked like a real person.

507
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,090
Zhihe, did you send this?

508
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,220
They are so annoying.

509
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:53,180
Sender: Marketing Director, Liu Zhihe, Recipient: Human Resources Director

510
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:56,230
I admit this is childish behavior.

511
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,320
It's really amazing

512
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:05,820
What's amazing?

513
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,450
Someone is on my side

514
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:14,620
Someone is more angry than me about me

515
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,170
what's on your mind?

516
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,090
I want to kiss you

517
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,390
What?

518
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,300
In fact, I want to go a step further...

519
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:32,930
What's the matter?

520
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:50,280
- Damn it! - I'm scared to death

521
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:53,030
What the hell are you doing? How can you do this to a pregnant woman?

522
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,370
Mom, please, you don't know anything.

523
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,790
What's this?

524
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,420
Were you the one who sent the wedding invitation to the company?

525
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:03,250
company?

526
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:07,800
What?

527
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,060
this…

528
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,600
This was announced by the company!

529
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:22,360
What?

530
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,400
Now the whole world knows that I'm marrying you

531
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,190
How am I going to get to work?

532
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,860
How am I going to work?

533
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,450
Oh, my god!

534
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:33,120
-It's so noisy- Just go to work, why not?

535
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,040
Just go to work. Marrying me isn't such a bad thing.

536
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,290
That is to say

537
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:40,830
This is how it is between men and women. I thought it was a big deal.

538
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,250
Hey, the purpose of holding a wedding is to collect the gift money.

539
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:48,970
Yes, you are not alone now, you have to think about our general

540
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:51,890
That damn general is a shitty soldier. How can he block my future?

541
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:52,970
Damn it!

542
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,010
You little bastard, how can you say that my eldest grandson is a piece of shit?

543
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,060
Stop fighting!

544
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,140
Really

545
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,270
You don't care about your son.

546
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:01,140
I have the hardest time!

547
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:02,730
hateful!

548
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:05,440
Let's go in, this won't work.

549
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:07,820
How did he do it?

550
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,150
It's noisy enough

551
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,070
Wife, be careful.

552
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:13,990
Our general must find it very noisy.

553
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:18,580
Wife, men are all children

554
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,120
Nothing will happen when he calms down.

555
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:24,040
Don't worry about anything

556
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:26,750
Just want to give birth to a healthy baby

557
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,920
I know he has a bad temper.

558
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,800
Are you going to sleep here today?

559
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:38,060
No, I want to go home.

560
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,430
I heard this is very good for prenatal education.

561
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,060
This is very good for the baby's brain development. Please listen to it all before you leave.

562
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,320
I'm out

563
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,080
Classical prenatal music

564
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:20,720
After thinking it over, I decided to go to this wedding.

565
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,100
I want to pack 1,000 won and eat three bowls of rice

566
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,980
Yeah, I plan to go too.

567
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,690
Liu Xiyan

568
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,190
I want to survive

569
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,130
Jiang Xianmou, Dad, I love you

570
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:29,750
Are you here?

571
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,830
Are you ready?

572
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:10,040
Okay, almost done. Wait for me.

573
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,040
Ji-won, wait a minute.

574
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:14,710
Could you come and sit for a moment?

575
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:28,810
This is…

576
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,320
Kang Ji-won deserves the best

577
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,500
Counterattack Day

578
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,820
Crown Wedding Hall, opening a happy marriage for you

579
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,540
It's okay, you're beautiful.

580
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,540
I'm going to have a family.

581
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:35,590
I won

582
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:40,670
daughter in law

583
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,340
mom

584
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,390
My belly isn't protruding, is it?

585
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:51,230
Of course it can't be protruding, that's why we hurriedly held the wedding

586
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:54,440
But why didn’t your friends come?

587
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,940
Did you tell them the right time?

588
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,150
Yes, yes

589
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:03,200
Oh, is the bride's mother here? Want to take a picture together?

590
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,490
No, she is my mother-in-law.

591
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:08,870
I am more suitable for wearing pink

592
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:11,700
Don’t you think this color is beautiful?

593
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:14,000
Yes, very beautiful

594
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,170
Thanks

595
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:16,960
- Sit down. - Okay.

596
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,380
The wedding dress was a bit...

597
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:28,180
Just shoot it directly

598
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,930
Although her belly is not too obvious, it is not good to leave a photo

599
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,520
Just take a photo

600
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,600
Come

601
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:36,350
OK, I understand

602
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,060
Smile

603
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,400
-But ah-Yeah

604
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:44,360
Why hasn't your mother come yet?

605
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,160
Oh, mother-in-law

606
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,120
I'm so sorry I'm so late

607
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,160
Oh, mother-in-law

608
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:59,340
It seems that the traffic jam on the road is very serious.

609
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,210
Oh, yes.

610
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,050
Because I only live in Busan

611
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:07,390
The traffic in Seoul really scares me

612
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,440
Our Xiumin is so beautiful

613
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,610
Sorry I'm late, mom.

614
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:23,570
Crown Wedding Hall

615
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:26,990
Auntie, why are you here so late? Didn't I ask you to come over and wait?

616
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,030
sorry

617
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,950
There's a real traffic jam.

618
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:33,290
There was a car accident nearby

619
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:34,910
never mind

620
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,790
Are you remembering correctly? My father passed away and my mother was an elementary school teacher.

621
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,210
certainly

622
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:44,550
He used to be a businessman and left a lot of property. I have no problem with my retirement.

623
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:49,220
Where are my friends? I have remitted 300,000 won. Will 11 of them come?

624
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,140
Oh, you're here? Thank you.

625
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,760
Hello

626
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:57,480
-Long time no see. -Congratulations

627
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,940
- You're here? - Yeah

628
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:02,610
In the end, you still got married? You also said she was not marriage material

629
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,530
Thanks

630
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,150
Don't talk nonsense

631
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,160
Why are you the only one here? Where are the others?

632
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,070
You also know Yunjing's personality

633
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,870
She said she would not attend the cheating man's wedding, so other girls didn't come either.

634
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:19,210
Zongcan is on a business trip, Rongjiu said he would only come to the wedding banquet

635
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:22,380
Eat his big head, really

636
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,590
Wow, who are they?

637
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,550
A friend of the bride?

638
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:57,790
Congratulations on your marriage

639
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,830
I think it would be better to give this to you separately

640
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,630
Are you here?

641
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,300
You are beautiful

642
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:14,300
But you don't need to give me this.

643
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:19,230
Will you stay for dinner?

644
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,190
But this...

645
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:31,400
let's go

646
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:42,920
I think I've seen that girl somewhere.

647
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,460
Could it be your ex-girlfriend? Kang Ji-won?

648
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,300
What's going on? She's a goddess.

649
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:53,220
You are not the one dumping someone, but the one being dumped?

650
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,220
Oh, shut your mouth.

651
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,350
So annoying

652
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,060
complaint

653
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:04,650
What is this?

654
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:09,400
Have you been sued? Do you owe money?

655
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,620
We're coming in soon.

656
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:24,420
good

657
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,420
No problem

658
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,190
Why did you arrive so late?

659
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:48,480
I thought you weren't coming.

660
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,420
You received my bouquet

661
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,090
What?

662
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:22,640
Oh, how can you catch the bouquet?

663
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,270
My parents-in-law all know you.

664
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,520
That's right.

665
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,030
The wedding dress suits you very well

666
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:40,660
Right? My mother-in-law helped me choose it.

667
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:46,080
Although this is the preference of my elders, I am not entirely satisfied with it, but what can I do?

668
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,120
She sees me as her daughter.

669
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,590
I'm so glad you two are a good match.

670
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:59,720
Let's take a photo, please ask the photographer to come in

671
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,140
No

672
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,560
I don't think there's any need to take a photo

673
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:15,650
congratulations

674
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,530
Picked me up

675
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,700
Discarded garbage

676
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:36,510
Park Min-hwan bought this for me.

677
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:43,050
So when you need it, you can use it or sell it.

678
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:03,280
Thrown away garbage?

679
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,910
She lost Park Min-hwan?

680
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,620
Oh wow, I can get treasure for free

681
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:11,960
How am I going to work?

682
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:15,250
No, it's impossible

683
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:17,420
I'm going to marry Min-hwan soon.

684
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,380
I'm going to have a new family

685
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:21,930
I can't be tied to you forever.

686
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,800
We're coming in soon.

687
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:28,810
Next, please welcome the beautiful bride

688
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,270
-Okay. -Please give me a round of applause.

689
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,600
Welcome the bride

690
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:35,480
I stole it. It was Kang Ji-won's man and family.

691
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,940
It's all mine now.

692
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,860
I won

693
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,200
Now I'm starting over

694
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,790
Groom Park Min-hwan and bride Jung Soo-min

695
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:20,630
With the blessings of our parents and relatives and friends, we are here to…

696
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:46,860
The groom's mother just needs to smile

697
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,360
Yes, very good

698
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:54,750
Doesn’t Zheng Xiumin look so different from her mother?

699
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:56,460
It seems that she only looks like her father

700
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,500
That is to say

701
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:00,080
Two more photos

702
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:04,000
Everyone smiles, dad smiles, come on

703
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:07,050
It seems you haven't seen her.

704
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,600
Many people are hiring guests these days, could it be that she is hiring someone to be her mother?

705
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:14,810
No way

706
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:17,730
If I remember correctly

707
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:20,480
Zheng Xiumin's mother should still be alive

708
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:25,190
Eun-ho, why are you here?

709
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,150
Zheng Xiumin sent me a wedding invitation

710
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:34,450
But the problem is…

711
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,830
Now please invite the friends and colleagues of the bride and groom to come to the front.

712
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,470
I showed the wedding invitation to Ruizhi

713
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,180
That's how they came.

714
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,270
Wait a moment!

715
01:01:56,970 --> 01:02:00,390
- Childhood friends of the bride, move out! - Move out!

716
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,570
They said they were very sorry and wanted to avenge you.

717
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:14,240
Are they your friends?

718
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:16,410
no…

719
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:19,290
Xiumin, I'm here

720
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:21,580
Who wants to catch the bouquet? Should I catch it?

721
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:24,790
Even if Jiwon is your significant other

722
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,710
You stole her boyfriend and married him.

723
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,380
You should have some conscience. How could you ask her to accept the bouquet?

724
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:32,340
Isn’t that too exaggerated?

725
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,470
She stole her friend's boyfriend?

726
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:39,390
Who did you send the wedding invitation to?

727
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:42,100
You handle it yourself

728
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,900
What are you doing?

729
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:52,450
Who are you?

730
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:55,950
- I should say hello to your mother-in-law. - No

731
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:02,790
I am the left eye of Xiumin's eye friend

732
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:06,290
Let me go!

733
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,460
Isn’t this too rude?

734
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,670
I am her right eye friend

735
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,840
How can there be something so low-level?

736
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:18,430
No skills?

737
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:20,020
What are you thinking about?

738
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:25,900
We are her eyeball friends, we are as indispensable as her eyeballs

739
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:29,900
What? What are you thinking about?

740
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:31,440
I am the nose

741
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:34,740
She is the right eye, she is the left eye, and I am the nose

742
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:38,240
Do you know whose wedding this is?

743
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:43,710
As far as I know, this family has a dog that is involved with his girlfriend's best friend.

744
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:47,130
If there's anything else I need to know, please let me know.

745
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:49,420
What are you talking about with your stinky mouth?

746
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:51,210
How dare you do this?

747
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:54,880
Don't do this, Mom.

748
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,140
You are so brave.

749
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:03,060
- Mom! - Drag him out!

750
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:11,570
Where is Min Hwan?

751
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:14,030
Everyone, please calm down.

752
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:15,860
Nothing happened

753
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:19,620
The wedding must continue. Where did the groom go?

754
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:20,700
Minhwan!

755
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:23,450
What a great group of friends.

756
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:27,790
They were also very good when they bullied me before.

757
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,670
If you are tired, why not just leave?

758
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,380
Is that so?

759
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:37,930
If you have anything to say, let's talk later.

760
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,850
OK, Eun-ho and Hee-yeon, I'll contact you later.

761
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:44,770
OK, contact me later

762
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:48,400
Don't you want to eat? I paid 1,000 won and got the meal ticket.

763
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:51,150
Let's go

764
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:01,240
It seems he has made up his mind.

765
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:03,620
How are you?

766
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,750
I want to eat before I leave. Do you want to eat with me?

767
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,670
If you don't mind eating out, I'll treat you.

768
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:15,420
Of course it's good.

769
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:22,220
But our section chief originally said he would come

770
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:24,390
Why didn't she come?

771
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,280
I told you not to come here again.

772
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,870
It's the weekend, what are you doing here?

773
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:51,750
I can't go home now

774
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:57,260
Yanzhi at home

775
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:03,050
I can't sort out my mood yet

776
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,310
I'm too busy

777
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:14,650
I have never listened to the medical examination report.

778
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,900
Then I heard over the phone...

779
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:23,070
Calm down and speak clearly.

780
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:24,660
No

781
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:27,330
Let's get out of here.

782
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:34,960
I have stomach cancer

783
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:29,930
You've worked hard, go back and have a rest

784
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,060
The same to you

785
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:46,870
I'll come talk to you.

786
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:51,540
But it seems inconvenient

787
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:00,710
Hello

788
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,960
I am Liu Zhihe's fiancée

789
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,720
Oh, it should be the ex-fiancee, right?

790
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:14,180
He unilaterally cancelled the engagement

791
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:17,600
Although I haven't heard that he did this because he had a woman.

792
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,100
Have you heard that I'm married?

793
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:57,770
What would it feel like if my boyfriend married my best friend?

794
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:00,230
What to do? Section Chief Yang has stomach cancer

795
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:01,310
It's my fault.

796
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,480
My fate falls on the section chief.

797
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:05,990
I know Minister Liu is a good person.

798
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:07,610
It's all my problem

799
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:09,660
Mr. Park Min-hwan?

800
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:11,950
She threw Park Min-hwan to me

801
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:14,450
Replace it with a rich man?

802
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,960
I hate when someone touches my things.

803
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:23,920
I realized I had a very happy dream
