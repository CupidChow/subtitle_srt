JUNGRIMCHEON BEWARE OF RAPIDS

2
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,505
Your necklace.

3
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:47,840
It's really pretty.

4
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:55,973
Let's go.

5
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,859
The flag is just down here.

6
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,652
Flag one.

7
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:10,904
What?

8
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,448
- What's that?
- What?

9
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,995
I think someone already got it.

10
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,601
Goodness.

11
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,645
You're incredible.

12
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,564
I wondered who'd
dare go in there.

13
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:46,816
It was you?

14
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,235
You're incredible.

15
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,823
I want to be solid land.

16
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,617
- Hui-yeon.
- Yeah?

17
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,788
What does it mean when
someone wants to be land?

18
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:06,252
Like when asked what you want
to become or do in the future.

19
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:09,547
Maybe they meant lamb?

20
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,757
Oh, man. Now I'm hungry.

21
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:17,263
Maybe it was something else.

22
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,890
Who said it? You
should just ask them.

23
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:21,809
Well...

24
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:25,145
It's hard to ask them.

25
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:26,939
Is it Mr. Park?

26
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,359
You shouldn't be like that.

27
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:36,907
My husband said things I never
understood, and I couldn't ask him too.

28
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,910
Especially between lovers,

29
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,746
you should share future
goals or bucket lists!

30
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,250
You won the camper today.

31
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,129
Sneak him into your
car and ask him.

32
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:53,757
What are you saying? So dirty!

33
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,092
Married women are so...

34
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,970
<i>I can't do that.</i>

35
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:01,140
<i>Min-hwan can't be
with me tonight.</i>

36
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:08,731
<i>In the past, I got number four
which was the single tent,</i>

37
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,066
<i>and Su-min got number
one, the camper.</i>

38
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,027
<i>And that night...</i>

39
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:18,866
Hey, I can't sleep
in a sleeping bag.

40
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,993
Let's go sleep somewhere else.

41
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,537
<i>We left and came back at dawn.</i>

42
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:25,414
I'll die if I sleep here.

43
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:29,084
<i>We drank so we were
overheated. It was horrifying.</i>

44
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:30,586
Hey.

45
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,256
- Hey!
<i>- If I'm in the camper,</i>

46
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,012
<i>Su-min will be in
the single tent.</i>

47
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:42,848
<i>If so...</i>

48
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,769
Today could be D-Day.

49
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:47,852
What?

50
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:50,314
Nothing.

51
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,942
I should go out.

52
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,485
You're going out again?

53
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,363
You found the number
one. Just rest.

54
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,407
We still have time. I
have to follow the rules.

55
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,535
Goodness.

56
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,204
She's so inflexible.

57
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,633
That was dangerous and reckless.

58
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:22,596
I know I won't
die from drowning.

59
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,642
What scares me the most

60
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:31,230
is living the same life as
before with this second chance.

61
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,610
In order to not do
that, I can do anything.

62
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:53,836
So since you have
the number one flag,

63
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,129
has fate changed?

64
00:04:55,963 --> 00:05:01,051
Or is there a chance that Su-min will
take it before you sleep in the camper?

65
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,220
I don't know.

66
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,139
Then...

67
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,517
But there's one
thing that's certain.

68
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,396
Park Min-hwan borrowed
money from me,

69
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,150
and he bought a necklace
before coming here.

70
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,070
He's simple-minded.

71
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:23,282
It's his killer move to
get into a woman's pants.

72
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,452
I got it too.

73
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,958
It's so pretty, babe.

74
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,501
It's nothing much.

75
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,632
Are you saying he bought
the same necklace?

76
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,218
No, it's a bit
different. This one...

77
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,096
It looked quite expensive.

78
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,849
I must've been easier to him.

79
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,731
It's okay.

80
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,650
I'm doing all this to
escape someone like him.

81
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,781
I'll only take what's good.

82
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,911
You should.

83
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,288
That's how you'll
make today D-Day?

84
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,084
Yes. First, I'll make sure
Su-min gets number four.

85
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,337
Then I'll get Min-hwan wasted.

86
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:22,007
Okay, I'll be rooting for you.

87
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,300
As much as I can.

88
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,469
Okay, I'll root for...

89
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:30,516
By the way, what did you say
you wanted to be earlier?

90
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,228
Lamb? Lamp?

91
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,524
What was it? Or maybe champ?

92
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,443
Was that it?

93
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,237
Not me! Get someone else!

94
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,072
Can't you get someone else?

95
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,573
Someone else!

96
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:51,869
You're out.

97
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,546
Who the heck has number one?

98
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,757
No one here would
go in the water.

99
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,184
Except for Ji-won.

100
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,651
I've never had nice things before,
so protecting this is so hard.

101
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,851
Sorry, Ji-won!

102
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:02,774
Let go!

103
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,277
You scared me!

104
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,695
My bracelet's stuck!

105
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,947
Be still. Don't move.

106
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,616
That hurts!

107
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,666
Are you mad?

108
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:24,421
This is just a game.

109
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,926
And this wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't tried to get me.

110
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:04,753
What's wrong with me?

111
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,630
Why am I worried?

112
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,622
Ji-won, you're out!

113
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,921
I knew you'd come back.

114
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,134
Did you really go
into the water?

115
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,803
So this is why you
impress everyone.

116
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,596
Find someone who's glamping.

117
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,223
Thanks for this.

118
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:03,979
Hello, everyone.

119
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,898
I hope you're having fun.

120
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:10,777
Anyway, I didn't know you'd all
participate so enthusiastically.

121
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,071
You're all so great.

122
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,823
Now,

123
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:18,160
which female employee will
get to sleep in the camper?

124
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,953
Number one, come out!

125
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,898
BASED ON THE NAVER SERIES WEBNOVEL
<i>MARRY MY HUSBAND</i> BY SUNGSOJAK

126
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,721
Who is it?

127
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,808
What? Really?

128
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:44,895
It's me!

129
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,027
Please come forward.

130
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,287
I'll give you the
key to your camper!

131
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,122
Congratulations!

132
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,667
Find someone who's glamping.

133
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,252
Thanks for this!

134
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,725
Isn't sleeping in a camper
better than glamping?

135
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,732
The camper is right
in front of me,

136
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,359
so why would I
consider glamping?

137
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,128
Congratulations, Ms. Kang
Ji-won from Marketing Team 1!

138
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,588
Let's give her a
round of applause!

139
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,257
Congratulations!

140
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,682
Next, let's see which male
employee won the camper.

141
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,810
Who found the number one flag?

142
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,770
Please come to the front!

143
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:09,896
Come on up!

144
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,949
Happy you beat me?

145
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,622
You know I can't
just sleep anywhere.

146
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,420
Same goes for me.

147
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,087
Really?

148
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,967
Then why did I think you could
sleep just about anywhere?

149
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,471
Because I did so for you.

150
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,764
What?

151
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,142
Nothing, I'm going.

152
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,527
Why are you like this to me?

153
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,571
What do you mean?

154
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,114
You won't let me win.

155
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,328
How much longer will
you keep this up?

156
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:10,499
I feel like I've become
a bad person now.

157
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,417
You're too harsh to me lately.

158
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,347
I don't...

159
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,435
like you anymore.

160
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:37,817
I tried not to show it, but
I failed. I'll just tell you.

161
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,570
I just started to hate you.

162
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,823
You whine and try to act cute.

163
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,576
You think my things are
yours. It's annoying.

164
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,164
You yielded them to me!

165
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,335
Is it bad I took
that for granted?

166
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,880
You made me this way. What
am I supposed to do now?

167
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,303
You're right. I always yielded

168
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,180
and let you whine.

169
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,433
So I'm going to stop now.

170
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,981
I'm marrying Min-hwan.

171
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,984
I'll start a new family.

172
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,611
I can't be tied to you forever.

173
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,289
Thanks for bringing
it up first. Bye.

174
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,140
I feel like a bad person.

175
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,977
She's the one that was wrong.

176
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,355
She's the bad one. I only
said what I should say, but...

177
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,773
You're just too good.

178
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,530
You're not bad enough
to hurt others.

179
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,248
But I know better than anyone.

180
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,921
You did what you had to.

181
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,136
Good job.

182
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,820
<i>Su-min must want to punish me.</i>

183
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:50,575
<i>If she thinks I'm being like
this because of Min-hwan,</i>

184
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,788
<i>it's obvious how she'll
try to punish me.</i>

185
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:58,333
- I can't drink anymore.
- What? You have to finish your shot.

186
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,418
- Gosh, I...
- Drink it.

187
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,624
What are you doing here?

188
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,880
Shall we talk?

189
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,103
How did you know
that I wanted...

190
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,897
to talk to you?

191
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,529
I can tell by your face.

192
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,115
Did you drink a lot?

193
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,076
Do you have a lot on your mind?

194
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,916
Just a little.

195
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:25,670
I feel uneasy.

196
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,724
Just a little.

197
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,526
Do you want...

198
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,074
to sleep with me?

199
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,121
Will it change anything?

200
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,250
You're Ji-won's boyfriend,
and I'm her other half.

201
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,548
Is it the alcohol?

202
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,719
I only care about
who's in front of me.

203
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:35,782
Me too.

204
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,786
I drank a lot.

205
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,397
I only need you too.

206
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,445
Maybe I'll push
her off somewhere.

207
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,498
You can't check your wounds

208
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,878
or your opponent's on the mat.

209
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,089
Focus only on two things.

210
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,844
"I decided to fight."

211
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,473
"And I will win."

212
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,733
I decided to fight.

213
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,736
And I will win...

214
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,862
The entire company is excited

215
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,740
about our marketing team lately!

216
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:25,785
Of course, since the
project's going so well.

217
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,746
We could go down in U&K
history at this rate!

218
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,833
I'm sorry, Hui-yeon.

219
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,168
Why would you be sorry?

220
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,462
The original sin
is with Mr. Kim.

221
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:38,131
And the boomer is Mr. Yu.

222
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,634
No wonder this is so fun!

223
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,219
Mr. Kim isn't here!

224
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:52,895
I hear aroused elks always
appear during workshops.

225
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,605
I finally get to see it!

226
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:56,024
Are you insane?

227
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,608
- What? I want to...
- Let's go.

228
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,110
Seriously! Just once!

229
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,112
No, let's go.

230
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,455
I think I found
Su-min so pretty.

231
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,253
When I first met her at 15,

232
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:23,384
I couldn't believe someone so
pretty and nice was my friend.

233
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,014
I was so proud. It was nice.

234
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,476
So I wanted to protect her.

235
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,647
And Min-hwan...

236
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,028
He was such a jerk.

237
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,116
But I needed someone
to trust and lean on.

238
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,412
And after we got married,

239
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,166
I put up with him even more.

240
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,588
Aren't I such a fool?

241
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,884
It's all over now.

242
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,846
Stop thinking about them.

243
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,432
Think about one thing today.

244
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,601
Kang Ji-won won.

245
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:25,571
I haven't...

246
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:30,326
had someone touch my
hand this affectionately

247
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,328
in a long time.

248
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,758
Since I came back to 2013,

249
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,596
I've felt so lonely
since I was alone.

250
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:59,147
So I'm glad I have you.

251
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:02,650
Thank you.

252
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,033
To be honest,

253
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,414
my life is like a
well-written novel.

254
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:23,129
A life without any
worries or obstacles.

255
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,338
Just well-written.

256
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,430
So I'm glad I came back,

257
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:36,058
and I'm happy I get to
talk to you like this.

258
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,944
I should thank you.

259
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,792
You never keep it simple.

260
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,377
Is that so?

261
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:11,010
What did you say earlier?
What do you want to be?

262
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:14,513
I'll help you for
helping me too.

263
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:19,101
I told you, I don't want
anything from you in return.

264
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:22,021
I'm being honest,
but you're not.

265
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,982
Then I won't let you help me.

266
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:27,568
Let's say I said champ.

267
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:29,779
No, you didn't.

268
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,197
Are you lying?

269
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:33,783
It's true.

270
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:46,753
Ji-won.

271
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:52,426
Did you sleep well when your boyfriend
was sleeping in a sleeping bag?

272
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,845
You're so cold-hearted.

273
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,598
Did you really sleep there?

274
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,017
Where else, then?

275
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,436
My selfish girlfriend
slept in the camper.

276
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:08,234
Weren't you even worried your
boyfriend might be too cold overnight?

277
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,697
I was, so I went to you with hand
warmers, but you weren't there.

278
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,744
I guess I was in
the bathroom then.

279
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:19,996
Yes.

280
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,206
You could've just
left them there.

281
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,083
Where's your common sense?

282
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,001
Where's Su-min?

283
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:31,882
How should I know
where your friend is?

284
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,386
Where did she sleep?

285
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,513
I don't know.

286
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:43,853
Something happened between us
yesterday, and it's uncomfortable.

287
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,772
Uncomfortable?

288
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:49,817
Did you fight?

289
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:54,113
Women are always fighting
and making up. Goodness.

290
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:00,786
What?

291
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,080
Let's go eat breakfast.

292
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:20,806
Su-min.

293
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,185
This isn't your tent.

294
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:25,978
Where were you last night?

295
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:30,149
I was drunk, so I slept over
there. I just left my stuff here.

296
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,486
Did you drink a lot too?

297
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:38,991
I was able to sober up a bit after
a walk with Hui-yeon last night.

298
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:40,742
I see.

299
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,544
Let's not tell Ji-won.

300
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:52,921
What?

301
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:57,301
It's not like she'll break up
with me. She'll only get hurt.

302
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,014
You're close friends.
It's unnecessary.

303
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,145
Let's just be realistic.

304
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:12,775
As you said, things are
too complicated between us.

305
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:18,906
Instead of rolling around
in a messy reality,

306
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,659
let's keep it as a
beautiful memory.

307
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,702
Is it too greedy of me?

308
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,500
Let's go eat.

309
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,960
I'm so hungover.

310
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:32,794
Okay.

311
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:41,053
Why can I never get the best?

312
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,137
What?

313
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:46,642
The workshop sucked.

314
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,770
I wanted to sleep in a
camper or a glamping tent.

315
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,899
You'll have other chances.

316
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:56,068
Failure is the
mother of success.

317
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:02,074
You're right.
Nothing's impossible.

318
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:04,076
This is so nice!

319
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:11,708
Babe!

320
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:13,668
Here.

321
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:17,298
I'm so hungry.

322
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,758
Let's see the food
over here first.

323
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,219
Babe, here. You like this.

324
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,145
Wow! It's been so long
since I had an orange!

325
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,315
Here's a melon!

326
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,860
Avocado! Wow!

327
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:41,489
Let's see.

328
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,115
Can this help digestion?

329
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:19,026
<i>I don't think it
went as expected.</i>

330
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:22,780
<i>I've been with Su-min for 26
years, and 17 years with Min-hwan.</i>

331
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,990
<i>I'm sure something happened.</i>

332
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:26,074
<i>Then...</i>

333
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:32,039
<i>When I felt something was off, all my
ex-boyfriends broke up with me right away.</i>

334
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:36,126
<i>Min-hwan was the first
to do it behind my back.</i>

335
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,339
<i>I thought it was
because of marriage.</i>

336
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:47,054
<i>But if Min-hwan is more of
a scumbag than I thought...</i>

337
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:52,685
<i>It means</i>

338
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,354
<i>it's not over yet.</i>

339
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,537
Why are you so full of energy?

340
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:57,041
I hit a homerun!

341
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,002
What? With your
girlfriend's friend?

342
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:04,381
Shut up!

343
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:06,550
Wow! Seriously?

344
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,845
But she's her best friend.

345
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,764
I'll tell you in one sentence.

346
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:14,725
Autumn was coming,

347
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:17,770
and the night air was sexy!

348
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:30,074
What the... Okay,
let's try again.

349
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:35,204
Can you handle the consequences?
You work in the same office.

350
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,838
OUT ON BUSINESS LOG

351
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:46,256
PARK MIN-HWAN, JEONG SU-MIN

352
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,175
ACTIVITIES: JOMART TASTING EVENT

353
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,259
What's this?

354
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,639
You're going to Jomart.

355
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:54,932
It'll be tiring.

356
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:59,019
Why me?

357
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,480
Shouldn't you go instead?

358
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,440
Right, you guys fought.

359
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,362
Don't talk nonsense. I
have a presentation today.

360
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:11,532
A presentation? The slides
must be all ready, right?

361
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:12,700
I'll do it.

362
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:14,702
Is there a problem?

363
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,707
No, not at all, sir.

364
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,674
Mr. Park, shall we go?

365
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,300
Yes.

366
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,271
I'll get going, Ms. Kang.

367
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,325
Su-min's so smart.

368
00:33:56,577 --> 00:34:00,414
She's working so hard. I hope
she becomes a full-time employee.

369
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,924
<i>To my other half, Ji-won.</i>

370
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:13,469
<i>I'm sorry I didn't
know how you felt.</i>

371
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,512
<i>You're everything to me,</i>

372
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:18,348
<i>and I think it made me
blind to your feelings.</i>

373
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:22,436
<i>I just blindly
believed you loved me.</i>

374
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,689
<i>I didn't think about whether
I deserved your love.</i>

375
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:31,111
<i>So everything you said and
everything you feel towards me...</i>

376
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:32,696
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

377
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:39,578
<i>Still, can't you forgive me?</i>

378
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:43,832
<i>You're too precious to me.
I can't live without you.</i>

379
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,753
<i>I'm going to wait
until you feel better.</i>

380
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:52,633
<i>If I knock and you ever want to
reopen your closed heart to me,</i>

381
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:55,344
<i>will you smile as
if nothing happened?</i>

382
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,096
<i>You're my other half.</i>

383
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,433
<i>We can't just end
things like this.</i>

384
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,070
If I hadn't seen the end,

385
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,115
would I have been able

386
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,369
to not be swayed
after reading this?

387
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,550
She's a good writer.

388
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,432
Maybe she really means it.

389
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,785
- You're doing well. Hurry up.
- Yes, Chef.

390
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,858
I don't want to see you face.

391
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:34,776
I'm jealous.

392
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:45,037
My life is like a
well-written novel.

393
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:52,419
But if Kang Ji-won is the
one wrong sentence in it...

394
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,797
How would you feel?

395
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,843
Don't talk nonsense. Get up.

396
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:04,348
It's short and crooked.

397
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,185
The content and
writing is a mess too.

398
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,939
So it keeps catching my
eye and bothering me.

399
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,859
It opens to her
page when thrown.

400
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:22,407
There's nothing special to
find or remember in my life.

401
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,869
But only that part is so clear.

402
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,709
Nevertheless...

403
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:38,882
You're more qualified.

404
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,972
Because you'll be
alive after ten years.

405
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,004
ALLERGEN LABELING

00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:41,945
<i>What is she thinking right now?</i>

U&K FOOD UDAM'S

408
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,994
The rosé goes there.
Make sure it's seen well.

TASTING EVENT

410
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,245
I'll try it.

411
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,261
What the hell?

412
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,725
It's so good. I
think it'll be a hit.

413
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,146
This is our new product,

414
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:19,441
so try and make people
taste all three products.

415
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,901
- Okay?
- Okay!

416
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,110
Also...

417
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,123
I'll get the allergy sign.

418
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:46,885
Let's do two groups.
Those who shop after work

419
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,053
and housewives.

420
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,180
We have to check
preference too. So...

421
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:51,389
I need to go pee.

422
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:53,558
Mr. Park!

423
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:55,310
Why haven't you started?

424
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,326
What are you doing?

425
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,579
Can you check this?

426
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:16,206
Yeah, sure.

427
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,841
What the...

428
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,301
What is this?

429
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,557
What do you think?

430
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:35,809
What?

431
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:40,647
We'll start the brief
on Chef's Table,

432
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,400
the meal kit project
set to launch next year.

433
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,403
CHEF AND MENU INTRODUCTION

434
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,321
The winner of <i>One Dinner,</i>

435
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:51,366
Lee Gwang-min's chicken dish
will be the pilot product.

436
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:56,163
Production will begin in the 1st quarter,
and it'll launch in the 2nd quarter.

437
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:59,541
Then we have Daniel
Kim, a traditional chef.

438
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:04,838
Along with Park Ji-ho who's popular
with those in their 20s and 30s...

439
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:11,887
Sir!

440
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,557
Well...

441
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,353
Thank you for trusting and
letting me take over this project.

442
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,026
Sure, you didn't trust me.

443
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:31,156
You just had no other choice
given the circumstances.

444
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:36,745
I'm sure that's why you suggested
it. Still, I was very thankful...

445
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,788
I just wanted to thank you...

446
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,962
That's not why.

447
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:48,965
I thought you would be
capable of doing it.

448
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,008
Pardon?

449
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,011
And finish your sentences.

450
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:57,682
Don't trail off
whenever you speak.

451
00:41:57,766 --> 00:42:01,102
Just say, "Thank you."

452
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,481
Yes, sir.

453
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:09,653
And when you get both good and bad
feedback, remember the good one too.

454
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,113
Pardon?

455
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:15,784
I said you would be
capable of doing it.

456
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,536
Right.

457
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,996
Thank you.

458
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,172
Well, then.

459
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,769
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

460
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:58,785
I WANT TO DO IT

461
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:07,752
Wait.

462
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:09,254
What? Why?

463
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,214
What will you do?

464
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:14,634
What? You wanted to
do it! Let's do it!

465
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:16,094
What about us?

466
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:18,680
Are you toying with me?

467
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:22,475
I'll live with you both!

468
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:27,187
What?

469
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,274
Aren't you two like sisters?

470
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:33,069
In the old days, competent men
lived with sisters. It's nothing.

471
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:34,321
Damn it!

472
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:37,407
- Let go of me!
- Come on...

473
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,490
Just a second.

474
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,209
Excuse me.

475
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,796
I'm the one in charge.

476
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,256
What's wrong?

477
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,967
My husband's allergic
to pine nuts!

478
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:58,720
But there wasn't
any allergy sign!

479
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,430
- What?
- What do we do?

480
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:01,930
Honey.

481
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,516
I'll get the allergy sign.

482
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,560
ALLERGEN LABELING: PINE NUTS

483
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,730
He should go to the hospital.

484
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:20,158
You must've been so scared, and
it's impossible to make up for it,

485
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:23,453
but we apologize!

486
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:28,583
How could a big company like
U&K make such a mistake?

487
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,543
I just don't understand.

488
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:31,753
We're very sorry.

489
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:37,175
Let it go. Nothing happened.

490
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:40,887
Things like this can
happen while you work.

491
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:42,389
Yes, sir.

492
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:44,599
Since it's just us,
we'll let it go.

493
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,351
If my daughter were here...

494
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,353
We apologize one more time.

495
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:56,820
Toss the receipt.

496
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:08,998
The ambulance fees
and hospital bills.

497
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:10,834
But compensation too?

498
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:17,173
If he had such a dangerous allergy,
shouldn't he have been more careful?

499
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:18,842
Everyone likes money.

500
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:21,428
If the company finds
out about this,

501
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:23,430
it'll be bad for us.

502
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:27,809
Paying them off is the easiest.

503
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:32,480
Still, you spent so
much of your own money.

504
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:35,733
It's okay. It's me!

505
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:38,069
I've gotten a good
return on stocks.

506
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:39,612
<i>- The CEO of TKU,</i>
- So... What?

507
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:43,450
<i>Oh Chang-gyu, fled overseas,
and it's been revealed only now.</i>

508
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,702
<i>A political emergency
is happening.</i>

509
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:49,330
<i>Oh was once investigated for his
relationship with politician Choi.</i>

510
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:52,292
<i>He claimed he was
innocent, expressing his...</i>

511
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,210
<i>According to TMB's coverage,</i>

512
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:57,088
<i>it's been 27 days since
he fled the country.</i>

513
00:45:57,172 --> 00:45:59,799
<i>It has been revealed
that TKU employees</i>

514
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:02,594
<i>haven't been paid
wages for two months.</i>

515
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,724
What do I do?
Seriously? Damn it!

516
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,019
How about selling
everything now?

517
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,187
Who will buy it?

518
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:17,734
I already put it up for sale.

519
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:19,986
But everyone's
trying to sell now.

520
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,156
Then what do you have to do?

521
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,035
The transaction will be...

522
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,162
Why are you asking? So annoying!

523
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:33,791
Then you can't get a cent?

524
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:41,965
Ji-won.

525
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:46,429
The situation is much more
serious than you think.

526
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,097
I used credit.

527
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,352
Credit? What do you mean?

528
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:54,354
Then what do you have to do?

529
00:46:57,232 --> 00:47:00,360
What's the point
of talking to you?

530
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:06,449
Yes, Ms. Yang.

531
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,578
Yes, I'm in the bathroom.

532
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:15,083
You dummy. The credit
isn't important.

533
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:19,128
I even took out a private loan.

534
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:22,048
He didn't mention
the private loan.

535
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:23,508
He didn't before too.

536
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:27,512
He never says things to hurt
his pride. He's not the type.

537
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:31,724
Just in case, keep
an eye on him.

538
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:35,979
I loved you.

539
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,192
What are you doing?

540
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:45,071
Was it our fate

541
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:48,074
to be a threesome,
not just two of us?

542
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:52,620
Are you possessed? I
don't understand you.

543
00:47:57,584 --> 00:48:00,128
I'm going to marry Ji-won.

544
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:02,922
If we had more time,

545
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:06,092
I would've fallen
for you completely.

546
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:08,261
But this fate puts
the brake down.

547
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:11,222
Then...

548
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:14,851
Goodbye.

549
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:19,939
So keep my mouth shut?

550
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:23,568
What?

551
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,073
I won't...

552
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:36,414
say anything,
Min-hwan. Don't worry.

553
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:41,169
I just want you to be happy.

554
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:44,380
What?

555
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:46,757
Happy?

556
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:05,026
Why does life suck so bad?

557
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,319
Drink slowly.

558
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:10,405
Hey.

559
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,285
Do you like me?

560
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:20,625
Of course, I do.

561
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:26,756
Thank you for liking
someone like me.

562
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,307
You said to drink
slowly, so I should.

563
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:39,977
I'm sorry.

564
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:44,190
I wanted to marry you next year,

565
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:46,984
but what's left...

566
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,655
is the Han River for me.

567
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:54,283
<i>He's asking for money
in such a literary way.</i>

568
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:01,249
Damn it!

569
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:05,378
You're young. You can earn
it again. I'm in no rush.

570
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:10,800
You can't say that.

571
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:14,887
Think of your age.
What about kids?

572
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,639
You don't want any kids.

573
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:19,016
You're more important to me.

574
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:21,352
<i>That's true.</i>

575
00:50:22,437 --> 00:50:24,605
I'm a third-generation only son.

576
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,691
How can I only think of myself?

577
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,526
That's true.

578
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,362
Then what should we do?

579
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:40,328
Ji-won?

580
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,125
Shall we get married?

581
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:50,089
I can't give you a
glamorous life as I planned.

582
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:56,596
But we'll be a better family
tomorrow than we are now.

583
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:59,182
I promise.

584
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:06,355
Family?

585
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,190
Family.

586
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:12,695
<i>I know you get weak
when I mention family.</i>

587
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:18,326
<i>What a crappy way to say you'll sponge
off me for life. You call that family?</i>

588
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:23,706
It took courage for me to
say that. What's with you?

589
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:27,418
Is it because I'm broke now?

590
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,630
You're not that type of snob.

591
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:38,971
<i>How funny, right?</i>

592
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,016
He wants to marry
without a penny.

593
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:46,437
No, he must want to marry
me now that he's broke.

594
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,525
This is the same as before.

595
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:55,321
He proposed to me, saying he'd
invest with his parents' money.

596
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:03,120
My debt started to get
bigger when that went south.

597
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:07,333
But he was the person I chose, so I
thought we'd work it out together.

598
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:10,211
He was selfish.

599
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:15,007
Anyway, all my choices
were backwards.

600
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:33,609
You'll get fat if
you eat like that.

601
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:45,538
I used to give a stray
cat food in college.

602
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:50,209
I wanted to bring him home,

603
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:54,005
but I was scared I couldn't
raise him properly.

604
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:55,923
Then...

605
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:00,344
the cat disappeared one day.

606
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:01,971
It was a cold winter.

607
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:05,391
I regretted it so much then.

608
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:11,731
He was so tiny. Like this big.

609
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:14,483
He had such a temper.

610
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:19,780
He got chased away after
trying to fight other cats.

611
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:24,201
He hated people, so I don't
think anyone took him.

612
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:38,549
To tell the truth,

613
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,010
I was discharged early.

614
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:44,472
It was similar to
a car accident.

615
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:48,476
Similar to a car accident?

616
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,792
Are you okay?

617
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:13,918
Yeah, I'm fine.

618
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:24,136
Are you okay?

619
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:34,855
<i>I ruptured my knee ligaments.</i>

620
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:42,863
I jumped in front of
a car to save a cat.

621
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:44,532
I didn't get hit, though.

622
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:51,288
Then...

623
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:56,794
the cat you're raising now...

624
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,797
It was the winter of 2005.

625
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:04,635
A cheese tabby
with a bad temper.

626
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:09,098
Doesn't like people.

627
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:25,573
Are you going to work out?

628
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:27,783
Hello?

629
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,410
Where'd they go?

630
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:33,873
Was it you? It
was you all along!

631
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,960
I thought you looked
similar. It was really you!

632
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:41,172
It's 20130419.

633
00:55:41,756 --> 00:55:42,798
My passcode.

634
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:44,091
Come anytime.

635
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,177
Really? Can I?

636
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,889
Let's see each other more often!

637
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:52,975
You're so cute!

638
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:04,612
Either way, Mr. Park
must get married now.

639
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:09,033
Yes. Since he needs to
get money from his family.

640
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:15,873
His debts are probably about
half a billion won in total.

641
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,084
Maybe more.

642
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:21,337
It was worthwhile lending him

643
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,381
my money to make him
go all in with TKU.

644
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:28,969
But at this rate, I don't think
he'll give up marrying you.

645
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:33,224
So I came up with this plan.

646
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:36,477
Although,

647
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:40,773
I'll have to get
his crappy proposal.

648
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:46,779
It must be so annoying
for me, right?

649
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:50,407
But if I want to live a
long life, I must work hard.

650
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:55,204
He proposed on my birthday.

651
00:56:55,913 --> 00:57:00,084
Everything he did was
tolerable back then.

652
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:01,752
But I hated it.

653
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,296
One, two, three.

654
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,710
I have to see that again?

655
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:46,422
Terrible, right?

656
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:50,342
It's my first birthday
after being reborn.

657
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,353
Ji-hyuk did?

658
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:03,022
Yes, sir.

659
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,607
Oh, right. Also...

660
00:58:12,323 --> 00:58:13,365
NECESSITY OF R&D

661
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:15,451
TEST FLIGHT RESULTS

662
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:18,120
Wait, so this
technology is possible?

663
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:21,999
Apparently, the development
team says we can finally try it.

664
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:26,128
As you can see, those are
the test flight results.

665
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:30,299
U&K Aerobotics.

666
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,051
Shall I secure more stocks?

667
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:34,261
If this is possible, of course.

668
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:36,347
That's that. About
Ji-hyuk again.

669
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:42,561
What on earth is he
thinking right now?

670
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:24,186
Ji-won?

671
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:31,777
Min-hwan, what is all...

672
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:36,532
Don't say anything.

673
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:40,035
Tonight's for you.

674
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:45,416
My princess.

675
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:54,258
Kang Ji-won.

676
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:03,934
I love you.

677
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:37,343
Let me.

678
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:54,109
<i>I'll do everything I
can for you, Ji-won.</i>

679
01:00:54,193 --> 01:00:56,570
<i>She won't know this
is cubic, right?</i>

680
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,864
<i>But it's not like
she'll toss it.</i>

681
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,951
<i>I won't let them marry.</i>

682
01:01:04,203 --> 01:01:06,997
<i>You'd hate to see me happy.</i>

683
01:01:16,632 --> 01:01:17,800
<i>Yes.</i>

684
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:21,220
<i>Please use whatever
means necessary</i>

685
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,682
<i>to marry my husband.</i>

686
01:01:40,948 --> 01:01:44,118
<i>Ji-won jumped in
the water for me.</i>

687
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:45,285
Ji-won.

688
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:48,747
It's your turn to make me happy.

689
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:52,793
It was the best first birthday.

690
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:56,755
I'm engaged!

691
01:01:57,339 --> 01:02:01,260
<i>I'm going to milk him for
the first and last time.</i>

692
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:02,803
She bought all this?

693
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:05,139
My mother-in-law
has high standards.

694
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:07,015
<i>Why are you here?</i>

695
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:08,559
Isn't the family meeting today?

696
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,894
I'm happy with now.

697
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:16,316
It's obvious what kind of
family she'll marry into.

698
