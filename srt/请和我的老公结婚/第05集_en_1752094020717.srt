You can get a leave after serving in the army for 100 days!

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,110
Are you going to do hard labor instead of joining the army?

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,530
What's wrong with your face?

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,620
I thought you were gone.

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,080
There is a product called sunscreen

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,870
Of course, before you join the army
This thing already exists

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,330
What are we going to eat now?

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,420
Guys, we've spent a lot of money.

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,130
Let's buy some soju and go back to school.

14
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,760
What a wonderful night!

15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,100
Thanks

16
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,480
What?

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,690
Let's go

18
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,650
Drinking should be done in moderation. It scares me to death.

19
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,320
sorry

20
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,860
sorry

21
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,414
Is she alone? Should we pick her up?

22
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,458
She was practically begging us to carry her.

23
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,377
It would be rude to ignore her.

24
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,921
Yes, this goes against the spirit of chivalry.

25
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,380
Move out!

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,050
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

27
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,970
How are you?

28
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,270
Telephone pole

29
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,560
sorry

30
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,190
How are you?

31
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,940
Are you alone? What's your name?

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,900
I'm alone

33
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,990
I'm totally alone, really alone

34
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,200
My dad passed away on March 2nd.

35
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,410
so

36
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,290
I am alone

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,960
I also broke up with my boyfriend.

38
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,880
So I am really alone

39
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,050
What about friends?

40
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,890
You should have friends.

41
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,810
friend…

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,210
I have no friends because I'm a bit annoying

43
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,840
Smell of alcohol

44
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,230
What's wrong?

45
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,200
It seems delicious

46
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,950
What?

47
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,730
Episode 5

48
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,660
What are you looking at?

49
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,500
I wonder if this is beer or soju

50
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,630
My eyesight is very bad

51
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,170
Even if you close your eyes, you know it's beer.

52
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,630
If you can't tell

53
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,220
You shouldn't drink it anymore.

54
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,560
But this is the beer I bought

55
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,350
Ouch

56
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,400
Thanks

57
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,610
Doesn’t your forehead hurt?

58
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,820
No

59
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,950
But I really should drink today.

60
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,450
Then you go home and drink

61
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,170
Do you want me to drink alone?
I'm already a person

62
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,880
My dad passed away three months ago.

63
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,050
March 2

64
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,970
I know you broke up with your boyfriend too.

65
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,640
Do you have other family members? Mom or brothers and sisters

66
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,270
I don't have any brothers or sisters

67
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,070
My mother has been away from home for 3193 days

68
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,110
That was when I was in my country.

69
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,280
As for friends...

70
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,790
You have no friends because you are annoying

71
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,160
How do you know?

72
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,090
Are you a fortune teller?

73
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,390
Come, beer

74
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,970
Thanks

75
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,150
Drinking is beer

76
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,500
Actually, I have a friend

77
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,500
But every time...

78
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,050
When I was really sad, I couldn't contact her.

79
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,510
Is she busy?

80
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,510
I mean, the time is always wrong.

81
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,060
She must want to be with me.

82
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,310
I'm sad that you can't accompany me

83
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,030
But…

84
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,370
Days like today

85
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,950
If I were with Xiumin

86
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,960
I would feel a bit cowardly.

87
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,800
My boyfriend

88
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,390
One day it suddenly started

89
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,730
He always says he is busy and tired

90
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,610
And when my dad passed away

91
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,320
He didn't come

92
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,280
I had a premonition then.

93
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,410
But I still pretended to be fine

94
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,790
Three full months

95
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,710
because…

96
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,590
Alone

97
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,210
More sad

98
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,850
I found out…

99
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,280
I don't know when it started
He only has Xiumin in his eyes

100
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,780
But this is natural.

101
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,290
Xiumin is kind, pretty and cute

102
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,330
And she's my only friend.

103
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,090
Do you know that feeling?

104
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,350
Xiumin is indeed very kind

105
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,430
Pretty and cute

106
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,400
But I stood beside her

107
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,650
I'll feel so shabby.

108
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,490
A total wimp.

109
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,410
If she makes you feel this way
You should stay away from her.

110
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,210
Whether she is good or bad
If she makes you feel uncomfortable

111
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,670
To you, isn't she just a bad friend?

112
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,930
Do you know what it means to have no family?

113
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,440
Have you ever been on a boat?

114
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,820
Ever since my dad passed away

115
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,490
I feel like I'm on a boat every day

116
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,830
I stood firmly and straight, but the boat kept shaking.

117
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,290
I feel uneasy

118
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,790
I want stability

119
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,800
I want to step on the land

120
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,930
Only Xiumin can be my land

121
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,270
Only her

122
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,320
But this is all because I'm such a wimp, period.

123
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,410
Then I am also a wimp.

124
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,910
My mother passed away 15 years ago.

125
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,580
5328 days ago

126
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,380
Later I had a stepmother and a younger sister.

127
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,010
They are good people, but I feel weird.

128
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,930
So annoying

129
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,350
Wow, you are such a wimp.

130
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,430
I should cheer up.

131
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,520
The real wimp is here

132
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,400
Although it is sad to lose your mother

133
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,400
But your dad started over.
Isn't that a very good thing?

134
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,030
My dad should be like this too.

135
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,120
If so…

136
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,420
He shouldn't have died.

137
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,680
My father who started over has passed away

138
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,510
Don't think like that.

139
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
cheers

140
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,360
So warm

141
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,170
Let's just assume that neither of us is a coward.

142
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:09,010
You are right.
At least my dad was happy before he died.

143
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,730
Your father left you a new family.

144
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,850
congratulations

145
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,820
Congratulations on having a friend who is as reliable as the land

147
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,910
You are someone who has
A good man who is as reliable as the land

Lost to Liu Zhihe, an average student in the Department of Economics

154
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,040
Why?

155
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,630
Why would you go to such lengths?

156
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,550
You are obviously an ordinary person.

157
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,420
You're not an athlete.

158
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,800
I'm a soldier, take a ten-minute break.

159
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,050
What?

160
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,010
Does he mean to fight again?

161
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,720
It seems

162
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,190
Then why did he study economics?

163
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,360

It really scared me.

166
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,460
I hope he is not a student of our school.

167
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,090
Otherwise it would be too embarrassing

168
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,500
I really hate that.

169
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,800
But he's really weird.

170
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,840
Why do this to a drunk person?

171
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,640
- No way
-Yeah.

172
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,810
I should cheer up.

173

I'm already 23 years old

174
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,770
When will you become sensible?

175
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,900
Is she a senior?

176
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,450
Since you want to fight, why don't you defeat that guy Xinyu?

Am I an unattractive looking uncle?

00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,400
Which part are you asking about?

185
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,820
Does he look unpleasant? Or does he look like an old man?

186
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,610
Do you want me to recommend you a sunscreen?

187
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,240

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,830
very good

190
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,330
- Very nice
-Um

191
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,540
right

192
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,340
Hey, stop.

193
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,430
Are you here?

194
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,610
It tastes so good

195
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,480
Four

196
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,360
I'll give you nine, eat them all.

197
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,660
Eat slowly

198
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,830
Drink some water

199
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,760
If you keep eating like this you'll turn into a pig

200
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,190
(Cat Snacks)

201
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,220
Brother, why do you come to school every time you have a vacation?

202
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,270
-What is that?
- He seems to be doing something

203
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,980
-I think his senior in the military school asked him to do this.
-It seems that his military life was very hard

204
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,690
Looking back, I had a few chances.

205
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,740
Because I didn't know it was an opportunity
So I didn't grasp it.

206
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,620
Otherwise, I didn't grasp it.

207
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,830
(U&K won the 2011
The most influential food brand

208
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,670
Minister, I would like to introduce our team to you.

209
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,960
right

210
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,090
- Or...
-This person graduated from a Korean university.

211
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,590
Kang Ji-won Staff

212
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,220
Say hello

213
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,060
This is Minister Liu Zhihe who took office today.

214
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,230
Although Jiang Zhiyuan graduated from a Korean university

215
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,900
But it's not very rigorous,

216
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,900
So I paid extra attention to her.

217
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,320
-How is the project proposal I asked you to submit?
- You said you would hand it in by tomorrow

218
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,950
Did you see that? Yes

219
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,870
Let's change the next one

220
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,240
Yes, that...

221
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,920
It's no longer a chance to seize

222
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,770
But this time it's different

223
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,900
(April 19, 2013)

224
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,710
I am in a good mood indeed.

225
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,210
What are you doing?

226
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,970
Um?

227
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,390
Are you happy?

228
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,600
Follow me

229
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,780
I told you, that guy is interested in you

230
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,570
What are you talking about? He has a girlfriend.

231
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,120
Did that guy say that?
He said he has a girlfriend?

232
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,870
You are so naive

233
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,200
So what if I have a girlfriend?

234
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,210
Ji-won, I tell you, men

235
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,750
All will cheat

236
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,920
Does he have a girlfriend?

237
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,550
Even if you have a wife, you will still like someone else.
That's the man

238
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,630
Do you know who is a man’s ideal lover?

239
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,430
A strange woman I met for the first time

240
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,260
That's what a man is, you know?

241
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,850
Are all men like you?

242
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Don't be so stupid

243
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,940
That's why I say you are the problem.

244
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,820
Because you look easy to get
Men play tricks

245
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,530
You absolutely

246
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,820
That can't be the case, right?

247
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,330
What?

248
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,540
No

249
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,670
I probably thought all men were like you.

250
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,750
oh

251
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,670
Because everyone does this except me.

252
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,760
So I can see

253
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,720
I want you to be careful

254
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,510
- You don't understand
-I see

255
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,180
Agent Jiang

256
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,560
- I'm leaving
-good

257
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,690
Really

258
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,410
She's been so weird lately.

259
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,290
Surprisingly good

260
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,920
Become beautiful

261
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:26,010
This is the new revolution

262
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,180
Unprecedented

263
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,190
This is company welfare.

264
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:36,020
Our company actually has Pacific Broad Shoulders

265
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,900
Does he have broad shoulders too?

266
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,490
I was busy looking at the lines from his waist to his back

267
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,860
I didn't see his shoulders.

268
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,120
It would probably take two days and one night to take a closer look.

269
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,120
How come his legs are so long?
Why are you so selfish?

270
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,460
- So cool
- So cool

271
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,010
Hello? Hello, Director.

272
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,340
Minister Liu Zhihe

273
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,840
The Finance Team has submitted your stock trading information

274
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,390
I'm calling to confirm with you.

275
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,100
Do I need to report my personal account as well?

276
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:13,350
The change is large and you
No stocks other than ours are being bought

277
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,650
If it's inconvenient for you
Should I not report it?

278
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,770
Please, thank you.

279
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,820
Don’t you usually stay away from areas you don’t understand?

280
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,620
That's right

281
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,710
(Minister Liu Zhihe)

282
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,670
This means he knows something.

283
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,540
Did you say Roy Gental?

284
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,590
Are you sure there's nothing special?

285
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,470
Yes, although the stock price soared

286
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,680
But according to our intelligence
It’s still an uncertain project.

287
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,430
It's not a company related to Zhihe.

288
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,560
But he hasn't sold it yet.

289
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,850
Let's observe again.

290
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,770
You should also check if he has any accounts in his name.

291
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,320
Don't let Ji Hyuk know

292
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,320
OK, I understand

293
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,200
If something has changed

294
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,370
Things that weren't a problem before
It may become a problem

295
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,340
It's so sexy.

296
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,380
-His ass...
- Legs so long

297
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:31,260
Will we be interested in the minister's transformation?
Too indifferent?

298
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,060
Everyone is discussing it like crazy

299
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,020
That's not my type.

300
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,480
It was supposed to be after the relationship
Finding out that the other person is not your type

301
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,110
I'm married, it's illegal to have feelings for someone

302
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,990
Our quick-cooking meal kits

303
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:53,910
Green peppers have high nutritional value
But there aren't many farms that supply it.

304
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,200
so…

305
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:59,170
In fact, green pepper is not another variety

306
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,630
Harvested before it is fully ripe

307
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:04,960
- As long as you buy it, they should be able to supply it
-What?

308
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,170
That's true, I just found out.

309
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,680
It seems that both of you only study at your desks.

310
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,970
I come from a farm.

311
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,980
I mean when I was a kid
Grew up on the muddy ground

312
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,650
Oh really?

313
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:25,530
We've walked on a lot of muddy ground

314
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,280
That’s not right. Are we stepping on sand?

315
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,620
We used to run on the beach.

316
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,830
Reminds me of my childhood.

317
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,080
Do you remember the auntie who used to sell candy at the beach?
We ate a lot

318
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,420
Expanded sugar?

319
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,670
It's sugar

320
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,800
It's really fun to peel and eat loquat while looking at the sea

321
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,340
You always break it into pieces, and I peel it for you.

322
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,970
Please take good care of our Zhiyuan

323
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,470
You don't know how much she needs care.

324
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,770
I'm sad that she went to Seoul to attend university

325
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,230
But she couldn't make friends at that time.
Spend the whole day in the library

326
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:08,400
I had to go back and forth between Busan and Seoul.

327
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,500
You go to school in Busan?
Are you coming to Seoul to see Agent Kang?

328
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,830
Yes, every week

329
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,540
I'm really dying of exhaustion.

330
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,580
I once concentrated the course into four days.

331
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,590
Three days in Seoul

332
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,670
Is that why she can't make friends?

333
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,720
Such a long distance
Even if it's my boyfriend, I won't see him every week.

334
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,760
We are so good.

335
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:43,480
She is really your other half
This kind of friend is rare

336
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,650
This kind of friend is not worth having

337
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,110
Agent Kang, why did you go to college in Seoul?

338
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,160
Because she wants to study at a Korean university.

339
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,200
She must be sure of this.
That's a Korean university.

340
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,540
Are you here to play in the company?

341
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,210
You don't work all day, you just get together and chat

342
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,420
Graduated from Korean University, go move my car

343
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,720
The parking spaces were terrible.

344
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,640
I parked on the fourth floor underground, car number 75NA1109

345
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,360
How? Graduated from a Korean university
Don't you bother to do such a thing?

346
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,820
Are you guys going to keep chatting in the lounge?

347
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,860
That's how women are anyway.

348
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,280
Hey, everyone, get back to work.

349
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,410
Why don’t you get up right now?

350
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,750
I'm going to blow up the lounge.

351
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,010
It's you

352
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,230
It's not your fault that your master has a bad temper.

353
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,570
If I guessed correctly

354
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,450
You should be waiting for me

355
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,410
Because you want to comfort me

356
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,290
You have to tell me that you are the only one on my side

357
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,760
I'm worried about you and waiting for you

358
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,430
Have you moved the section chief's car?

359
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,140
alright

360
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:51,480
If you can't give me the quick-cooking meal plan
At least let me join.

361
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,530
I go to farms and factories.
I will really do it seriously

362
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,910
I must become a full-time employee this time

363
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,530
Let me join, please?

364
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,580
I'll think about it.

365
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,250
Are you still sulking?

366
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,250
I'm not just saying this casually

367
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:19,590
If you have something that is bothering you, you should talk about it.
If you keep doing this, I'll be hurt.

368
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:32,110
It is our destiny to be together forever

369
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,150
If I use this opportunity to get a full-time job
We'll work together till we die in U&K

370
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,070
Okay?

371
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,700
Hey, Jiang Zhiyuan, please come here as soon as you park your car.

372
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,920
When will you give me the revised business plan?
You didn't tell me you were going to form a team.

373
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,510
Sorry, it's not sorted yet.

374
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,050
Definitely not well organized

375
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,640
That's all you're capable of.

376
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,680
You can't do it on your own

377
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:11,100
I will ask Yang Zhulan to help you
I've already told Xiumin about this.

378
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,110
Agent Yang is already helping me

379
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,980
- And Hee-yeon is helping me too
-Is she any use?

380
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,900
What did she say? Never mind.

381
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,610
Because you submitted the project plan.
I didn't say much.

382
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,490
But this is a repeat of the plan I prepared last time.

383
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,620
Can I remove you?

384
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,790
Once my name is on it

385
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,580
And an agent in the district is handling
It's a completely different level

386
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:35,090
But I want you to join

387
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,300
So please stop talking back.

388
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,380
Get out now

389
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,220
Is this how things turned out?

390
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,520
Since I didn't give the project proposal to Zheng Xiumin

391
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,520
Jin Jingxu will take away my project

392
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,070
Add Zheng Xiumin's name

393
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,360
Agent Jiang

394
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,830
Oh, Minister

395
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,250
Will you be free tonight?

396
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,080
May I ask what you want me to do?

397
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,380
No, not really.

398
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:22,260
I want to have dinner with you, let's make an appointment

399
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:28,600
I have something personal tonight.

400
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,350
If it is work related

401
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,690
Please tell me the time, place and occasion
I will arrange

402
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,030
No need for this

403
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,490
OK, I understand.

404
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,370
good

405
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,620
Personal matter?

406
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,850
Eun-ho, you seem to have a guest.

407
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,020
guest?

408
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,150
Ji Won

409
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,750
I thought this was just a restaurant.
Is this a place you are familiar with?

410
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,920
Yes, this is our restaurant.
Wine bar with business dealings

411
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,170
I want you to taste the real deliciousness

412
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:52,100
The aroma is very rich, right?
This is the wine produced by the Olang Estate in 1999.

413
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:56,940
Made when we first met in high school

414
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,860
With fir and black currant

415
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,860
There is also blackberry fragrance, it is not easy to be so rich

416
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,610
I really smelled it.

417
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,360
Scent of grapes and trees

418
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,120
-It smells so good
-Do you like it?

419
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,950
Wait a minute.

420
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,410
Here are these wines

421
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,170
All of them are alcohol with a wholesale price of over 1 million won

422
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,460
Let’s drink a little from each bottle.

423
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,710
Eun Ho

424
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,300
Actually, I came to you today to invite you to dinner.

425
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,380
Have you eaten?

426
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,680
Would you like to eat?

427
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,600
I usually eat early.

428
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,520
I didn't think of that.

429
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,600
It's okay. Come and sit down.

430
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,650
We haven't seen each other for a long time. Let's chat.

431
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,730
good

432
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:06,340
What is she doing now?

433
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,220
I wanted to take care of her.

434
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,300
She's really unlucky.

435
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,890
let me see

436
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,880
Hello? Minhwan

437
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,210
Hey, Xiumin

438
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,380
Are you with Jiwon now?

439
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,010
I can't contact her

440
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,550
Ji Won just left

441
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,890
She dressed up beautifully and looked in the mirror several times

442
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:00,230
I thought she was going to date you, wasn't she?

443
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,690
What?

444
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,190
Are you dressed up nicely?

445
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:08,150
Min-hwan, you need to take care of Ji-won

446
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,280
What do you care about?

447
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,700
It's not like she's going to run away or anything.

448
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,990
Why not? She suddenly changed her look recently.

449
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,740
Women are unpredictable

450
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:21,410
Zhiyuan's mother also gave birth to her
You've found your soul mate.

451
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:26,130
But as a woman, I think this is cool

452
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,920
Although Ji-won is so pitiful

453
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,380
etc.

454
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,180
Ji Won's mother...

455
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,430
Having an affair?

456
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,020
What?

457
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,140
Don't you know?

458
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,230
what to do?

459
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,070
Did I say something wrong?

460
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,280
No

461
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,240
It's not Ji Won, I made a mistake with another friend

462
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,410
that…

463
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:02,540
I thought you knew this, of course.

464
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,960
Oh, yes.

465
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,540
I know

466
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:09,170
Her mother left home when she was a child.

467
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,880
But because of the affair...

468
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,880
No

469
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,930
I mean you don't know
Did she leave because she found true love?

470
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,810
what to do?

471
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,690
I'm going crazy

472
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,280
Minhwan

473
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,070
Just pretend you didn't hear it.

474
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,160
I said the wrong thing

475
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,200
Infidelity is not hereditary, so it's not a big problem

476
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,410
Of course, yes

477
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,120
This is not a problem

478
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,590
You are such a good man.

479
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:57,380
But I will find out what Ji Won is doing today
Tell you again

480
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:00,100
Although she is definitely working

481
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,430
Well, that should be it.

482
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,640
OK, then call me again.

483
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,270
good

484
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:40,140
You told me not to talk to you anymore
Is it because you think I rejected you?

485
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,640
Don't talk to me anymore.

486
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,180
No…

487
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,440
Don't mention that.

488
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,900
You didn't just reject me...

489
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,150
What did I say?

490
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:58,110
Did you take that
Did you say you brought the letter I wrote to you?

491
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:02,570
Yes, I brought it if you asked me to.

492
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,370
Let me see

493
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,750
(Bai Enhao: You think you are popular
Will everyone like you?)

494
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,050
(I want to vomit, so annoying
Don't talk to me!)

495
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:15,960
(Kang Ji-won)

496
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,720
Isn't this your handwriting?

497
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,970
Yes, it's my handwriting.

498
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,430
But I didn't really write this.

499
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,730
This means that Zheng Xiumin can
Imitating my handwriting perfectly

500
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,780
Really

501
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,660
Will you be cold?

502
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,200
etc.

503
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,490
No

504
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,790
The air conditioning here seems a bit strong

505
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,250
Let's go out

506
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,380
good

507
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,290
Let's go

508
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,930
You first

509
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,730
Eun Ho

510
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,820
I can see the heart of 31-year-old Eun-ho

511
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:20,740
But…

512
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,530
I have a boyfriend

513
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:31,870
Is that so?

514
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:38,670
Is that person very tall?
The one wearing black-framed glasses?

515
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,340
Black frame glasses?

516
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,050
right

517
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,220
Wearing a three-button suit

518
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,720
No fashion sense...

519
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:56,400
I mean he dresses classically.
Wearing a very expensive watch

520
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,440
Is it the minister?

521
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,820
How do you know our minister?

522
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,950
He was the one who told me there was a class reunion.

523
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,620
How does he know you?

524
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,420
So, yes

525
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:22,210
I thought he was your boyfriend

526
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,220
I think he's worried about you.

527
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,360
You opened six bottles?

528
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:48,990
Six million won?

529
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,660
And then she rejected you?

530
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,620
- She didn't reject me.
- You were rejected.

531
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:01,420
If you are not rejected
I wouldn't be here looking so pitiful.

532
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,220
Before I give up

533
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,930
I'm not rejected.

534
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,720
Even though she has a boyfriend

535
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,190
even though…

536
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:20,270
There are other boys who like her

537
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,400
Did you still send her home?

538
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,780
-What?
-You were rejected

539
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,110
Just give up.

540
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,620
hateful

541
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:38,620
Ouch

542
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:55,810
(Represented by Kang Ji-won)

543
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:19,960
(Agent Jiang Zhiyuan, dialing)

544
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,960
(Park Minhwan)

545
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,800
(Park Min-hwan, missed call)

546
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,270
That's stomach cramps.

547
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,140
Drinking on an empty stomach is not good

548
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,190
good

549
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:46,730
When the pain subsides, take the medicine with hot porridge.

550
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,570
OK, check out please

551
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,380
Drinking on an empty stomach is not good

552
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:46,250
I was scared to death!

553
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,630
Are you crazy? Why are you exaggerating?

554
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:54,340
So it’s you?

555
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,430
how?

556
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,600
Were you expecting it to be another man?

557
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,140
no

558
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:06,520
Then why are you following me? Just call me

559
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,530
Why should I make you happy? You don't answer my calls.

560
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:12,990
What?

561
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:14,740
So funny

562
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,200
You are self-aggrandizing.

563
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,540
Men are not interested in you.

564
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:23,910
And seeing you're so scared

565
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:25,790
Really interesting

566
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,750
Is this interesting?

567
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,420
Yes, it's very interesting.

568
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:35,630
Say

569
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,680
Where have you been?

570
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,930
Do you put on lipstick again after get off work?

571
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,430
What are you talking about?

572
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,690
Look

573
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:49,860
Why are your lips so red?

574
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,030
Where did you go to seduce someone?
What's that on your face?

575
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,280
Is this blush?

576
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,330
Blushing

577
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,540
Like mother, like daughter

578
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:10,670
What did you just say?

579
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,550
What?

580
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:15,510
I asked you what you were talking about.

581
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:16,420
What?

582
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,720
I didn't say anything

583
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,930
I'm doing this because you've been really suspicious lately.

584
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:25,810
It's Jung Soo Min

585
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:28,390
Zheng Xiumin told him about her mother

586
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,600
how?

587
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:31,650
You've been acting strange lately, right?

588
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,780
I bought clothes that I wouldn't normally buy.

589
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:35,690
What?

590
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:38,700
Did you wear perfume?

591
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,910
What kind of perfume? It smells like soap.

592
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:46,040
Where did you go after get off work?

593
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,210
You honestly

594
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,920
Let me go

595
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:56,960
Very painful

596
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:58,550
hateful

597
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:01,640
I'll go to the company to see your off-get off work time.

598
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,140
Tell me the truth, where have you been?

599
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,810
I asked you where you went?

600
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:06,520
What are you doing?

601
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:21,450
Minister Liu Zhihe?

602
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:26,330
grown ups?

603
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:33,250
What's going on? Is the minister so great?

604
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,050
How are you two?

605
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,130
Are you crazy?

606
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,220
etc.

607
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,890
Anyway, if I leave her alone, she will die.

608
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,810
minister

609
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,940
You can't do this.

610
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:58,230
minister!

611
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:02,490
Let me go

612
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,280
hateful

613
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,700
Damn

614
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,480
No, why should I run away?

615
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:38,070
Liu Zhihe, that bastard
If I were in better shape, you would have...

616
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:47,950
Forget about Liu Zhihe

617
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:50,040
Um?

618
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,040
Why didn’t Jiang Zhiyuan follow?

619
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,670
Is she really crazy?

620
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,500
Um?

621
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:01,050
Both of them?

622
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,300
Go to hell, damn it

623
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,810
In this case, the person who left the woman behind

624
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,570
It's my husband.

625
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,160
Is your wrist okay?

626
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:33,080
How come you are here?

627
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:38,920
I just came here to do some work.

628
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:41,630
What's the matter?

629
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,970
that…

630
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:53,430
Because you didn't answer the phone

631
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,980
Although nothing should happen
But I'm worried about what might happen.

632
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:02,320
Why are you worrying about me?

633
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,440
It's time to get off work

634
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:08,610
Even if something happens to me,

635
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:12,240
- It has nothing to do with you.
-Related

636
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,500
I'm worried

637
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,460
Park Min Hwan will hurt you

638
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,890
Why do you think so?

639
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:31,600
People don't change

640
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,220
What I have done before I will do again

641
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,520
Min Hwan does have violent tendencies
But the minister has already discovered it?

642
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,770
I didn't know that before I got married.

643
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,320
-Park Min Hwan never laid a hand on me...
- He just moved.

644
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,740
It's no big deal

645
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,870
No, please don't say that.

646
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:59,080
No one can do anything to you

647
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,420
How is it no big deal?

648
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,710
I should break all his fingers.

649
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,380
It can be seen from NurTV at that time
He is a man of insight.

650
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,140
The problem is…

651
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,510
No

652
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,350
Seeing Park Min-hwan so scared
I find it interesting.

653
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:25,610
So that's not a problem

654
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,620
What is the situation now?

655
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:38,160
I'm here to see a good show
Watch her fight with Park Min-hwan

656
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,380
(Park Minhwan)

657
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:47,210
(Swipe to answer)

658
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,340
Hello?

659
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:52,180
Yes, Minhwan

660
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,970
Your behavior makes me uncomfortable

661
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:59,060
I'm worried about you

662
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:01,600
I don't want you to worry about me

663
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,730
Your feelings make me feel uncomfortable

664
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:10,820
Do you know what I mean?

665
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:19,120
Because of my personal experience
I hate emotional cheating.

666
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:22,790
I especially believe that you shouldn't betray your partner.

667
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:26,710
I've already dealt with it

668
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,550
deal with?

669
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:37,260
Is your girlfriend your business?

670
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:40,640
- No, that's not...
- Oh my god, I didn't think you were that kind of person

671
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,980
You're worse than I thought.

672
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,770
Hee-yeon is a very precious person to me.

673
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,450
She is so kind and beautiful

674
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:54,360
And lovable...

675
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:00,040
Never mind. I'll tell her myself.

676
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,250
No, Jiwon, please wait a moment.

677
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,170
Please calm down first

678
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:09,500
listen to me

679
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,590
So you thought I was dating Liu Xiyan

680
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,970
And then you're planning on cheating, right?

681
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:19,470
Because I like you

682
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,180
Isn’t it?

683
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:24,230
That's right

684
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:28,400
It's only this part of you that I like.

685
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:33,900
Come

686
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,790
(The most beautiful beauty)

687
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:50,130
Why are you calling me in the middle of the night? It's so scary?

688
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,760
-Hee Yeon
- If you don't within five seconds

689
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:55,340
Tell me what you want to do and this phone will explode

690
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,800
-Five, four...
-I love you

691
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,310
Does she sound like my girlfriend?

692
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,770
(The most beautiful beauty)

693
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,820
Besides, this is the name Liu Xiyan saved herself
Give you a reference

694
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:19,200
Hearing those disgusting words
I should not see you for a month.

695
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,030
But I will still see you at the company tomorrow
That's why I ask you

696
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:26,620
Are you terminally ill?
Or do you want to withdraw from our household registration?

697
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,290
(End of call)

698
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,540
that…

699
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,800
so…

700
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,720
So you two are brother and sister.

701
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:43,260
Liu Xiyan

702
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:44,640
Liu Zhihe

703
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,820
What should I do? I'm sorry.

704
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,110
Please forget what I said today

705
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:59,660
I had a huge misunderstanding

706
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:03,660
You haven't got it all wrong.

707
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,620
I…

708
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:15,840
I like you very much

709
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,860
Thank you for sending me back

710
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:05,930
minister

711
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,230
minister

712
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:10,390
minister

713
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,400
what to do?

714
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:15,480
minister

715
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,570
minister?

716
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,360
minister

717
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:38,090
So for Kang Ji-won's sake

718
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:39,460
It would be better if you break up.

719
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,260
Minister, aren't you crossing the line?

720
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:45,260
The first step to victory
Just stand on the mat and face your opponent

721
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:49,810
I don't want to be robbed of everything by heartless people again

722
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,350
He is one of the people that Kang Ji-won has dated.
The best one

723
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,270
You exit

724
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:58,320
All of them should be in the name of Wang Xingren, the executive

725
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,110
You are really good at fighting.

726
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,360
First stand on the mat and face your opponent

727
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:05,780
The question is how to knock it down
