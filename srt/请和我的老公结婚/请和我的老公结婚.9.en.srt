<i>- Happy birthday to you!
- Happy birthday to you!</i>

13
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:59,327
I wondered why you'd have
such a fancy birthday party.

14
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:01,370
Was it to propose?

15
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:05,208
I hope today will be the best gift
of her life.

16
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,292
How was it?

17
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:09,921
You're so lucky!

18
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:12,590
This is amazing.

19
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,759
How did you come up with this?

20
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:22,683
<i>I was a little surprised
by the drones and fireworks too.</i>

21
00:01:24,602 --> 00:01:27,188
Well, you know. I'd do anything.

22
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:33,986
You know, I would've still been happy
with a cheaper event.

23
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:34,904
Thanks.

Proposal...

PROPOSAL DECORATION

27
00:01:44,747 --> 00:01:45,748
It's 39,000 won?

28
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:50,419
This is 50,000 won? This is insane!

29
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:52,338
Oh, hello.

30
00:01:57,552 --> 00:02:00,847
The company will provide a villa
for Ms. Kang's birthday

31
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,724
to offer consolation
for what happened recently.

32
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:05,393
Consolation?

33
00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:07,061
For what Mr. Kim did.

34
00:02:07,687 --> 00:02:08,729
Oh, right.

35
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:11,023
It's for that.

36
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:14,026
But a villa for consolation?

37
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:18,531
Normally, a condo,
but they're more generous this time.

38
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,450
<i>He's really in love with her.</i>

39
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,870
<i>It's true love!</i>

40
00:02:23,953 --> 00:02:26,706
<i>But too bad. You clearly don't know women.</i>

41
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,666
<i>Ji-won only loves me.</i>

42
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,130
Don't grab like that! You're crazy!

43
00:02:36,048 --> 00:02:37,884
I'm sorry, sir.

44
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:40,845
This is a great opportunity.

45
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:44,098
Why don't we have the party
with everyone on our team?

46
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:48,686
She thought it was a birthday party,
but surprise!

47
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,607
I'm going to propose to her.

48
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:57,987
I'm going to marry Kang Ji-won.

49
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,659
<i>Come and get your heart broken, punk!</i>

50
00:03:03,743 --> 00:03:05,411
<i>I hate your guts!</i>

51
00:03:05,494 --> 00:03:07,622
You'll come too, right?

52
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,374
Of course.

53
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,793
I can provide other support too.

54
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:19,926
Well...

55
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:41,614
Congrats.

56
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:49,121
Have you...

57
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:51,999
still not forgiven me?

58
00:03:57,713 --> 00:04:01,133
Ji-won, I'm sorry. Stop being mad at me.

59
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:03,552
Please?

60
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:04,845
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:08,933
Don't be mad.

62
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:12,728
Let's go back
to being good friends. Please, Ji-won?

63
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:23,280
I can't figure you out.

64
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:27,368
But what's important is

65
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:29,996
that I don't really want to.

66
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:35,126
Bye.

67
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:36,794
Ji-won...

68
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,760
Kang Ji-won!

69
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:05,948
You know I can't swim.

70
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:15,374
Guess what they say then?

71
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,751
What?

72
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:18,210
Carbonara.

73
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:22,733
Ji-won.

74
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:46,632
Are you cold?

75
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:50,928
Are you okay?

76
00:06:51,804 --> 00:06:52,930
I'm fine.

77
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,809
Su-min's sleeping.
She must've been surprised.

78
00:06:58,435 --> 00:07:00,646
What a relief. It could've been bad.

79
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:04,024
How did she fall in?

80
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:07,862
She didn't jump in, did she?

81
00:07:08,946 --> 00:07:10,322
She slipped.

82
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:11,740
She seemed drunk.

83
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,076
Really?

84
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,453
I'm glad no one's hurt.

85
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:20,332
Su-min should be grateful to you
for the rest of her life.

86
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,709
You're her savior.

87
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:25,379
Thankfully, there's some hot cocoa.

88
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:27,131
It's hot.

89
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:31,844
Yeah, drink that.

90
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:33,888
Let's bring your temperature up.

91
00:07:35,514 --> 00:07:37,641
I bet you'll have a good life.

92
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:40,936
The more accidents,
the more to reminisce about.

93
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,064
The proposal was nice!

94
00:07:44,148 --> 00:07:46,066
Of course.

95
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:50,446
- Shall we clean up?
- What?

96
00:07:51,113 --> 00:07:53,824
But it's only 11.

97
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:58,454
We need to talk and drink more.
The night's still young.

98
00:07:59,205 --> 00:08:01,957
I'm pretty shook up, so I'm tired too.

99
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,918
Let's all rest.

100
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:05,711
Thanks for tonight.

101
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:06,879
Let's go.

102
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:10,132
Shall we go up too?

103
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:13,719
Go ahead. I'll go after I drink this.

104
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:16,639
Yeah, sure.

105
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:39,703
That was a textbook proposal.
It went great.

106
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:43,374
I could never do it again. No way!

107
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,335
Oh, my God! What the hell?

108
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:47,461
What?

109
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:52,925
You're quite late.

110
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:57,096
What are you doing here?

111
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:01,809
Get in here.

112
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:08,857
I proposed today.

113
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,318
And Ji-won's in the next room.

114
00:09:13,237 --> 00:09:15,072
That makes it more thrilling.

115
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,658
You don't want to?

116
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:21,704
Are you drunk?

117
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:24,498
You look really happy.

118
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:30,462
Ji-won...

119
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,757
jumped in the water for me.

120
00:09:46,312 --> 00:09:47,313
Now...

121
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:51,358
it's your turn to make me happy.

122
00:09:58,407 --> 00:09:59,366
Come on.

123
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:16,884
Are you okay?

124
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,728
She jumped in.

125
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,938
She didn't slip.

126
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:32,691
She jumped in.

127
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,651
Right in front of me.

128
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:44,828
<i>Maybe I didn't know Su-min at all.</i>

129
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:52,878
<i>I thought it'd be easy.</i>

130
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:57,007
<i>That Min-hwan is trash
and Su-min covets my things,</i>

131
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:59,968
<i>so I just need them to marry
to become happy.</i>

132
00:11:03,472 --> 00:11:04,723
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

133
00:11:09,812 --> 00:11:11,647
She dragged me down.

134
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,734
She grabbed my arm
and dragged me down deeper.

135
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:18,487
Also...

136
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,949
she was smiling.

137
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:29,623
Did I imagine it?

138
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:31,583
I wish that were true.

139
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:33,836
But no.

140
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,381
She tried to die for real.

141
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:44,221
As if dying in the water was nothing

142
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:47,975
and she didn't care about anything
as long as I died with her.

143
00:12:58,337 --> 00:13:00,047
I want to show you something.

144
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:23,403
When I felt confused
and unsure of what I was doing,

145
00:13:24,613 --> 00:13:25,989
I always came here.

146
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:31,286
Once I cleared my head here,

147
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:34,456
I felt I could take another step.

148
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:42,214
No one knows the future.

149
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:45,342
However,

150
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,304
we know more than other people.

151
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:55,060
So don't be scared.

152
00:13:55,143 --> 00:13:57,771
You've gotten so much better.

153
00:13:57,854 --> 00:14:01,149
You learned something new
about a friend of 26 years.

154
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:07,990
If Su-min showed you a side
she never had before,

155
00:14:08,073 --> 00:14:12,828
it means you're not an easy target
to her anymore.

156
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:24,673
I truly wish you a happy birthday.

157
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:36,852
Thanks for the proposal.

158
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:42,983
It was the best first birthday.

159
00:14:57,842 --> 00:15:03,669
MARRY MY HUSBAND

160
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,714
EPISODE 9

161
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:15,390
Ms. Kang!

162
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:17,267
- Hello.
- Hello.

163
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,896
Oh, my. What's that?

164
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:22,272
Ms. Kang, no way!

165
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:26,318
I'm engaged!

166
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:28,236
Wow! Is that a carat?

167
00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:31,657
Wow, Mr. Park really did it.

168
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,116
It's so pretty.

169
00:15:33,784 --> 00:15:34,785
I'm so jealous.

170
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,912
- It looks good on her.
- Yeah.

171
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:20,038
Why tell everyone if you'll call it off?

172
00:16:20,622 --> 00:16:22,666
Because I'm going to call it off.

173
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,628
Park Min-hwan's life
will take a bigger hit

174
00:16:26,712 --> 00:16:28,630
once everything's revealed.

175
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:33,343
You know, I've gotten a lot better.

176
00:16:34,886 --> 00:16:37,013
What are you doing this weekend?

177
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:39,057
Come to Yuhan Department Store.

178
00:16:39,808 --> 00:16:44,020
I'm going to milk him
for the first and last time.

179
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,150
It's a shame I have a trip to Japan.

180
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,320
You're going to miss out
on a big spectacle.

181
00:16:52,404 --> 00:16:54,322
Min-hwan's face will be a sight.

182
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,117
I'll be rooting for you.

183
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,251
The family can meet on the weekend.

184
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:10,797
My mom has a cooking class
at the cultural center. There's no time.

185
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,759
Are you eating something nice? Buy me too.

186
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:16,553
Goodness.

187
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,555
You're so greedy, aren't you?

188
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,682
- I want...
- My God!

189
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:24,352
It's the printer.

190
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:26,855
It must be jealous.

191
00:17:26,938 --> 00:17:30,066
Are you two planning another surprise?

192
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,778
I'm so jealous of Ms. Kang.

193
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:36,364
It's the least they can do.

194
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:38,533
Only the family dinner's left now.

195
00:17:38,617 --> 00:17:41,995
You'll do something legendary again,
right, Mr. Park?

196
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:44,873
Even I can't wait.

197
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,334
Right.

198
00:17:48,418 --> 00:17:51,379
I didn't know Min-hwan had
this side to him.

199
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:54,549
My expectations are so high now.

200
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,552
They are?

201
00:17:57,636 --> 00:18:01,014
What do you mean by expectations?

202
00:18:01,097 --> 00:18:02,098
Come on.

203
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:06,812
Good men buy women clothes, shoes,
and bags before the family dinner, right?

204
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:10,899
Wait, women run away
if you buy them shoes.

205
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:13,109
The best friend can buy them!

206
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:18,532
Oh, is that a thing?

207
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:20,617
So nice! I'll spread the word.

208
00:18:27,457 --> 00:18:28,542
Yeah, sure.

209
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,548
What to sell second hand...

210
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:41,429
Just the frame.
I'll toss the rest. They're too old.

211
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:43,765
And the...

212
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:45,725
Who's that?

213
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:57,362
Ji-won.

214
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,324
I'll just give you this and leave.

215
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:04,035
Your birthday present.

216
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:17,966
<i>These.</i>

217
00:19:20,677 --> 00:19:23,054
Aren't they pretty? Buy them for me.

218
00:19:23,555 --> 00:19:25,015
As my birthday present.

219
00:19:34,357 --> 00:19:35,400
Well...

220
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:37,402
And...

221
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:44,034
I want to give you something else
as a wedding present.

222
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,036
Is that okay?

223
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:53,710
You're getting married,
and you can't cook.

224
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:00,216
I heard Yuhan Department Store Cultural
Center has a good weekend cooking class.

225
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:02,886
I'll pay for it.

226
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:05,555
Let's take the class together.

227
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:12,896
Yuhan Mall's cooking class?

228
00:20:15,273 --> 00:20:16,858
Make it just like this.

229
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:24,574
YUHAN DEPARTMENT STORE CULTURAL CENTER
SPECIAL COOKING CLASS

230
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:26,743
<i>The class Kim Ja-ok was taking.</i>

231
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:31,164
<i>This never happened before.</i>

232
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:34,918
<i>I'm sure Su-min's evolving
because I've changed my attitude.</i>

233
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:40,340
You don't like it?

234
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:43,843
That's not it.

235
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:44,886
Thank you.

236
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:49,474
I'm more grateful.

237
00:20:51,643 --> 00:20:52,727
Ji-won.

238
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:57,607
I'm really sorry.

239
00:20:59,943 --> 00:21:03,279
Thanks for the chance.
I won't disappoint you.

240
00:21:04,114 --> 00:21:10,245
I'm going to become your real other half.
Someone you can really rely on.

241
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:37,981
<i>I must have no talent for acting.</i>

242
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:40,275
<i>Because it's so hard</i>

243
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:44,696
<i>to pretend to be biting it
when I know it's bait.</i>

244
00:22:13,224 --> 00:22:14,517
This is great.

245
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,773
If the bad guys weren't bad enough,
I'd be hesitant to take revenge.

246
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:26,571
But they just won't give up
and continue to be so persistently bad.

247
00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:28,156
Thanks.

248
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,326
Thank you so much.

249
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:51,736
YUHAN DEPARTMENT STORE CULTURAL CENTER
COOKING CLASS

250
00:22:55,114 --> 00:22:57,200
I had to pay for parking last week.

251
00:22:57,283 --> 00:22:59,827
I've been coming here for years.

252
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,246
That's not possible.

253
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,040
Your name and plate number?

254
00:23:04,123 --> 00:23:07,460
Kim Ja-ok, 5780.

255
00:23:08,127 --> 00:23:12,882
Ma'am, you parked
for over six hours last week.

256
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:15,635
We only provide two hours for the class.

257
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:18,179
- It's our policy that you must buy...
- No.

258
00:23:18,262 --> 00:23:22,183
It's just a tiny parking spot,
but you make me pay?

259
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:23,976
I've never once paid!

260
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,229
Why are you making me pay now?

261
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:32,401
This is my spot.

262
00:23:34,403 --> 00:23:35,530
Goodness.

263
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:39,575
Everyone pays for this class.
How are there assigned seats?

264
00:23:40,743 --> 00:23:42,620
Look at this young lady.

265
00:23:42,703 --> 00:23:44,413
I'm an adult, and I said so.

266
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:47,416
Move out of the way. Go over there!

267
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,045
I'm sorry. Let's just do what she says.

268
00:23:51,546 --> 00:23:53,297
- We'll go.
- Don't say sorry.

269
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:54,757
Nothing's set here.

270
00:23:57,218 --> 00:23:59,095
That girl knows a thing or two.

271
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:03,015
I swear, there will always
be rude, ill-mannered people.

272
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:05,059
They're everywhere.

273
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,366
I called and checked the quantity.

274
00:24:20,449 --> 00:24:24,328
And the Jomart tasting evaluation.
There it is.

275
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:27,290
And the proposal for promotion.
Where is it?

276
00:24:27,373 --> 00:24:30,418
Farm assessment form.

277
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:33,254
Oh, no.

278
00:24:37,717 --> 00:24:39,177
I'm really busy...

279
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,595
<i>Mommy.</i>

280
00:24:41,888 --> 00:24:42,972
Yeon-ji?

281
00:24:43,472 --> 00:24:46,851
Mommy, it's Sunday. Where are you?

282
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:48,895
I'm hungry.

283
00:24:49,478 --> 00:24:52,023
How did you call me?

284
00:24:52,106 --> 00:24:54,317
Where's your daddy? Where is he?

285
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,236
Daddy? He's busy.

286
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,989
I'm hungry. When are you coming home?

287
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:02,992
Why is your daddy busy?

288
00:25:03,075 --> 00:25:05,912
Is he not home? Where is he?

289
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:22,803
Sir, can you drive faster?

290
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:26,098
My five-year-old daughter
is home alone right now.

291
00:25:26,182 --> 00:25:28,059
I'm sorry to hear that,

292
00:25:28,142 --> 00:25:31,646
but I can't clear this weekend traffic.

293
00:25:36,776 --> 00:25:38,444
This is insane.

294
00:25:38,527 --> 00:25:40,488
YEON-JI'S DAD

295
00:25:43,866 --> 00:25:45,368
<i>Mommy!</i>

296
00:25:45,451 --> 00:25:47,078
- Yeon-ji!
- <i>Mommy!</i>

297
00:25:47,161 --> 00:25:50,623
It's me. This is a video call.
Put it down and look at me.

298
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:53,125
- <i>Mommy!</i>
- Don't cry. Look at me.

299
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:57,838
<i>Mommy!</i>

300
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,663
Yeon-ji, I'll be there as soon as I can.
Just wait.

301
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:37,378
Mr. Lee!

302
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:41,299
Please help me.

303
00:27:11,287 --> 00:27:13,331
Here. Thank you.

304
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,083
Sir, thank you so much.

305
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:17,668
Thank you.

306
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:27,970
Where did you go?

307
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,806
I had some work to do.

308
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:33,225
Do I play all day?

309
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:34,894
It's the weekend.

310
00:27:36,312 --> 00:27:37,188
Noodles...

311
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,443
How could you feed her instant noodles?

312
00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:43,736
Don't eat that.

313
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:45,321
So dramatic.

314
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:47,698
You feed her then.

315
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:51,327
Are you okay?

316
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,037
- Mommy.
- Yeah?

317
00:27:56,248 --> 00:27:59,293
Why go to work on the weekend
to come back so early?

318
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:31,534
Your hands are quick and neat
for a young lady.

319
00:28:32,618 --> 00:28:34,245
I love to cook.

320
00:28:41,794 --> 00:28:43,379
But as for you...

321
00:28:44,213 --> 00:28:47,550
How will she cook for her family
if she's that slow?

322
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,845
They won't eat tomorrow at that speed.

323
00:28:50,928 --> 00:28:53,055
Maybe breakfast in two days?

324
00:28:53,139 --> 00:28:54,974
No, lunch in two days.

325
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:56,475
What?

326
00:28:57,476 --> 00:28:58,394
What was that?

327
00:28:58,477 --> 00:29:02,648
My boyfriend loves cooking,
so he'll cook for me for the two days.

328
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:10,990
Men weren't even allowed in the kitchen
back in the day.

329
00:29:12,575 --> 00:29:13,951
It's not that day now.

330
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,705
I'm happy with now.

331
00:29:18,914 --> 00:29:20,624
What's your problem?

332
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:25,629
It's obvious what kind of family
she'll marry into.

333
00:29:28,048 --> 00:29:29,383
- Ja-ok?
- Goodness!

334
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,509
Are you done?

335
00:29:30,593 --> 00:29:31,927
Hello!

336
00:29:34,263 --> 00:29:36,599
<i>Why is she so annoying?</i>

337
00:29:39,935 --> 00:29:43,772
Sir, women who can't even cook

338
00:29:43,856 --> 00:29:47,526
are signing up for this class
to try and seduce a man.

339
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,488
You have to be careful of them.

340
00:29:51,155 --> 00:29:53,365
Yeah, I understand.

341
00:29:58,787 --> 00:30:00,206
Goodness, Ji-won!

342
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:02,458
How did you make it so pretty?

343
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,586
Wow! That's amazing. You're the best.

344
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:07,463
Great job.

345
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:14,345
<i>I was bad at cooking
around this time. But...</i>

346
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:28,984
Peel that pear.

347
00:30:29,818 --> 00:30:30,819
Yes, ma'am.

348
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:38,494
Not so thick. Thinner.

349
00:30:38,577 --> 00:30:39,537
Okay.

350
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:44,041
<i>Thanks for the hard training.</i>

351
00:30:45,334 --> 00:30:47,920
<i>I love her cooking skills.</i>

352
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,965
<i>How could someone so rude...</i>

353
00:30:53,717 --> 00:30:55,511
Food shouldn't just look good.

354
00:30:55,594 --> 00:30:59,098
It's hard to make good carrot <i>râpées.</i>

355
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:02,893
This taste...

356
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,318
It's the same as the teacher's.

357
00:31:11,986 --> 00:31:15,489
<i>Because you learned it here
and taught it to me, Ms. Kim.</i>

358
00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:22,663
I'm glad you think it's good.

359
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:35,467
When did you learn to cook?

360
00:31:36,552 --> 00:31:38,929
I didn't learn. I just did it.

361
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,141
I wanted to make it pretty,
so I went slow.

362
00:31:44,643 --> 00:31:47,354
I learned what carrot <i>râpées </i>were today.

363
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:51,817
Well, my dad taught it to me long ago.

364
00:31:53,736 --> 00:31:55,404
Your dad...

365
00:31:55,487 --> 00:31:56,864
He was a great person.

366
00:31:57,656 --> 00:31:59,867
- Enjoy.
- Thank you. Let's go.

367
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,744
Let's go do some shopping.

368
00:32:02,828 --> 00:32:03,912
Min-hwan!

369
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:11,920
He's buying me clothes
for the family dinner.

370
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,256
Want to join us?

371
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,430
But...

372
00:32:22,723 --> 00:32:25,017
I didn't know Su-min...

373
00:32:27,102 --> 00:32:28,270
would be here.

374
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:38,697
Babe, when are we meeting your parents?

375
00:32:39,323 --> 00:32:40,199
What?

376
00:32:42,284 --> 00:32:46,580
Well, we have to set a date.

377
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:48,374
I should go.

378
00:32:51,835 --> 00:32:52,836
I have plans.

379
00:32:54,421 --> 00:32:58,634
If I knew you were coming,
I wouldn't have made other plans.

380
00:32:59,176 --> 00:33:00,135
You have plans?

381
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,973
Yeah, let's hang out next time. I'll buy!

382
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,935
We did birthday and wedding gifts.

383
00:33:08,018 --> 00:33:09,395
Next time,

384
00:33:09,478 --> 00:33:11,355
it's a gift for my savior.

385
00:33:13,273 --> 00:33:14,191
Yeah, okay.

386
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,236
It's a date, then. Just the two of us.

387
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:19,905
Yeah, sounds good.

388
00:33:19,988 --> 00:33:22,074
This is nice!

389
00:33:29,123 --> 00:33:32,376
I'm really alive because of you.

390
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:39,550
Bye.

391
00:33:49,935 --> 00:33:51,937
Do you need any duty-free items?

392
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,021
That's okay.

393
00:33:55,441 --> 00:33:57,776
Do you need any duty-free items?

394
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,861
That's fine.

395
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:02,364
Wait a second.

396
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,034
Do you want to see?

397
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:18,213
<i>Are you saying
he bought the same necklace?</i>

398
00:34:19,506 --> 00:34:21,925
No, it's a bit different. This one...

399
00:34:22,551 --> 00:34:24,219
It looked quite expensive.

400
00:34:39,902 --> 00:34:41,236
I want this one.

401
00:34:42,738 --> 00:34:45,157
Hey, this is too expensive.

402
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,450
Are you newlyweds?

403
00:34:46,533 --> 00:34:48,160
The perfect wedding gift.

404
00:34:49,411 --> 00:34:50,871
I haven't met her yet,

405
00:34:50,954 --> 00:34:53,832
but I hear his mother has high standards.

406
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:55,334
If that's the case,

407
00:34:55,417 --> 00:34:57,044
you'll need that bag.

408
00:34:59,379 --> 00:35:00,714
It's not just her.

409
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,675
We both work at U&K, actually.

410
00:35:03,759 --> 00:35:07,763
Everyone's dying to see what he'll buy
for me. Even I feel pressured.

411
00:35:09,723 --> 00:35:12,267
<i>Pride controls his body.</i>

412
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:13,852
Yeah, well...

413
00:35:13,936 --> 00:35:15,395
I'm a legend at U&K.

414
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,648
We'll take it.

415
00:35:17,731 --> 00:35:19,191
- Can I?
- Of course.

416
00:35:19,274 --> 00:35:21,443
Show us a few more similar ones.

417
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,534
This would go well with pink.

418
00:35:28,617 --> 00:35:29,910
- With this bag!
- What...

419
00:35:49,763 --> 00:35:52,015
How could she buy all of these?

420
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:03,443
Are you going to wear
cheap clothes you bought online again?

421
00:36:04,361 --> 00:36:05,654
I told you.

422
00:36:05,737 --> 00:36:07,990
My mom has high standards.

423
00:36:08,073 --> 00:36:09,449
We can't get married

424
00:36:10,075 --> 00:36:11,493
if she doesn't like you.

425
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,249
<i>I didn't want to spend his money
when he was struggling.</i>

426
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,376
<i>Why did I do that?</i>

427
00:36:19,459 --> 00:36:22,963
<i>He would've bought it
for another woman anyway if not me.</i>

428
00:36:23,922 --> 00:36:25,382
<i>It was no big deal.</i>

429
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:27,968
Here's your coffee.

430
00:36:28,594 --> 00:36:29,720
Thank you.

431
00:36:31,179 --> 00:36:33,891
Min-hwan, isn't this beautiful?

432
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:35,350
I love it.

433
00:36:37,185 --> 00:36:41,231
I finally feel like
I'm up to par with your parents.

434
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:45,736
Getting a family is really great.

435
00:36:47,571 --> 00:36:49,114
It's pretty. Yeah.

436
00:36:49,197 --> 00:36:51,241
They're all pretty. All of them.

437
00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:56,330
I realized yet again
that a woman should meet the right man.

438
00:36:57,247 --> 00:37:00,542
Of course.
A woman needs to meet the right man.

439
00:37:04,796 --> 00:37:07,799
We have to have our family meeting now.

440
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,594
We have to go somewhere to eat.

441
00:37:10,677 --> 00:37:13,221
How shall we pay for the meal?

442
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:14,681
BAEK EUN-HO

443
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,439
- Baek Eun-ho?
- Yeah, go on.

444
00:37:24,149 --> 00:37:26,068
The one running a restaurant?

445
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:29,613
- No.
- No?

446
00:37:29,696 --> 00:37:30,822
Wait.

447
00:37:31,406 --> 00:37:32,407
Hello?

448
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,537
Isn't this Ji-won's phone?

449
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:38,956
Yes, hello.

450
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:41,166
I'm Min-hwan, Ji-won's boyfriend.

451
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:46,421
Yes, hello.

452
00:37:47,714 --> 00:37:49,383
I'm Eun-ho, Ji-won's friend.

453
00:37:50,092 --> 00:37:51,677
<i>I heard a lot about you.</i>

454
00:37:52,302 --> 00:37:54,680
She said you were a great chef.

455
00:37:54,763 --> 00:37:58,392
Yeah, thanks.

456
00:37:58,475 --> 00:38:02,604
But can I speak with Ji-won right now?

457
00:38:02,688 --> 00:38:04,272
That's not important.

458
00:38:04,356 --> 00:38:06,942
I heard you ran a fine dining restaurant.

459
00:38:07,025 --> 00:38:08,276
What cuisine is it?

460
00:38:08,777 --> 00:38:11,071
Is it French or Italian?

461
00:38:11,154 --> 00:38:12,781
Or maybe omakase?

462
00:38:14,032 --> 00:38:15,742
It's a fusion restaurant.

463
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,411
French is the base.

464
00:38:17,494 --> 00:38:19,079
That's perfect.

465
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:20,747
The thing is,

466
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:24,543
Ji-won and I have
an engagement family dinner soon.

467
00:38:26,378 --> 00:38:30,549
It'll be meaningful to have it there.
We were just talking about it.

468
00:38:32,134 --> 00:38:34,469
If you're a friend from school,

469
00:38:34,553 --> 00:38:39,224
is there a close friend discount
or an alumni discount?

470
00:38:39,307 --> 00:38:41,226
That'd be so nice.

471
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:44,187
I'll call you back.
I look forward to it! Bye.

472
00:38:44,813 --> 00:38:47,607
- What are you doing?
- Are you two close?

473
00:38:53,822 --> 00:38:56,074
What is it? What did he say?

474
00:38:56,742 --> 00:38:57,993
Was it her boyfriend?

475
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:02,831
What's wrong? Why? Is she busy?

476
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:06,877
I didn't get to speak with Ji-won.

477
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:08,795
I'll ask later.

478
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,297
What did you do?

479
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,299
From Ji-won's standpoint,

480
00:39:12,382 --> 00:39:15,218
- she may not want an apology.
- You're right.

481
00:39:15,302 --> 00:39:18,055
Either way! We should do something.

482
00:39:18,597 --> 00:39:21,683
A decent person should make up
for their wrongs.

483
00:39:23,101 --> 00:39:25,103
I, Ha Ye-ji, was fooled

484
00:39:25,187 --> 00:39:29,066
by Jeong Su-min,
and it was the worst mistake of my life.

485
00:39:34,237 --> 00:39:36,990
<i>The date of the dinner
will be early December.</i>

486
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,408
<i>I'm counting on you.</i>

487
00:39:39,785 --> 00:39:44,915
I think she's getting married soon,
so gift her a lot of congratulatory money.

488
00:39:45,832 --> 00:39:46,958
Getting married?

489
00:39:51,421 --> 00:39:52,422
KANG JI-WON

490
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:55,967
Hey.

491
00:39:57,219 --> 00:39:58,762
Eun-ho, I'm sorry.

492
00:39:58,845 --> 00:40:00,722
<i>It's fine. Well...</i>

493
00:40:01,765 --> 00:40:04,935
Congratulations on your wedding.

494
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:08,647
No, don't worry about what he said.

495
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,023
I'll take care of it.

496
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,484
I'll do it for you.

497
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,529
Eun-ho...

498
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:18,865
You were my first love.

499
00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:21,118
Let me do it.

500
00:40:22,661 --> 00:40:24,746
<i>They're going to be your family.</i>

501
00:40:25,455 --> 00:40:27,999
I'll treat you to something special.

502
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:50,147
Your one and only grandfather
was admitted, and you came so late.

503
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:53,358
If I was more impatient,
I would've died waiting.

504
00:40:53,441 --> 00:40:55,360
You live to see ten more years.

505
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:57,237
What?

506
00:40:57,737 --> 00:40:59,406
I just came back from Japan.

507
00:41:00,532 --> 00:41:01,867
Did it go well?

508
00:41:04,035 --> 00:41:06,288
It's Yu-ra. We just met briefly.

509
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,293
There's no one like her.

510
00:41:13,378 --> 00:41:16,840
She's a hundred times better
than that Kang Ji-won.

511
00:41:18,383 --> 00:41:21,511
Grandfather, just leave her alone.

512
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,264
She has nothing to do with me.

513
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:26,391
I can't just leave her alone.

514
00:41:26,474 --> 00:41:27,976
They're my feelings.

515
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:29,853
You foolish boy.

516
00:41:29,936 --> 00:41:32,314
You're in love with someone who's taken.

517
00:41:32,397 --> 00:41:34,983
You broke the promise between families.

518
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:38,486
You used the villa and yacht,
and lit fireworks.

519
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,239
I heard you even had the staff fly drones!

520
00:41:42,073 --> 00:41:44,534
How is that just your feelings?

521
00:41:48,914 --> 00:41:52,918
Do you hear about everything I do?

522
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:54,419
Of course.

523
00:41:54,502 --> 00:41:57,672
You're not free.
Since your dad's no longer with us.

524
00:42:02,886 --> 00:42:03,887
You...

525
00:42:04,971 --> 00:42:09,726
are the one who will lead and take care of

526
00:42:10,727 --> 00:42:14,898
over 600,000 employees at U&K
for the next 30 or 40 years.

527
00:42:15,565 --> 00:42:18,068
You poor boy. Such a fool.

528
00:42:18,652 --> 00:42:20,862
Just a fool in love.

529
00:42:22,864 --> 00:42:24,282
Goodness.

530
00:42:31,831 --> 00:42:32,666
What?

531
00:42:44,761 --> 00:42:47,722
<i>There were a lot
of things I missed out on.</i>

532
00:42:53,853 --> 00:42:54,980
What is it?

533
00:43:04,781 --> 00:43:05,907
<i>Grandfather...</i>

534
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,451
<i>must've cried a lot.</i>

535
00:43:19,546 --> 00:43:23,591
I'll do better. Don't worry.

536
00:43:34,728 --> 00:43:35,937
I'm sorry.

537
00:44:11,264 --> 00:44:12,349
It's so cold.

538
00:44:12,432 --> 00:44:13,683
What brings you here?

539
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:18,980
We have a company warehouse near here.

540
00:44:19,064 --> 00:44:20,565
I stopped by on my way...

541
00:44:25,153 --> 00:44:26,696
Actually, that's a lie.

542
00:44:28,656 --> 00:44:30,450
I came because I missed you.

543
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:40,168
Did something happen?

544
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:49,052
Do you remember asking me
what I wanted to be?

545
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:53,765
I never thought about it before.

546
00:44:56,434 --> 00:44:59,020
My life was decided since birth.

547
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:04,609
So I studied and worked only for U&K.

548
00:45:11,616 --> 00:45:13,076
I want to be solid land.

549
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,792
But you want to be something now.

550
00:45:25,505 --> 00:45:26,548
I don't.

551
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,261
I could never be that.

552
00:45:36,558 --> 00:45:39,060
Then let's start with something simple.

553
00:45:39,144 --> 00:45:41,187
What you want to do right now.

554
00:45:46,192 --> 00:45:50,029
When I first came back,
I just didn't know what to do.

555
00:45:50,655 --> 00:45:53,366
"Where do I run to?
How will I make money?"

556
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,370
And I hated
the sight of Min-hwan and Su-min.

557
00:46:01,249 --> 00:46:04,294
So I told myself
I wouldn't just take it anymore.

558
00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:07,380
Then I made food spilled all over him.

559
00:46:11,676 --> 00:46:13,011
Come on!

560
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:20,977
After that, I could see things
a little more clearly.

561
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:29,486
Getting them to marry is just the process.

562
00:46:32,697 --> 00:46:36,201
In the end, I have to be happy.

563
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,955
I have to do what I love.

564
00:46:42,123 --> 00:46:43,374
I have to meet...

565
00:46:47,378 --> 00:46:48,671
friends I like.

566
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,811
Can I...

567
00:47:07,106 --> 00:47:08,316
hold your hand?

568
00:47:50,483 --> 00:47:52,443
Get Min-hwan to marry Su-min,

569
00:47:55,071 --> 00:47:56,614
and you be happy, Ji-won.

570
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:09,586
<i>Is it your wedding?</i>

571
00:48:09,669 --> 00:48:11,921
Just wear what I pick for you.

572
00:48:12,005 --> 00:48:14,048
This is very expensive!

573
00:48:14,132 --> 00:48:16,634
It's Authentique!

574
00:48:16,718 --> 00:48:18,636
Who cares if it's expensive?

575
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,389
The color sucks,
and the shape looks weird.

576
00:48:21,472 --> 00:48:25,018
Your undiscerning eyes...
Should I just claw them out?

577
00:48:25,101 --> 00:48:28,438
Why argue so early?
Are you going early and wait?

578
00:48:28,521 --> 00:48:31,107
Are you insane? I'm going 30 minute late.

579
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:34,152
She must wait
if she wants my precious boy.

580
00:48:34,235 --> 00:48:38,323
It pisses me off that a good-for-nothing
brat's stealing you away.

581
00:48:38,906 --> 00:48:39,741
Mom.

582
00:48:40,575 --> 00:48:42,827
You're getting me a house, right?

583
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:45,496
Are you looking? What's the budget like?

584
00:48:45,997 --> 00:48:47,165
What the hell?

585
00:48:48,082 --> 00:48:51,586
Put this on! This is classy and nice!

586
00:48:51,669 --> 00:48:53,087
I don't want to...

587
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:54,172
Not the red!

588
00:48:54,255 --> 00:48:56,549
<i>I'm in front of your house. Come out.</i>

589
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,678
HAEYEONG VILLA

590
00:49:05,683 --> 00:49:07,018
Damn it.

591
00:49:09,103 --> 00:49:11,356
What the hell? Why are you here?

592
00:49:11,856 --> 00:49:13,608
Isn't the family meeting today?

593
00:49:13,691 --> 00:49:15,318
What? Well...

594
00:49:16,611 --> 00:49:17,695
Don't be scared.

595
00:49:22,408 --> 00:49:24,243
I know you're mine.

596
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,470
What on earth are you doing?

597
00:49:43,054 --> 00:49:45,807
What? I'm just checking
how my man's doing.

598
00:49:50,728 --> 00:49:52,480
I have about ten minutes.

599
00:49:52,563 --> 00:49:54,440
I won't finish in ten minutes.

600
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:55,942
What?

601
00:49:57,402 --> 00:49:58,778
You'll be late.

602
00:49:58,861 --> 00:50:01,531
Go and introduce Ji-won to your parents.

603
00:50:13,626 --> 00:50:16,254
Chef, I'll do it.

604
00:50:18,381 --> 00:50:20,049
Do you not trust me?

605
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:21,134
No.

606
00:50:24,178 --> 00:50:25,638
It's important to me.

607
00:50:43,614 --> 00:50:44,991
I'll be right back.

608
00:50:45,074 --> 00:50:46,117
Okay.

609
00:50:50,163 --> 00:50:52,582
Why does he look so sad?

610
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:56,002
Why is no one here yet?

611
00:50:59,046 --> 00:51:01,174
Hello! I'm sorry I'm late.

612
00:51:01,257 --> 00:51:02,425
The traffic...

613
00:51:04,802 --> 00:51:07,305
- No one's here?
- No, no one yet.

614
00:51:07,889 --> 00:51:08,806
What?

615
00:51:14,228 --> 00:51:15,396
Where are you?

616
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,064
How could you be late?

617
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:21,360
My parents are both here!
But you're not here!

618
00:51:21,861 --> 00:51:23,696
Today is important!

619
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,156
<i>I'm at the door.</i>

620
00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:26,949
What took you so long?

621
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:28,159
Mom!

622
00:51:28,242 --> 00:51:29,327
Hurry up.

623
00:51:30,828 --> 00:51:32,538
She's not here yet?

624
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,874
She is. She went to the bathroom.

625
00:52:00,316 --> 00:52:03,152
I thought I was late.
But I guess I'm on time.

626
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,781
Mother, Father. It's nice to meet you.

627
00:52:13,496 --> 00:52:15,957
Wait. Aren't you...

628
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,708
You are!

629
00:52:17,792 --> 00:52:19,210
I'm happy with now.

630
00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:22,129
What's your problem?

631
00:52:22,213 --> 00:52:27,426
It's obvious what kind of family
she'll marry into.

632
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:30,888
Oh, my. So you're Min-hwan's mother.

633
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:36,483
Thank you.

634
00:52:38,694 --> 00:52:41,321
I heard your parents passed away early.

635
00:52:42,322 --> 00:52:45,617
You must've lacked home discipline.

636
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:50,497
No, my father passed away when I was 23.

637
00:52:51,164 --> 00:52:52,833
I received enough.

638
00:52:55,168 --> 00:52:59,923
Of course, since my mom left home
when I was 14,

639
00:53:00,007 --> 00:53:01,925
I didn't get her influence.

640
00:53:02,009 --> 00:53:05,012
A good thing, though.
She was having an affair.

641
00:53:07,055 --> 00:53:08,599
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

642
00:53:21,361 --> 00:53:25,449
I was curious as to
who Min-hwan would bring.

643
00:53:26,408 --> 00:53:29,328
And he brought quite the woman.

644
00:53:30,662 --> 00:53:33,040
Mom, Ji-won's a great girl.

645
00:53:33,123 --> 00:53:34,249
She's really nice.

646
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:37,920
She won't make you work at all! I'm sure.

647
00:53:40,339 --> 00:53:43,592
What's with the eagle wings?
What about the clothes I bought?

648
00:53:44,092 --> 00:53:46,470
You bought her clothes?

649
00:53:47,387 --> 00:53:50,307
Well, no. Not these. No.

650
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:53,352
I'll wear those clothes
on a more special day.

651
00:53:53,894 --> 00:53:57,147
But I brought the bag.

652
00:54:02,402 --> 00:54:06,615
Mother, thank you for raising him so well.

653
00:54:06,698 --> 00:54:09,368
To celebrate joining his family,
he bought me

654
00:54:09,451 --> 00:54:12,996
everything from shoes to clothes.
He's so sweet.

655
00:54:15,332 --> 00:54:18,627
He only ever bought me red long johns
with his first paycheck.

656
00:54:19,419 --> 00:54:21,088
Seriously?

657
00:54:21,171 --> 00:54:22,839
That's not right.

658
00:54:27,803 --> 00:54:29,763
CAT CARE TRUST AGREEMENT

659
00:54:32,015 --> 00:54:35,560
TRUSTOR: YU JI-HYUK

660
00:54:41,692 --> 00:54:43,777
No matter what happens to you,

661
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,613
your cat will receive proper care here.

662
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,616
Thank you.

663
00:54:50,325 --> 00:54:52,869
Are you going somewhere? Why the papers?

664
00:54:54,329 --> 00:54:56,748
Who knows what will happen to me?

665
00:54:59,668 --> 00:55:01,294
You don't even like cats.

666
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,589
I like him.

667
00:55:06,717 --> 00:55:08,510
I have one more favor to ask.

668
00:55:30,407 --> 00:55:31,950
I wonder if she's doing well.

669
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:38,957
Good boy.

670
00:55:43,837 --> 00:55:45,005
I'll protect you.

671
00:55:50,469 --> 00:55:55,265
I'll just say this
because I'm an honest person.

672
00:55:56,266 --> 00:55:57,559
I love you, Mom.

673
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:02,439
I do not like you.

674
00:56:03,023 --> 00:56:05,233
I never thought of accepting

675
00:56:05,317 --> 00:56:07,402
a woman like you into our family.

676
00:56:08,945 --> 00:56:11,323
You didn't learn much with no parents.

677
00:56:12,157 --> 00:56:16,119
But it's okay as long
as you're willing to learn from now on.

678
00:56:16,912 --> 00:56:19,790
You're willing to, right?

679
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:22,918
Yes, of course.

680
00:56:24,002 --> 00:56:25,378
Okay.

681
00:56:26,505 --> 00:56:29,341
I'm not that uptight.

682
00:56:29,424 --> 00:56:31,009
Sexism is wrong.

683
00:56:31,093 --> 00:56:33,011
You're both equally precious.

684
00:56:34,346 --> 00:56:37,808
However, that's only in society.

685
00:56:37,891 --> 00:56:39,142
Not at home.

686
00:56:40,185 --> 00:56:41,478
Right.

687
00:56:42,521 --> 00:56:45,190
The family life depends
on how the woman does.

688
00:56:45,273 --> 00:56:48,693
Feed your man and keep your house clean.

689
00:56:48,777 --> 00:56:50,570
Raise your child well.

690
00:56:50,654 --> 00:56:53,156
Yes, Mother. I can do it!

691
00:56:55,283 --> 00:56:59,371
Men lose energy
if they frequent the kitchen.

692
00:56:59,454 --> 00:57:01,957
No matter how much they gripe and say no,

693
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:05,961
this is a known fact all around the world.

694
00:57:06,503 --> 00:57:08,547
That's why I'm learning to cook

695
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,298
- so I can cook for him.
- Yes.

696
00:57:10,382 --> 00:57:13,260
You must feed him breakfast.

697
00:57:13,343 --> 00:57:16,513
Nothing ridiculous like bread or cereal.

698
00:57:16,596 --> 00:57:18,557
Cook him soup or stew with rice.

699
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,226
Yes, I understand.

700
00:57:22,144 --> 00:57:25,689
And as for kids, how about three or four?

701
00:57:25,772 --> 00:57:27,774
Have as many as you can.

702
00:57:29,067 --> 00:57:30,402
That sounds good.

703
00:57:30,485 --> 00:57:33,321
I didn't have siblings growing up.
I was lonely.

704
00:57:33,405 --> 00:57:35,532
I like that.

705
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,452
I'll call you when I have time.

706
00:57:39,536 --> 00:57:40,912
Let's go see a doctor.

707
00:57:41,621 --> 00:57:45,542
There are so many uteruses in bad shape
these days.

708
00:57:46,459 --> 00:57:49,754
I'll take a look
and see what the doctor says.

709
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:54,843
As long as you took care of yourself,
there's no reason to say no.

710
00:57:55,927 --> 00:57:57,762
Let's do a health checkup too.

711
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:03,435
I haven't been able to see my ancestors,

712
00:58:03,518 --> 00:58:05,020
and it's bothered me.

713
00:58:06,021 --> 00:58:08,481
Since we have a new family member,

714
00:58:08,565 --> 00:58:10,650
let's revive ancestral rites.

715
00:58:11,318 --> 00:58:12,569
Revive?

716
00:58:13,236 --> 00:58:14,821
Red, right. White, left.

717
00:58:15,947 --> 00:58:18,408
I'll teach you, so don't worry.

718
00:58:19,242 --> 00:58:22,078
Just keep this in mind.

719
00:58:22,162 --> 00:58:24,789
Treat your elders with care.

720
00:58:24,873 --> 00:58:27,000
Be obedient to your husband.

721
00:58:27,083 --> 00:58:29,085
Raise children properly.

722
00:58:30,629 --> 00:58:34,132
And keeping your career after marriage,

723
00:58:34,216 --> 00:58:35,759
I approve of it.

724
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,973
Why would I work, Mother?

725
00:58:46,436 --> 00:58:48,396
Are you going to quit?

726
00:58:50,565 --> 00:58:53,902
I don't want to,
but considering what you're mother said,

727
00:58:53,985 --> 00:58:55,153
I'd be greedy.

728
00:58:56,071 --> 00:58:57,113
No, no!

729
00:58:57,197 --> 00:58:59,699
Do you know how expensive kids are?

730
00:58:59,783 --> 00:59:01,743
How could you just play at home?

731
00:59:02,661 --> 00:59:04,371
Play?

732
00:59:04,454 --> 00:59:06,289
To treat you with care,

733
00:59:06,373 --> 00:59:07,415
serve Min-hwan,

734
00:59:07,499 --> 00:59:09,793
and raise my children properly,

735
00:59:11,836 --> 00:59:14,422
I won't have enough time in a day.

736
00:59:15,757 --> 00:59:19,135
Also, it's not red on the right,
white on the left.

737
00:59:19,219 --> 00:59:22,138
It's red on the east, white on the west.

738
00:59:23,932 --> 00:59:25,767
- What?
- You said it was left.

739
00:59:26,726 --> 00:59:28,186
Same difference.

740
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:31,690
I did an ancestral rite for my father
every year on my own.

741
00:59:31,773 --> 00:59:33,566
I have no objections either.

742
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:37,028
This is why home discipline is important.

743
00:59:37,112 --> 00:59:39,864
That's not the case with customs.

744
00:59:39,948 --> 00:59:42,617
Daughters aren't supposed to do that.

745
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:49,791
Your father probably thinks it's his fault
to have a daughter and understands.

746
00:59:49,874 --> 00:59:52,294
This is why everyone wants a son.

747
00:59:52,377 --> 00:59:54,921
There's a reason for that.

748
00:59:55,005 --> 00:59:56,965
But I don't understand, lady.

749
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:03,013
"Lady"?

750
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:06,599
Are you a judge?

751
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:09,853
Why do you judge my dad like that?

752
01:00:09,936 --> 01:00:11,855
Kang Ji-won, are you crazy?

753
01:00:11,938 --> 01:00:13,315
How dare you?

754
01:00:13,398 --> 01:00:15,191
Wait. Don't say anything.

755
01:00:16,568 --> 01:00:17,610
"Lady"?

756
01:00:18,194 --> 01:00:20,572
Hey, are you done?

757
01:00:24,451 --> 01:00:25,869
This wedding's off.

758
01:00:27,662 --> 01:00:28,830
That makes us strangers.

759
01:00:30,623 --> 01:00:33,209
Lady, wake up.

760
01:00:33,293 --> 01:00:35,920
Your son isn't that great.

761
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:38,256
Even if he was,

762
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,718
you should know someone else's child
is just as precious!

763
01:00:44,971 --> 01:00:46,639
Listen carefully.

764
01:00:46,723 --> 01:00:48,641
It's not you.

765
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:51,436
It's me that's calling this wedding off.

766
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:52,562
Got it?

767
01:00:54,189 --> 01:00:56,649
Ji-won, are you crazy? Hey...

768
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,072
Wait here. Hey, Ji-won!

769
01:01:02,155 --> 01:01:03,281
Kang Ji-won!

770
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:12,290
Kang Ji-won!

771
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:15,627
Hey!

772
01:01:21,341 --> 01:01:22,467
What are you doing?

773
01:01:23,802 --> 01:01:26,346
What do you think?
I'm breaking up with you.

774
01:01:28,848 --> 01:01:31,518
What? Breaking up?

775
01:01:33,186 --> 01:01:34,437
Are you kidding me?

776
01:01:38,274 --> 01:01:41,694
I never want to see you again.

777
01:01:49,452 --> 01:01:50,703
You little...

778
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:56,000
It's not easy for a woman
to throw a man who's bigger.

779
01:01:57,127 --> 01:01:59,129
So when he's off guard,

780
01:02:02,173 --> 01:02:03,341
do it in one move.

781
01:02:21,109 --> 01:02:22,152
Min-hwan!

782
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:24,821
What the hell?

783

784
01:02:54,142 --> 01:02:56,311
Kang Ji-won!

785
01:02:56,394 --> 01:02:58,771
<i>How dare you shout? You cheater!</i>

786
01:02:58,855 --> 01:03:01,399
What else do you have
besides being pretty?

787
01:03:01,483 --> 01:03:03,401
<i>How could you do that to Su-min?</i>

788
01:03:03,485 --> 01:03:06,029
My life is over!

789
01:03:06,946 --> 01:03:08,156
I have a fiancé!

790
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:11,159
<i>You said nothing was going on with her.</i>

791
01:03:11,701 --> 01:03:15,121
<i>Will I be able to live like this
if they get married?</i>

792
01:03:15,705 --> 01:03:17,665
<i>How could you do this?</i>

793
01:03:18,416 --> 01:03:19,876
Jeong Su-min, stop!

794
01:03:19,959 --> 01:03:21,711
<i>I won't let it go this time.</i>

795
01:03:21,794 --> 01:03:23,880
You fix what you did.
