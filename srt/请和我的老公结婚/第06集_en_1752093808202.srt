1
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,300
Thank you for sending me back

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,760
Ji Won

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,010
Are you feeling unwell?

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,680
Actually, my stomach has been feeling uncomfortable since just now.

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,190
Stomach…

6
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,290
minister

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,750
minister

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,000
minister

9
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,590
minister!

10
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,780
Please come in. Where are you going?

11
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,290
Sir, did you see a man sitting there?

12
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,370
- Go over there, please.
-What? In front of there?

13
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,590
Minhwan

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
Are you hurt?

15
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,100
Oh my god

16
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,890
Did you fight with anyone?

17
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,150
(Regional Emergency Center)

18
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
minister

19
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,810
You fainted, I took you to the hospital

20
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,100
Are you awake? The test results are out.

21
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,737
Liu Zhihe, 30 years old, type A, right?

22
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,863
right

23
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,865
You've been overworked and sleep deprived lately

24
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,034
Somewhat

25
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,700
Irregular diet

26
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,450
Probably drank a lot of wine

27
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,750
Do you have anything stressful?

28
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:54,010
You pushed too hard and your brain decided to shut down.

29
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,800
There seems to be something wrong with your autonomic nervous system.
More testing is needed

30
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,720
How is your digestion?

31
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,140
You should feel sick to your stomach.

32
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,480
By the way, Jiwon, do you have a stomachache?

33
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,480
Me?

34
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,650
She has a very bad stomach, please help her get checked

35
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,820
What?

36
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,690
Are there any family members? Do you have any medical history?

37
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,610
No, I just have gastritis, no need for examination

38
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,620
No, you looked really bad just now.

39
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,240
Because you are in a state of shock
Maybe it's okay

40
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,210
Please check her out.

41
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,540
No, I had a CT scan not long ago.

42
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,830
It's just gastritis

43
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,130
Did you have a CT scan?

44
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,550
Why?

45
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,260
Just by the way

46
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,060
Just by the way? Just a CT scan?

47
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,650
But how do you know I have a bad stomach?

48
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,150
That’s because…

49
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,150
You often take medicine at work.

50
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,450
Then should we be fair?
Did you two get checked?

51
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,720
Minhwan

52
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,790
Can't

53
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,290
I can't hurt Ji Won

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,330
I might as well just die...

55
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,260
I can…

56
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,010
leave

57
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,550
Oh, that...

58
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,850
I can't let you get it so easily.

59
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,190
Don't cry, silly.

60
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,150
what to do?

61
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,870
Ji Won…

62
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,040
What should I do?

63
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,470
-Keep the change, please
-Oh, okay, walk slowly

64
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,640
-Thanks
-You're welcome

65
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,060
Is he getting off here?

66
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,530
Then please walk slowly and carefully

67
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,320
I'll take you back. My car is over there.

68
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,030
oh…

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,460
I am a good person

70
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,510
He is a good person

71
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,350
But I can trust someone again

72
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,230
Start over?

73
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,020
I have a boyfriend

74
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,440
And he is your subordinate.

75
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,820
Because of what happened today, I am in a difficult situation.

76
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,160
He will definitely care a lot, so...

77
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,370
Then he should pay more attention.

78
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,080
Let him treat you every moment

79
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,050
Be more careful and cautious

80
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,260
Do you want to take a taxi back?

81
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,480
I like you

82
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,070
But if you don't like it, I won't do anything.

83
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,700
It won't make things difficult for you.

84
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,750
You just need to say one word.

85
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,630
Say you don't like

86
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,800
I…

87
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,010
But not now

88
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,220
Please consider this first.

89
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,270
If you say you don't like it, I won't do anything.
So until then…

90
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,810
I hope Park Min-hwan can be a little...

91
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,320
No, I hope he'll pay more attention.

92
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,400
And you

93
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,780
I hope you can think about it slowly.

94
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,790
I can guarantee
You'd be a good choice to be with me

95
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,920
Although it is difficult to prove

96
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,630
But I'm really a good person.

97
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,560
I won't take the bus, so you don't have to feel burdened. Just get in the car.

98
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,550
Oh my god, I didn't sleep at all.

99
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,550
Good morning, I'm on my way to the restaurant.
I'll bring you coffee.

100
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,730
Are you coming out to wait for me?

101
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,770
Now is the time for traffic jam
You came all the way here to bring me coffee?

102
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Yeah, yeah

103
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,030
-Thank you
-Won't

104
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,360
I just happened to come here for something.

105
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,340
Be careful, the minister is in a bad mood today.

106
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,760
Be careful not to be spotted by him.

107
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,600
He looks the same as usual.

108
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,810
No, he was in a bad mood and in a bad condition.

109
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,570
How do you know?

110
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,150
Because they are siblings

111
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,780
But they really don't look alike at all

112
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,530
No matter how you look at it, it doesn't look like

113
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,710
You look worse.
Are you not doing well?

114
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,050
Hello everyone, good morning

115
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,930
Ji-won, did you sleep well?

116
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,430
Um

117
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,730
Hey, morning...

118
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,620
How? What?

119
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,220
She obviously wants to see my face
Why are you still being so arrogant over there?

120
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,600
So women should be taught a lesson every three days.

121
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,520
No smoking here

122
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,440
Oh, yes, Minister.

123
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,690
That's not right.

124
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,360
What happened yesterday?

125
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,320
U&K's company regulations
There are still rules against office romances

126
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,700
No love allowed?

127
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,040
What era is it now? This is too outdated.

128
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,670
Because it is outdated, it has not been executed for a long time.

129
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,420
Therefore, many people are not aware of this rule.
But it still exists

130
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,090
-No
-It exists because

131
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,050
Office romance can affect work

132
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,640
Just like what you did today

133
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:55,440
No matter whether that rule exists or not,
Let’s talk common sense.

134
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,610
What happened yesterday?
Are you stalking my girlfriend?

135
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,940
Or are you mutual?

136
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,280
Just behind that alley

137
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,740
There is a building that our company uses as a logistics warehouse

138
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:11,790
What?

139
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,620
(U&K Logistics Warehouse)

140
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,670
Yes, there is.

141
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,790
I'm on my way to the warehouse
Seeing that the safety of my subordinates is seriously threatened

142
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,550
Even though she is your subordinate

143
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,430
But she's also my girlfriend
This should belong to our private life, right?

144
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,340
Because it affects work.

145
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,640
Just like the way you behaved when you arrived at the company today

146
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,020
It doesn't mean you will grow up when you get older.

147
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,690
You won't necessarily become a man.

148
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,530
Date children instead of men
Women will become unhappy

149
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,110
So for Kang Ji-won's sake
It would be better if you break up.

150
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,580
separate?

151
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,330
Minister, aren't you crossing the line?

152
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,210
Then just assume that I like Kang Ji-won

153
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Like her?

154
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,420
You are...

155
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,590
No matter what

156
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,550
Don't do that to her again.

157
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,230
Minister, that's because you don't understand...

158
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,310
-What time is it now?
-What?

159
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,480
What are you doing

160
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,150
11:30

161
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,900
What are you doing?

162
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,780
You didn't hit her, did you?

163
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,580
Hmm? What?

164
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,580
You didn't hit her, did you?

165
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,670
Well, no

166
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,920
Could you please stop hitting her?

167
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,880
Can!

168
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,090
Can I be mature enough to not care about what happened yesterday?

169
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,060
Can!

170
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,570
What is going on?

171
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,820
What's that guy like?

172
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,700
hateful

173
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,790
-Minhwan
-Oh my god

174
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,790
How come you walk without making any sound?

175
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:26,750
You are really becoming more and more unsatisfactory.

176
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,510
Were you angry yesterday?

177
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,470
I thought about it, we...

178
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,680
If we break up now
What will happen to him and Jung Soo Min?

179
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,850
Feeling like something is going on

180
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,560
Was it painful yesterday?

181
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,730
I'm sorry I hit you.

182
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,150
But you know you're also wrong, right?

183
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,490
If you weren't so exaggerated
Why would that guy interfere?

184
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,490
I'm not the kind of rubbish that hits women.

185
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,330
Using violence is a crime

186
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,370
You treat your boyfriend like a criminal.

187
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,840
You're so stupid that you're driving me crazy

188
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,630
Before, it was because you put up with my temper.
That's why I kept enduring

189
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,010
From now on, I have to discipline you.

190
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,770
Let's go

191
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,900
He doesn't care too easily.

192
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,440
Will we not break up even if this happens?

193
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,400
Or has something changed?

194
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,780
No matter how hard I try, I can't imagine what Liu Zhihe has.

195
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,410
He said he was on his way to the logistics warehouse yesterday
See Us

196
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,790
I haven't done anything right.

197
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,620
Why don’t you come over here quickly?

198
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,750
oh

199
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,250
-Did you go straight home yesterday?
-What?

200
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,050
I'm going in.

201
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,140
Oh, yeah, of course.

202
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,600
I'm going home too.

203
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,640
Your home is here.

204
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,900
This area is beautiful, very nice.

205
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,690
I feel good with you.

206
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,360
What?

207
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,160
But…

208
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,160
It's complicated between us, isn't it?

209
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,460
Yeah, yeah

210
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,350
Just today, I'm going to be honest with myself

211
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,610
Thank you for sending me back. Be careful.

212
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,700
Of course, where else could I go?

213
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,210
There must be something, otherwise he wouldn't just let it go.

214
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,090
It's hard to find someone like her.
Such a suitable woman to marry.

215
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,180
It was Liu Zhihe who was jealous of her.

216
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,300
She only has eyes for me

217
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,760
- I have to be on my guard.
- You have to be on your toes.

218
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,650
I like you

219
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,570
But if you don't like it, I won't do anything.

220
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,370
It won't make things difficult for you.

221
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,550
Kang Ji-won

222
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,800
Come to lunch with me

223
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,470
Agent Yang, do you know where this is? Come over here too.

224
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,150
Things turned out like this

225
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,440
I won't have lunch with you today.

226
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,070
So…

227
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,240
Xiumin is all alone

228
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,410
I don't want to eat

229
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,580
I'll just drink coffee in the lounge.

230
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,710
Oh, well...

231
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,670
Something is really unfolding.

232
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,970
All right

233
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,430
This won't work.

234
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,720
It's obvious if you skip a meal
You were already very thin.

235
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,430
Don't do this, Min-hwan
Why don't you take Xiumin out to eat something delicious?

236
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,360
-Delicious?
- I want to ask you

237
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,650
But because of the section chief...

238
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,440
Oh, yes.

239
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,240
Please
I'll use my credit card to express my feelings

240
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,570
-Is it really possible?
- Let's eat at a place with a good atmosphere

241
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,160
good

242
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,290
steak?

243
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,550
Sorry, I have too much to do.

244
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,050
Have you been waiting long?

245
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,350
Do you know Executive Director Wang Xingren?
The marketing executive

246
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,900
Do I have to see it before I can decide?

247
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,860
He is my father-in-law's distant cousin.

248
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,690
So I have a lot of things to help him.

249
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:48,280
You don't know anything.
How easy it is to wait for your paycheck

250
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,380
I don't know what's so good about soy sauce

251
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,210
Sashimi is supposed to be served with vinegar sauce, right?

252
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,470
Why don't you eat?

253
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,940
You really don't know how to eat

254
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,070
Sushi should not be eaten with chopsticks

255
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,320
But even if you don’t know how to eat, you still have the blessing of a noble person.
Where can I find a boss like me?

256
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:33,120
Just give me an idea.
I will send you Agent Yang who is very capable.

257
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,580
And beautiful staff

258
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,370
Not only that, I also found a general manager for you.

259
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,550
Even if the plan is not very rigorous
We still have to find a way to do it.

260
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,170
I will try my best

261
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,720
Alas, that's not the problem.

262
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,510
This is not an agent level job. Just work hard.

263
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,100
I don't mean to interfere with your work.

264
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,940
But I will lend you my name

265
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,150
It's all about making things work.
Otherwise why would I do this?

266
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:08,200
So I do everything.
And you want to sit back and reap the benefits?

267
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:13,030
Now that I think about it, that's too unrealistic.

268
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,700
This can't be done.

269
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,580
Where can I find a real gourmet restaurant?
Starting to make instant meal kits?

270
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,580
Let's replace the original packaging and materials

271
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,920
What is that called?

272
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,340
Yes, borrow the name of a famous chef to build a brand

273
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,840
Then use our company's distribution channels.

274
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,220
If you push it well
It should be available this summer

275
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,930
No…

276
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,390
Three-minute meatballs, just pack well

277
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,310
Add the name of a famous chef and it becomes a high-end steak.

278
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,560
You can't do that.

279
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:44,610
What?

280
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,570
The focus of this project is
It is convenient to make delicious food at home

281
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,110
What kind of logic is that?

282
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,870
That is your personal focus!
My main goal is to become the Deputy Minister

283
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,790
Let Yang Zhulan be the section chief

284
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,420
That way you will have a future

285
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,750
People of your rank, just do as you're told.

286
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,840
You can't do this.

287
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,430
You are stubborn, you don't know how to do things, you are so stupid

288
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,220
But

289
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,930
- This project
-never mind

290
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,560
You exit

291
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,270
Section Chief

292
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,190
Chief, this is my project proposal.

293
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,400
You are so funny

294
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,820
How come this project is yours?

295
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,650
Strictly speaking, this is the company's

296
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,860
I approve the development

297
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,700
Agent Yang also helped

298
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,410
So what should we do with the idea proposed by Agent Yang?

299
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:43,500
Kang Ji-won, we did this together
Why do you take it upon yourself?

300
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,000
Don't you want to stay in the company for a long time?

301
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,960
From today on, you quit

302
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,920
Handed over to Yang Zhulan and Zheng Xiumin

303
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,660
Isn't this a very classy place?

304
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,950
This is not enough to entertain you.

305
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,200
Really?

306
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,660
I'm so happy

307
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,790
Isn't there that lunch?

308
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,170
Just the one I usually eat.

309
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,050
Which kind of wine do you want?

310
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,340
Don't drink what I stored here.

311
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,970
Any good wines today?

312
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,020
I recommend the best wine to go with today's set menu

313
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,810
Henri Briant, 2008

314
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:47,150
French oak aging method
The flavor is deeper...

315
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,690
He is indeed a good man.

316
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:54,030
He has style, knows a lot, and is an employee of a large company.

317
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,780
He is one of the people that Kang Ji-won has dated.
The best one

318
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,960
Pretty little things
You're totally obsessed with me now, right?

319
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,420
The characteristic is that you can feel its flavor

320
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,590
What kind of wine would you like?

321
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,810
- The last one has flavor
-Okay, I'll prepare it for you right away.

322
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,230
Did you sleep well yesterday?

323
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,570
I couldn't sleep all night.

324
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,790
And you?

325
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,080
How could I possibly sleep well?

326
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,610
Flavor

327
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,700
Section Chief

328
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,950
Do you really want to remove Agent Jiang?

329
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,710
What? Can't we do without her?

330
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,170
It's not a good idea to remove the proposer.

331
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,090
She is right.

332
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,340
In my humble opinion

333
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,890
I also think it’s not a good idea to just change the packaging.

334
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,050
-Who said we were going to do this?
-What?

335
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:48,930
Although we want to simplify the process, we can't do that.

336
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,520
That will be a real quick-cooking meal package.

337
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,070
Please list a few good restaurants.
The kind that everyone knows at a glance

338
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,320
But just now...

339
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,700
Wang Xingren will promote this plan

340
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,870
But too many people participated

341
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,330
The name of the executive should also be listed above

342
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,330
Did you do that on purpose?

343
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,590
Yes, intentional

344
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:21,840
The food is pretty much the same anyway
Find a business person who knows how to do business

345
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,010
Good-looking and photogenic ones are better.

346
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,400
Wake up, or I'll take you away?

347
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,360
Frankly speaking, if it weren't for me

348
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,200
The person who became the section chief by this project proposal
Will it be you or Kang Ji-won?

349
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,340
Although I decided to fight him.
But how to fight?

350
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,550
(Card amount: 340,000 won)

351
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,930
(340,000 KRW)

352
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,010
340,000 won?

353
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,020
What?

354
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,270
Is he crazy?

355
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,570
Because I didn't know how to fight with people before
That's why you live so miserably

356
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,320
If you don't understand, learn

357
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,780
I don't want to be robbed of everything by heartless people again

358
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,910
No

359
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,750
I won't be robbed of anything this time.

360
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:41,090
He didn't bypass you and report directly to me

361
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,680
Section Chief Jin is my distant relative

362
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,550
He is good at his job, but he is unlucky.

363
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,020
This time he came up with a very good idea

364
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,270
I am also writing a project for a quick-cooking meal package

365
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,690
I'm not helping him because I'm his relative.

366
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,030
I asked the development team and they said it was pretty good.

367
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,650
Let's go ahead.

368
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,070
By the way, Minister Liu

369
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,910
Your personnel performance evaluation is too stingy.

370
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:15,790
Leaders should know how to train their subordinates in a timely manner

371
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,080
If the water is too clear, the fish will not survive.

372
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,460
He has been the section chief for a long time.

373
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,720
He's old too.

374
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,220
I'll find out

375
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,850
OK, go ahead.

376
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,520
Thank you for your hard work

377
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,980
Why is he always so rigid?

378
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,570
So what if his last name is Liu?
Could he be a distant relative of the president?

379
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,870
(Liu Zhihe, Head of Marketing Group 1)

380
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,040
The project you mentioned by the Han River
how's it going?

381
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,430
(I'm working on it, thanks)

382
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,310
He's sharper than he looks.

383
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,430
I like you very much

384
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,310
But I have to rely on my own strength

385
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,740
Do you have a date tonight?

386
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,830
(I'll probably be working late)

387
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,250
There are more important things than work, please make time for it

388
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,220
I'm not looking for you, don't worry.

389
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,660
Could you tell me what it is?

390
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,740
I don't think you'd want my help.

391
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,830
I'm just doing what I can to help you.

392
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,540
- Minister, I...
-No request for anything in return

393
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,880
You make me uncomfortable

394
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,260
Why? Do you like rewards?

395
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,640
Would you like to just accept my unconditional kindness?

396
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,520
I do what I want without asking for anything in return.

397
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,060
It's not easy to find someone who can take advantage of you.

398
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,020
-But…
- If you still feel uncomfortable

399
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,360
I will order you as your boss.

400
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,060
Oh, brother, you are here?

401
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,060
Hello, big sister

402
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,650
You are still so beautiful

403
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,270
Have we met?

404
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:35,700
He will act familiar whenever he sees a beautiful woman
Hello, I'm Kim Shin-woo and he's Cho Dong-seok

405
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,030
Yes, hello

406
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,200
Hello

407
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,250
They are my juniors in the university club

408
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,160
Do you like judo?

409
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,880
Actually, I am a reserve player for the national team.

410
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,800
Taekwondo, but I'm also good at judo

411
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,090
oh

412
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,340
-What's going on?
-Come

413
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:56,260
(Kang Ji-won)

414
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,060
What's this?

415
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:02,890
Go change your clothes.

416
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,650
Change this?

417
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,200
As you just saw, it takes only one shot to knock someone down.

418
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,530
Judo is basically physics.
It is easier to understand if you think of it as a lever.

419
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,990
Catch, knock down

420
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,540
- Catch and knock down
-right

421
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,620
Do you want to try it?

422
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,000
Oh, okay

423
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,630
catch

424
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,630
- Catch it, yes
-catch

425
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,300
Trip someone's feet

426
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,760
Knock down

427
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,840
- Knock down
- Knock down

428
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,760
-Why can't I fall over?
- Knock down

429
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,440
Come on, shout louder

430
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,310
Start Over

431
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,030
again!

432
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,000
Use all your strength!

433
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,600
You did it, sister. You did it.

434
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,060
-Success
- I knocked you down

435
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,390
You succeeded. You succeeded.

436
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,940
Now that you have the basics, let’s start practicing.

437
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,240
Actual combat?

438
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,200
The first step to victory

439
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,290
Just stand on the mat and face your opponent

440
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,830
This is the way to fight

441
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,210
Catch Me

442
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,840
They usually won't let you catch them so easily.

443
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,720
but…

444
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,640
Sometimes they'll let you catch

445
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,320
Because they know you can't take them down anyway

446
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,290
I will really knock you down

447
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,960
If you hesitate to fight
Don't stand on the mat at the beginning

448
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,840
Once you're on the mat, there's only one thing to think about.

449
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,840
Knock down the opponent

450
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,760
Knock down the opponent

451
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,050
Hold him tight

452
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,970
-call out
-call out

453
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,290
The basics of Judo are pushing and pulling

454
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:15,630
When your strength is insufficient
Use the opponent's strength

455
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,460
certainly

456
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,920
I think it's okay not to fight in person

457
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,800
You can ask for help

458
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:29,810
Ask for someone like me who can help you fight.

459
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,420
I succeeded. I really succeeded.

460
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,750
I succeeded

461
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,420
I succeeded

462
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,010
You didn't expect that I would really knock you down, did you?

463
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,520
But you were a little lax just now, right?

464
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,870
Well done

465
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,860
He just asked me to treat it as a real battle, not to let her

466
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,400
-Wasn't he knocked down too easily just now?
-yes

467
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,150
He just jumped up and fell down

468
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,820
He jumps very high

469
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,550
Thank you so much today

470
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,010
Don't forget to shout

471
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,300
You are really good at fighting.

472
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,260
Like cockfighting?

473
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,020
The most righteous cockfighting in the world

474
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,650
Once you're on the mat, there's only one thing to think about.

475
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,240
Team Leader Jin, how are your performance?

476
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,290
If performance is not good, you will lose your job

477
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,000
Stand on the mat and face your opponent

478
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,680
I follow your opinion

479
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,430
Revised the plan

480
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,980
And yesterday's incident

481
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,530
terribly sorry

482
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,130
This is mine

483
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:51,130
I gave you this because you thought
No one has the ideas you have.

484
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,260
(General Convener: Wang Xingren
Proposers: Jin Jingxu, Yang Zhulan, Zheng Xiumin)

485
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,140
What? Your name isn't on it?

486
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:02,190
Isn't this a matter of course?

487
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,690
This case was originally mine.

488
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:08,570
But now I have become a regular-level person
There is no place to put your name in the case being promoted

489
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,700
Chief, could you give me a chance?

490
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,250
Is that so?

491
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,210
So…

492
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,000
Combine this with the one you are preparing.
Submit after integration

493
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:29,800
I'll decide based on your performance.

494
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,670
Do you want to put your name?

495
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,010
good

496
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,270
sorry

497
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:46,310
You helped a lot, but it's a bad situation.

498
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,480
I'm really sorry

499
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,690
So we must put the name of Zheng Xiumin
Put it on, huh?

500
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:57,990
Forget it, he's even upset about having to put your name on it.

501
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,620
Thank you for your concern

502
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:02,540
Eat it

503
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,260
how?

504
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,050
This seems to be...

505
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,890
Using goats running in New Zealand

506
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:25,020
After giving birth to my second child with my beloved husband
Basque cheesecake made with goat's milk

507
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,100
What?

508
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,600
Where did you buy this?

509
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,400
Werther?

510
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,490
This is a restaurant owned by my friend.

511
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,660
He just called

512
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,120
-Should I take it?
-good

513
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,000
Hello?

514
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,670
Did you receive the cake?

515
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,800
Well, I'm eating with my colleagues.

516
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,710
Who sent such an excellent cake?

517
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,130
This is what love is all about

518
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,550
What?

519
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,640
-It means it's delicious
-Is that so?

520
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,770
Great, that's what I did.

521
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:06,730
Did you make it yourself?

522
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,150
-You can bake too?
-Um

523
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,860
I will make desserts for important people myself

524
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:15,780
Enjoy

525
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,240
Thank you, I will enjoy it

526
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:22,780
benefactor

527
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,950
Are you in a relationship with that friend?

528
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,080
no

529
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:32,420
What are you talking about? I have a boyfriend.

530
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,210
Yes

531
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:39,590
I'm sure he likes you.

532
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,180
Without heart, you can't make such a delicious cake

533
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:49,020
Back to the point
Do you really want to do what Chief Jin said?

534
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,320
I was so stupid for losing my temper

535
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,690
He didn't intend to do that.

536
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,030
What?

537
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:05,030
He gave me the plan
I just changed a few words in my proposal.

538
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,830
God

539
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,500
So he is trying to get rid of you?

540
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:17,010
Oh my god, he's really bad.
Working with a bad heart

541
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,720
It's really unbearable to watch.

542
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,760
Did you know that Judo is all about pushing and pulling?

543
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,220
Jin Jingxu underestimated me

544
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,560
So he let me grab the corner of his judo uniform

545
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:34,150
I thought I couldn't knock him down.

546
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,730
Why are we suddenly talking about judo?

547
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:46,740
I don't want to imagine Kim Kyung-wook wearing a judo uniform

548
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:54,880
Judo is a great sport
When you shout, your mood changes

549
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,920
Yell? I know what that's like.

550
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:01,550
Although it's nothing, but shouting will make a difference

551
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:08,600
Sorry, I'm so sorry

552
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,230
-Feel sorry
-sorry

553
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,110
What about Agent Yang?

554
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,660
You should feel bad.

555
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:31,790
You didn't mean to do that, but because of the section chief...

556
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,590
Sometimes being competent is a problem, right?

557
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,170
No, it's not because I can do it.

558
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,800
I really love Ji Won

559
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,100
But there are principles to follow in work

560
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,770
Don't worry too much, you did nothing wrong

561
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,440
Ji Won is good at everything

562
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,650
Too upright, not flexible

563
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,320
But there is no way
That's how she got into a Korean university

564
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,360
Let's forgive her.

565
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:09,030
You are a really good friend.

566
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:16,420
I also want to be your good sister

567
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:23,010
I'm not as smart as Ji Won, I'm stupid

568
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,800
I just know that you'll have a good outcome this time
I will also have good results

569
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,850
I think so

570

571
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,520
You are very capable and savvy.

572
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,940

581
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,150
I grabbed the corner of Kim Kyung-wook's judo uniform

582
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,240

What? She's still doing everything?

717
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:37,040
No wonder she was talking about raising objections.

718
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,120
What? Did she call you?

719
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:42,540
Yes, she complained that her name was not included.

720
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:45,420
Kill this clueless guy immediately.

721
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,300
I'm so pissed off.

722
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,300
What was he talking on the phone about on the plane?

723
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,930
What are you doing?

724
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,270
Hey, come here.

725
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,320
- Were you laughing just now?
-What?

726
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,280
I was talking on the phone just now and you were laughing
Do you look down on me?

727
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:19,040
I'm sorry, General Manager, I will educate her again

728
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,040
I'm here to serve you

729
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,880
This should have been done long ago.

730
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,130
General Manager, please keep your seat back upright during takeoff.

731
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,050
Fasten your seatbelts…

732
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:38,560
Are you kidding?

733
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,310
You really can't do this.

734
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:42,640
Hello

735
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,400
Call someone bigger than you

736
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:51,650
I'm the business class cabin crew leader.
And it is illegal to assault flight attendants...

737
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,990
What do you mean by violence?
I just clicked on you.

738
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:58,410
General Manager, violence against flight attendants...

739
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:00,040
You really are...

740
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,750
I was just holding it like this, you came over and bumped into it

741
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:05,370
Isn’t it?

742
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,710
How dare you do this to me?

743
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:10,880
What are you looking at? Is there anything good to see?

744
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,720
He actually hit the flight attendant

745
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,510
Isn't he famous for being kind?

746
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,100
Not long ago, a commotion on a passenger plane caused controversy

Fully recycled and scrapped

764
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:31,130
You didn't tell me that Kang Ji-won who wrote the project proposal
Is it handled well?

765
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,250
Let me go

766
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:36,340

How dare you touch my body?

Why don't you let me go?

769
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:44,640
So at this time
U&K's whack-a-mole bully is still in the company?

770
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:49,400
All of them should be in the name of Wang Xingren, the executive

771
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,480
You'll all be fired!

772
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:24,510
Oh my god, that scared me.

773
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,890
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

774
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,360
No, it's okay.

775
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:36,940

778
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,170
You've worked hard

779
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:03,430
Then I'll take my leave.

780
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,100
Wait, Minister.

781
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:23,280
BTS oh I like them too

782
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:27,870
In fact, according to my current mood
I want to listen to Dynamite

783
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:29,540
But I can't find it no matter how hard I try

784
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,290
Dynamite is great
Although I personally like "Spring Day"

785
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:35,250
I also like Spring Day

786
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:47,300
That is...

But let's try it this time. You can go

790
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:57,360
He was the one who told me there was a class reunion.

791
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,320
By the way, Jiwon, do you have a stomachache?

792
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,570
I'm worried that Park Min-hwan will hurt you

793
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:05,320
People don't change

794
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:08,580
What I have done before I will do again

795
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:21,380
"Haruhi"?

796
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,430
Do you mean Dynamite?

797
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:42,110
(Dynamite, 2020)

798
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:56,040
(Spring Day, 2017)

799

(It is now July 10, 2013)

800
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:23,360
What is supposed to happen will eventually happen.

801
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,690
I won't run away

802
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,400
My time was over then.

803
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,820
-elder brother
- Yesterday after you got off work

804
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:32,740
Go back to Cheongdam-dong with her
Are you working overtime too?

805
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:34,370
I will help you, no matter what

806
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:36,960
Kang Ji-won, how is it?
Feeling like Park Min-hwan?

807
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:40,380
If you want something, you will do whatever it takes to get it.

808
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:42,590
If you really want it, you will

809
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,250
You are more qualified

810
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:48,590
Because you will still be alive in ten years.
