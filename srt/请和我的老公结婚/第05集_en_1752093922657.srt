You can get a leave after serving in the army for 100 days!

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,110
Are you going to do hard labor instead of joining the army?

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,530
What's wrong with your face?

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,620
I thought you were gone.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,080
There is a product called sunscreen

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,870
Of course, before you join the army
This thing already exists

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,330
What are we going to eat now?

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,420
Guys, we've spent a lot of money.

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,130
Let's buy some soju and go back to school.

14
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,760
What a wonderful night!

15
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,100
Thanks

16
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,480
What?

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,690
Let's go

18
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,650
Drinking should be done in moderation. It scares me to death.

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,320
sorry

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,860
sorry

21
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,414
Is she alone? Should we pick her up?

22
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,458
She was practically begging us to carry her.

23
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,377
It would be rude to ignore her.

24
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,921
Yes, this goes against the spirit of chivalry.

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,380
Move out!

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,050
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,970
How are you?

28
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,270
Telephone pole

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,560
sorry

30
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,190
How are you?

31
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,940
Are you alone? What's your name?

32
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,900
I'm alone

33
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,990
I'm totally alone, really alone

34
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,200
My dad passed away on March 2nd.

35
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,410
so

36
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,290
I am alone

37
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,960
I also broke up with my boyfriend.

38
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,880
So I am really alone

39
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,050
What about friends?

40
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,890
You should have friends.

41
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,810
friend…

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,210
I have no friends because I'm a bit annoying

43
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
Smell of alcohol

44
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,230
What's wrong?

45
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,200
It seems delicious

46
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,950
What?

47
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,730
Episode 5

48
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,660
What are you looking at?

49
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,500
I wonder if this is beer or soju

50
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,630
My eyesight is very bad

51
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,170
Even if you close your eyes, you know it's beer.

52
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,630
If you can't tell

53
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,220
You shouldn't drink it anymore.

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,560
But this is the beer I bought

55
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,350
Ouch

56
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,400
Thanks

57
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,610
Doesn’t your forehead hurt?

58
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,820
No

59
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,950
But I really should drink today.

60
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,450
Then you go home and drink

61
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,170
Do you want me to drink alone?
I'm already a person

62
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,880
My dad passed away three months ago.

63
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,050
March 2

64
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,970
I know you broke up with your boyfriend too.

65
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,640
Do you have other family members? Mom or brothers and sisters

66
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,270
I don't have any brothers or sisters

67
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,070
My mother has been away from home for 3193 days

68
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,110
That was when I was in my country.

69
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,280
As for friends...

70
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,790
You have no friends because you are annoying

71
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,160
How do you know?

72
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,090
Are you a fortune teller?

73
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,390
Come, beer

74
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,970
Thanks

75
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,150
Drinking is beer

76
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,500
Actually, I have a friend

77
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,500
But every time...

78
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,050
When I was really sad, I couldn't contact her.

79
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,510
Is she busy?

80
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,510
I mean, the time is always wrong.

81
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,060
She must want to be with me.

82
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,310
I'm sad that you can't accompany me

83
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,030
But…

84
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,370
Days like today

85
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,950
If I were with Xiumin

86
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,960
I would feel a bit cowardly.

87
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,800
My boyfriend

88
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,390
One day it suddenly started

89
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,730
He always says he is busy and tired

90
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,610
And when my dad passed away

91
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,320
He didn't come

92
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,280
I had a premonition then.

93
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,410
But I still pretended to be fine

94
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,790
Three full months

95
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,710
because…

96
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,590
Alone

97
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,210
More sad

98
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,850
I found out…

99
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,280
I don't know when it started
He only has Xiumin in his eyes

100
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,780
But this is natural.

101
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,290
Xiumin is kind, pretty and cute

102
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,330
And she's my only friend.

103
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,090
Do you know that feeling?

104
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,350
Xiumin is indeed very kind

105
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,430
Pretty and cute

106
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,400
But I stood beside her

107
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,650
I'll feel so shabby.

108
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,490
A total wimp.

109
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,410
If she makes you feel this way
You should stay away from her.

110
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,210
Whether she is good or bad
If she makes you feel uncomfortable

111
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,670
To you, isn't she just a bad friend?

112
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,930
Do you know what it means to have no family?

113
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,440
Have you ever been on a boat?

114
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,820
Ever since my dad passed away

115
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,490
I feel like I'm on a boat every day

116
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,830
I stood firmly and straight, but the boat kept shaking.

117
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,290
I feel uneasy

118
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,790
I want stability

119
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,800
I want to step on the land

120
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,930
Only Xiumin can be my land

121
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,270
Only her

122
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,320
But this is all because I'm such a wimp, period.

123
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,410
Then I am also a wimp.

124
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,910
My mother passed away 15 years ago.

125
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,580
5328 days ago

126
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,380
Later I had a stepmother and a younger sister.

127
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,010
They are good people, but I feel weird.

128
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,930
So annoying

129
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,350
Wow, you are such a wimp.

130
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,430
I should cheer up.

131
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,520
The real wimp is here

132
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,400
Although it is sad to lose your mother

133
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,400
But your dad started over.
Isn't that a very good thing?

134
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,030
My dad should be like this too.

135
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,120
If so…

136
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,420
He shouldn't have died.

137
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,680
My father who started over has passed away

138
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,510
Don't think like that.

139
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
cheers

140
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,360
So warm

141
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,170
Let's just assume that neither of us is a coward.

142
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:59,010
You are right.
At least my dad was happy before he died.

143
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,730
Your father left you a new family.

144
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,850
congratulations

145
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,820
Congratulations on having a friend who is as reliable as the land

147
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,910
You are someone who has
A good man who is as reliable as the land

Lost to Liu Zhihe, an average student in the Department of Economics

154
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,040
Why?

155
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,630
Why would you go to such lengths?

156
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,550
You are obviously an ordinary person.

157
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,420
You're not an athlete.

158
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,800
I'm a soldier, take a ten-minute break.

159
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,050
What?

160
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,010
Does he mean to fight again?

161
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,720
It seems

162
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,190
Then why did he study economics?

163
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,360

It really scared me.

166
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,460
I hope he is not a student of our school.

167
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,090
Otherwise it would be too embarrassing

168
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,500
I really hate that.

169
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,800
But he's really weird.

170
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,840
Why do this to a drunk person?

171
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,640
- No way
-Yeah.

172
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,810
I should cheer up.

I'm already 23 years old

174
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,770
When will you become sensible?

175
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,900
Is she a senior?

176
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,450
Since you want to fight, why don't you defeat that guy Xinyu?

Am I an unattractive looking uncle?

00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,400
Which part are you asking about?

185
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,820
Does he look unpleasant? Or does he look like an old man?

186
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,610
Do you want me to recommend you a sunscreen?

187
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,240

00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,830
very good

190
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,330
- Very nice
-Um

191
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,540
right

192
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,340
Hey, stop.

193
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,430
Are you here?

194
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,610
It tastes so good

195
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,480
Four

196
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,360
I'll give you nine, eat them all.

197
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,660
Eat slowly

198
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,830
Drink some water

199
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,760
If you keep eating like this you'll turn into a pig

200
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,190
(Cat Snacks)

201
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,220
Brother, why do you come to school every time you have a vacation?

202
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,270
-What is that?
- He seems to be doing something

203
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,980
-I think his senior in the military school asked him to do this.
-It seems that his military life was very hard

204
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,690
Looking back, I had a few chances.

205
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,740
Because I didn't know it was an opportunity
So I didn't grasp it.

206
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,620
Otherwise, I didn't grasp it.

207
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:50,830
(U&K won the 2011
The most influential food brand

208
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,670
Minister, I would like to introduce our team to you.

209
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,960
right

210
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,090
- Or...
-This person graduated from a Korean university.

211
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,590
Kang Ji-won Staff

212
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,220
Say hello

213
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,060
This is Minister Liu Zhihe who took office today.

214
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,230
Although Jiang Zhiyuan graduated from a Korean university

215
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,900
But it's not very rigorous,

216
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,900
So I paid extra attention to her.

217
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,320
-How is the project proposal I asked you to submit?
- You said you would hand it in by tomorrow

218
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,950
Did you see that? Yes

219
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,870
Let's change the next one

220
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,240
Yes, that...

221
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,920
It's no longer a chance to seize

222
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,770
But this time it's different

223
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,900
(April 19, 2013)

224
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,710
I am in a good mood indeed.

225
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,210
What are you doing?

226
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,970
Um?

227
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,390
Are you happy?

228
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,600
Follow me

229
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,780
I told you, that guy is interested in you

230
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,570
What are you talking about? He has a girlfriend.

231
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,120
Did that guy say that?
He said he has a girlfriend?

232
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,870
You are so naive

233
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,200
So what if I have a girlfriend?

234
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,210
Ji-won, I tell you, men

235
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,750
All will cheat

236
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,920
Does he have a girlfriend?

237
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,550
Even if you have a wife, you will still like someone else.
That's the man

238
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,630
Do you know who is a man’s ideal lover?

239
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,430
A strange woman I met for the first time

240
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,260
That's what a man is, you know?

241
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,850
Are all men like you?

242
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Don't be so stupid

243
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,940
That's why I say you are the problem.

244
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,820
Because you look easy to get
Men play tricks

245
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,530
You absolutely

246
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,820
That can't be the case, right?

247
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,330
What?

248
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,540
No

249
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,670
I probably thought all men were like you.

250
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,750
oh

251
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,670
Because everyone does this except me.

252
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
So I can see

253
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,720
I want you to be careful

254
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,510
- You don't understand
-I see

255
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,180
Agent Jiang

256
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,560
- I'm leaving
-good

257
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,690
Really

258
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,410
She's been so weird lately.

259
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,290
Surprisingly good

260
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,920
Become beautiful

261
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,010
This is the new revolution

262
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,180
Unprecedented

263
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,190
This is company welfare.

264
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,020
Our company actually has Pacific Broad Shoulders

265
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,900
Does he have broad shoulders too?

266
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,490
I was busy looking at the lines from his waist to his back

267
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,860
I didn't see his shoulders.

268
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,120
It would probably take two days and one night to take a closer look.

269
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,120
How come his legs are so long?
Why are you so selfish?

270
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,460
- So cool
- So cool

271
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,010
Hello? Hello, Director.

272
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,340
Minister Liu Zhihe

273
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,840
The Finance Team has submitted your stock trading information

274
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,390
I'm calling to confirm with you.

275
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,100
Do I need to report my personal account as well?

276
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,350
The change is large and you
No stocks other than ours are being bought

277
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,650
If it's inconvenient for you
Should I not report it?

278
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,770
Please, thank you.

279
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,820
Don’t you usually stay away from areas you don’t understand?

280
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,620
That's right

281
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,710
(Minister Liu Zhihe)

282
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,670
This means he knows something.

283
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,540
Did you say Roy Gental?

284
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,590
Are you sure there's nothing special?

285
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,470
Yes, although the stock price soared

286
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,680
But according to our intelligence
It’s still an uncertain project.

287
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,430
It's not a company related to Zhihe.

288
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,560
But he hasn't sold it yet.

289
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,850
Let's observe again.

290
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,770
You should also check if he has any accounts in his name.

291
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,320
Don't let Ji Hyuk know

292
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,320
OK, I understand

293
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,200
If something has changed

294
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,370
Things that weren't a problem before
It may become a problem

295
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,340
It's so sexy.

296
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,380
-His ass...
- Legs so long

297
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,260
Will we be interested in the minister's transformation?
Too indifferent?

298
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,060
Everyone is discussing it like crazy

299
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,020
That's not my type.

300
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,480
It was supposed to be after the relationship
Finding out that the other person is not your type

301
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,110
I'm married, it's illegal to have feelings for someone

302
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,990
Our quick-cooking meal kits

303
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:43,910
Green peppers have high nutritional value
But there aren't many farms that supply it.

304
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,200
so…

305
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:49,170
In fact, green pepper is not another variety

306
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,630
Harvested before it is fully ripe

307
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,960
- As long as you buy it, they should be able to supply it
-What?

308
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,170
That's true, I just found out.

309
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,680
It seems that both of you only study at your desks.

310
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,970
I come from a farm.

311
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,980
I mean when I was a kid
Grew up on the muddy ground

312
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,650
Oh really?

313
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,530
We've walked on a lot of muddy ground

314
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,280
That’s not right. Are we stepping on sand?

315
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,620
We used to run on the beach.

316
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,830
Reminds me of my childhood.

317
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,080
Do you remember the auntie who used to sell candy at the beach?
We ate a lot

318
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,420
Expanded sugar?

319
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,670
It's sugar

320
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,800
It's really fun to peel and eat loquat while looking at the sea

321
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,340
You always break it into pieces, and I peel it for you.

322
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,970
Please take good care of our Zhiyuan

323
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,470
You don't know how much she needs care.

324
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,770
I'm sad that she went to Seoul to attend university

325
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,230
But she couldn't make friends at that time.
Spend the whole day in the library

326
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,400
I had to go back and forth between Busan and Seoul.

327
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,500
You go to school in Busan?
Are you coming to Seoul to see Agent Kang?

328
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,830
Yes, every week

329
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,540
I'm really dying of exhaustion.

330
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,580
I once concentrated the course into four days.

331
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,590
Three days in Seoul

332
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,670
Is that why she can't make friends?

333
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,720
Such a long distance
Even if it's my boyfriend, I won't see him every week.

334
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,760
We are so good.

335
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,480
She is really your other half
This kind of friend is rare

336
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,650
This kind of friend is not worth having

337
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:42,110
Agent Kang, why did you go to college in Seoul?

338
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,160
Because she wants to study at a Korean university.

339
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,200
She must be sure of this.
That's a Korean university.

340
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,540
Are you here to play in the company?

341
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,210
You don't work all day, you just get together and chat

342
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,420
Graduated from Korean University, go move my car

343
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,720
The parking spaces were terrible.

344
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,640
I parked on the fourth floor underground, car number 75NA1109

345
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,360
How? Graduated from a Korean university
Don't you bother to do such a thing?

346
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,820
Are you guys going to keep chatting in the lounge?

347
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,860
That's how women are anyway.

348
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,280
Hey, everyone, get back to work.

349
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,410
Why don’t you get up right now?

350
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,750
I'm going to blow up the lounge.

351
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,010
It's you

352
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,230
It's not your fault that your master has a bad temper.

353
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,570
If I guessed correctly

354
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,450
You should be waiting for me

355
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,410
Because you want to comfort me

356
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,290
You have to tell me that you are the only one on my side

357
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,760
I'm worried about you and waiting for you

358
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,430
Have you moved the section chief's car?

359
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,140
alright

360
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,480
If you can't give me the quick-cooking meal plan
At least let me join.

361
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,530
I go to farms and factories.
I will really do it seriously

362
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,910
I must become a full-time employee this time

363
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,530
Let me join, please?

364
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,580
I'll think about it.

365
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,250
Are you still sulking?

366
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,250
I'm not just saying this casually

367
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,590
If you have something that is bothering you, you should talk about it.
If you keep doing this, I'll be hurt.

368
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,110
It is our destiny to be together forever

369
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,150
If I use this opportunity to get a full-time job
We'll work together till we die in U&K

370
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,070
Okay?

371
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,700
Hey, Jiang Zhiyuan, please come here as soon as you park your car.

372
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,920
When will you give me the revised business plan?
You didn't tell me you were going to form a team.

373
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,510
Sorry, it's not sorted yet.

374
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,050
Definitely not well organized

375
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,640
That's all you're capable of.

376
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,680
You can't do it on your own

377
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,100
I will ask Yang Zhulan to help you
I've already told Xiumin about this.

378
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,110
Agent Yang is already helping me

379
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,980
- And Hee-yeon is helping me too
-Is she any use?

380
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,900
What did she say? Never mind.

381
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,610
Because you submitted the project plan.
I didn't say much.

382
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,490
But this is a repeat of the plan I prepared last time.

383
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,620
Can I remove you?

384
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,790
Once my name is on it

385
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,580
And an agent in the district is handling
It's a completely different level

386
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,090
But I want you to join

387
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,300
So please stop talking back.

388
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,380
Get out now

389
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,220
Is this how things turned out?

390
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,520
Since I didn't give the project proposal to Zheng Xiumin

391
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,520
Jin Jingxu will take away my project

392
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,070
Add Zheng Xiumin's name

393
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,360
Agent Jiang

394
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,830
Oh, Minister

395
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,250
Will you be free tonight?

396
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,080
May I ask what you want me to do?

397
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,380
No, not really.

398
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,260
I want to have dinner with you, let's make an appointment

399
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,600
I have something personal tonight.

400
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,350
If it is work related

401
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,690
Please tell me the time, place and occasion
I will arrange

402
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,030
No need for this

403
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,490
OK, I understand.

404
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,370
good

405
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,620
Personal matter?

406
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,850
Eun-ho, you seem to have a guest.

407
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,020
guest?

408
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,150
Ji Won

409
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,750
I thought this was just a restaurant.
Is this a place you are familiar with?

410
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,920
Yes, this is our restaurant.
Wine bar with business dealings

411
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,170
I want you to taste the real deliciousness

412
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:42,100
The aroma is very rich, right?
This is the wine produced by the Olang Estate in 1999.

413
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:46,940
Made when we first met in high school

414
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,860
With fir and black currant

415
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,860
There is also blackberry fragrance, it is not easy to be so rich

416
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,610
I really smelled it.

417
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,360
Scent of grapes and trees

418
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,120
-It smells so good
-Do you like it?

419
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,950
Wait a minute.

420
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,410
Here are these wines

421
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,170
All of them are alcohol with a wholesale price of over 1 million won

422
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,460
Let’s drink a little from each bottle.

423
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,710
Eun Ho

424
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,300
Actually, I came to you today to invite you to dinner.

425
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,380
Have you eaten?

426
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,680
Would you like to eat?

427
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,600
I usually eat early.

428
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,520
I didn't think of that.

429
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,600
It's okay. Come and sit down.

430
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,650
We haven't seen each other for a long time. Let's chat.

431
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,730
good

432
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,340
What is she doing now?

433
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,220
I wanted to take care of her.

434
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,300
She's really unlucky.

435
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,890
let me see

436
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,880
Hello? Minhwan

437
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,210
Hey, Xiumin

438
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,380
Are you with Jiwon now?

439
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,010
I can't contact her

440
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,550
Ji Won just left

441
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,890
She dressed up beautifully and looked in the mirror several times

442
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:50,230
I thought she was going to date you, wasn't she?

443
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,690
What?

444
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,190
Are you dressed up nicely?

445
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:58,150
Min-hwan, you need to take care of Ji-won

446
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,280
What do you care about?

447
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,700
It's not like she's going to run away or anything.

448
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,990
Why not? She suddenly changed her look recently.

449
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,740
Women are unpredictable

450
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,410
Zhiyuan's mother also gave birth to her
You've found your soul mate.

451
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,130
But as a woman, I think this is cool

452
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,920
Although Ji-won is so pitiful

453
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,380
etc.

454
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,180
Ji Won's mother...

455
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,430
Having an affair?

456
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,020
What?

457
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,140
Don't you know?

458
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,230
what to do?

459
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,070
Did I say something wrong?

460
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
No

461
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,240
It's not Ji Won, I made a mistake with another friend

462
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,410
that…

463
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:52,540
I thought you knew this, of course.

464
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,960
Oh, yes.

465
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,540
I know

466
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:59,170
Her mother left home when she was a child.

467
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,880
But because of the affair...

468
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,880
No

469
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,930
I mean you don't know
Did she leave because she found true love?

470
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,810
what to do?

471
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,690
I'm going crazy

472
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,280
Minhwan

473
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:25,070
Just pretend you didn't hear it.

474
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,160
I said the wrong thing

475
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,200
Infidelity is not hereditary, so it's not a big problem

476
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,410
Of course, yes

477
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,120
This is not a problem

478
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,590
You are such a good man.

479
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:47,380
But I will find out what Ji Won is doing today
Tell you again

480
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:50,100
Although she is definitely working

481
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,430
Well, that should be it.

482
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,640
OK, then call me again.

483
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,270
good

484
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,140
You told me not to talk to you anymore
Is it because you think I rejected you?

485
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,640
Don't talk to me anymore.

486
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,180
No…

487
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,440
Don't mention that.

488
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,900
You didn't just reject me...

489
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,150
What did I say?

490
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:48,110
Did you take that
Did you say you brought the letter I wrote to you?

491
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,570
Yes, I brought it if you asked me to.

492
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,370
Let me see

493
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,750
(Bai Enhao: You think you are popular
Will everyone like you?)

494
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,050
(I want to vomit, so annoying
Don't talk to me!)

495
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:05,960
(Kang Ji-won)

496
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,720
Isn't this your handwriting?

497
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,970
Yes, it's my handwriting.

498
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,430
But I didn't really write this.

499
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:24,730
This means that Zheng Xiumin can
Imitating my handwriting perfectly

500
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,780
Really

501
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,660
Will you be cold?

502
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,200
etc.

503
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,490
No

504
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,790
The air conditioning here seems a bit strong

505
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,250
Let's go out

506
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,380
good

507
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,290
Let's go

508
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,930
You first

509
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,730
Eun Ho

510
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,820
I can see the heart of 31-year-old Eun-ho

511
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,740
But…

512
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,530
I have a boyfriend

513
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,870
Is that so?

514
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:28,670
Is that person very tall?
The one wearing black-framed glasses?

515
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,340
Black frame glasses?

516
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,050
right

517
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:36,220
Wearing a three-button suit

518
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,720
No fashion sense...

519
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:46,400
I mean he dresses classically.
Wearing a very expensive watch

520
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,440
Is it the minister?

521
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,820
How do you know our minister?

522
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,950
He was the one who told me there was a class reunion.

523
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,620
How does he know you?

524
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,420
So, yes

525
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:12,210
I thought he was your boyfriend

526
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,220
I think he's worried about you.

527
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,360
You opened six bottles?

528
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:38,990
Six million won?

529
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,660
And then she rejected you?

530
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,620
- She didn't reject me.
- You were rejected.

531
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:51,420
If you are not rejected
I wouldn't be here looking so pitiful.

532
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,220
Before I give up

533
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,930
I'm not rejected.

534
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,720
Even though she has a boyfriend

535
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,190
even though…

536
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,270
There are other boys who like her

537
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,400
Did you still send her home?

538
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,780
-What?
-You were rejected

539
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,110
Just give up.

540
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,620
hateful

541
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,620
Ouch

542
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:45,810
(Represented by Kang Ji-won)

543
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:09,960
(Agent Jiang Zhiyuan, dialing)

544
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,960
(Park Minhwan)

545
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,800
(Park Min-hwan, missed call)

546
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,270
That's stomach cramps.

547
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,140
Drinking on an empty stomach is not good

548
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,190
good

549
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:36,730
When the pain subsides, take the medicine with hot porridge.

550
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,570
OK, check out please

551
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,380
Drinking on an empty stomach is not good

552
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,250
I was scared to death!

553
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,630
Are you crazy? Why are you exaggerating?

554
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,340
So it’s you?

555
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:46,430
how?

556
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,600
Were you expecting it to be another man?

557
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,140
no

558
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,520
Then why are you following me? Just call me

559
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,530
Why should I make you happy? You don't answer my calls.

560
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,990
What?

561
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,740
So funny

562
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,200
You are self-aggrandizing.

563
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,540
Men are not interested in you.

564
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,910
And seeing you're so scared

565
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:15,790
Really interesting

566
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,750
Is this interesting?

567
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,420
Yes, it's very interesting.

568
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:25,630
Say

569
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,680
Where have you been?

570
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,930
Do you put on lipstick again after get off work?

571
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,430
What are you talking about?

572
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,690
Look

573
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:39,860
Why are your lips so red?

574
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,030
Where did you go to seduce someone?
What's that on your face?

575
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:48,280
Is this blush?

576
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,330
Blushing

577
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,540
Like mother, like daughter

578
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:00,670
What did you just say?

579
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,550
What?

580
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,510
I asked you what you were talking about.

581
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:06,420
What?

582
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,720
I didn't say anything

583
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:12,930
I'm doing this because you've been really suspicious lately.

584
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:15,810
It's Jung Soo Min

585
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:18,390
Zheng Xiumin told him about her mother

586
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,600
how?

587
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:21,650
You've been acting strange lately, right?

588
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,780
I bought clothes that I wouldn't normally buy.

589
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:25,690
What?

590
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:28,700
Did you wear perfume?

591
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,910
What kind of perfume? It smells like soap.

592
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:36,040
Where did you go after get off work?

593
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,210
You honestly

594
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,920
Let me go

595
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:46,960
Very painful

596
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:48,550
hateful

597
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,640
I'll go to the company to see your off-get off work time.

598
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,140
Tell me the truth, where have you been?

599
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,810
I asked you where you went?

600
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,520
What are you doing?

601
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,450
Minister Liu Zhihe?

602
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:16,330
grown ups?

603
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:23,250
What's going on? Is the minister so great?

604
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,050
How are you two?

605
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,130
Are you crazy?

606
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,220
etc.

607
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,890
Anyway, if I leave her alone, she will die.

608
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,810
minister

609
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,940
You can't do this.

610
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,230
minister!

611
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:52,490
Let me go

612
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,280
hateful

613
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,700
Damn

614
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,480
No, why should I run away?

615
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:28,070
Liu Zhihe, that bastard
If I were in better shape, you would have...

616
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:37,950
Forget about Liu Zhihe

617
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:40,040
Um?

618
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,040
Why didn’t Jiang Zhiyuan follow?

619
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,670
Is she really crazy?

620
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,500
Um?

621
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,050
Both of them?

622
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,300
Go to hell, damn it

623
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,810
In this case, the person who left the woman behind

624
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,570
It's my husband.

625
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,160
Is your wrist okay?

626
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:23,080
How come you are here?

627
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,920
I just came here to do some work.

628
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,630
What's the matter?

629
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:34,970
that…

630
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:43,430
Because you didn't answer the phone

631
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,980
Although nothing should happen
But I'm worried about what might happen.

632
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:52,320
Why are you worrying about me?

633
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,440
It's time to get off work

634
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:58,610
Even if something happens to me,

635
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:02,240
- It has nothing to do with you.
-Related

636
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,500
I'm worried

637
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,460
Park Min Hwan will hurt you

638
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:19,890
Why do you think so?

639
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,600
People don't change

640
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,220
What I have done before I will do again

641
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:29,520
Min Hwan does have violent tendencies
But the minister has already discovered it?

642
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:32,770
I didn't know that before I got married.

643
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:36,320
-Park Min Hwan never laid a hand on me...
- He just moved.

644
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,740
It's no big deal

645
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,870
No, please don't say that.

646
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:49,080
No one can do anything to you

647
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,420
How is it no big deal?

648
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,710
I should break all his fingers.

649
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,380
It can be seen from NurTV at that time
He is a man of insight.

650
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,140
The problem is…

651
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,510
No

652
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,350
Seeing Park Min-hwan so scared
I find it interesting.

653
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:15,610
So that's not a problem

654
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,620
What is the situation now?

655
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,160
I'm here to see a good show
Watch her fight with Park Min-hwan

656
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,380
(Park Minhwan)

657
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,210
(Swipe to answer)

658
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,340
Hello?

659
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:42,180
Yes, Minhwan

660
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,970
Your behavior makes me uncomfortable

661
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,060
I'm worried about you

662
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,600
I don't want you to worry about me

663
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,730
Your feelings make me feel uncomfortable

664
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:00,820
Do you know what I mean?

665
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,120
Because of my personal experience
I hate emotional cheating.

666
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:12,790
I especially believe that you shouldn't betray your partner.

667
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,710
I've already dealt with it

668
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,550
deal with?

669
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:27,260
Is your girlfriend your business?

670
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:30,640
- No, that's not...
- Oh my god, I didn't think you were that kind of person

671
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,980
You're worse than I thought.

672
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:38,770
Hee-yeon is a very precious person to me.

673
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,450
She is so kind and beautiful

674
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,360
And lovable...

675
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:50,040
Never mind. I'll tell her myself.

676
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,250
No, Jiwon, please wait a moment.

677
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,170
Please calm down first

678
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,500
listen to me

679
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,590
So you thought I was dating Liu Xiyan

680
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,970
And then you're planning on cheating, right?

681
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:09,470
Because I like you

682
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,180
Isn’t it?

683
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:14,230
That's right

684
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:18,400
It's only this part of you that I like.

685
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:23,900
Come

686
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,790
(The most beautiful beauty)

687
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,130
Why are you calling me in the middle of the night? It's so scary?

688
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,760
-Hee Yeon
- If you don't within five seconds

689
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,340
Tell me what you want to do and this phone will explode

690
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,800
-Five, four...
-I love you

691
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,310
Does she sound like my girlfriend?

692
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,770
(The most beautiful beauty)

693
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,820
Besides, this is the name Liu Xiyan saved herself
Give you a reference

694
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:09,200
Hearing those disgusting words
I should not see you for a month.

695
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,030
But I will still see you at the company tomorrow
That's why I ask you

696
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:16,620
Are you terminally ill?
Or do you want to withdraw from our household registration?

697
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,290
(End of call)

698
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,540
that…

699
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,800
so…

700
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,720
So you two are brother and sister.

701
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,260
Liu Xiyan

702
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:34,640
Liu Zhihe

703
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,820
What should I do? I'm sorry.

704
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,110
Please forget what I said today

705
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:49,660
I had a huge misunderstanding

706
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:53,660
You haven't got it all wrong.

707
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:56,620
I…

708
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,840
I like you very much

709
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,860
Thank you for sending me back

710
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:55,930
minister

711
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:59,230
minister

712
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:00,390
minister

713
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:03,400
what to do?

714
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:05,480
minister

715
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,570
minister?

716
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,360
minister

717
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:28,090
So for Kang Ji-won's sake

718
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:29,460
It would be better if you break up.

719
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:31,260
Minister, aren't you crossing the line?

720
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:35,260
The first step to victory
Just stand on the mat and face your opponent

721
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:39,810
I don't want to be robbed of everything by heartless people again

722
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,350
He is one of the people that Kang Ji-won has dated.
The best one

723
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,270
You exit

724
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:48,320
All of them should be in the name of Wang Xingren, the executive

725
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,110
You are really good at fighting.

726
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,360
First stand on the mat and face your opponent

727
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:55,780
The question is how to knock it down
