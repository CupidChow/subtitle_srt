1
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,126
I...

2
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,044
had a crush on you!

3
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:17,495
What I mean is...

4
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,122
I...

5
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:22,666
Sorry.

6
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,877
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

7
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:28,255
- Yes, sir?
- <i>I'm sorry to call on the weekend.</i>

8
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,925
But I think I need your help.

9
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,011
Do you have time to help me?

10
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:38,057
It's about the group's advertising
budget. I'm at Winton Hotel.

11
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,064
Hello? Ms. Kang?

12
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,818
Right. I see.

13
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,072
I think I can get
there in 30 minutes.

14
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,243
Okay, I'll see you later.

15
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:58,953
Okay.

16
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,384
Sorry, I really have to go.

17
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,638
Yeah, okay.

18
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,182
By any chance...

19
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,602
Can I have your number?

20
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:30,985
Wait.

21
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,005
Bye.

22
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,179
Bye!

23
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,213
{\an8}EPISODE 4

24
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:38,385
{\an8}<i>Mr. Yu has never called me
out on a weekend before.</i>

25
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,315
{\an8}I'm sorry I'm late.

26
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,859
{\an8}You're not late.
Thanks for coming.

27
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,446
{\an8}<i>I'm sure of it. This
has never happened.</i>

28
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,864
{\an8}Let's talk as we go.

29
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,077
{\an8}There is a showcase
going on right now.

30
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,664
{\an8}It's a proposal to shift
marketing expenses online.

31
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,209
- It will change our advertising strategy.
- A bold suggestion.

32
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,629
Which means online
marketing must increase,

33
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:17,216
but the group is conservative
and says it's early to invest.

34
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,885
How can I help?

35
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,514
Support my opinion.

36
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,873
<i>It's NurTV! I can't believe it.</i>

37
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,210
<i>It will be a platform used
by all ages within ten years.</i>

38
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,300
Wow, this is...

39
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,136
I sense success here.

40
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,483
Though not everyone may agree.

41
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,862
Mr. Yu. You're here.

42
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,907
I'm sorry I'm late, Mr. Wang. This
is Assistant Manager Kang Ji-won.

43
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:29,329
<i>So this is when U&K's power-tripping
mole, Wang Heung-in, was still here.</i>

44
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,497
{\an8}<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

45
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:34,752
{\an8}<i>The so-called "Mole" executive was
filmed assaulting a crew member.</i>

46
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,838
{\an8}<i>It's spreading through social
media and causing a stir.</i>

47
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,631
{\an8}<i>What are you looking at?</i>

48
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,846
Hello.

49
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,557
It's so interesting
to meet you...

50
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,686
I mean, it's an honor.

51
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,233
You know your stuff, Mr. Yu.

52
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,994
It's smart to hire pretty girls.

53
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:11,455
It makes working
more fun, doesn't it?

54
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,833
<i>I almost forgot.</i>

55
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:18,462
<i>Kim Gyeong-uk's connection was
the mole guy. They're similar.</i>

56
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,131
I bet working isn't
fun for you here.

57
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,981
I told you to be
nicer to Ji-won.

58
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,944
Hey, are you really a
contract worker for U&K?

59
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,365
Who said that? Was it Ji-won?

60
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:50,744
Yeah, she said you are a contract
worker, and she's an assistant manager.

61
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,372
Since we're on it,
can I see your card?

62
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,166
Ji-won's an assistant
manager, so what are you?

63
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,502
I'm just a staff member.

64
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,337
She got promoted quickly.

65
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,256
- It's my turn...
- Are you joking?

66
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,968
How was she promoted first
if you got her the job?

67
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,680
I bought you all the meals
for your job hunting tips,

68
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,517
when you got your job
through a referral?

69
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,979
You said that the first, second,
and third interview rounds

70
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,857
for big companies should
be approached differently.

71
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,527
Apart from all that, what
was it about dating Eun-ho?

72
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:29,283
<i>No one could even reach Eun-ho.
How did he come to the reunion?</i>

73
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,081
Are you still
talking about that?

74
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,042
That was when we were
kids. We're 31 now.

75
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,837
- Stop it.
- Are you kidding me?

76
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:45,340
You've been playing
us with your lies.

77
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,719
Is it true you gave
Ji-won the knockoffs?

78
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,929
It wasn't that she
was copying you.

79
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,640
You're the one that gave
it to her as a gift!

80
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,853
Why did she say all that?

81
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,065
Have you been trying
to screw her over?

82
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,865
Why would I do that?

83
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,283
I'm her friend.

84
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,911
It's true.

85
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,247
It's your fault Ji-won was
dissed all through school.

86
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:21,293
You said she stole your man, copied
you, and wanted all your things.

87
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,794
You were always whining!

88
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,131
I never told you to diss her.

89
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:29,009
You bullied her on your
own, don't come at me!

90
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,685
What a creatively

91
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,146
crazy bitch.

92
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,567
I'm going to the restroom.

93
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,364
- Can you believe her?
- Jeez.

94
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,540
When did I ask
them to bully her?

95
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,042
Why are they blaming me?

96
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,753
What a bunch of losers!

97
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,891
OTHER HALF

98
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,195
<i>The person you are
trying to call...</i>

99
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,405
Darn it.

100
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,283
Why did Eun-ho have
to show up now?

101
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,566
Come on.

102
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,943
You think this is a joke?

103
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,446
Why do I pay you?

104
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,741
Do I have to see this
for you to decide?

105
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,410
I'm sorry.

106
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,787
Still, it's a really...

107
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:22,748
A really good...

108
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,126
I've accessed this site too.

109
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,796
What do you mean, it's good?
It's full of indecent content.

110
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:43,393
It seems the targeting effectiveness
works. It's called algorithm.

111
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:47,064
That's probably because it was
your first time on the site.

112
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,940
What?

113
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,902
When I first accessed the site,

114
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,863
<i>He Was Delicious </i>was on.

115
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,740
To attract attention at first,

116
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,327
the site recommends
provocative content first.

117
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,745
As time passes,

118
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,332
it will recommend content
that you're interested in.

119
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,958
It's actually pretty useful.

120
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:10,170
It keeps you from content
you're not interested in.

121
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,963
Hey.

122
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,591
Your job here is to
smile like a flower.

123
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,177
Know your place and
cut the chatter.

124
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,806
She's Ms. Kang
Ji-won, not "Hey".

125
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,059
What, Mr. Yu?

126
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,729
I called this promising employee
in today to hear her opinion.

127
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,565
No, I mean...

128
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,238
Mr. Yu is giving you praise.

129
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,367
I know. I've never heard
him say that before.

130
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,701
Mr. Yu is...

131
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,871
so hard to approach and
doesn't keep anyone close.

132
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,125
A good and competent person
should be kept close.

133
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,715
Did you just smile?
Are you insane?

134
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,969
Are you in your
right mind or not?

135
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,149
Mr. Yu?

136
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,069
Thank you for your
kinds words earlier.

137
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,158
It's because you're kind.

138
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,955
I wouldn't have said
so if you weren't.

139
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,840
You said we could get
girls if we go camping!

140
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,633
We could.

141
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,636
But you can't. You can't
even get your girlfriend.

142
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,724
You struck out and
had to go home.

143
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,896
So what? Is your
wife any different?

144
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,107
Man, my wife only
cares about me.

145
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,942
Whenever I leave the house,

146
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,361
she'll call and text nonstop.

147
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,238
"I miss you. What did you do?"

148
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:03,825
"Did you eat?" I'm
so tired of it.

149
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,118
This one time...

150
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,163
Honestly, I don't get it.

151
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,873
She called me already

152
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,001
- only five minutes after I left home.
- What is this?

153
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,794
- It's good, right?
- Yeah.

154
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,922
My wife got that for me.

155
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,759
A delicious treat to refresh
myself without coffee.

156
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:21,843
That's nice.

157
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,095
Unlike your
indifferent girlfriend.

158
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,180
Damn it.

159
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,184
I think your girl is
seeing another guy,

160
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,895
and saving you for the marriage.

161
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,481
Who says she can't do it either?

162
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,150
You don't know anything.

163
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,069
She couldn't pull that off!

164
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,403
What do you know...

165
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,406
Damn it.

166
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,327
Why are you taking that?

167
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,704
Because it's good! I'll
use it for flirting!

168
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,581
- Stop the car.
- Come on.

169
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,876
Get in.

170
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,836
That's okay.

171
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,463
I'm not okay with it.

172
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:01,550
You didn't have to work
and hear all that nonsense.

173
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,843
I think I should
treat you to a meal.

174
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,660
We're going to go eat
if you keep that up.

175
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,081
What is it?

176
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,962
Because you feel bad
over something like this.

177
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:44,843
There are people who were terrible
to me, and they're not sorry at all.

178
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,221
Don't get into the habit
of conforming to others.

179
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,433
Okay.

180
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:55,854
I learned I don't have to be good
to the people who treat me badly.

181
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,858
I'll use that energy to
be nicer to good people.

182
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,569
That's a good idea.

183
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,531
All you need now is to
recognize the good ones.

184
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,994
How did you know I was a
terrible judge of character?

185
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,541
I thought I was a good judge of
character, but I wasn't at all.

186
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,126
So it seems.

187
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,171
What about me?

188
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,386
A good person.

189
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,723
You're not that terrible.

190
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,394
By the way,

191
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,190
how was <i>"He Was Delicious"</i>?

192
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:45,904
No.

193
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:50,283
I was just saying that earlier
to make Mr. Wang feel better.

194
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,202
I don't know. It felt too real.

195
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,496
Tell me. Shall I
watch it or not?

196
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,622
No, I swear...

197
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,499
I haven't seen it!

198
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,126
This is unfair.

199
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,672
You must've watched it closely.

200
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,757
That's unfair. I mean it.

201
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,884
I really didn't watch it.

202
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,764
OTHER HALF

203
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,101
REMIND ME LATER

204
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,686
IN 1 HOUR CALL DECLINED

205
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,316
If you had plans, I
can take you there.

206
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,736
No need.

207
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,038
<i>Sorry, I said I'd wait
but I'm texting again.</i>

208
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:40,250
<i>Seeing you after all this
time, I can't settle myself.</i>

209
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,714
Someone must've said
something funny.

210
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,340
A friend.

211
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,175
Who?

212
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:50,969
A friend from school.

213
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,722
I went to a high
school reunion today.

214
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,307
It's been so long, so
we exchanged numbers.

215
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,979
It's momentarily nice
to see an old friend.

216
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,815
Even if it's all in the past.

217
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,818
I used to like him a lot.

218
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,988
He was my first love.

219
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,121
Well...

220
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:22,459
You could be reminded of old
feelings when seeing him again,

221
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,668
but it's dangerous.

222
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:27,505
So you should let go
of your old feelings...

223
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,299
It's not like that.

224
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,344
I have a boyfriend.

225
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,279
PARK MIN-HWAN

226
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,447
REMIND ME LATER IN 1 HOUR

227
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,530
CALL DECLINED

228
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,040
Ms. Kang?

229
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,124
Yes?

230
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,448
Everyone drives a
nice car these days.

231
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:37,450
It's hard to see inside the car.

232
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:38,743
What? No, I...

233
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,829
It's not for that reason.

234
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:45,041
- I thought you were trying to hide.
- No, why would I?

235
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,400
Su-min?

236
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,076
Mr. Park.

237
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,496
What's going on? What
are you doing here?

238
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:25,957
Well...

239
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,045
What is it?

240
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,381
The thing is...

241
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:35,717
What's wrong?

242
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,358
What?

243
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,569
Something's wrong.

244
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,367
The passcode is the day
Ji-won and I started dating.

245
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,827
Zero, six, two, two.

246
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,287
Am I wrong?

247
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,747
June 22. It's right.

248
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,334
I'll try calling her now.

249
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,629
She won't pick up.

250
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:17,967
<i>The person you are...</i>

251
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,260
This isn't like her.

252
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,472
It's okay.

253
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,016
I'll keep waiting outside.

254
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,853
No. I came to see her too.

255
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:29,979
It's just that...

256
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,482
What do we do?

257
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,868
Let's go get something
warm to drink and talk.

258
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,745
You can tell me what happened.

259
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,833
Stop crying.

260
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,172
Then shall we go outside?

261
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,256
Okay.

262
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,650
<i>Mr. Yu caught me acting strange.</i>

263
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:16,943
<i>How do I explain it?</i>

264
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,160
Thank you.

265
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,920
<i>It tastes good,
and it's warm too.</i>

266
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:49,559
Since Park Min-hwan and
I are an office couple,

267
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,394
I'm sure you're also curious.

268
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,732
However, it's my personal life.
So I don't want to explain.

269
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,276
Sure.

270
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,822
I'm curious, but don't
explain if you don't want to.

271
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:07,785
As long as you're making a
good decision for yourself,

272
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,912
that's enough for me.

273
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,834
I'm sure of that.

274
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,628
I figured something out lately.

275
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,300
I've been conforming to
others my whole life,

276
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,135
so I didn't know who I was.

277
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,639
So? Did you learn
something about yourself?

278
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,643
I'm still learning.

279
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,106
I'm planning a
meal kit proposal.

280
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,275
Meal kit?

281
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,360
Yeah.

282
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,615
Show me when you're done.

283
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,575
No, that's okay.

284
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,453
I'll look forward to it.
The sooner the better.

285
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,124
If that's the case,

286
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:56,834
okay.

287
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,712
What else do you want to do?

288
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,590
Well, what else...

289
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,343
I want to do interior design.

290
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:09,263
Also, I want to
learn self-defense.

291
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,975
Self-defense? Shall
I teach you that?

292
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,398
Self-defense from you?

293
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,442
What was that reaction?

294
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,236
It's just...

295
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,697
I just didn't picture
you as the type.

296
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,408
What? I was an athlete.

297
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:34,038
I did judo, hapkido, special martial
arts, taekwondo, Muay Thai, kickboxing...

298
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,462
I mean...

299
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:48,886
I've had this
thought for a while.

300
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,102
Have you considered
wearing contacts?

301
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:12,910
DRIED YOUNG POLLACK
GRILLED DRIED POLLACK

302
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,707
Don't drink so fast.
You'll get drunk.

303
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:22,628
I don't know how
things got this bad.

304
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:26,090
I'm scared Ji-won will
get the wrong idea.

305
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,675
Come on.

306
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:30,178
You know she's not
the type to do that.

307
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,430
She's been acting strange.

308
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:36,976
It feels like she's
getting distant from me.

309
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:42,315
Our relationship
wasn't like that.

310
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,359
<i>She's been strange indeed.</i>

311
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,697
<i>Wait, is something really
going on with Yu Ji-hyuk?</i>

312
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,449
<i>No way.</i>

313
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,284
<i>Ji-won likes me, and it means</i>

314
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,120
<i>she cares about both
looks and personality.</i>

315
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,750
It's because she's been busy.

316
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,376
She's one-track minded.

317
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,378
She only thinks about one thing.

318
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,423
- Do you think so?
- Of course.

319
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,967
Everyone knows what
type of relationship

320
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,302
you have with Ji-won.

321
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:14,972
Right?

322
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:16,724
Yeah.

323
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:23,898
I'm so glad I met you, Mr. Park.

324
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:29,570
If I hadn't, I would've gone
through such a hard time.

325
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,076
Thanks so much.

326
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,372
You're the best!
You're the coolest!

327
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,752
Thanks.

328
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,380
The coolest...

329
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,182
Eat this...

330
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:19,787
We're here.

331
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,335
Thanks for the ride.

332
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,213
- I'll go inside.
- Shall I walk you to your door?

333
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:30,756
What?

334
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,384
Never mind.

335
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,929
Ms. Kang?

336
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,351
I think we need to meet

337
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:45,604
as many people as possible
before getting married.

338
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,820
You're more free-spirited
than I thought.

339
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:54,655
I wasn't, but now...

340
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:58,409
No, wait.

341
00:26:58,492 --> 00:26:59,910
I won't be from now on.

342
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:04,415
Anyway, I don't think
marriage is a must.

343
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,878
So you don't want
to get married.

344
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,505
No. I'm going to get married.

345
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:15,801
What I wanted to say was...

346
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,471
I mean...

347
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:20,890
Well...

348
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,479
I swear...

349
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:33,736
Mr. Yu.

350
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,741
It's nice to see you smile.

351
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:04,058
<i>Interior design proposal
for my savior's happiness!</i>

352
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,565
She's so cute.

353
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:34,171
In order to do all of this, I
recommend moving to somewhere new!

354
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,006
Moving...

355
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,261
That's a good idea.

356
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:57,695
OTHER HALF

357
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,075
OTHER HALF MISSED CALL

358
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,833
<i>I can't reach you.</i>

359
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,253
<i>I don't know why they acted
that way at the reunion.</i>

360
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,299
<i>I knew you wouldn't come
if I told you about it.</i>

361
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,509
<i>I just wanted us
to all get along.</i>

362
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:26,015
<i>I don't think this should
be done over text or call.</i>

363
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:28,267
<i>Let's talk tomorrow.</i>

364
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:36,901
PARK MIN-HWAN

365
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:46,619
<i>Ji-won.</i>

366
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,628
<i>Su-min's crying right now.</i>

367
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,631
<i>It sounds like a
misunderstanding. Where are you?</i>

368
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:04,303
<i>I'm glad you're with her.</i>

369
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,722
<i>Take care of her
and get her home.</i>

370
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:09,767
<i>I have a lot on my mind,
so I need time to think.</i>

371
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:16,732
- Are you okay?
- Are you?

372
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,942
Yeah, I'm okay.

373
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:23,906
Still, I don't think I
can do this for long.

374
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:29,411
So hurry up and get
married. Please.

375
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,812
- Hello?
- <i>Hey.</i>

376
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:58,816
I'm not the type to be clingy

377
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,818
but I couldn't
help but call you.

378
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:04,697
Sorry, I got home late
and couldn't call.

379
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,032
No, that's okay. It's not late.

380
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:11,745
I was just feeling impatient.

381
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:16,875
But it feels weird
talking to you like this.

382
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,795
You think so?

383
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,673
Have we never spoken
on the phone before?

384
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:25,426
No, you told me not to speak...

385
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:29,263
Never mind.

386
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:30,848
What is it?

387
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:34,852
No. Actually, no, no.

388
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,270
Don't say it.

389
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,191
How many times
will you say "no"?

390
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,402
<i>Okay.</i>

391
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:48,240
In the past, you told me
not to speak to you again.

392
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:49,742
It was because of that.

393
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:53,120
Hey! Ji-won.

394
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,474
Hey, Ji-won!

395
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:17,978
What did I do?

396
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,399
You shouldn't be like that.

397
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,280
I never want to
speak to you again.

398
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,878
What's wrong with him?
I didn't say anything.

399
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,215
Sorry, Ji-won.

400
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:50,928
I told him that you
had feelings for him.

401
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:58,560
Does it make him feel that
awful that I like him?

402
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:14,493
That's because you rejected me.

403
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,329
I rejected you?

404
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:18,831
Yeah.

405
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:22,960
I still have that letter.

406
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,714
- Letter?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

407
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,173
Your reply.

408
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,969
I wanted to throw it
away, but I couldn't.

409
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:35,472
So you asked me out
through a letter,

410
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,224
and I replied?

411
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,144
Did you forget?

412
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,606
<i>I worked hard to
write that letter.</i>

413
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,818
I stayed up all night.

414
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:50,904
Oh, well.

415
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:54,032
- <i>Eun-ho.</i>
- Yeah?

416
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,910
Shall we meet up?

417
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,496
Can you bring

418
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,916
my reply letter?

419
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:18,432
Where is she? She's
usually early.

420
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:41,997
What's this, Ms. Kang?

421
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,665
You look like a celebrity!

422
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,083
Is it a special day?

423
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,127
No, it's not like that.

424
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:49,755
Wow, you look so pretty.

425
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:54,593
Actually, I went shopping
with Hui-yeon on Saturday.

426
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,136
So while I was at it...

427
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,388
Great job.

428
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,057
Right? You look amazing.

429
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,976
- Ji-won.
- What's going on? Move!

430
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:05,270
Babe.

431
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,023
Are you really my girlfriend?

432
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,566
You look so different.

433
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,486
I wanted to surprise you.

434
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,404
You did surprise me.

435
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,198
Babe.

436
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:21,495
You look like someone else
without your glasses. So pretty.

437
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:26,208
You talk as if you've never
seen her without her glasses.

438
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,584
Come on.

439
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:29,127
Of course, I've seen it.

440
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,963
She just looks so new.

441
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,297
So new!

442
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,477
What was that?

443
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:50,649
I'm sorry.

444
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,611
I'm sorry.

445
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:01,285
I'll clean it up, Mr. Yu.

446
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:03,453
Thank you.

447
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,290
What? But...

448
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:10,836
Your outfit...

449
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:14,089
doesn't seem suitable
for work today.

450
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:16,550
Excuse me?

451
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:17,634
I...

452
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:19,928
It's very suitable
for work, so why

453
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,806
are you criticizing her?

454
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:29,813
I must've felt that way because I
haven't seen her without her glasses.

455
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:30,897
Excuse me.

456
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,441
You saw it yesterday.

457
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:34,902
What?

458
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,492
That was the weekend, and
it's the first time at work.

459
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,120
What?

460
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,250
I see you're wearing
contacts too.

461
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,465
She's right.

462
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,258
Mr. Yu.

463
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:00,093
You look much better.

464
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:07,768
That's why you look
somewhat different today.

465
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,019
You look much...

466
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,151
I...

467
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,656
Did you get contacts together?

468
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,199
What are you saying?

469
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,659
Why?

470
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,743
Go to your seat.

471
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:29,873
Goodness.

472
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,291
Stop it.

473
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:35,587
Mr. Park, good for you.

474
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:39,049
We were just talking
about Ms. Kang.

475
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:43,428
You have a really great eye.

476
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:47,307
Who knew Ms. Kang
was that beautiful?

477
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:50,352
You probably didn't know but
she's always been pretty.

478
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,941
- You'll need a good defense.
- What?

479
00:37:56,024 --> 00:38:00,028
Just because there's a goalkeeper
doesn't mean a goal can't be made.

480
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:01,488
There's Seo Jin-su.

481
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,157
He's been talking
about Ms. Kang all day.

482
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:05,659
He's right.

483
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:07,869
Come on. No.

484
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,830
The ball wouldn't like that.

485
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,082
The ball is crazy about me...

486
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:21,675
Over here.

487
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:26,263
What's going on?

488
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,223
I have a meeting outside later.

489
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,017
It'll just take a second.

490
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,436
Here. This coffee's
for you. Drink it.

491
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,730
Thanks.

492
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:38,859
Did you rest up?

493
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,903
How do you feel?

494
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,865
Sorry about Friday.

495
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,910
Did you feel better
after the reunion?

496
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:54,833
And...

497
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,128
By the way,

498
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:03,550
how did you meet Yu
Ji-hyuk yesterday?

499
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:06,678
Oh, that.

500
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:12,059
<i>I feel bad for using
Mr. Yu so much.</i>

501
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,811
Something urgent came
up and he called me out.

502
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:17,564
I left my school
reunion because of that.

503
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:20,108
What a jerk! How
could he do that?

504
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:24,321
I think Yu Ji-hyuk

505
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,990
likes you.

506
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,537
No, it's not like that.

507
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:34,956
Yes, it is. I know it as a man.

508
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,167
It's like an antenna for males.

509
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,420
No matter how urgent,
why would he call you?

510
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:44,800
Just this morning, he went on
about your outfit being unsuitable.

511
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,427
You're so pretty

512
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,971
that it made him crazy.

513
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,349
What a jerk.

514
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:57,687
By the way,

515
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,609
you look really pretty today.

516
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:08,865
You're so pretty, and it makes me angry
that other jerks are looking at you.

517
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:10,951
I should be the only one.

518
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:12,577
You're mine, right?

519
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,166
What's this?

520
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:20,794
Right here.

521
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:27,551
Oh, no! What do we do?

522
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,761
What do we do? Go
to the restroom!

523
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:31,721
Hurry and go to the restroom!

524
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:34,015
It's seeping through
my underwear!

525
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:36,977
Wait!

526
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:47,154
Ji-won.

527
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:56,037
You didn't take it the
wrong way, did you?

528
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:00,667
I don't know why they said that.

529
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,170
They're so immature.
It was ten years ago.

530
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,636
<i>How could I not trust you?</i>

531
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:16,224
<i>If I hadn't seen the end,
it would've been impossible</i>

532
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,019
<i>for me to not trust you.</i>

533
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,648
I could've made a mistake,

534
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,401
but you know I get
confused easily.

535
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,243
Yeah, I was mad yesterday,

536
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:36,745
but it did seem strange.

537
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,664
There was no reason
for you to lie

538
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:42,876
about dating Eun-ho and
say I told you to dump him.

539
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,797
Unless you wanted to make
me look like a bad person.

540
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:51,676
But...

541
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,845
only a crazy person
would do that.

542
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,892
That's right. I wouldn't
do something like that.

543
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:06,399
Ye-ji and her friends always picked
on me for the strangest things.

544
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:07,609
It must be you now.

545
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,569
Yeah.

546
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:13,448
I won't let it slide this time.
We're not in high school anymore.

547
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,369
I'm going to meet
Eun-ho and ask him.

548
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,830
You're going to see him?

549
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,292
Yeah, he gave me his
number. He wants to meet up.

550
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,171
Don't worry, my other half.

551
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,591
This time,

552
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:33,468
I really won't let it slide.

553
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:37,347
Okay.

554
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,772
But don't you think
Min-hwan wouldn't like it

555
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,274
if you met another man?

556
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:49,734
Min-hwan isn't like that.

557
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,739
He wants me to feel at ease.

558
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,741
Also,

559
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:01,288
his stocks went through the
roof and made a lot of money.

560
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:09,129
His stocks did that well?

561
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:11,881
He said to look forward
to our newlywed house.

562
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:14,926
Lucky you.

563
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:29,524
We haven't left work on
time in ages, right, Ji-won?

564
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,906
Right, Ms. Kang?

565
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,620
To celebrate,

566
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:45,081
who wants to get chicken?

567
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,711
I have to pick up my kid.

568
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:51,796
I'm meeting a client.

569
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,923
- I can...
- Seriously?

570
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:56,343
You deserve an
incentive, Ji-won.

571
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:58,386
You do all the work on your own.

572
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:27,582
Excuse me.

573
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,003
Sorry about that.

574
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,807
That hair looks good on you.

575
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:47,185
Everyone was talking
about you today,

576
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,896
saying how they were
all jealous of Mr. Park.

577
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:51,981
Stop it.

578
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:55,735
Ms. Kang, you and Mr. Park
make a great couple.

579
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,445
I'm so jealous.

580
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,045
Ms. Kang.

581
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,839
Yes, Mr. Yu?

582
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:28,351
Why did you dress like
that for work today?

583
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,650
Do I look that strange today?

584
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:37,944
No, it's not that.

585
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:43,700
Never mind. I shouldn't
have said that.

586
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:50,748
I wore my contacts today
after what you said.

587
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,301
So I was wondering if
you dressed like this

588
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,803
because of or for someone.

589
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,389
It makes me feel good.

590
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:12,437
I dressed up for the first time
like this, and it felt good.

591
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:17,400
And people started treating me differently
because I dressed up like this.

592
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,571
Wouldn't it be wrong for others

593
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:24,741
to treat you differently
over how you're dressed?

594
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:26,618
You're right.

595
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:30,121
But there are
people who do that.

596
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:37,337
I think this is the right way to
deal with those type of people.

597
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:39,380
From now on,

598
00:46:40,048 --> 00:46:43,510
I won't just foolishly stick
to formalities anymore.

599
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:45,261
For my sake.

600
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:48,139
For your sake?

601
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,600
Yeah.

602
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,317
I swear, you look
different when you smile.

603
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,278
I hope you smile more often.

604
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:08,785
Also,

605
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:11,371
I'm not an expert
on this either,

606
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:16,417
but I think it would
be better if you change

607
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,461
your style a little.

608
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,005
I recommend that. Bye now.

609
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:27,887
Yeah.

610
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:30,390
Foolishly sticking to
formalities is bad.

611
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:39,357
Hey, where are you?

612
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:44,654
We'll leave it to you, Ms. Kang.

613
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:47,323
You can take the bus
at the shopping street.

614
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:49,409
Okay, thank you for your time.

615
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:01,754
I wore my contacts today
after what you said.

616
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:03,631
I think Yu Ji-hyuk likes you.

617
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,474
Yes, it's mine!

618
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:15,476
It's mine!

619
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,231
Isn't that Hui-yeon?

620
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,192
Yeah!

621
00:48:23,276 --> 00:48:24,277
What's she doing?

622
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:26,070
Hui-yeon...

623
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:27,530
What are you doing?

624
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:29,490
- What are you doing?
- I'm happy!

625
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:32,410
Yes, it's mine!

626
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:35,204
Okay, I get that you're
happy, but please stop.

627
00:48:37,457 --> 00:48:38,458
Thank you!

628
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:42,253
I won't forget your kindness of
buying me this limited edition!

629
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:45,506
I would be thankful
if you calmed down.

630
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,925
- Come on!
- Wait!

631
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,605
Right. There was a
scandal about them.

632
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,899
PERSONNEL TRANSFER
STAFF YU HUI-YEON

633
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:12,241
<i>Mr. Kim said they had an
inappropriate relationship</i>

634
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:13,951
<i>so she was even transferred.</i>

635
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,621
I can't believe this.

636
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:21,501
We kept bumping into each other
because I'm friends with Hui-yeon now.

637
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,254
I had no idea.

638
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:27,256
Gosh.

639
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:29,759
That could've been bad.

640
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:34,055
Park Min-hwan, you useless jerk.

641
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,182
Male's antenna, my foot.

642
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,274
Mr. Yu and Hui-yeon

643
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:48,653
were dating.

644
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:59,914
The successor of U&K does
get treated differently.

645
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,083
I always had to wait in line,

646
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,585
but he went straight
to the VVIP room.

647
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:08,047
"What did you want? Give
her everything she wants."

648
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:09,799
That's what he said!

649
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:14,554
- Is that why you're happy?
- I haven't been this happy in ages!

650
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:17,598
And he acted like he's
not into luxurious brands.

651
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:19,350
It was so cool, Grandfather.

652
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:21,394
I always want to buy things.

653
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:25,606
I asked him to buy me all the
clothes, bags, and shoes I wanted.

654
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:29,527
Clothes, bags, shoes, coats...
Because it's his credit card.

655
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,405
He bought me everything.
That was pretty cool.

656
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,243
I want to stay a little longer.
I'm sorry to leave so early.

657
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:38,870
That's okay.

658
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:44,709
- Hello, Mr. Lee.
- Hi.

659
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:48,880
Who's doing the strategic planning
if you're always with Grandfather?

660
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,339
He's my right-hand man.

661
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:53,134
No, that's me. I'm
your right-hand person.

662
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:57,847
Take care of yourself.
I'll visit soon.

663
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,099
Okay, come back whenever.

664
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:01,476
- You too.
- Okay.

665
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:07,523
- Ji-hyuk, you'll give me a ride, right?
- It's the opposite direction.

666
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:10,401
What are you saying?
Take her home.

667
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:12,737
It's late. Will you
make her go alone?

668
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:14,781
- Get in.
- Bye, Grandfather!

669
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:15,864
Bye.

670
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,037
Bye.

671
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,421
Bye, Grandfather!

672
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:42,016
Did you look into the woman?

673
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:45,311
I left the report in your study.

674
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:54,028
{\an8}FRY ME

675
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,248
Ji-hyuk? Why?

676
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:08,376
Hey, Ji-hyuk.

677
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:13,881
Right now?

678
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:55,256
If I want to teach a
woman self-defense,

679
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,091
judo would be best, right?

680
00:52:58,968 --> 00:53:00,803
Wait, all of this is because...

681
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:04,181
All of this so you can teach
a woman self-defense skills?

682
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,559
Wait. That hurts so bad.

683
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,520
Great job.

684
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:14,942
He's so cold.

685
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:34,337
{\an8}<i>Whenever my dad gave me an allowance,
he always drew a heart on it.</i>

686
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,359
Yeah, I know.

687
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:58,444
I didn't know it'd be this hard.

688
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:01,906
But I can't be honest and
it's complicating things.

689
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:06,452
What would you have done?

690
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:11,874
Shall I just tell Ji-won?

691
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:15,252
That Min-hwan will cheat on
her with Su-min and hurt her.

692
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:22,009
No, if I say that,

693
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:25,554
I can't avoid telling her that
I'm living my second life.

694
00:54:31,811 --> 00:54:34,355
She won't believe me.
Even I can't believe this.

695
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,821
I haven't figured
everything out yet.

696
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:10,349
{\an8}APRIL 13, 2023

697
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:34,999
Mr. Park Min-hwan? You're under arrest
on suspicion of murdering Kang Ji-won.

698
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,211
Ms. Jeong Su-min?
Please come with us.

699
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:40,713
What?

700
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,339
Damn it.

701
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,633
Stop right there!

702
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:48,012
What's going on?

703
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,930
Why are you doing this?

704
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:52,058
Why are you doing
this? Let me go.

705
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:53,934
You have the right
to remain silent.

706
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:57,897
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

707
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,901
- Do you understand your rights?
- Murder? What do you mean, murder?

708
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:04,403
I didn't kill anyone!

709
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:08,282
It was an accident! It
was culpable homicide!

710
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,450
Okay?

711
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:12,870
She was going to
die anyway, right?

712
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,497
Those are the charges.

713
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,541
Jeong Su-min will be
arrested as the accomplice.

714
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:20,544
Whatever you have to say,
save it for the station.

715
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:21,837
- What?
- Take them.

716
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:23,297
What? Why me?

717
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,549
No, I didn't do it!

718
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:26,884
Take them quickly!

719
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:30,471
- It wasn't me! I didn't do it!
- Let go!

720
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:31,555
Let go!

721
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,151
What's going on?

722
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:49,240
So Jeong Su-min was having an
affair with Ji-won's husband?

723
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:51,200
This is unbelievable.

724
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:53,786
If that's true, where
did she get the nerve

725
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,830
to suddenly ask us to come here?

726
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:59,583
Honestly, I came because I
felt bad. Was it ten years ago?

727
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:01,627
We had a reunion at Goseuljung.

728
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:04,630
We ganged up on her,
and I felt bad about it.

729
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:10,970
You're right. Do you really think
Ji-won told Eun-ho to dump Su-min?

730
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:14,014
- I don't know.
- Ji-won...

731
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:15,850
said what?

732
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,561
Eun-ho? What are you doing here?

733
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,856
Hey, come here! It was
so chaotic just now!

734
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,946
What did you just say?

735
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:31,574
Don't get me started.
Your ex, Jeong Su-min,

736
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,743
- conspired with Ji-won's husband...
- Wait.

737
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:37,037
I never dated Su-min.

738
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,873
Is that true?

739
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,791
You never dated her?

740
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:42,251
Is that so?

741
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:49,383
<i>There wasn't much to say about what
I heard regarding Kang Ji-won's life.</i>

742
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:51,886
<i>After that,</i>

743
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,972
<i>I regretted
everything like crazy.</i>

744
00:57:57,433 --> 00:57:58,475
<i>But then...</i>

745
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,229
<i>I was given a second chance.</i>

746
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:47,983
APRIL 19, 2013

747
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:08,212
{\an8}<i>Thinking back, I
had a few chances.</i>

748
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:10,506
{\an8}<i>But it's different this time.</i>

749
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:11,632
{\an8}<i>I do feel better.</i>

750
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:13,717
{\an8}<i>Ji-won, let me
tell you about men.</i>

751
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:15,261
{\an8}<i>All men cheat.</i>

752
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:18,472
{\an8}<i>Min-hwan, you should
control Ji-won better.</i>

753
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,015
{\an8}<i>When something's changed,</i>

754
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:23,185
{\an8}<i>what wasn't a problem in
the past could become one.</i>

755
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:26,188
{\an8}<i>Where'd you go after
work? Tell me the truth.</i>

756
00:59:26,272 --> 00:59:29,316
{\an8}<i>I'm worried Mr. Park
might hurt you.</i>

757
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,818
{\an8}Are you crazy...

758
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:31,901
{\an8}Mr. Yu!
