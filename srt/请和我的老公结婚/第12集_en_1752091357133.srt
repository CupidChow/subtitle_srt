1
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,580
我总是抽到不好的牌
I used to always pick a bad hand.

2
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,710
唉呀
Crap...

3
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,670
去带妈妈回来
Bring Mom.

4
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,220
不管吵得再凶，丈夫都应该先低头才对
When a couple fights, the husband should reach out first.

5
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,310
哦，可以了
Oh, it's working.

6
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,520
你有没有需要什么？
Do you need anything?

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,860
我全都买给你
I'll get it for you.

8
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,490
爸爸虽然勤劳，但依然为生计所苦
My dad was hard-working but struggled to make ends meet.

9
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,450
我总是为他感到惋惜和难过
I always felt sad and bad for him.

10
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,330
买辆新车吧
Just get a new car.

11
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,420
它刚才发出一百岁老爷爷的咳嗽声
This one sounds like a 100-year-old grandpa coughing.

12
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,590
它会听到啦
She can hear you!

13
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,300
不可以这么无情
Don't be so heartless.

14
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,260
我是怕你会危险
I'm afraid it's dangerous.

15
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,800
它不会让我有危险
This baby won't put me in danger.

16
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,970
现在如果没有我，你就是一个人了
You'll be alone without me.

17
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,140
小心开车
Drive safe.

18
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,770
你晚上会回来吗？
Are you coming at night?

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,270
我半夜才会回来
I'll be pretty late.

20
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,980
要把门锁好再睡觉哦
Check the doors before bed!

21
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,500
我们家又没有什么东西好偷的
Who would steal anything from us?

22
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,260
给你
There you go.

23
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,430
你走吧
Go on now.

24
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,510
再见
Bye.

25
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,520
她长得真标致，很像她妈妈
She's pretty. Just like her mom.

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,360
像离家出走的妈妈有什么用？
So what? Her mom ran away.

27
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,530
姜先生只知道看女人的脸蛋
Mr. Kang shouldn't have married her for her pretty face.

28
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,240
-害得孩子这么可怜 -别说了
-I feel sorry for that poor kid. -Stop it.

29
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,320
妈妈离家的可怜孩子
The poor kid whose mom ran away.

30
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:32,000
在隔壁有几双筷子都知道的小村庄里，大家茶余饭后闲聊的话题
In this tiny little neighborhood, people talked about us to pass the time.

31
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,210
是我正值敏感的青春期的伤痕
And it hurt me more because I was going through puberty.

32
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,170
爸爸…
Dad...

33
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
他是要去哪里？
Where's he going?

34
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,150
下雨了，我们要不要租个片来看？
It's raining. Shall we rent a video?

35
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,740
-要不要也煮泡面来吃啊？-好啊
-Shall we have some ramyeon too? -Sounds great.

36
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,450
我去租片哦
I'll go rent it.

37
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,820
-快点回来哦 -好
-Hurry back. -Okay.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,080
妈妈？
Mom?

39
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,280
要撑下去就必须接受，有人的人生就是如此
To carry on, I had to accept that it was just my life.

40
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,910
有人的人生就是什么都没有
That my life was just one of the awful ones.

41
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,000
而我偏偏就是那种人
That there was no reason that I shouldn't be

42
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,120
也没有理由不是
one of the unlucky ones.

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,710
1200韩元
It's 1,200 won.

44
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,890
钱包不见了吗？
Did you lose your wallet?

45
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,230
唉唷，你一副就是妈妈离家的孩子
Goodness. You make it so obvious that your mother ran away.

46
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,480
你妈妈这样
Because of your mother,

47
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,780
你的行为就应该要更端正，才不会被说闲话
you must act smart so others won't find fault with you.

48
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,530
知道没？
You know that, right?

49
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,490
别那么闲言闲语
Don't be so nosy.

50
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,910
这个
Here.

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,290
是你的吗？
Is it yours?

52
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,640
那时一切都很好
So anything was good.

53
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,560
因为我很渴望伸出手就能碰到的感觉
I was desperate to feel a hand reaching out to me.

54
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,190
郑秀敏
JEONG SU-MIN

55
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,350
嗯？
What?

56
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,610
这些臭家伙
Those brats...

57
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,690
坏坏！
I'll punish you!

58
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,070
所以我没有余裕，去判断那是土地还是泥沼
Too desperate to judge whether it was land or swamp.

59
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,570
然而
But

60
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,080
当我获得第二次机会的时候，我心想我不会再这样
I was determined not to do it again with my second chance.

61
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,420
我会去对抗，我会成长
I was going to fight, grow,

62
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,290
我将会比任何人都幸福
and become happier than anyone else.

63
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,720
我的人生不可能只会抽到坏牌
It was finally my turn to pick a good hand.

64
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,600
我相信这次我真的抽到了好牌
I picked a good hand this time.

65
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,020
我会变得幸福
I believed I'd be happy.

66
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,690
我打电话想跟你聊聊，但是你一直都不接
I called to talk, but you wouldn't pick up.

67
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,450
我本来想之后再来
I thought about coming back later.

68
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,790
但是因为一直联络不上你，所以我想说来跟你约时间
But you might keep dodging my calls, so I waited to see you.

69
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,790
智媛
Ji-won.

70
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,170
我可以向你解释
I can explain this.

71
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,310
结果并非如此，我依旧只抽到坏牌
I was wrong. I still only pick bad hands.

72
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,870
第12集
EPISODE 12

73
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,680
原著：NAVER网络小说系列，成所作《和我老公结婚吧》
BASED ON THE NAVER SERIES WEBNOVEL MARRY MY HUSBAND BY SUNGSOJAK

74
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,770
熙妍，不好意思，我现在…
Hui-yeon, I'm sorry...

75
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,650
姜代理，怎么办？
Ms. Kang, what do we do?

76
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,730
刚才…
Just now,

77
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,990
我打电话给杨科长，因为她没有来
I called Ms. Yang because she didn't show up.

78
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,620
怎么办？杨科长得了胃癌
What do we do? Ms. Yang has stomach cancer.

79
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,630
所以说人生很困难
That's why life's hard.

80
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,130
世事难料
The future's a mystery.

81
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,680
小时候以为到了我这个年纪，就会什么事都明白
I thought I'd knew everything at this age when I was a kid.

82
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,190
不，你做得很好
No, you're doing great.

83
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:51,480
上次出事的时候，我看到你在公司内刊上写的专栏
I read your column in the company paper about that unfortunate incident.

84
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,940
原本员工们可能会动摇，而你回应得十分恰当
The staff could've been shaken. It was the appropriate response.

85
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,030
令我很引以为傲
I was proud.

86
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,660
感觉很像你帮我们员工擦屁股，也让我觉得有些抱歉
And I felt bad for asking you to clean up my employee's mess.

87
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,790
我们和一家人没有两样，我理应这么做
We're like family. It's the least I could do.

88
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,080
我爸总是跟我说
My father always told me

89
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,000
要我别忘了我是U&K的一分子
not to forget that U&K was my family.

90
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,550
我从来不曾认为，U&K的事是别人家的事
I've never thought differently.

91
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,510
康哲真是好福气
Gang-cheol's so lucky.

92
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,470
把孩子养育得很好
He's raised you well.

93
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,100
这样的话，我应该别跟志赫解除婚约
If you feel that way, I shouldn't have broken off the engagement.

94
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,810
虽然我们被长辈们逼着订婚
We got engaged because of our parents,

95
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,610
但是志赫非常冷淡
and Ji-hyuk was so apathetic.

96
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,820
我也不曾把他当作男人在喜欢
And I never liked him as a man.

97
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,030
所以他说要解除婚约时，我马上就同意了
That's why I agreed to break off the engagement.

98
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,330
不过他变帅了
But he's become charming.

99
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,830
是发生了什么事吗？
What's happened?

100
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,510
所以我打算在韩国待久一点
So I'm going to stay in Korea for quite a while.

101
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,970
可以吗？
Can I do that?

102
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,020
我也会常常来看你
I'll come and see you often.

103
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,560
我男友跟我闺蜜结婚会是什么感觉？
How would it feel to have my boyfriend marry my best friend?

104
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,440
新男友是富三代就弥补了吗？
Would I feel lucky since I got a new rich boyfriend?

105
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,370
很像连续剧，对吧？
It's like a soap, isn't it?

106
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,550
你为了载我去医院还买车
You bought a car to take me to the hospital.

107
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,930
你几年没上路了？
How long since you last drove?

108
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,640
检查结果如何呢？
How were the test results?

109
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,610
看来会很不容易
It's not going to be easy.

110
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,990
因为有很多人要手术，我得等很久
I have to wait long because the doctor's schedule is full.

111
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,820
不过最近医术进步很多…
Still, medicine's gotten so much better, so...

112
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,670
我不喜欢这样
I hate this.

113
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,220
跟你在一起．我就变得软弱
I get weak if I'm with you.

114
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,890
要是我自己一个人，我还可以忍
I can endure it if I'm alone.

115
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,570
因为你自己一个人会忍，我才会追着你跑
That's exactly why I follow you around.

116
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,870
身体如此不舒服，心理怎么可能会健康？
You can't be mentally healthy when you're in pain.

117
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,200
哭出来
Cry.

118
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,000
你还是抱着我哭吧
Don't hold it back. Just cry in my arms.

119
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,380
你必须哭出来
You have to cry.

120
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,890
你为什么要对我这么好？
Why are you so good to me?

121
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,140
是我害的
It's my fault.

122
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,440
我的命运落到科长身上了
My fate went to her.

123
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,440
但是为什么呢？
But why?

124
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,030
不是朴敏焕结婚就结束了呢？
This doesn't end with Min-hwan's marriage?

125
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,170
喂…
Hey.

126
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,750
不要再瞪我了
Stop glaring.

127
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,800
如果你这么讨厌这里，当初就该跟我妈说啊
You should've told my mom if you hated this place.

128
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,930
我怎么有办法说？你要居中协调啊
How can I tell her? You should've told her for me.

129
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:47,840
我为什么要？
Why would I?

130
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,510
我觉得我妈说得没错啊
I think my mom's right.

131
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,060
孕妇不该搭飞机，危险
It's dangerous for a pregnant woman to fly.

132
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,520
算了，好吧
All right. Fine.

133
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,270
重点不是蜜月旅行
The honeymoon isn't important.

134
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,700
敏焕哥
Min-hwan.

135
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,830
我们好好生活吧，好吗？你现在是我们家的一家之主了
Let's live a good life, okay? You're the head of our house now.

136
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,080
-宝宝也… -喂！
-The baby-- -Hey!

137
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,460
我为什么是一家之主？
Why am I the head?

138
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,210
姜智媛都没说过那种话
Ji-won never said that.

139
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,390
秀敏
Su-min.

140
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,850
你什么都好，但是好像不懂得婚姻
You're great and all, but you don't know marriage.

141
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,770
你听好罗
Listen carefully.

142
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:45,280
婚姻就是要各司其职才会运作良好
Marriages work well when each spouse does their own job.

143
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,440
什么？
What?

144
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,910
从印喜帖那时，你就开始抱怨东抱怨西
You didn't like the wedding invitation,

145
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,620
说我妈为什么要那样，为什么要来这种地方蜜月
didn't understand Mom, and hated the honeymoon destination,

146
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,330
对我有许多不满
You keep complaining to me.

147
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,040
因为你没有考虑我俩各自的感受
That's because you only think about yourself.

148
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,580
你看看我
Look at me.

149
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,000
我们结婚的时候，你的朋友来大闹
Did I say anything about your friends who caused a scene

150
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,170
我有对你说什么吗？
at our wedding?

151
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,130
你说我把喜帖传到公司，向我丢手机耶
You were upset and threw your phone at me.

152
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,260
喂！
Hey!

153
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,550
这两件事一样吗？
Are they the same thing?

154
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,260
我本来打算好好跟你说的
There's no use talking to you...

155
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:15,930
算了
Forget it.

156
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,270
唉唷
Damn it.

157
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,110
恭喜你
Congratulations

158
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,190
捡了我丢掉的垃圾
on picking up my trash.

159
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,660
不是的
No.

160
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,790
喂？尚宗，房子租出去了吗？
Hey, Sang-jong. Has it been rented out?

161
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,330
嗯，我刚才把钱汇过去了
Yeah, I just wired the money.

162
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,670
-谢谢 -慢走
-Thank you. -Bye.

163
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,750
好
Okay.

164
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,590
不过你跟你妈说，你被租屋诈骗可以吗？
But is it really okay to tell your mom you were scammed?

165
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,430
就算把你妈骗过去了
Even if she falls for it,

166
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,970
要你老婆住在婆家，她不会发飙吗？
won't your wife throw a fit about it?

167
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,010
我是我妈唯一的儿子，她难道会杀了我吗？
I'm her only son. She won't kill me.

168
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,810
还有我老婆又没有出钱，她能怎样？
And it wasn't my wife's money, so what can she do?

169
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,890
等等哦
Hold on.

170
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,690
刘尚宗，汇入三亿六千万韩元
YU SANG-JONG: 360 MILLION WON

171
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,990
好的，收到汇款了
Okay, I got the money!

172
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,570
债务也是资产的一部分，没关系
Debts are assets too. It'll be okay.

173
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,280
好，辛苦啦，再见
Okay, thanks. Bye!

174
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,950
吓死我了
Oh, my God!

175
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,040
你刚才是在说什么？
What were you talking about?

176
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,790
什么？
What?

177
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,170
你说什么？你听到了什么？
What do you mean? What did you hear?

178
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,300
我问你刚才在说什么
What did you mean?

179
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,800
你说什么又不是我出钱的
You said it wasn't my money!

180
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
哦，那个…
Well...

181
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,730
马上就要上市了，这样我们很为难
It'll be released soon. This puts us in a spot.

182
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,230
他们都看过草案了，怎么现在又说不行？
They even checked the draft. How could they back out now?

183
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,440
怎么可以在上市前这样？
You can't do this before the launch.

184
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,530
我要疯了
This is insane.

185
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,070
等等，请等一下！
Wait! Wait a second!

186
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,950
怎样？刘熙妍职员
What is it, Hui-yeon?

187
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,790
敬爱的杨科长
Are things not going well

188
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,830
与姜代理进行的专案不顺利吗？
with the project the respected Ms. Yang and Ms. Kang are working on?

189
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,260
-泰亨 -是
-Tae-hyeong. -Yes?

190
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,380
不需要紧抓着不会成功的专案不放
Don't hold onto a hopeless project.

191
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,640
我们去抽烟吧
Let's go smoke, okay?

192
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,480
好，走吧
Yeah, let's go.

193
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,390
认真工作，知道吗？
Keep working, okay?

194
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,560
1点45分
It's 1:45 p.m.

195
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:34,650
你休假三天又请了半天假，到现在才来啊？
You took three and a half days off, and you show up to work now?

196
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,700
你一副工作一丝不苟的样子
You act so meticulous at work,

197
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,910
其实很会精打细算利用个人时间哦
but you're more meticulous about your free time.

198
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,620
金代理
Mr. Kim?

199
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,210
嗯？姜代理
Yes, Ms. Kang?

200
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,630
你好像在上班时间，要去很远的地方抽烟
You must be going somewhere far to smoke during work hours.

201
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,960
杨科长不在
Since Ms. Yang is away,

202
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,920
你得一起帮忙快煮料理包的案子，可是你好像都还没看资料
you should help with the meal kit, but you don't review the data.

203
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,880
哦，那个哦？
Oh, that?

204
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,350
那个不用看也可以，所以我才不看
I don't need to review it. That's why.

205
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,720
泰亨，我们走
Tae-hyeong, let's go.

206
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,270
主厨们取消合约？为何突然要取消？
The chefs suddenly canceled their contracts? Why?

207
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,940
什么？
What?

208
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,650
李光民主厨怎么会这样？
What's with Chef Lee Gwang-min?

209
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,950
就要上市了，怎么会说要延期？
We're about to release. Why postpone?

210
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,330
他说产品不符自己的质量标准，老实说，现在才说很离谱
He says the product's of poor quality. Honestly, it's ridiculous.

211
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,580
我觉得好像有什么问题，金景旭…
I think something's up. Kim Gyeong-uk...

212
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,590
我是说金代理，他不是满会搞政治的吗？
I mean, Mr. Kim is good at politics.

213
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,760
他也有人脉，应该是他在背后搞鬼
He has connections. I think he did something.

214
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,680
珠兰科长怎么样了？
What about Ms. Yang?

215
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,180
我送她回家了，她应该需要请假一段时间
I took her home. I think she should take time off.

216
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:46,890
请假…
Time off...

217
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,960
虽然现在不是我该生气的时候
It's not time for me to be angry.

218
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,670
但是你都在躲我，不听我说话
But you won't hear me out,

219
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,380
让我得在公司找你过来
and you made me call you like this at work.

220
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,590
对不起
I'm sorry.

221
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,880
我需要时间整理思绪
I needed time to sort my thoughts.

222
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,850
我觉得好混乱
I was confused.

223
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,190
在我得到第二次机会后
I was given another chance,

224
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,780
我以为我只要让朴敏焕，和郑秀敏结婚就可以了
and I thought I just had to get Min-hwan and Su-min to marry.

225
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,280
而你对我来说
While I was doing it, you were...

226
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,280
就像是其中的一项礼物
like a gift to me.

227
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,510
你有听说过我结婚了吗？
Did you ever hear that I was married?

228
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,520
我和她本来就会在几年后断绝关系，我只是把它提前而已
It gets sorted out in a few years anyway. I just sped up the process.

229
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,990
宥拉是我们家族间，从小就认识的朋友
Yu-ra's a family friend since we were kids.

230
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,570
虽然我们之间完全没有爱情，但是我认为可以跟她结婚
I thought I could marry her without any feelings.

231
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,490
但是并非如此，所以我结束掉这段关系
But that wasn't the case, so I ended it with her.

232
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,500
没有爱情也可以结婚？
You can marry someone without any feelings?

233
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,920
那种关系的确存在
Such relationships exist.

234
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,550
其实…
To be honest,

235
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,810
在看到你的丧礼之前，我并不了解自己的心意
I didn't know how I felt about you before your funeral.

236
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,730
所以我一回来就结束掉这段关系了
So I ended it when I got back.

237
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,730
就只有这样而已
That's all.

238
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,410
我不知道
I don't know.

239
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,710
现在你说的话，我听起来都像是在辩解
Everything you say just sounds like an excuse to me.

240
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,080
智媛
Ji-won.

241
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,000
我不是要责怪你
I'm not trying to blame you.

242
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,550
只是…
I just...

243
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,840
我领悟到我做了一个…
I realized I dreamed of something

244
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,300
太幸福的梦
too happy.

245
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,560
之前在湖边
At the lake,

246
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,060
你跟我说
you told me

247
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,190
有家庭是好事
having a family was a good thing.

248
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,990
你知道没有家人是什么意思吗？
Do you know what it means to not have a family?

249
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,870
我曾经想要组成家庭
I wanted to start a family.

250
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,870
对，我错了
Yes, I made a mistake.

251
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,130
我妈妈…
My mom...

252
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,010
在我14岁的时候离家出走
left home when I was 14.

253
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,270
她说她找到了真爱
She found love.

254
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,560
她说她为了我忍了14年，可是…
She endured for 14 years because of me, but...

255
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,400
不管是忍了几年
No matter how long you endure,

256
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,660
留下来的人
those left behind...

257
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,120
都会受伤
get hurt.

258
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,800
我认为不论是何种关系，一旦开始
No matter what the relationship is, once it's started,

259
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,430
就绝不可以不经两人同意
I don't think it's right for one person

260
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,020
单方面结束
to end it one-sidedly.

261
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:23,500
我把美国的李贤知教授，请到我们公司旗下的癌症中心了
I recruited Dr. Lee to our cancer ward from the States.

262
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,500
她是胃癌专家
She specializes in stomach cancer.

263
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,460
唯一医院，专科医师，李贤知
YUIL MEDICAL CENTER DR. LEE HYEON-JI

264
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,680
我花了半年的工夫在这上面
I spent half a year on this.

265
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,550
杨珠兰科长
Ms. Yang will receive

266
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,180
很快就可以动手术了
surgery as soon as possible.

267
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:16,970
喂？
Hello?

268
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:29,030
我最讨厌陈腔滥调，不过看来我也是无可奈何
I hate clichés like this, but I guess I can't help it.

269
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,450
感谢你来
Thanks for coming.

270
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,870
我来是因为我想应该要跟你谈谈才对
I thought it was only right to talk to you, so I came.

271
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,090
不过你不用太在意…
There's nothing to worry--

272
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,710
这应该不是由你来决定吧？
That's not for you to decide, is it?

273
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,840
我有点在意呢
It bothers me.

274
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,720
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

275
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,350
我不知道他订婚了
I didn't know he was engaged.

276
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,560
我也打算不要再跟他见面了
And I'm going to stop seeing him.

277
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:14,610
人生在世，也是有可能会不小心砍人
In life, there are times when you accidently stab someone.

278
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,620
不过并不会因为你砍了之后说，你不晓得，你不会再砍人了
But saying you didn't know and will never do it again

279
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,330
事情就结束了
doesn't cut it.

280
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,790
你要我怎么做呢？
What do you want me to do?

281
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,210
我喜欢他
I liked him.

282
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,720
我本来没有，后来却喜欢上他了
I didn't mean to, but I fell for him.

283
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,140
所以我暂时做了个幸福的梦
So I had a happy dream for a moment.

284
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,850
但是在得知新的事实之后
However, after I found out about you,

285
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,730
我就跟他结束了
I ended it.

286
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,360
我并不了解自己的心意
I didn't know how I felt...

287
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,360
所以我一回来就结束掉这段关系了
So I ended it when I got back.

288
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,740
真是有意思的一段话，你喜欢上他？
That's interesting that you fell for him.

289
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,540
你不是有交往七年的男友吗？
Didn't you have a boyfriend of seven years?

290
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,710
这样可以说是跟夫妻没两样吧？
You were practically married to him.

291
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,840
你为什么会突然喜欢上公司上司呢？
Why did you suddenly fall for your boss?

292
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,550
你都进公司七年了
After seven years of working.

293
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,390
因为志赫是U&K的继承人？
Because Ji-hyuk's U&K's successor?

294
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,730
-并不是这样 -那你不知道这件事吗？
-It's not like that. -Then you didn't know?

295
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,110
我爷爷知道
My grandfather knew...

296
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,320
晋升为会长…
...promoted to CEO...

297
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,780
我只是…
...that I just

298
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,660
之前没有想要的东西
didn't want anything.

299
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,160
从我一出生，我就被决定要做什么了
My life was decided since birth.

300
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,870
所以我只为了U&K努力和学习
So I studied and worked only for U&K.

301
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,210
看来你知道嘛
So you knew.

302
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,300
我要说的话都说完了
I think we're done.

303
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,590
那我告辞了
If you'll excuse me.

304
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,100
我最讨厌的就是
What I hate the most

305
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,190
像你这种人
are people like you.

306
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,150
无名小卒，却很高傲
Self-righteous nobodies.

307
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,360
贪得无厌，却又否认
You were greedy but say you weren't.

308
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,280
明知道一切，却在装蒜
You know everything but pretend you don't.

309
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,410
你又没有蠢到不知道
You're not dumb enough to not know

310
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,540
他可以改变你的人生
he could change your life.

311
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,510
真是老套
How predictable.

312
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,970
我讨厌的人也正是你这种人
You're the type of person I hate as well.

313
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,270
你以为世界上的人都跟你一样吗？
Do you think everyone's like you?

314
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:58,780
你以为我跟你一样认为，刘志赫是U&K的继承人很重要吗？
You think it was important to me that he was U&K's successor?

315
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,780
对我来说，一点都不重要
It didn't matter to me at all.

316
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,370
因为我的人生
Because...

317
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,670
没有刘志赫就改变了
my life changed without him.

318
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:47,410
奥森迪克

319
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,310
我得打起精神
I need to get a grip.

320
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,660
癌症的命运落到珠兰科长身上
If the cancer went to Yang Ju-ran...

321
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,710
该不会…
Wait...

322
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,170
现在事情会怎么发展呢？
What happens now?

323
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,590
-去开门 -好
-Open the door. -Okay.

324
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,270
妍芝，跟妈妈说再见
Say bye to your mom.

325
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:57,190
说再见，拜拜
Say bye. Bye.

326
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,810
公主大人
Princess.

327
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,230
你不用再到这里来了，在家好好休息
Don't come here anymore. Rest at home.

328
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,690
好吗？快回去了
Okay? Go on now.

329
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,280
我是珠兰的丈夫，李在元
I'm Lee Jae-won, Ju-ran's husband.

330
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,240
我得了胃癌
I have stomach cancer.

331
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,960
我现在是在做什么？
What am I doing right now?

332
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,340
我们走吧
Let's go.

333
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,340
冷吗？
Are you cold?

334
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,310
你先进去
Go inside first.

335
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,900
-怎样？-你的嘴唇
-What? -Your lips.

336
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,190
丈夫…
Husband...

337
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,070
丈夫…
Husband...

338
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,280
如果命运不是和朴敏焕结婚有关，而是跟丈夫有关呢？
What if the fate has something to do with the husband, not marrying Min-hwan?

339
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,540
我去见过李贤知教授了
I went to see Dr. Lee.

340
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,710
安排好治疗日程了，手术时间也很快就能安排好
I made treatment appointments. I can get surgery soon too.

341
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,460
虽然不晓得为什么，但是她说一直都有空出一个位子
I don't know why, but she always left one spot open.

342
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,260
她是胃癌专家
She specializes in stomach cancer.

343
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,050
我花了半年的工夫在这上面
I spent half a year on this.

344
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,810
什么？租屋诈骗？
What? A scam?

345
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,780
-我要去把那个中介的头发给拔光 -不要这样，妈
-I'll kill that real estate agent. -No, Mom!

346
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,240
我已经解决了，我跟她讲好了，妈
I took care of it. I spoke to her, Mom.

347
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,910
什么解决了？
What did you take care of?

348
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:35,200
解决好了，你还会跪在这里吗？
Why are you on your knees here if you did?

349
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,410
仔细想来，郑秀敏…
When I think about it, Su-min is

350
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,460
个性和我不一样
different from me.

351
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,170
对
Right.

352
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,710
其实算起来，这都是你的错
If you think about it, this is all your fault.

353
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,550
男人懂什么？
What does a man know?

354
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,340
所以说要娶个好女人进家门才行
This is why a good woman needs to join the family.

355
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,800
我不该决定得这么仓促
I shouldn't have been so hasty.

356
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,140
难怪我就觉得哪里不对劲
I felt strangely hesitant about this.

357
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,480
很不对劲
It felt wrong.

358
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,190
即使她和我一样跟朴敏焕结婚了
Although she married Min-hwan like me,

359
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:10,030
但是她会像我一样什么都不敢说，只被欺负吗？
would she just let them walk all over her like me?

360
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,870
妈
Mother.

361
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,750
你应该把话讲清楚
You should get the facts straight.

362
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,960
是你决定好房子，拿钱要敏焕哥签约
You picked the house and gave him money to sign the contract.

363
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,960
为什么要怪我呢？
Why are you blaming me?

364
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:37,680
当初说要买房子，结果却是租房，我都忍下来了
I mean, after I let it slide that he was renting a house, not buying one.

365
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,720
我的老天啊
Goodness.

366
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:44,440
看看你这个样子，因为你怀孕，我都让着你
Listen to you! I've been nice to you since you're pregnant.

367
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,770
你只有人嫁进来，什么都没有，你说你忍？
You didn't bring anything, but what? You let it slide?

368
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,070
我有钱啊，是他要我人嫁进来就好
I have money. He said to not bring anything.

369
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,740
我看他是因为想住在这里…
I guess it's because he wanted to move in here...

370
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,370
喂…
Hey.

371
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,160
你是约聘人员，怎么会有钱？
You're a contract employee. What money?

372
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,620
什么？约聘？你不是说她生完孩子就会复职吗？
Contract employee? You said she'd work after giving birth.

373
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,210
她会复职
She will.

374
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,920
她是很有能力的约聘人员
She's a competent contract employee.

375
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,210
我有买股票
I did stocks.

376
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,590
-什么？-我赚了不少
-What? -I earned quite a lot.

377
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,840
什么？
What?

378
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,100
变成现在这样，我一点都不开心
I'm not excited about this at all either.

379
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:25,770
而且老实说，结婚的一切过程都是我在配合
And let's be honest. I did everything you wanted for the wedding.

380
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,980
还有在蜜月旅行的时候，我得知他债…
And during the honeymoon, I learned of his--

381
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,520
嘘！
Hush!

382
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:40,950
总之请你不要再打他了
In any case, stop hitting Min-hwan.

383
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,630
他是我们家的一家之主，也是将军的爸爸
He's the head of the household and our baby's dad.

384
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,290
不然要我带着将军离开吗？
Or shall I just leave with our baby general?

385
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,130
将军
Our baby...

386
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,640
在这里
Here it is.

387
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,430
结婚还真是不赖
Marriage isn't all that bad, right?

388
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,020
有人站在我这边
I gained an ally.

389
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,400
不用担心
Don't worry.

390
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,900
虽然我妈讲话很狠
My mom can be harsh,

391
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,110
但是她其实很潇洒
but she's cool.

392
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,740
等我们的将军一出生，她肯定马上买房子给我们
Once our baby's born, she'll buy us a house!

393
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,660
依她的个性，只要一听到婴儿哭声
Once she hears the baby crying,

394
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,160
她就受不了啦
she can't withstand it.

395
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,280
没有小孩
There's no baby.

396
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,040
什么？没有什么？你说什么？
What? No what? What did you say?

397
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,290
吓我一跳
My God!

398
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,800
我要出门去
I'll be home later.

399
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,050
在我回来前，把家里全都打扫干净
Make sure the house is clean.

400
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,970
我的命好苦啊
I can't believe this is my life.

401
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,430
我这把年纪还要多喂养两口子
I have two more mouths to feed at my age.

402
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,100
唉唷，真是讨厌鬼
God, such nuisances.

403
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,270
唉唷，可恶
Darn it...

404
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,570
你刚才说什么？
What do you mean?

405
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,780
没有什么？
There's no what?

406
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,410
我…
I...

407
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,790
流产了
had a miscarriage.

408
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,800
从你朝我丢手机的那天起
When you threw your phone at me,

409
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,550
我就开始肚子痛
my stomach started to hurt.

410
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,220
我很害怕
I was so scared.

411
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,890
我也不知道该怎么办才好
And I didn't know what to do.

412
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,520
我也怕妈会失望，所以不敢说
I didn't want to disappoint your mom, so I couldn't tell you.

413
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,880
我们的将军
Our baby.

414
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,060
不过…
By the way...

415
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,360
你在蜜月旅行的时候说，因为将军的关系，所以你想要吃韩牛
You said you craved beef during our honeymoon because of the baby.

416
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,990
可是那时候不是已经没有宝宝了吗？
But didn't you not have the baby then?

417
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,290
你不也是没房子，却说有吗？
Didn't you say you had a house when you didn't too?

418
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,290
什么？
What?

419
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,750
我们的将军…
But our baby...

420
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,210
恩人！
Ms. Kang!

421
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,710
吓我一跳
You scared me.

422
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,290
你刚才不是下班了吗？
Didn't you leave earlier?

423
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,380
因为我想到你啦
I thought of you.

424
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,930
蛋白质鲑鱼片

425
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,850
自从圣诞节过后，我就很努力要吃得健康一点
Since last Christmas, I've been trying to eat healthy.

426
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:38,810
这个蛋白质含量很高，吃起来又脆口，这是我最近的最爱
This is rich in protein and so crunchy! It's my favorite lately.

427
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,730
这样吗？
Really?

428
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,320
很好吃
It is good.

429
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,950
不过这个感觉要…
But for some reason...

430
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,910
是不是想到了什么啊？
Does it remind you of something?

431
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,910
你就是想到这个吧？
It's probably this!

432
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,750
太完美了，我正好非常需要这个
It's perfect. I desperately needed it.

433
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:10,220
其实这些全都是我哥买的，他说你应该需要
To tell the truth, my brother bought all this saying you'd need it.

434
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,180
什么？
What?

435
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:32,030
现在刘志赫很不像平常的他，在那边踌躇，看人脸色
He's been hesitant and walking on eggshells lately.

436
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,330
是因为宥拉姐的关系吗？
Is it because of Yu-ra?

437
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,840
嗯，那个…
Yes, well...

438
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,050
她最近很常到爷爷家去
She's been seeing my grandpa.

439
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,340
不过恩人
But Ms. Kang,

440
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,430
不论他解除婚约是为了你
whether he called off the engagement

441
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:54,060
还是他终于清醒了，我都非常赞成
for you or because he came to his senses, I'm totally in favor.

442
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,890
因为我哥订婚，其实是为了我
To tell you the truth, he got engaged because of me.

443
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,770
他跟我说要帮我组成，像土地一样踏实的家庭
He said we should make a family firm enough to stand on like land.

444
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,490
还有我哥本来对恋爱完全不感兴趣
Also, my brother had no interest in dating.

445
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:17,410
该说他根本没有感情吗？他全都压抑住，不表现出来
He just seemed emotionless. He always suppressed his emotions.

446
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,830
他又不是什么机器人
Like some robot.

447
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,290
所以说最近他很不一样
He's so different lately.

448
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,630
他以前不是这样的
He wasn't like this.

449
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,380
爷爷，天气很凉
The weather is chilly.

450
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,760
-请别出来 -没关系
-Go inside. -I'm okay.

451
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,010
-哦 -我回来了
-Hey. -I'm back.

452
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,680
现在由我来送宥拉吧
I'll escort Yu-ra now.

453
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,100
好，你走吧
Yeah, okay. Bye.

454
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,310
-好，我下次再来 -好，常来玩
-I'll come again. -Okay, come often.

455
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,480
-好 -嗯
-Okay. -Bye.

456
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,820
你这是在做什么？
What are you doing?

457
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,360
我一直很想跟你说，你变了好多
I've been meaning to tell you this. You've changed a lot.

458
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,530
不只是拿掉眼镜，变得会穿衣服而已
You didn't just change your appearance.

459
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,870
你变得像个男人
You're a man now.

460
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,580
我是来看爷爷的
I came to see your grandfather.

461
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,750
不管你和我的关系如何，我和爷爷的关系不会变
No matter how our relationship is, he and I are still close.

462
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,340
这还真是神奇
That's interesting.

463
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,630
你突然就和爷爷关系变好了
I think you two suddenly got closer.

464
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,800
你1月8日回到韩国，10日、11日、13日都来
You came to Korea on the 8th and visited him three times.

465
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,190
这是订婚五年来，不曾有过的事
It never happened in our five-year engagement.

466
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,190
就是这样
Things like this.

467
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:28,360
对于世事完全不不关心，只在工作的少爷
You didn't care about anything but work.

468
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,490
变得很缜密
You're so detailed now.

469
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,570
是因为那个女人吗？
Is it because of her?

470
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:36,200
你不是同意解除婚约了吗？
Didn't you accept my decision?

471
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,410
那是在我听说你有女人之前
That was before I knew there was a woman.

472
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:45,250
我很讨厌有人…
I don't like anyone touching

473
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,250
动我的东西
what's mine.

474
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,420
还有吴宥拉看起来很正常
Also, Yu-ra may seem normal,

475
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,680
但却是个世上绝无仅有的疯子
but she's a total whack job.

476
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,680
2017年
2017

477
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,510
请你出去
Get out.

478
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,190
你要这样到什么时候？
How much longer will you do this?

479
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,190
你知道她跟我没有任何关系
You know we're not anything.

480
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,660
是她的错，她为何要贪图我的东西？
It's her fault. Why covet what's mine?

481
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:22,410
我讨厌有人动我的东西
I don't like anyone touching what's mine.

482
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,460
别说了
Enough.

483
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
恩人
Ms. Kang.

484
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,130
我知道刘部长是个好人
I know Mr. Yu's a good person.

485
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,630
全都是我的问题
This is my fault.

486
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,550
所以我们别再谈这件事了
So let's stop talking about this.

487
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,600
恩人
Ms. Kang.

488
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,480
其实我不是我哥的亲妹妹
I'm not actually his real little sister.

489
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,690
我和我妈让我哥很受伤
My brother was hurt badly because of me and my mom.

490
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,980
所以…
So...

491
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:58,200
他是绝对不可能会出轨
He could never cheat on anyone.

492
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,590
再怎么看
I realized it again.

493
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,510
我都觉得宥拉是个好孩子
Yu-ra's a great kid.

494
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,850
我们都解除婚约了，你不会认为她是抱着好意来看你吧？
You don't think she visits you with good intentions, do you?

495
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,220
所以我才喜欢她
That's why I like her.

496
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,730
她有足以当U&K女主人的野心
She's greedy enough to be lady of the U&K household.

497
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:29,730
我喜欢对自己的东西执着的人
I like those who obsess over what's theirs.

498
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,020
男人要遇到对的女人才行
A man should meet the right woman.

499
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:35,440
要守护家庭，必须有狠劲
A woman needs spite to protect her family.

500
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,280
没错，你说过这句话
You're right. You said that.

501
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,660
所以我才认为没问题
That's why I thought it'd be okay.

502
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,040
爷爷
Grandfather.

503
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,920
当我妈还活着的时候
When my mother was alive,

504
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:57,800
你对爸和车女士交往有什么看法？
how did you feel about Father meeting Ms. Cha?

505
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,600
车女士比我妈还有野心
Did Ms. Cha have more spite and greed

506
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,350
还有狠劲吗？
than my mother?

507
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,150
我喜欢车女士
I liked Ms. Cha.

508
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,450
比起生病的妈妈，我小时候更依赖车女士
Mother was always sick, and I relied more on her as a kid.

509
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:32,420
在我得知熙妍与我的年纪，只差了五岁之前是如此
Before I learned that Hui-yeon was only five years younger than me.

510
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,180
在我得知这个事实之后，我觉得熙妍很可怜
After learning that, I felt bad for Hui-yeon.

511
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,600
所以在我和宥拉订婚之后
So after I got engaged to Yu-ra,

512
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:55,820
即使我觉得实在无法忍受，却还是用力忍住了
I held it in even when I couldn't stand it.

513
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:02,110
因为我决心不要成为像爸一样的人
I vowed that I'd never become like my father.

514
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,700
可是后来我得知这样并不可行
But I only learned things didn't work that way

515
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,750
我看到了最后的结局
when I saw the end.

516
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,380
可是…
But...

517
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:31,520
我应该要怎么做才对？爷爷
What should I have done, Grandfather?

518
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,650
太难了
It's too hard.

519
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:52,540
这个人是劈腿女友闺蜜的混蛋
So he's the bastard that cheated on his girlfriend with her bestie.

520
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,330
而这个人是跟闺蜜男友结婚的婊子
And she's the bitch that married her bestie's boyfriend.

521
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,670
因为他们不晓得刘志赫是什么人？
Because they don't know who Ji-hyuk is?

522
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,050
对
Yes.

523
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,670
两个傻子
Those fools.

524
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,680
要不要试看看告诉他们会怎么样呢？
What if they find out?

525
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,460
今天要洗衣服，不只要把洗衣篮里的衣服拿去洗
There's laundry to do today. Don't just do what's in the basket.

526
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,830
还要整理衣柜，把过去的衣服都拿出来洗
Organize the closet and wash the old clothes too.

527
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:40,210
我自己一个人吗？妈要去哪里？
By myself? Where are you going?

528
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,300
我是妇女中心的干事啊，我有午餐聚会
I'm the secretary of the Women's Center. I have a luncheon.

529
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,630
哦，对了
Oh, right.

530
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,100
只有你自己在家，你就边听边慢慢做家事
Since you're alone, take it easy while listening to it.

531
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,350
你还真是享受
Isn't your life so sweet?

532
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,810
有够好福气
You're so lucky.

533
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:05,820
奶奶出门去罗，我们的宝贝将军
Your grandmother will be back later, our little general.

534
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,800
可恶
Darn it...

535
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,350
真是的
Seriously?

536
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,640
这样对吗？
Is this really right?

537
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,520
婚姻是这样吗？
Is this married life?

538
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:01,580
这是什么？
What's this?

539
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:05,260
U&K股东名单
U&K STOCKHOLDER'S LIST

540
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,970
刘志赫…
Yu Ji-hyuk...

541
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:12,970
刘志赫，刘熙妍
YU JI-HYUK YU HUI-YEON

542
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:16,680
这是什么？
What is this?

543
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,100
那该不会…
No way.

544
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,150
她真的…
Did she really...

545
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:23,820
秀敏
Su-min.

546
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:28,490
我有垃圾要丢，你可以帮我丢吗？
I have some trash to throw away. Will you do it for me?

547
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,450
恭喜你
Congratulations

548
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:35,330
捡了我丢掉的垃圾
on picking up my trash.

549
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,830
她把朴敏焕丢给我
She dumps Min-hwan on me

550
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:45,250
换成有钱的男人？
and goes for a rich man?

551
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,220
不是，不可能
No way. No.

552
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,800
是我把他抢了过来
I stole him.

553
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,810
是我抢的！
I did it.

554
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,850
是我！
I did!

555
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:02,900
不！
No!

556
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,830
这…
Why is...

557
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,210
家里怎么会这个样子？
the house like this?

558
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,760
你为什么要问我？
Why are you asking me?

559
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,130
你老婆把家里都砸了，把门锁起来都不出来
Your wife did this to the house, locked the door, and won't come out.

560
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,490
什么？
What?

561
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:01,370
什么？
What?

562
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,380
可恶
Damn it...

563
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,960
那个只有个子长得高的傻大个，只不过是投对胎而已
All that tall jerk did was be born into the right family.

564
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:15,720
我爸妈为什么都不努力讨生活？有够糟糕
What the hell have my parents done their entire lives?

565
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:22,430
我这个人只要有支援就可以展翅高飞
I can fly much higher with a little support.

566
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:27,110
你现在是在羡慕刘志赫吗？
Are you jealous of Yu Ji-hyuk right now?

567
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:32,400
姜智媛把你丢给了我
Kang Ji-won dumped you on me.

568
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,240
所以事到如今，你是想怎样？
So what will you do about it now?

569
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:44,500
我不只是捡了个垃圾
So it wasn't just trash.

570
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,580
还是捡到了一个没有自尊心的垃圾
I picked up trash with no pride.

571
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,500
你真的是…
You little...

572
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:51,630
不仅没有自尊心，连脑都没有
Not just that. You're stupid too.

573
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,550
你的债还完了吗？
Have you paid off your debt?

574
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:56,430
我妈会听到，别再提那该死的债
My mom can hear you. Stop bring that up.

575
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,060
还剩多少？一亿韩元够吗？
How much is left? Is 100 million won enough?

576
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,640
什么？
What?

577
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,400
我们应该要得到赔偿
We deserve compensation.

578
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,690
为什么都是姜智媛得到好东西？
Why does Ji-won get all the good stuff?

579
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:15,950
你脑子里是装了什么？
Are you out of your mind?

580
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,990
喂，你想她会给吗？
Do you think she'll give it to you?

581
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,120
我得让她给
I'll make her.

582
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,960
我知道她的一切
I know everything about her.

583
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:28,920
甚至连她不知道的事也知道
Even what she doesn't know.

584
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:11,380
赢过我开心吗？
Happy you beat me?

585
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,170
我们是彼此的另一半啊，我们的关系不能这样就结束
You're my other half. We can't just end things like this.

586
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,450
智媛，打不通你的电话
Ji-won, I can't reach you.

587
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:46,870
你过得好吗？
How have you been?

588
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,500
我偶然听到你的消息
I heard about you by chance.

589
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,580
我是妈妈
It's your mom.

590
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,730
智媛
Ji-won.

591
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,120
你长大好多
You grew up so well.

592
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,700
长得真好
You really did.

593
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,750
妈依旧很美
You're still beautiful.

594
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:39,090
你记得你是我们那里最漂亮的吗？
You were always the prettiest in our neighborhood.

595
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,880
我现在已经老了
I'm all old now.

596
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:46,470
岁月不饶人啊
Time can't help but pass.

597
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:51,100
你也很美
You're pretty too.

598
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:53,520
幸好你遗传到我
I'm glad you take after me.

599
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,150
虽然现在说这个也没什么意义了
I know it's in the past now,

600
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:06,070
但是我没有很喜欢你爸爸
but I never liked your father much.

601
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,950
以前我年纪小又过得辛苦
I was young and struggling,

602
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:11,450
而他很喜欢我
and he liked me so much.

603
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,460
我以为我可以喜欢上他
I thought I could like him too.

604
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:18,250
以前大家都是这么结婚的
Everyone got married like that back then.

605
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,510
所以我也不疼你
So I didn't like you either.

606
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:24,010
我当然疼你
I mean, I did.

607
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,890
你是我的孩子，怎么会不疼？
You're my kid. How could I not?

608
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,350
不过很抱歉
Anyway, I'm sorry.

609
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:35,770
当时我不懂事
I was immature.

610
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,820
我还没长大就生下你了
I had you when I wasn't ready.

611
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:43,190
但是…
Still...

612
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,160
我还是很想你
I missed you so much.

613
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,620
那你为何都没有来看过我呢？
Then why didn't you come to see me?

614
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:58,500
爸就算了，但是你可以来看我啊
Forget my dad, you could've come to see me.

615
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,340
我有去找你
I did.

616
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,800
他不让我见你
He didn't let me.

617
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,720
你不知道你爸有多么爱护你吗？
Do you not know how much he cared about you?

618
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,970
我知道他对你来说是个好爸爸
I know he was a good father to you.

619
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,310
他很善良
He was sweet.

620
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,730
可是他固执得不得了
But he was so stubborn.

621
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:18,690
并不是细腻的人
He wasn't considerate.

622
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:22,980
我也很难过
It was hard for me too.

623
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:27,530
我现在会来找你，也是听说你爸死了
I was only able to come to see you after I heard your father had passed.

624
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,490
才鼓起勇气来的
It took me courage.

625
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:35,120
爸竭尽全力把我养大
My father tried his best to raise me.

626
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:41,750
当然，失去你的空缺还是很大
Of course, your absence was big for me.

627
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:44,710
尤其是对青春期的少女来说
I was just an adolescent girl.

628
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,680
所以我才会眷恋于错误的人
That's why I became attached to the wrong people.

629
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:56,430
也不懂得怎么表达情感
I didn't know how to express myself.

630
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:57,940
不
No...

631
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:02,270
其实我不了解我自己的情感
Actually, I didn't know how I felt.

632
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:06,610
因为没有人教过我
There was no one to teach me.

633
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,450
对不起
I'm sorry.

634
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:16,040
全都是我的错
It's all my fault.

635
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:20,920
是我不好，让你受苦
I was a bad mother, and it made you suffer.

636
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:23,290
我该怎么补偿你好呢？
How can I make it up to you?

637
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,210
我该如何补偿？
How can I do it?

638
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,350
请问你明天要做什么？
What are you doing tomorrow?

639
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,560
什么？
What?

640
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:47,940
如果你有空，要不要跟我约会呢？
If you're free, would you like to spend time with me?

641
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,340
你昨天平安回家了吗？
Did you get home okay yesterday?

642
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,720
睡得好吗？
Did you sleep well?

643
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:12,640
嗯，妈，你呢？
Yes, what about you, Mom?

644
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:15,180
也许是跟你见了面
Is it because I met you?

645
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,930
我整夜都睡不着
I couldn't sleep at all.

646
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:22,480
你有想吃什么吗？
Are you craving anything?

647
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:25,980
猪肉汤饭
Pork gukbap.

648
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:31,400
你会用这个吗？
Do you know how to do this?

649
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:32,990
我第一次来这种地方
This is my first time.

650
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:34,070
这个好看
This is pretty.

651
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,450
要看哪里？
Where do we look?

652
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:36,700
这里吗？
Here?

653
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,740
我爱你，快乐的日子
I LOVE YOU

654
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,210
跟妈妈一起，快乐的日子
WITH MOM

655
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,960
爱心？
Heart?

656
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,000
一、二、三
One, two, three.

657
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:50,800
快乐的一天，可爱女孩

658
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,510
唉唷，好好看哦
This is so pretty.

659
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,800
釜山没有这种东西，适合我吗？
They don't sell this in Busan. Does it look good on me?

660
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,180
请给我们这个
We'll take this.

661
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:01,060
唉唷，不要啦
No, don't!

662
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,020
不用了
That's okay.

663
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,440
这很贵耶
This is so expensive.

664
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,190
请拿这个给我们看
Show us this.

665
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,480
那太贵了啦
It's too expensive.

666
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:11,740
我还是戴看看吗？
Still, shall I just try it on?

667
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,610
-可以比看看吧？-可以
-Can we? -Yes.

668
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:17,070
如何？
How does it look?

669
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,450
-好看吗？-很适合你
-It looks good. -Does it?

670
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,790
我正好想要一件这种外套
I wanted to buy something like this.

671
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:27,750
我朋友都在炫耀女儿买给她们
My friends brag about their daughters so much.

672
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,840
如何？
How does it look?

673
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:31,050
感觉很适合你
It looks good on you.

674
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,220
要不要也穿看看黑色的？
What about the black?

675
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,930
尺寸是…
The size is...

676
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,180
这么开心吗？
Are you that happy?

677
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:43,390
当然开心
Of course.

678
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,020
我有个好女儿才能这么享受
I'm so lucky to have a daughter like you.

679
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:50,610
跟有钱人交往的女儿，果然出手很大方…
Since you date a rich man, you know how to spend...

680
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,040
我就知道
I knew it.

681
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:12,090
我上了好大学，进了大公司，你都不曾联络过我
Even when I went to a good college and joined a big company, you never called.

682
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:16,130
智媛，我刚才的意思是…
Ji-won, what I just said--

683
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,340
如果你说的是刘志赫
If you're talking about Yu Ji-hyuk,

684
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:21,010
我们没在一起了，我们分手了
I'm not seeing him. We broke up.

685
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,350
什么？
What?

686
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,730
到底为什么？
Why on earth?

687
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,150
你是在骗我吧？
Are you lying to me right now?

688
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:35,860
你为什么要这样？
Why did you do it?

689
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:41,160
你问我为什么？
Why?

690
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:45,160
那你为什么要离家出走？
Then why did you run away?

691
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:52,340
我本来还不确定
I didn't want to believe it.

692
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,710
唉唷，这是谁啊？
Goodness. Look who called.

693
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,220
你过得好吗？
How have you been?

694
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,840
-真的好久不见 -听说你为钱所困
-It's been so long-- -I heard you needed money.

695
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:06,230
你全都知道吗?
Did you know everything?

696
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:11,150
那这些是什么？
Then what is this?

697
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:14,230
我想要尝试看看
I wanted to try it once.

698
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,820
跟妈妈约会
A date with my mom.

699
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:25,040
当个被爱的女儿，尽孝道
A loved daughter, a good daughter.

700
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,540
做一对幸福的母女
Happy mother and daughter.

701
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:34,250
我想要尝试一次看看
I wanted to try it once.

702
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,590
不过现在已经试过，那就够了
Now I've done it.

703
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,220
回去的路上小心
Have a safe trip back.

704
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,680
那你有钱吗？
Do you have any money?

705
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:51,900
你从好大学毕业，在大公司上班
A good college and a good company.

706
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,730
应该有个一亿韩元吧？
Do you have 100 million won?

707
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:56,650
我不会再来找你
I'll never come see you again.

708
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,200
你以为我想来找被我抛弃的女儿吗？
Do you think I wanted to?

709
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:04,280
你应该要谅解我啊，除了你，谁还会谅解妈妈？
You should understand me! Who else would understand your mom?

710
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:13,040
我没有钱，我也没有妈妈
I have no money. I have no mother either.

711
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:17,670
我以前没有，往后也都不会有
I didn't before, and I won't in the future.

712
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,890
你不也选择了当女人，而不是当妈妈吗？
You chose to live as a woman instead of a mother,

713
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,930
所以请你往后也继续安静地过日子
so live the rest of your life that way quietly.

714
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,770
不要贪心
Don't be greedy.

715
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:47,580
坏丫头
You wench.

716
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,640
以他们那个水平，当然是过那种生活
No wonder they live like that.

717
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:15,900
难道不由我亲自出面，就做不好事情吗？
Why do I always have to do it myself to get things done properly?

718
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:19,150
我说我要去参加丧礼
I said I was going to a funeral.

719
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,030
没有人死啦
No one died!

720
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:27,120
我待不住家里，你也结婚看看，你现在可以出来吧？
I can't stay at home. Try a married life. Can you come out now?

721
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,330
唉唷
Damn it...

722
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:36,460
搞什么？
What was that?

723
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:45,930
嗯？
What?

724
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,810
朴敏焕先生？
Park Min-hwan?

725
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,060
对
Yes?

726
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:56,460
我把他摔过去了
I flipped him!

727
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,830
这是第一次，终于！
For the first time. Finally!

728
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:05,420
我不愧是跆拳道国家代表队储备选手，宝刀未老…
Yes, I've still got it! The reserve for the national...

729
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:21,770
姜贤谋
KANG HYEON-MO

730
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:26,740
爸
Dad.

731
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:33,870
你送给我的礼物
The gift you gave me...

732
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:39,960
这次我真的很想要好好使用
I wanted to use it really well this time.

733
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,920
可是为何这个世界要如此为难我？
But why is the world so hard on me?

734
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,970
我又让珍惜的人受伤了
I hurt someone precious to me again.

735
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,310
一切对我来说都太难了
It's all too difficult for me.

736
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:03,980
这次我真的想要做好
I really wanted to do well this time.

737
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:06,980
我该怎么做？
What do I do?

738
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,900
这种时候该怎么办？
What do I do in this case?

739
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:26,630
对不起，我是个傻女儿
I'm sorry I'm such a fool.

740
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:25,480
是
Yes.

741
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:28,690
我知道了，三分钟之后？
Okay. In three minutes?

742
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:30,690
好
I understand.

743
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:08,790
姜智媛抢走我的未婚夫
Kang Ji-won stole my fiancé.

744
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:13,750
你惩罚背叛你的女人，然后去过着，用你的月薪做梦也不敢想的生活
You punish the woman who betrayed you, and change your life with a fortune.

745
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:17,800
那我要怎么做才可以那样？
What do I have to do to make that happen?

746
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,090
杀了姜智媛
Kill Kang Ji-won.

747
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:21,600
我会收拾善后
I'll clean up the mess.

748
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:26,020
你们只要照做，这种穷酸的生活就会结束了
Do as you're told, and this shitty life is over.

749
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:28,060
你再说一次
Say it again.

750
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,850
别再说谎了
Stop lying.

751
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:31,650
你为什么要这样对我？
Why are you doing this to me?

752
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:34,320
我无法守护你到最后
I can't protect you forever.

753
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:36,400
我真的很喜欢你
I like you so much.

754
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,320
希望你不要自责
Don't blame yourself.

755
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:41,280
这只是该发生的事发生了而已
The inevitable just happened.

756
