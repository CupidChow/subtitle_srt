1
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:38,873
Come

2
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:43,002
You are waiting there

3
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,172
Hey

4
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:48,466
Yo

5
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,302
There is express delivery

6
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,765
where…

7
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:56,682
(Bomb me)

8
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,101
Hello, did you order the hot original fried chicken?

9
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:00,269
Spicy fried chicken

10
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,104
Is there any fried chicken in salty sauce?

11
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,315
No

12
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,733
Do you want some fried chicken?

13
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:07,485
Why would I order fried chicken?

14
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:08,694
Come on, let's start over.

15
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:09,987
Oh, I said it wrong.

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,491
It's hot original fried chicken, hot spicy sauce fried chicken
Fried chicken with salty sauce

17
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,285
There is also a large portion of fries and a free Coke.

18
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,747
-Excuse me, that...
-gentlemen

19
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,916
We didn't order any food, please leave

20
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,335
Please wait a moment

21
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,004
It's not Coke, it's soda?

22
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,840
Sir, I said we didn't order any food.

23
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,509
Please leave

24
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,552
Didn't you order fried chicken?

25
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,888
That’s right, isn’t this number 401?

26
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,515
No matter what your number is, just go.

27
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,725
I have to confirm it.

28
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:40,851
Why are you like this?

29
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,395
You pissed me off.

30
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,981
How? What do you want?

31
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,569
But it should be here, right?

32
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,655
I'll go check it out. Please wait here for a moment.

33
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,159
Whether you want to confirm or not, don't come again

34
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:59,829
- I'll come back later.
-Don't come here, go away!

35
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,205
Get out of here, hey!

36
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,498
etc.

37
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,502
Hey, Kang Ji-won, hello!

38
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,631
What is this?

39
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:15,761
Kang Ji-won, open the door

40
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,557
I think we shouldn't be like this now.

41
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:24,144
What? What are you talking about? Hey!

42
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:28,023
I'm not delivering fried chicken.
I'm Park Min-hwan, open the door

43
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,528
Open the door, hey

44
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,701
I'm really confused by your attitude today.

45
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,120
What do you think about our relationship?

46
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,290
What are you thinking?

47
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,542
Are you possessed?

48
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,878
This is not like your usual self, hey!

49
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,963
Open the door, what's wrong with you lately?

50
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:55,384
I need some time
If you have any difficulties, you can tell me

51
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,553
I will accept your opinion 100%

52
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,433
Who is she kidding?

53
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,034
I'm leaving. You're really going too far.

54
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,434
Kang Ji-won

55
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,519
Are you listening?

56
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,774
I didn't think you were easy to get.

57
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,110
I love your inner self more

58
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:00,199
To be honest, you are skinny and nothing good to look at.

59
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,994
Don't get me wrong.

60
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:05,829
Anyway…

61
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,832
I'm not good today

62
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,460
Good night

63
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:30,354
It was almost tragic.

64
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,025
hateful

65
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:43,909
Damn

66
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:54,837
Ouch

67
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,715
He left, if he didn't come out
I was planning to go in again.

68
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:00,634
I did a good job, right?

69
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,344
well done

70
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:04,221
Feels like a spy, not bad.

71
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,265
But what is going on?

72
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,147
that…

73
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,148
Should I leave?

74
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,197
Episode 3

75
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,618
Hello

76
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,328
You really are

77
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,539
Where did you suddenly go with the fried chicken?

78
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,375
Do you know how busy I am when I have to cook and deliver food?

79
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,335
Brother Zhihe wants me to go over immediately

80
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,337
Hello

81
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:39,631
So…

82
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:40,674
You lost it

83
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,634
- You should get there faster.
- You lost it

84
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,970
- You lost it
- I thought you ran away

85
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,055
You really are

86
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,099
But why so sudden?

87
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,101
I don't know

88
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,562
He asked me to pretend to deliver food to the wrong house.

89
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,399
There seems to be something hidden

90
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,484
What's the secret?

91
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,361
This morning he suddenly asked me to help find someone

92
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,946
I made more than a hundred calls.

93
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,032
-You need someone?
-right

94
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,242
-Why?
-I have no idea

95
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,870
He suddenly became like this

96
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,791
I dare not ask him

97
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,684
You really should be an artist.

98
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,104
I don't dare to stand in front of the public

99
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,397
Your problem lies here

100
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,649
Too timid...

101
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,026
I mean be cautious.

102
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,696
If you were a little more shameless, we would make a lot of money.

103
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,740
If you go on TV and do this

104
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,242
And this

105
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,576
and this

106
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,704
Our turnover will definitely soar

107
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,290
That's right

108
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:59,169
I may not be able to come to work this Sunday
I've already spoken to the sous chef.

109
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,088
What's up? Are you going on a blind date?

110
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,800
Are you going to open up?

111
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,802
No, not like that.

112
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,638
I have a high school reunion

113
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,973
What?

114
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:12,933
Are you going?

115
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:17,396
You are not heartbroken by your first love
So you don’t even want to think of your high school classmates?

116
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,565
You confessed and got rejected, right?

117
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,695
It's not easy to reject you.

118
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,196
Really

119
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,575
But how did you find out about the class reunion?

120
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,035
You haven't contacted anyone.

121
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,413
that…

122
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,005
(U&K, Minister Liu Zhihe)

123
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,174
Excuse me

124
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,594
Are you free on Sunday?

125
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,438
You seem like a nice person.

126
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,356
But I have a girlfriend.

127
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,275
-terribly sorry
-What?

128
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,904
No, what are you thinking about?

129
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,323
That's not what I meant. Absolutely not.

130
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,786
There was a high school reunion

131
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,915
A man told me that there was a class reunion

132
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,834
But I don't know who he is

133
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,420
He is obviously not my classmate

134
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,173
Sounds suspicious.

135
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,717
It's best not to get involved at this time.

136
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,720
Unless you want to see your first love, don't go.

137
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:36,725
What happened to me?

138
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,937
You really shouldn't do that.

139
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,691
Don't talk to me anymore.

140
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,486
Do you want to see her?

141
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,490
Because you were hurt by the rejection.
So I don't want to fall in love

142
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,533
Wearing a fake ring

143
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,247
Right? I shouldn't go there, okay?

144
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,126
If you're going, be sure to...

145
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,544
Dress up

146
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,075
not good

147
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,856
Honestly, I'm sad today.

148
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,109
You'll pay for this at Gusuting on Sunday.

149
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,235
Don't be late

150
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,739
Dressing up is not something that can be done overnight

151
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,751
(Sunday)

152
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,720
Is my other half on the way?
Today is our date

153
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,223
Don't be late, dress nicely

154
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,853
Although becoming beautiful is not something that can be achieved overnight

155
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,023
But I think it's beautiful.

156
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:55,280
(Guse Pavilion)

157
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:59,743
(The 37th reunion of Busan Taeha High School)

158
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,747
Zheng Xiumin, isn’t this Zheng Xiumin?

159
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:09,711
How did you become so beautiful?

160
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,380
She was beautiful.

161
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,466
My lovely girl, you haven't changed at all.

162
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,927
Hey, Xiumin is here, let's have a drink

163
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,011
Come have a drink

164
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,096
Sit down

165
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,016
Busan Taeha High School, come on!

166
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:33,443
After Xiumin joined a big company
It feels a little different.

167
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,737
How should I put it? She looks like a capable urban woman.

168
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,532
I'm lucky.

169
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,575
Jiwon also supports me

170
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,953
Are you still playing with her?

171
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,081
She is my other half.

172
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,459
You are too soft-hearted, and you are still being taken advantage of.

173
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:50,961
How is that woman doing?

174
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,338
Am I still relying on you in a very poor way?

175
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,840
She is just plain

176
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,008
But she has become much prettier recently.

177
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,511
And Zhiyuan will come over later. I asked her to come.

178
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,305
Wait, she's coming here?

179
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,475
Wait for her to come over, and be nice to her.

180
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,437
She's been in a bad mood lately.

181
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:09,813
Why are you in a bad mood?

182
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:17,946
I'm not recommending her.
Should she be sent to U&K as a contract employee?

183
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,615
After she came to work
I seem to have a crush on Park Min-hwan

184
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,076
Isn’t the person you’re flirting with Park Min-hwan?

185
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,619
Is it the same person?

186
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,206
Um?

187
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,334
Oh, that...

188
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,088
No, it's not like that.

189
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,258
Don't mention this to Jiwon for a while.

190
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,218
-Don't mention it.
-What don't you mention?

191
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,097
That girl started again?

192
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:46,975
(Other half)

193
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,021
Hello? Ji Won

194
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,606
Xiumin, where are you?

195
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,615
If you can't find it, I'll bring you here.

196
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,626
I'm coming, behind you

197
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,430
Ji Won

198
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:26,765
What's going on?

199
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,558
Aren't we just the two of us having dinner?

200
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:33,980
Long time no see everyone

201
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,998
Dressing up is not something that can be done overnight

202
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:02,968
Agent Jiang

203
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,345
You said you had an appointment on Sunday

204
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,305
So do you want to go out with me tomorrow?

205
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,233
(Saturday)

206
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:26,700
(Stock balance: 1,403,000 KRW)

207
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,952
It's over 1.4 million won.

208
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,706
That means I invested 3 million won
It will become 6 million won

209
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,959
Wait for next month's salary to come in

210
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,419
I'm gonna put it all in.

211
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,632
(Ossendyk)

212
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,451
What are you doing?

213
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,954
The difference is bigger than I thought

214
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,715
No wonder the minister told me not to wear it.

215
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,843
Kang Ji Won is such an idiot

216
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,519
(2011)

217
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:40,899
What a nice view

218
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,574
Ji Won

219
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,871
Sorry, I'm late.

220
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,122
No, it's okay.

221
00:15:56,706 --> 00:16:01,169
You are so beautiful today
You wore the clothes I bought for you

222
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,339
Today is this, clang clang

223
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,549
Couple hats

224
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,555
You also wear

225
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,017
It suits you very well and looks good.

226
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,560
Thanks

227
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,814
I wish I could wear glasses like you.

228
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,401
It looks better without wearing it

229
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:29,030
You have no confidence again. You are beautiful, very beautiful.

230
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:31,616
Where's Min-hwan?

231
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,868
He will be here soon

232
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,541
It's a nice day today. It's hot.

233
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,043
Give me sweet and sour candy

234
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,468
Sorry, I finished eating last time and forgot to buy it again

235
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:56,224
What? You know I like that.

236
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,103
Feel sorry

237
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,358
What happened? Did Ji-won make Xiu-min cry again?

238
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:10,280
Min-hwan, Ji-won said she doesn't have sweet and sour candy
She knows I like to eat that

239
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,366
If she had the heart, she would have prepared in advance.

240
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,617
I'm so sad

241
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,829
Why are you like this?

242
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,332
I knew this would happen, so I bought it.

243
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,460
Sweet and sour candy!

244
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,171
-Minhwan is so nice
-well done

245
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:30,759
-Should we go flower viewing?
-Okay, remember to take your stuff.

246
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,346
- Come here
-good

247
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,684
etc.

248
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,483
Wow, it's really beautiful

249
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,402
-Are you here?
-Um

250
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,781
- Jiwon, look there, isn’t it beautiful?
-Um

251
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,745
The long-awaited date with my benefactor

252
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,580
Oh, sorry.

253
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,333
No, that's okay.

254
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,003
Ossendic…

255
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,343
This is a gift from Xiumin.

256
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,969
This is not Ossendic, it's a fake

257
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,679
I just found out

258
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,562
This is true, right?

259
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,272
Yes, the real thing

260
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,276
The sheen is totally different, isn't it?

261
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,111
It's really beautiful

262
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,197
Thank you, isn't it beautiful?

263
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,204
Benefactor, why didn’t you drink before?

264
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,164
How nice it would be to drink together

265
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,292
I don't drink? I can drink a lot.

266
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,169
You said last time that you don't drink

267
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,630
You said you drank and got into trouble as a kid

268
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,424
So I decided not to drink it.

269
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,635
Have I? In trouble?

270
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,095
How are you?

271
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,607
I didn't drink before

272
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,527
But Park Min-hwan makes me sad
So I...

273
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,238
God

274
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,575
So you're saying that you were involved because of Agent Park
Start drinking again?

275
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,453
Not now, maybe in about five years.

276
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,084
I think drinking in moderation is fine.

277
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:32,255
There is no need to avoid drinking such good things for fear of getting into trouble.

278
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:36,092
-Would you like some fried dumplings?
-good

279
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:40,263
- Boss, we want six fried dumplings
-good

280
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,933
Drinking caused trouble
To me, it seems like a big deal

281
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,768
I don't remember it at all

282
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,898
Why do I live so timidly?
Keep reflecting on yourself?

283
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,399
Fried dumplings are here

284
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,859
Thanks

285
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,986
I envy you.

286
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,614
Cheerful and healthy

287
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,199
You look a lot like your name.

288
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:01,576
That's right

289
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,037
My name Xiyan sounds like Xiyuan, so it's not a bad fate.

290
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,372
Therefore, "establishing happy connections with others"

291
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,832
That's my motto

292
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:09,959
I see

293
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,628
Benefactor, let's have a toast

294
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,547
- Happy
-fate

295
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,598
Try it now, it's delicious.

296
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,558
-Eat it right away?
-right

297
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:26,809
Right now?

298
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,647
Delicious, right? Super delicious, right?

299
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,607
Super delicious, right?

300
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,359
No matter how much I think about it,

301
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,235
It's so right that we meet today

302
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,906
On Sundays, you have to think about going to work tomorrow.
There is no way to drink as much as you want

303
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,074
That's right

304
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,410
Didn’t you say you had a class reunion tomorrow?

305
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,955
-Should we exercise some moderation?
-Oh, that

306
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:50,291
I haven't decided whether to go yet.

307
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,965
In fact, I was not only unpopular before

308
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,174
But being bullied

309
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,094
What? You're being bullied?

310
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,304
Why?

311
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,807
Don't know

312
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,976
They suddenly hate me

313
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:12,188
So I became timid

314
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,148
More mistakes due to fear

315
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:17,443
As a result, everyone hates me even more

316
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,363
You should ask them why they do this.

317
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,573
How can I ask?

318
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,827
How do you know what others are thinking if you don’t ask?

319
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,206
Although I am the kind of person who would want to run away if things get too difficult.

320
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,917
But I still think that before that
Do everything you can.

321
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:37,463
You have to know that the other party is an unreasonable lunatic

322
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:40,133
Or is there any reason?

323
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,135
I won't have any lumps in my heart

324
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,721
Won't there be any pimples?

325
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,389
right

326
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,018
Such a matter of course
Why haven't I thought about it?

327
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,939
Zheng Xiumin is so kind

328
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:58,026
When Jiang Zhiyuan was in high school...

329
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,527
Wisdom, etc.

330
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,613
Jiang Zhiyuan was not at her seat just now

331
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,869
I have to listen to the conversation that follows.

332
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:08,953
Yes

333
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,999
If I don't want to feel uncomfortable, I should go

334
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,590
What's wrong?

335
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,676
Turning the shameful past into a glorious history

336
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,969
Easier said than done

337
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:28,598
People like me
It's not something that can change overnight.

338
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,433
Although it is true

339
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,810
But you can try hard

340
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,939
-effort?
-Steady and steady, everything will go well

341
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,526
Those who are fully prepared will not fail

342
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,664
What are you doing

343
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,124
I really like eating dumplings

344
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,169
I'll take it home and heat it up.

345
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,885
Benefactor, I can finally repay you.

346
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,199
Hello

347
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,034
Hee-yeon, long time no see

348
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:33,538
This is my favorite boss at work.

349
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:34,664
Hello

350
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,707
Hello, I am designer Song Caimin

351
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,459
Then let's come in.

352
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,336
OK, let's go

353
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,803
I will pay the bill today with the membership voucher I bought

354
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,222
- No, Hee-yeon
-Shh

355
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,306
benefactor

356
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,433
Please concentrate

357
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,727
The membership voucher will expire if not used today?

358
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,729
Very good

359
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:01,524
It would be bad if we didn't have this person to use it.

360
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,569
Your hair is very healthy, any hairstyle is suitable for you

361
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,404
Want an S-shaped perm?

362
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,905
Or water wave type?

363
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,701
If the shape changes too much suddenly

364
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,579
Maybe I was misunderstood and reincarnated.

365
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:18,541
Just a little wave, and also curl the eyelashes

366
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,002
- And get your eyebrows trimmed
-etc

367
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,883
I want to be reborn

368
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:33,139
OK, I got it

369
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:36,976
Then you will be reborn today

370
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:41,063
And reparted her hair.

371
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,190
besides…

372
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:43,357
To make up

373
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:44,275
Is Director Nan here?

374
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,568
I asked her to come over

375
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:50,364
I'll let you see in the mirror today

376
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,700
You've never seen yourself

377
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:15,306
An ordinary person who is not as mature as you

378
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,850
Judging everything by appearance

379
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,520
If you want something, you need to dress accordingly.

380
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:22,897
This is just the beginning

381
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,854
Perfect

382
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,731
It suits you so well

383
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,066
Good for you

384
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,902
So beautiful, do you like it?

385
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,053
How about this?

386
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:22,266
Awesome!

387
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,727
Classics never go out of fashion

388
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,695
Never mind, maybe next time.

389
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,323
Why? This is great.

390
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,494
Someone else is going to receive this.

391
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,170
You bastard, you sprayed all over my meat

392
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,463
Do you have a cold?

393
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:55,049
I was choked by the smoke, not by a cold.

394
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,513
What? Your girlfriend doesn't answer the phone.
You won't call back?

395
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,390
I'm not calling Kang Ji Won

396
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,185
The real master is to leave it alone

397
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,021
(Call record: Jiang Zhiyuan)

398
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:11,732
(Not connected)

399
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:14,276
As long as you leave her alone, she will start to think a lot

400
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,071
Once you start thinking too much, you will surrender.

401
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,408
- You don't understand
-Help

402
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,451
You see

403
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,370
Do you need my help?

404
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,581
Hammock?

405
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,375
I'm good at setting up a hammock

406
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,502
Want to spread it out? One, two, three

407
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,135
You guys come over for barbecue later.

408
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:55,151
But that woman lasted longer than I expected.

409
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,903
You're going to die anyway.

410
00:28:58,696 --> 00:28:59,697
Get out of here!

411
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,116
The dumplings are cold.

412
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,119
Excuse me, I want more dumplings...

413
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:57,755
Thank you, Hee-yeon

414
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:08,849
That quick cooking bag

415
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,768
I'll help you deal with it.

416
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,728
Joined Yang Zhulan and Zheng Xiumin as members

417
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,064
Make up for your deficiencies

418
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,067
Has he seen my business proposal?

419
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,820
Join Zheng Xiumin as a team member?

420
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:25,574
Could it be that...

421
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,081
Did you forget that we have an appointment tomorrow?
Guse Pavilion, 5:30

422
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,543
(good)

423
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:41,757
Hello?

424
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,634
Ji Won, it's me

425
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:46,595
What are you doing today?

426
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,891
I went to eat spicy rice cakes with Xiyan today

427
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,227
Now she is sleeping

428
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:56,814
Liu Xiyan is at your house? Why?

429
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,108
We were chatting and then she fell asleep

430
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,110
We also had some wine.

431
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,491
Hello?

432
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:08,993
Why don't you look for me?

433
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,623
Did I do anything to upset you?

434
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:18,210
No, have you done anything to offend me?

435
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:19,545
No

436
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:25,801
I have something to ask of you, so I'm calling you.

437
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,014
What's up?

438
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,727
you…

439
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,395
this…

440
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,980
Isn’t there a quick-cooking meal package project?

441
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,690
Really good

442
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,066
That's pretty good.

443
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,943
I'll revise it a bit and submit it again

444
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:45,613
Could I revise it a bit and submit it?

445
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:46,989
how?

446
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:54,955
No, that's my project.

447
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,043
Why? Weren't you rejected?
I feel I can succeed

448
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,170
I have to get a full-time job.

449
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,963
Let's grow together, my friend.

450
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,133
You should have told me earlier.

451
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,302
If I knew

452
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,179
I won't modify it.

453
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,725
Sorry, I'll tell you next time when I have a good idea

454
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,478
besides…

455
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:23,275
I don't feel good about you calling me by my first name in the office

456
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,570
Although we are friends, we are at different levels.

457
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:30,949
There is also a difference in experience
You ask me to make coffee, give me orders

458
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,284
Seems a bit over

459
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:36,580
Let's keep public and private affairs separate, okay?

460
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,335
-What?
- I'm going to hang up now, see you tomorrow

461
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:50,636
What?

462
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:56,100
How dare Jiang Zhiyuan do this to me?

463
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:04,066
I rescheduled all my appointments for you.
I'm going to attend the class reunion tomorrow.

464
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,151
See you tomorrow, little girl

465
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,363
I love you, see you tomorrow

466
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,865
I also bought some beautiful earrings to show Ruizhi.

467
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:16,870
In conclusion

468
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:20,666
A little carelessness
She forgot how bad she was before.

469
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,252
It doesn't matter

470
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,504
If she doesn't understand, I can teach her again.

471
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:28,924
You must remember to wear the earrings I gave you tomorrow

472
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,347
(Proposal for quick-cooking meal kits in the one-person household era)

473
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,103
Here, the fried chicken is here, come over here

474
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:43,897
What did your mother say?

475
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,942
I told her I was with the section chief and she said okay.

476
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:50,612
My mom is really

477
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,031
I'm 31 years old, and there's still access control?

478
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:55,909
That's because you're so beautiful.

479
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,119
She's so worried.

480
00:33:57,995 --> 00:33:59,663
Speaking of women

481
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,127
It's better to be cared for and raised

482
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:07,588
Come

483
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,508
What’s the point of my mother raising me like this?

484
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:15,596
To meet a man as reliable as you
To continue living this life

485
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:25,564
Yeah, yeah.

486
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:28,400
Now that we've finished talking about business

487
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:31,236
-You really are my brother, right?
-etc

488
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,907
Of course

489
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,700
Start now

490
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:39,244
I really am your brother.

491
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,248
(Proposer: Marketing Agent 1, Kang Ji-won)

492
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:47,503
Come

493
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,949
(Guse Pavilion)

494
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:30,587
Hello? Ji Won

495
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,631
Xiumin, where are you?

496
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:41,598
If you can't find it, I'll bring you here.

497
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,853
I'm coming, behind you

498
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,114
Ji Won

499
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:02,202
What's going on? Aren't we the only two eating?

500
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,130
Long time no see everyone

501
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,637
Wow, what's going on?

502
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:23,348
The ugly duckling Kang Ji-won has become so beautiful?

503
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:28,353
I don't remember who you are
So it's like our first meeting.

504
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:29,438
You are so rude.

505
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,190
Is that so? I'm so sorry.

506
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:34,318
I was too reckless.

507
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:36,653
He never changed.

508
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,071
I was very reckless in high school.

509
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:40,073
- I'm still just as reckless now
- Really

510
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:43,493
You even imitate Xiumin in wearing earrings

511
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,954
What's the point of being polite?

512
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,584
Earrings?

513
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,462
It's different

514
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,590
This looks more advanced.

515
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:02,512
That looks a bit rough.

516
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,765
Is that a fake?

517
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,808
Wow, are you imitating her?

518
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,645
Xiumin, you should buy the genuine product.

519
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,772
There are a lot of fakes lately that are very good.

520
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,691
Oh, you can buy fake goods even if you don’t have money.

521
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,154
(five hours ago)

522
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:30,415
Makeup is also a skill, practice more and you will improve

523
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:46,598
My benefactor, where are the fakes...

524
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:48,350
wrong

525
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,935
Counterfeit goods

526
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,313
There are S-class, A-class, B-class, etc.

527
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:55,899
This is a level of insincerity.

528
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,068
A level of insincerity?

529
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:02,406
There's no sincerity in pretending to be genuine.
No sincerity counterfeit

530
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,370
There is only one intention for giving such a gift.

531
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,541
Embarrass you

532
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:18,880
-no…
- Come have a drink

533
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,590
You definitely have more than one trick

534
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,342
To highlight that I learn from you

535
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:26,054
Compare it with mine.
Yours is like the original

536
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,557
-I‥
-But

537
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,142
What to do?

538
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,935
You wear mine.

539
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,023
I seem to have made a real friend

540
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,649
Excuse me

541
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,895
Kang Ji-won is really amazing

542
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,272
No one who is familiar with her dares to come

543
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,024
She must be here to eat meat.

544
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,318
Looking at her dress, she looks very poor.

545
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,825
Kang Ji-won is really amazing

546
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,994
No one who is familiar with her dares to come

547
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:32,579
She must be here to show off.

548
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,915
Looking at her clothes, it seems that everything she bought was new.

549
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:38,335
Why are you speaking in Seoul accent all of a sudden? So corny

550
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,338
By the way, why is she still playing with Xiumin?

551
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:42,547
Can't you tell it at a glance?

552
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:46,134
Xiumin, that innocent child, is so kind to her.

553
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:48,553
She sticks to Xiumin and takes away everything that belongs to her

554
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:50,514
Really annoying

555
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:52,224
She is really amazing.

556
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:56,728
Zheng Xiumin is so kind

557
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:58,814
We should take care of her.

558
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,983
You see, when Kang Ji-won was in high school...

559
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,443
Wisdom, etc.

560
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:05,570
What's wrong?

561
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:07,697
Jiang Zhiyuan was not at her seat just now

562
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,449
Have you always been here?

563
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,911
-Why are you pretending not to be there? You...
- Could it be

564
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:56,997
I'll come in first

565
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,332
When I hear you coming in, should I go to greet you?

566
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,721
Don't worry about me, just keep talking.

567
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,055
I'm curious too

568
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:17,017
How have I treated Xiumin since high school?

569
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:19,519
Don't you know?

570
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:22,105
As long as it's Xiumin's
You want to learn from her.

571
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,941
Aren’t the earrings you’re wearing now imitating Xiumin?

572
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:29,863
This one?

573
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,699
Xiumin gave me earrings

574
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:41,541
But it's fake

575
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,251
Very obvious

576
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,463
So I bought the real thing myself

577
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,132
But they are still couple earrings of the same style
Isn’t it?

578
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:52,135
I still want to know

579
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,056
What else do I want from Xiumin?

580
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:58,350
man

581
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:02,562
I heard that you have a crush on Xiumin
Park Min-hwan or something else?

582
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,564
People don't change

583
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:08,443
Xiumin and Eunho dated in high school
Didn’t you also ask them to break up?

584
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:13,114
I want Xiumin to break up with Eunho?

585
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,408
Have they dated?

586
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,870
Park Min-hwan is Xiumin's ambiguous object?

587
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,122
She recommended you to work as a contract employee in a big company like U&K

588
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:24,167
You also stole her ambiguous object

589
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:25,752
That's too much.

590
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,422
I really can't continue talking to you.

591
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,634
-What did you say?
-Hello

592
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,514
If you only listen to one side
Such a bad attitude towards people

593
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:40,308
You should at least check the facts.

594
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:44,938
Listen carefully

595
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,775
(U&K, represented by Kang Ji-won)

596
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,735
I am an agent for U&K

597
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,947
I heard that contract employees also have business cards.

598
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,991
Are you lying?
How can we trust you?

599
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:59,494
I have been in the company for seven years.
When did Xiumin join the company?

600
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:04,749
I remember it was my second year as an agent.
Recommend Xiumin to come in

601
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,669
-About last year or so?
-Oh my god, yes

602
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:11,214
I often met with her to ask about her resume.
So I know it was at the beginning of last year

603
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:14,384
The strangest thing is

604
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:16,261
About Park Min-hwan

605
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,555
He is my boyfriend

606
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,978
(Park Minhwan)

607
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:25,895
(Amplified)

608
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:33,945
Hello? Honey

609
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:36,323
Honey, I'm at the class reunion.
Did you call me?

610
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,533
Um?

611
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,369
I didn't call you so that you can have fun without worrying about it.

612
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:42,787
I must have pressed it accidentally.

613
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:47,125
Oh, that's it,

614
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,586
Say hello to my friends.

615
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:52,422
friend?

616
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,177
Hello

617
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,264
Hello, I am Jiang Zhiyuan's friend

618
00:44:01,348 --> 00:44:04,100
Are you really Kang Ji-won's boyfriend?

619
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:07,437
Hello, I'm Jiang Zhiyuan's boyfriend
My name is Park Min-hwan

620
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,482
Except Xiumin
I haven't heard of her other friends.

621
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,901
Please take good care of our Ji-won

622
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,069
I should tell you...

623
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,570
Hello? Hey

624
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:19,407
What is this?

625
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,371
Is that ok?

626
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,391
Ji Won

627
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,645
-where are you going?
-you…

628
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:49,979
Hello, Kang Ji-won!

629
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:55,110
Okay, forget about the other things.

630
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,653
But no matter how young you are

631
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:59,239
You can't just like your friend's boyfriend.
Just ask them to break up?

632
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:13,128
Classmates, don't do this.

633
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:16,798
Don't bully your classmates. Don't do this.

634
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:17,882
Very dirty

635
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:22,303
Oh, I almost forgot

636
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,098
That thing is weird too.

637
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:28,601
I like Eun-ho, that's right.

638
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:30,770
But Xiumin has never dated Eunho.

639
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:35,692
Have you ever dated Eunho?

640
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:46,119
that…

641
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,919
I'm sorry, Ji-won, I didn't tell you then.

642
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,213
I know you like Eunho

643
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,924
How can I tell you that I'm dating him?

644
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:08,016
What are you talking about?
Didn’t you say I wanted you to break up?

645
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,767
Shouldn't I know that you guys are dating?

646
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,732
I was wrong

647
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:18,776
We are dating in secret, so I didn't tell you.

648
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:21,196
Do I know it or not?

649
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:27,160
Oh, it's so scary, Kang Ji-won is so fierce

650
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:29,746
You have no friends because of your bad temper.

651
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:33,249
-Why do you care so much?
-Because you care, so I care

652
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,711
Because I don't care

653
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,797
You have forgotten your three years
How did you bully me?

654
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:44,302
Even now I take out my business card to clarify

655
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,346
You're still just saying I have a bad temper

656
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:48,640
Does anyone know if that business card is fake?

657
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:51,476
The bag you're carrying is fake.

658
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:55,021
What are you talking about, girl?

659
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,232
This is when I got my first salary.

660
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:00,818
Go to the department store
12-month installment payment for genuine products

661
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,278
No, forget it.

662
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,406
You're really funny.

663
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,368
Randomly guessing that others are fake

664
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,537
And then just say no?

665
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,914
What else can I say?

666
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:15,959
You should apologize and say sorry!

667
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,794
It is you who should apologize!

668
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:22,465
Because of Zheng Xiumin's words

669
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:24,634
You bullied me for three whole years.

670
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:28,638
Do you still want to do this at a class reunion that you haven’t had for a long time?

671
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:33,643
Also correct

672
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:37,855
If you just want to bully me
You certainly don't want to apologize, do you?

673
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:39,482
How could I have that?

674
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:43,444
I am a fair person.

675
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:47,615
So you don't mean
Didn't Xiumin and Eunho date?

676
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:51,452
The person involved said they were in a relationship, why do you say they weren’t?

677
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,416
I don't know anything else

678
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:14,642
But I can tell you one thing for sure.

679
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,274
Zheng Xiumin and I

680
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:25,612
Never dated

681
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,464
Long time no see, Kang Ji Won

682
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:51,638
What are you talking about?

683
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:55,767
No

684
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:01,856
-sorry
- Explain clearly

685
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:03,733
This is a promise

686
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,026
To break the agreement

687
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,571
There must be a proper reason

688
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:11,866
I can’t understand, how can I ask for forgiveness from the other party?

689
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:14,077
I can't explain it clearly

690
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,079
Because don't

691
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,831
So don't

692
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,627
Who are you

693
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:26,047
The person who will inherit the U&K Group

694
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:29,092
Once you inherit the company and make your decision

695
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:31,886
You're telling people I can't explain it clearly.
No means no

696
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,055
Is this how you plan to run your company?

697
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:37,809
After I inherit the company
No one will ask me to explain it clearly

698
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:45,608
No matter how great you are

699
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:50,029
They can't beat the combined efforts of the two.

700
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:51,989
Since ancient times, people who have done great things

701
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,701
There must be another half

702
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,744
And it has to be an excellent other half

703
00:49:58,454 --> 00:49:59,497
Is this really the case?

704
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,124
Of course, your dad is also...

705
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:09,132
Recent young people

706
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:12,468
There is a ridiculous idea that it is better not to get married.

707
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:13,803
Do you think so too?

708
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:15,555
I think

709
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,182
marry

710
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,853
I have someone I like.

711
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:25,148
In conclusion

712
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:27,900
That's it

713
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:35,908
Is that someone I know?

714
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:40,455
Which family's daughter is she? What's her name?

715
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:45,042
I'm unrequited love

716
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,590
What did you say?

717
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:54,260
You asked me to study business administration, and I did.

718
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:56,262
They asked me to go to the American branch, and I went.

719
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:59,682
You want me to be in charge of food when I come back.
I joined the marketing team.

720
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:02,143
I will do whatever you ask.

721
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:03,853
this time

722
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:06,606
Please believe me

723
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,608
How dare you?

724
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,568
Do you think I don't know?

725
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:11,652
Which time have you

726
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:15,072
Have you ever done something you didn't want to do?

727
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:18,534
You just don't have any ideas, so just do it.

728
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:20,036
It has always been like this

729
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,998
Then you should know
I'll do what I want this time too.

730
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,333
Oh, you guy

731
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,889
I have to report this to you, Grandpa.

732
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,060
I have someone I like.

733
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,899
I don't want women's problems

734
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:18,261
Which woman did he fall in love with to do that?

735
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,179
Go and ask around

736
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:24,392
He never made unnecessary mistakes.

737
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,519
That makes me more scared.

738
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:30,356
People say that if a person behaves abnormally, he or she is going to die.

739
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:34,777
Indeed, he would never give up on women.

740
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:36,654
A stubborn person

741
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:39,115
So…

742
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:41,701
What should we do about President Wu?

743
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,870
My son no longer listens to me.

744
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:46,163
Is there any need to talk about grandson?

745
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:49,792
But these are two different things. No means no.

746
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:53,629
Ever since his mother passed away

747
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:56,382
He never spoke for a long time.

748
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,386
What happened to him suddenly?

749
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:04,056
-So…
- Go and ask around

750
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,643
It is better to remove the unnecessary buds as soon as possible.

751
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:21,449
It's so difficult

752
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:24,076
There is a class reunion

753
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,494
Class reunion?

754
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,582
Do I know you?

755
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:32,585
Although I don't know, I think
You should know that there is a class reunion

756
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,212
Why are you telling me this?

757
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:36,797
Do you remember Kang Ji Won?

758
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:42,053
As far as I know, there was a misunderstanding in high school.

759
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:45,389
If you can, please go to a class reunion.
It would be better if we cleared up the misunderstanding.

760
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:46,891
Misunderstand?

761
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:50,353
Wait, who would this be better for?

762
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,065
It will be better for Kang Ji-won

763
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:56,567
Please

764
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,915
(Guse Pavilion)

765
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:20,633
-Yes, Captain.
- Minister, where are you?

766
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,885
-Are you on your way?
- I'm going over now

767
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,353
Isn’t that Bai Enhao?

768
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:35,189
-Yes, it's Baek Eun-ho
- He's fine.

769
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,733
Hey little bastard, why didn't you answer my call?

770
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:39,944
Eun-ho, why are you here?

771
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,404
No, more importantly

772
00:54:41,988 --> 00:54:42,989
you say

773
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:46,409
You haven't dated Xiumin?

774
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:51,664
Say

775
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,376
Have you ever liked me?

776
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:59,880
Then why did you do that back then?

777
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:16,480
(Guse Pavilion)

778
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,768
She wears it so beautifully

779
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,187
Going to a class reunion?

780
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:19,877
etc.

781
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:23,964
No

782
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:25,883
So what I want to say is...

783
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,016
Feel sorry

784
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:37,269
I'll wipe your hands.

785
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,488
What did I do?

786
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,162
I have to go

787
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,042
Oh, okay

788
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:03,712
Wait, wait a minute

789
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:06,966
Listen to me, what I want to say is...

790
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,467
I never liked you

791
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:11,220
I just

792
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,014
Just a slip of the tongue

793
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,022
I used to...

794
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,276
Like you!

795
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:24,168
Start now
I won't be so foolish as to stick to just one form anymore

796
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,794
You are so beautiful

797
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:27,671
-Feel sorry
- Made him crazy

798
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:29,215
So beautiful

799
00:58:29,298 --> 00:58:32,092
You guys bullied her yourselves, why are you blaming me?

800
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:35,804
Don't worry, my significant other.
I really won't let it go this time.

801
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,934
Minister, it's nice to see you smile.

802
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:42,478
Liu Zhihe seems to be interested in you

803
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:45,564
Rumor has it that the Minister and Hee-yeon had an affair

804
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:46,982
Should I tell Ji-won everything?

805
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:50,194
Tell her that Park Min Hwan will have an affair with Jung Soo Min
Then hurt her

806
00:58:54,073 --> 00:58:56,075
