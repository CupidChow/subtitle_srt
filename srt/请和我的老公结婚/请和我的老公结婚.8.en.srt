00:00:22,138 --> 00:00:23,431
Your necklace.

7
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:24,766
It's really pretty.

8
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:32,899
Let's go.

9
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:43,785
The flag is just down here.

10
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:45,578
Flag one.

11
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,789
What?

12
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,374
-What's that?
-What?

13
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:54,921
I think someone already got it.

14
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,527
Goodness.

15
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,571
You're incredible.

16
00:01:20,196 --> 00:01:22,490
I wondered who'd dare go in there.

17
00:01:22,574 --> 00:01:23,742
It was you?

18
00:01:24,743 --> 00:01:26,161
You're incredible.

19
00:01:28,997 --> 00:01:30,749
I want to be solid land.

20
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,543
-Hui-yeon.
-Yeah?

21
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:37,714
What does it mean
when someone wants to be land?

22
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:43,178
Like when asked what you want to become
or do in the future.

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,473
Maybe they meant lamb?

24
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:48,683
Oh, man. Now I'm hungry.

25
00:01:50,018 --> 00:01:54,189
Maybe it was something else.

26
00:01:54,272 --> 00:01:56,816
Who said it? You should just ask them.

27
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:58,735
Well...

28
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:02,071
It's hard to ask them.

29
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,865
Is it Mr. Park?

30
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,285
You shouldn't be like that.

31
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:13,833
My husband said things I never understood,
and I couldn't ask him too.

32
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:16,836
Especially between lovers,

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,672
you should share
future goals or bucket lists!

34
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,176
You won the camper today.

35
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:27,055
Sneak him into your car and ask him.

36
00:02:28,223 --> 00:02:30,683
What are you saying? So dirty!

37
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:32,018
Married women are so...

38
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:34,896
<i>I can't do that.</i>

39
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:38,066
<i>Min-hwan can't be with me tonight.</i>

40
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:45,657
<i>In the past, I got number four</i>
<i>which was the single tent,</i>

41
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,992
<i>and Su-min got number one, the camper.</i>

42
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:49,953
<i>And that night...</i>

43
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:55,792
Hey, I can't sleep in a sleeping bag.

44
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,919
Let's go sleep somewhere else.

45
00:02:58,002 --> 00:03:00,463
<i>We left and came back at dawn.</i>

46
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,340
I'll die if I sleep here.

47
00:03:02,423 --> 00:03:06,010
<i>We drank so we were overheated.</i>
<i>It was horrifying.</i>

48
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:07,512
Hey.

49
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:11,182
-Hey!
<i>-If I'm in the camper,</i>

50
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:16,938
<i>Su-min will be in the single tent.</i>

51
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,774
<i>If so...</i>

52
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,695
Today could be D-Day.

53
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:24,654
What?

54
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:27,240
Nothing.

55
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:29,868
I should go out.

56
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:31,411
You're going out again?

57
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:34,289
You found the number one. Just rest.

58
00:03:34,372 --> 00:03:37,333
We still have time.
I have to follow the rules.

59
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:40,461
Goodness.

60
00:03:40,545 --> 00:03:42,130
She's so inflexible.

61
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:54,559
That was dangerous and reckless.

62
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:59,522
I know I won't die from drowning.

63
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,568
What scares me the most

64
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:08,156
is living the same life as before
with this second chance.

65
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:13,536
In order to not do that,
I can do anything.

66
00:04:27,175 --> 00:04:30,762
So since you have the number one flag,

67
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:32,055
has fate changed?

68
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:37,977
Or is there a chance that Su-min will
take it before you sleep in the camper?

69
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,146
I don't know.

70
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:42,065
Then...

71
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:45,443
But there's one thing that's certain.

72
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:49,322
Park Min-hwan borrowed money from me,

73
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:53,076
and he bought a necklace
before coming here.

74
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:56,996
He's simple-minded.

75
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,208
It's his killer move
to get into a woman's pants.

76
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,378
I got it too.

77
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:09,884
It's so pretty, babe.

78
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:11,427
It's nothing much.

79
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:17,558
Are you saying
he bought the same necklace?

80
00:05:17,642 --> 00:05:20,144
No, it's a bit different. This one...

81
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:23,022
It looked quite expensive.

82
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:25,775
I must've been easier to him.

83
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:32,657
It's okay.

84
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,576
I'm doing all this to escape
someone like him.

85
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,707
I'll only take what's good.

86
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:45,837
You should.

87
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,214
That's how you'll make today D-Day?

88
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:52,010
Yes. First, I'll make sure
Su-min gets number four.

89
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:55,263
Then I'll get Min-hwan wasted.

90
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,933
Okay, I'll be rooting for you.

91
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:00,226
As much as I can.

92
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,395
Okay, I'll root for...

93
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:07,442
By the way, what did you say
you wanted to be earlier?

94
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:11,154
Lamb? Lamp?

95
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:15,450
What was it? Or maybe champ?

96
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,369
Was that it?

97
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:20,163
Not me! Get someone else!

98
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,998
Can't you get someone else?

99
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,499
Someone else!

100
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:28,629
You're out.

101
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:37,472
Who the heck has number one?

102
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:40,683
No one here would go in the water.

103
00:06:49,817 --> 00:06:51,110
Except for Ji-won.

104
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:59,577
I've never had nice things before,
so protecting this is so hard.

105
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:32,777
Sorry, Ji-won!

106
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:39,700
Let go!

107
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,203
You scared me!

108
00:07:42,286 --> 00:07:43,621
My bracelet's stuck!

109
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,873
Be still. Don't move.

110
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:47,542
That hurts!

111
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:57,510
Are you mad?

112
00:08:00,138 --> 00:08:01,347
This is just a game.

113
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,852
And this wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't tried to get me.

114
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:41,679
What's wrong with me?

115
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,556
Why am I worried?

116
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,548
Ji-won, you're out!

117
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:24,847
I knew you'd come back.

118
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:29,060
Did you really go into the water?

119
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:31,729
So this is why you impress everyone.

120
00:09:31,812 --> 00:09:33,522
Find someone who's glamping.

121
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,149
Thanks for this.

122
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:40,905
Hello, everyone.

123
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:43,824
I hope you're having fun.

124
00:09:43,908 --> 00:09:47,703
Anyway, I didn't know
you'd all participate so enthusiastically.

125
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,997
You're all so great.

126
00:09:50,081 --> 00:09:51,749
Now,

127
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:55,086
which female employee
will get to sleep in the camper?

128
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:56,879
Number one, come out!

129
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,098
BASED ON THE NAVER SERIES WEBNOVEL
<i>MARRY MY HUSBAND</i> BY SUNGSOJAK

130
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:14,647
Who is it?

131
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:18,734
What? Really?

132
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,821
It's me!

133
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:28,953
Please come forward.

134
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:39,213
I'll give you the key to your camper!

135
00:10:39,797 --> 00:10:41,048
Congratulations!

136
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:44,593
Find someone who's glamping.

137
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,178
Thanks for this!

138
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,651
Isn't sleeping in a camper
better than glamping?

139
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:07,658
The camper is right in front of me,

140
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:09,285
so why would I consider glamping?

141
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:28,054
Congratulations, Ms. Kang Ji-won
from Marketing Team 1!

142
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:30,514
Let's give her a round of applause!

143
00:11:30,598 --> 00:11:32,183
Congratulations!

144
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:40,608
Next, let's see which male employee
won the camper.

145
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:43,736
Who found the number one flag?

146
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:45,696
Please come to the front!

147
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,822
Come on up!

148
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,875
Happy you beat me?

149
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,548
You know I can't just sleep anywhere.

150
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:10,346
Same goes for me.

151
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:11,889
Really?

152
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:15,893
Then why did I think
you could sleep just about anywhere?

153
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:19,397
Because I did so for you.

154
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:21,690
What?

155
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,068
Nothing, I'm going.

156
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,453
Why are you like this to me?

157
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:36,497
What do you mean?

158
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,040
You won't let me win.

159
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,254
How much longer will you keep this up?

160
00:12:43,337 --> 00:12:47,425
I feel like I've become a bad person now.

161
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:49,343
You're too harsh to me lately.

162
00:13:02,273 --> 00:13:03,232
I don't...

163
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:07,361
like you anymore.

164
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:14,743
I tried not to show it, but I failed.
I'll just tell you.

165
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,496
I just started to hate you.

166
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,749
You whine and try to act cute.

167
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,502
You think my things are yours.
It's annoying.

168
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,090
You yielded them to me!

169
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,261
Is it bad I took that for granted?

170
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,806
You made me this way.
What am I supposed to do now?

171
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,229
You're right. I always yielded

172
00:13:42,313 --> 00:13:44,106
and let you whine.

173
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:47,359
So I'm going to stop now.

174
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,907
I'm marrying Min-hwan.

175
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:55,910
I'll start a new family.

176
00:13:55,993 --> 00:13:58,537
I can't be tied to you forever.

177
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,215
Thanks for bringing it up first. Bye.

178
00:14:24,772 --> 00:14:27,066
I feel like a bad person.

179
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:30,903
She's the one that was wrong.

180
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:34,281
She's the bad one.
I only said what I should say, but...

181
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:35,699
You're just too good.

182
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,456
You're not bad enough to hurt others.

183
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,174
But I know better than anyone.

184
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,847
You did what you had to.

185
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:05,062
Good job.

186
00:15:20,494 --> 00:15:22,746
<i>Su-min must want to punish me.</i>

187
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:27,501
<i>If she thinks I'm being like this</i>
<i>because of Min-hwan,</i>

188
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:31,714
<i>it's obvious how she'll try to punish me.</i>

189
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:35,259
-I can't drink anymore.
-What? You have to finish your shot.

190
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,344
-Gosh, I...
-Drink it.

191
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,550
What are you doing here?

192
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:22,806
Shall we talk?

193
00:16:34,485 --> 00:16:37,029
How did you know that I wanted...

194
00:16:38,572 --> 00:16:39,823
to talk to you?

195
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:46,455
I can tell by your face.

196
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:49,041
Did you drink a lot?

197
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,002
Do you have a lot on your mind?

198
00:16:57,466 --> 00:16:58,842
Just a little.

199
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:02,596
I feel uneasy.

200
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,650
Just a little.

201
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:26,328
Do you want...

202
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,000
to sleep with me?

203
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:37,047
Will it change anything?

204
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:41,176
You're Ji-won's boyfriend,
and I'm her other half.

205
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:47,474
Is it the alcohol?

206
00:17:49,143 --> 00:17:51,645
I only care about who's in front of me.

207
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:12,708
Me too.

208
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,712
I drank a lot.

209
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,323
I only need you too.

210
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:51,371
Maybe I'll push her off somewhere.

211
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:44,424
You can't check your wounds

212
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:48,804
or your opponent's on the mat.

213
00:19:50,514 --> 00:19:52,015
Focus only on two things.

214
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:56,770
"I decided to fight."

215
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,399
"And I will win."

216
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,659
I decided to fight.

217
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,662
And I will win...

218
00:20:47,654 --> 00:20:52,496
MARRY MY HUSBAND

219
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:56,788
The entire company is excited

220
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:59,666
about our marketing team lately!

221
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,711
Of course,
since the project's going so well.

222
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,672
We could go down
in U&K history at this rate!

223
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,759
I'm sorry, Hui-yeon.

224
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:11,094
Why would you be sorry?

225
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:13,388
The original sin is with Mr. Kim.

226
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,057
And the boomer is Mr. Yu.

227
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,560
No wonder this is so fun!

228
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,145
Mr. Kim isn't here!

229
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,821
I hear aroused elks always appear
during workshops.

230
00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:31,531
I finally get to see it!

231
00:21:31,615 --> 00:21:32,950
Are you insane?

232
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:34,534
-What? I want to...
-Let's go.

233
00:21:34,618 --> 00:21:36,036
Seriously! Just once!

234
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:38,038
No, let's go.

235
00:21:45,128 --> 00:21:47,381
I think I found Su-min so pretty.

236
00:21:51,468 --> 00:21:54,179
When I first met her at 15,

237
00:21:56,682 --> 00:22:00,310
I couldn't believe
someone so pretty and nice was my friend.

238
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:04,940
I was so proud. It was nice.

239
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:08,402
So I wanted to protect her.

240
00:22:12,406 --> 00:22:13,573
And Min-hwan...

241
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:18,954
He was such a jerk.

242
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:24,042
But I needed someone to trust and lean on.

243
00:22:26,837 --> 00:22:28,338
And after we got married,

244
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:32,092
I put up with him even more.

245
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,514
Aren't I such a fool?

246
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:41,810
It's all over now.

247
00:22:43,812 --> 00:22:45,772
Stop thinking about them.

248
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,358
Think about one thing today.

249
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,527
Kang Ji-won won.

250
00:23:01,455 --> 00:23:02,497
I haven't...

251
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:07,252
had someone touch my hand
this affectionately

252
00:23:08,128 --> 00:23:09,254
in a long time.

253
00:23:20,682 --> 00:23:22,684
Since I came back to 2013,

254
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:27,522
I've felt so lonely since I was alone.

255
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:36,073
So I'm glad I have you.

256
00:23:38,158 --> 00:23:39,576
Thank you.

257
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:47,959
To be honest,

258
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:53,340
my life is like a well-written novel.

259
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,055
A life without any worries or obstacles.

260
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,264
Just well-written.

261
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,356
So I'm glad I came back,

262
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:12,984
and I'm happy
I get to talk to you like this.

263
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,870
I should thank you.

264
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:38,718
You never keep it simple.

265
00:24:40,303 --> 00:24:41,138
Is that so?

266
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:47,936
What did you say earlier?
What do you want to be?

267
00:24:48,645 --> 00:24:51,439
I'll help you for helping me too.

268
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:56,027
I told you,
I don't want anything from you in return.

269
00:24:56,653 --> 00:24:58,947
I'm being honest, but you're not.

270
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,908
Then I won't let you help me.

271
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,494
Let's say I said champ.

272
00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:06,705
No, you didn't.

273
00:25:06,788 --> 00:25:08,123
Are you lying?

274
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,709
It's true.

275
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:23,555
Ji-won.

276
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:29,352
Did you sleep well when your boyfriend was
sleeping in a sleeping bag?

277
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:31,771
You're so cold-hearted.

278
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,524
Did you really sleep there?

279
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,943
Where else, then?

280
00:25:37,027 --> 00:25:39,362
My selfish girlfriend slept in the camper.

281
00:25:40,113 --> 00:25:45,160
Weren't you even worried your boyfriend
might be too cold overnight?

282
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:49,623
I was, so I went to you with hand warmers,
but you weren't there.

283
00:25:53,543 --> 00:25:55,670
I guess I was in the bathroom then.

284
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:56,922
Yes.

285
00:25:57,005 --> 00:25:59,132
You could've just left them there.

286
00:25:59,216 --> 00:26:01,009
Where's your common sense?

287
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:02,886
Where's Su-min?

288
00:26:06,473 --> 00:26:08,808
How should I know where your friend is?

289
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,312
Where did she sleep?

290
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,273
I don't know.

291
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,779
Something happened between us yesterday,
and it's uncomfortable.

292
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,698
Uncomfortable?

293
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:26,743
Did you fight?

294
00:26:27,494 --> 00:26:31,039
Women are always fighting
and making up. Goodness.

295
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,712
What?

296
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:40,006
Let's go eat breakfast.

297
00:26:56,523 --> 00:26:57,732
Su-min.

298
00:26:59,526 --> 00:27:01,111
This isn't your tent.

299
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:02,904
Where were you last night?

300
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:07,075
I was drunk, so I slept over there.
I just left my stuff here.

301
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,412
Did you drink a lot too?

302
00:27:11,204 --> 00:27:15,917
I was able to sober up a bit
after a walk with Hui-yeon last night.

303
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:17,627
I see.

304
00:27:25,385 --> 00:27:27,470
Let's not tell Ji-won.

305
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:29,681
What?

306
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:34,227
It's not like she'll break up with me.
She'll only get hurt.

307
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:38,940
You're close friends. It's unnecessary.

308
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,071
Let's just be realistic.

309
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:49,701
As you said,
things are too complicated between us.

310
00:27:51,911 --> 00:27:55,832
Instead of rolling around
in a messy reality,

311
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:58,585
let's keep it as a beautiful memory.

312
00:27:59,252 --> 00:28:00,628
Is it too greedy of me?

313
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,426
Let's go eat.

314
00:28:06,509 --> 00:28:07,886
I'm so hungover.

315
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,637
Okay.

316
00:28:14,684 --> 00:28:17,979
Why can I never get the best?

317
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:18,897
What?

318
00:28:20,315 --> 00:28:23,568
The workshop sucked.

319
00:28:23,651 --> 00:28:26,696
I wanted to sleep in a camper
or a glamping tent.

320
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,825
You'll have other chances.

321
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,994
Failure is the mother of success.

322
00:28:35,121 --> 00:28:39,000
You're right. Nothing's impossible.

323
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,002
This is so nice!

324
00:28:47,634 --> 00:28:48,468
Babe!

325
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:50,428
Here.

326
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:54,224
I'm so hungry.

327
00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:56,684
Let's see the food over here first.

328
00:28:57,185 --> 00:28:59,145
Babe, here. You like this.

329
00:29:04,526 --> 00:29:08,071
Wow! It's been so long
since I had an orange!

330
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:11,241
Here's a melon!

331
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,786
Avocado! Wow!

332
00:29:17,247 --> 00:29:18,415
Let's see.

333
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:20,041
Can this help digestion?

334
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,952
<i>I don't think it went as expected.</i>

335
00:29:56,035 --> 00:29:59,706
<i>I've been with Su-min for 26 years,</i>
<i>and 17 years with Min-hwan.</i>

336
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:01,916
<i>I'm sure something happened.</i>

337
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,959
<i>Then...</i>

338
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:08,965
<i>When I felt something was off, all my</i>
<i>ex-boyfriends broke up with me right away.</i>

339
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:13,052
<i>Min-hwan was the first to do it</i>
<i>behind my back.</i>

340
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:17,265
<i>I thought it was because of marriage.</i>

341
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:23,980
<i>But if Min-hwan is</i>
<i>more of a scumbag than I thought...</i>

342
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,611
<i>It means</i>

343
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,280
<i>it's not over yet.</i>

344
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:30,463
Why are you so full of energy?

345
00:31:30,547 --> 00:31:33,967
I hit a homerun!

346
00:31:34,676 --> 00:31:36,928
What? With your girlfriend's friend?

347
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,307
Shut up!

348
00:31:41,391 --> 00:31:43,476
Wow! Seriously?

349
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:46,771
But she's her best friend.

350
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:48,690
I'll tell you in one sentence.

351
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,651
Autumn was coming,

352
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:54,696
and the night air was sexy!

353
00:32:04,372 --> 00:32:07,000
What the... Okay, let's try again.

354
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:12,130
Can you handle the consequences?
You work in the same office.

355
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:22,197
OUT ON BUSINESS LOG

356
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:23,615
PARK MIN-HWAN, JEONG SU-MIN

357
00:32:23,699 --> 00:32:25,534
ACTIVITIES: JOMART TASTING EVENT

358
00:32:25,617 --> 00:32:26,618
What's this?

359
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,998
You're going to Jomart.

360
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:32,291
It'll be tiring.

361
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:36,378
Why me?

362
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:38,839
Shouldn't you go instead?

363
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:40,799
Right, you guys fought.

364
00:32:42,676 --> 00:32:45,721
Don't talk nonsense.
I have a presentation today.

365
00:32:45,804 --> 00:32:48,891
A presentation?
The slides must be all ready, right?

366
00:32:48,974 --> 00:32:50,059
I'll do it.

367
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,061
Is there a problem?

368
00:32:54,813 --> 00:32:57,066
No, not at all, sir.

369
00:33:03,864 --> 00:33:06,033
Mr. Park, shall we go?

370
00:33:06,658 --> 00:33:07,659
Yes.

371
00:33:17,711 --> 00:33:19,630
I'll get going, Ms. Kang.

372
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,684
Su-min's so smart.

373
00:33:33,936 --> 00:33:37,773
She's working so hard.
I hope she becomes a full-time employee.

374
00:33:45,906 --> 00:33:48,283
<i>To my other half, Ji-won.</i>

375
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:50,828
<i>I'm sorry I didn't know how you felt.</i>

376
00:33:50,911 --> 00:33:52,871
<i>You're everything to me,</i>

377
00:33:52,955 --> 00:33:55,707
<i>and I think it made me</i>
<i>blind to your feelings.</i>

378
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:59,795
<i>I just blindly believed you loved me.</i>

379
00:33:59,878 --> 00:34:03,048
<i>I didn't think</i>
<i>about whether I deserved your love.</i>

380
00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:08,470
<i>So everything you said</i>
<i>and everything you feel towards me...</i>

381
00:34:08,554 --> 00:34:10,055
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

382
00:34:11,265 --> 00:34:16,937
<i>Still, can't you forgive me?</i>

383
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:21,191
<i>You're too precious to me.</i>
<i>I can't live without you.</i>

384
00:34:21,775 --> 00:34:25,112
<i>I'm going to wait until you feel better.</i>

385
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:29,992
<i>If I knock and you ever want to reopen</i>
<i>your closed heart to me,</i>

386
00:34:30,075 --> 00:34:32,703
<i>will you smile as if nothing happened?</i>

387
00:34:33,912 --> 00:34:35,455
<i>You're my other half.</i>

388
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:38,792
<i>We can't just end things like this.</i>

389
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:50,429
If I hadn't seen the end,

390
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,474
would I have been able

391
00:34:55,225 --> 00:34:57,728
to not be swayed after reading this?

392
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,909
She's a good writer.

393
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,791
Maybe she really means it.

394
00:35:36,975 --> 00:35:39,144
-You're doing well. Hurry up.
-Yes, Chef.

395
00:36:08,423 --> 00:36:10,217
I don't want to see you face.

396
00:36:11,134 --> 00:36:12,135
I'm jealous.

397
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:22,396
My life is like a well-written novel.

398
00:36:26,483 --> 00:36:29,778
But if Kang Ji-won is
the one wrong sentence in it...

399
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:33,156
How would you feel?

400
00:36:35,492 --> 00:36:37,202
Don't talk nonsense. Get up.

401
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,707
It's short and crooked.

402
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:45,544
The content and writing is a mess too.

403
00:36:46,461 --> 00:36:49,298
So it keeps catching my eye
and bothering me.

404
00:36:51,216 --> 00:36:53,218
It opens to her page when thrown.

405
00:36:55,887 --> 00:36:59,766
There's nothing special
to find or remember in my life.

406
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,228
But only that part is so clear.

407
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,068
Nevertheless...

408
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:16,241
You're more qualified.

409
00:37:19,911 --> 00:37:22,331
Because you'll be alive after ten years.

415
00:38:27,604 --> 00:38:28,563
I'll try it.

416
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,538
What the hell?

417
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:49,084
It's so good. I think it'll be a hit.

418
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,505
This is our new product,

419
00:38:53,588 --> 00:38:56,800
so try and make people
taste all three products.

420
00:38:56,883 --> 00:38:58,260
-Okay?
-Okay!

421
00:38:58,343 --> 00:38:59,469
Also...

422
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:12,482
I'll get the allergy sign.

423
00:39:21,116 --> 00:39:24,244
Let's do two groups.
Those who shop after work

424
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:25,412
and housewives.

425
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:27,539
We have to check preference too. So...

426
00:39:27,622 --> 00:39:28,748
I need to go pee.

427
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:30,917
Mr. Park!

428
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,669
Why haven't you started?

429
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:48,685
What are you doing?

430
00:39:50,645 --> 00:39:51,938
Can you check this?

431
00:39:52,564 --> 00:39:53,565
Yeah, sure.

432
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,200
What the...

433
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:05,660
What is this?

434
00:40:09,414 --> 00:40:10,916
What do you think?

435
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:13,168
What?

436
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,006
We'll start the brief on Chef's Table,

437
00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:20,759
the meal kit project
set to launch next year.

438

CHEF AND MENU INTRODUCTION

00:40:23,845 --> 00:40:25,680
The winner of <i>One Dinner,</i>

440
00:40:25,764 --> 00:40:28,725
Lee Gwang-min's chicken dish
will be the pilot product.

441
00:40:28,808 --> 00:40:33,522
Production will begin in the 1st quarter,
and it'll launch in the 2nd quarter.

442
00:40:34,356 --> 00:40:36,900
Then we have Daniel Kim,
a traditional chef.

443
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:42,197
Along with Park Ji-ho who's popular
with those in their 20s and 30s...

444
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:49,246
Sir!

445
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:52,916
Well...

446
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:57,712
Thank you for trusting
and letting me take over this project.

447
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:03,385
Sure, you didn't trust me.

448
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:08,515
You just had no other choice
given the circumstances.

449
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:14,104
I'm sure that's why you suggested it.
Still, I was very thankful...

450
00:41:14,187 --> 00:41:16,147
I just wanted to thank you...

451
00:41:21,861 --> 00:41:23,321
That's not why.

452
00:41:23,405 --> 00:41:26,324
I thought you would be capable
of doing it.

453
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:28,201
Pardon?

454
00:41:28,827 --> 00:41:30,370
And finish your sentences.

455
00:41:31,162 --> 00:41:35,041
Don't trail off whenever you speak.

456
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:38,461
Just say, "Thank you."

457
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,840
Yes, sir.

458
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:47,012
And when you get both good and bad
feedback, remember the good one too.

459
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,472
Pardon?

460
00:41:49,556 --> 00:41:53,143
I said you would be capable of doing it.

461
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:55,895
Right.

462
00:41:55,979 --> 00:41:57,355
Thank you.

463
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:07,365
Well, then.

Wait.

467
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,613
What? Why?

468
00:42:47,572 --> 00:42:48,573
What will you do?

469
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,993
What? You wanted to do it! Let's do it!

470
00:42:52,077 --> 00:42:53,453
What about us?

471
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,039
Are you toying with me?

472
00:42:58,041 --> 00:42:59,834
I'll live with you both!

473
00:43:03,546 --> 00:43:04,381
What?

474
00:43:04,964 --> 00:43:06,633
Aren't you two like sisters?

475
00:43:06,716 --> 00:43:10,428
In the old days, competent men lived
with sisters. It's nothing.

476
00:43:10,512 --> 00:43:11,680
Damn it!

477
00:43:12,806 --> 00:43:14,766
-Let go of me!
-Come on...

478
00:43:14,849 --> 00:43:15,684
Just a second.

479
00:43:24,192 --> 00:43:25,568
Excuse me.

480
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:29,155
I'm the one in charge.

481
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,615
What's wrong?

482
00:43:30,699 --> 00:43:33,326
My husband's allergic to pine nuts!

483
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,079
But there wasn't any allergy sign!

484
00:43:36,162 --> 00:43:37,789
-What?
-What do we do?

485
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:39,249
Honey.

486
00:43:39,332 --> 00:43:40,875
I'll get the allergy sign.

488
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,089
He should go to the hospital.

489
00:43:53,513 --> 00:43:57,517
You must've been so scared,
and it's impossible to make up for it,

490
00:43:59,602 --> 00:44:00,812
but we apologize!

491
00:44:02,355 --> 00:44:05,942
How could a big company like U&K
make such a mistake?

492
00:44:06,025 --> 00:44:07,902
I just don't understand.

493
00:44:07,986 --> 00:44:09,112
We're very sorry.

494
00:44:10,822 --> 00:44:14,534
Let it go. Nothing happened.

495
00:44:14,617 --> 00:44:18,246
Things like this can happen
while you work.

496
00:44:18,872 --> 00:44:19,748
Yes, sir.

497
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:21,958
Since it's just us, we'll let it go.

498
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:23,710
If my daughter were here...

499
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:25,712
We apologize one more time.

500
00:44:32,761 --> 00:44:34,179
Toss the receipt.

501
00:44:44,022 --> 00:44:46,357
The ambulance fees and hospital bills.

502
00:44:46,441 --> 00:44:48,193
But compensation too?

503
00:44:49,903 --> 00:44:54,532
If he had such a dangerous allergy,
shouldn't he have been more careful?

504
00:44:54,616 --> 00:44:56,201
Everyone likes money.

505
00:44:56,284 --> 00:44:58,787
If the company finds out about this,

506
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,789
it'll be bad for us.

507
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:05,168
Paying them off is the easiest.

508
00:45:06,711 --> 00:45:09,839
Still, you spent
so much of your own money.

509
00:45:09,923 --> 00:45:13,092
It's okay. It's me!

510
00:45:13,176 --> 00:45:15,428
I've gotten a good return on stocks.

What do I do? Seriously? Damn it!

521
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:48,378
How about selling everything now?

522
00:45:48,461 --> 00:45:49,546
Who will buy it?

523
00:45:52,841 --> 00:45:55,093
I already put it up for sale.

524
00:45:55,176 --> 00:45:57,345
But everyone's trying to sell now.

525
00:45:58,805 --> 00:46:00,515
Then what do you have to do?

526
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:04,394
The transaction will be...

527
00:46:04,477 --> 00:46:06,521
Why are you asking? So annoying!

528
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:11,150
Then you can't get a cent?

529
00:46:18,324 --> 00:46:19,158
Ji-won.

530
00:46:20,493 --> 00:46:23,788
The situation is much more serious
than you think.

531
00:46:24,372 --> 00:46:25,456
I used credit.

532
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:29,711
Credit? What do you mean?

533
00:46:29,794 --> 00:46:31,713
Then what do you have to do?

534
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:37,719
What's the point of talking to you?

535
00:46:42,807 --> 00:46:43,808
Yes, Ms. Yang.

536
00:46:45,518 --> 00:46:47,937
Yes, I'm in the bathroom.

537
00:46:50,023 --> 00:46:52,442
You dummy. The credit isn't important.

538
00:46:54,152 --> 00:46:56,487
I even took out a private loan.

539
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,407
He didn't mention the private loan.

540
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:00,867
He didn't before too.

541
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:04,871
He never says things to hurt his pride.
He's not the type.

542
00:47:06,873 --> 00:47:09,083
Just in case, keep an eye on him.

543
00:47:12,211 --> 00:47:13,338
I loved you.

544
00:47:17,383 --> 00:47:18,551
What are you doing?

545
00:47:20,762 --> 00:47:22,430
Was it our fate

546
00:47:23,097 --> 00:47:25,433
to be a threesome, not just two of us?

547
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,979
Are you possessed? I don't understand you.

548
00:47:34,943 --> 00:47:37,487
I'm going to marry Ji-won.

549
00:47:38,696 --> 00:47:40,281
If we had more time,

550
00:47:40,865 --> 00:47:43,451
I would've fallen for you completely.

551
00:47:43,534 --> 00:47:45,620
But this fate puts the brake down.

552
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,581
Then...

553
00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:52,210
Goodbye.

554
00:47:55,588 --> 00:47:57,298
So keep my mouth shut?

555
00:47:59,884 --> 00:48:00,927
What?

556
00:48:05,306 --> 00:48:06,432
I won't...

557
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,773
say anything, Min-hwan. Don't worry.

558
00:48:15,316 --> 00:48:18,528
I just want you to be happy.

559
00:48:20,655 --> 00:48:21,739
What?

560
00:48:23,116 --> 00:48:23,992
Happy?

561
00:48:40,516 --> 00:48:42,643
Why does life suck so bad?

562
00:48:42,726 --> 00:48:43,936
Drink slowly.

563
00:48:47,022 --> 00:48:47,940
Hey.

564
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:51,902
Do you like me?

565
00:48:56,865 --> 00:48:58,242
Of course, I do.

566
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:04,373
Thank you for liking someone like me.

567
00:49:10,587 --> 00:49:13,924
You said to drink slowly, so I should.

568
00:49:16,343 --> 00:49:17,594
I'm sorry.

569
00:49:19,263 --> 00:49:21,807
I wanted to marry you next year,

570
00:49:23,392 --> 00:49:24,601
but what's left...

571
00:49:26,061 --> 00:49:28,272
is the Han River for me.

572
00:49:29,064 --> 00:49:31,900
<i>He's asking for money</i>
<i>in such a literary way.</i>

573
00:49:37,865 --> 00:49:38,866
Damn it!

574
00:49:39,491 --> 00:49:42,995
You're young. You can earn it again.
I'm in no rush.

575
00:49:46,332 --> 00:49:48,417
You can't say that.

576
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,504
Think of your age. What about kids?

577
00:49:52,588 --> 00:49:54,256
You don't want any kids.

578
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,633
You're more important to me.

579
00:49:57,551 --> 00:49:58,969
<i>That's true.</i>

580
00:50:00,054 --> 00:50:02,222
I'm a third-generation only son.

581
00:50:02,306 --> 00:50:04,308
How can I only think of myself?

582
00:50:04,391 --> 00:50:06,143
That's true.

583
00:50:06,977 --> 00:50:08,979
Then what should we do?

584
00:50:16,945 --> 00:50:17,863
Ji-won?

585
00:50:20,407 --> 00:50:21,742
Shall we get married?

586
00:50:24,995 --> 00:50:27,706
I can't give you a glamorous life
as I planned.

587
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:34,213
But we'll be
a better family tomorrow than we are now.

588
00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:36,799
I promise.

589
00:50:42,971 --> 00:50:43,972
Family?

590
00:50:44,807 --> 00:50:45,766
Family.

591
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:50,312
<i>I know you get weak when I mention family.</i>

592
00:50:50,396 --> 00:50:55,943
<i>What a crappy way to say you'll sponge off</i>
<i>me for life. You call that family?</i>

593
00:50:58,195 --> 00:51:01,323
It took courage for me to say that.
What's with you?

594
00:51:02,825 --> 00:51:05,035
Is it because I'm broke now?

595
00:51:06,036 --> 00:51:08,247
You're not that type of snob.

596
00:51:15,462 --> 00:51:16,588
<i>How funny, right?</i>

597
00:51:17,464 --> 00:51:19,633
He wants to marry without a penny.

598
00:51:20,134 --> 00:51:24,054
No, he must want to marry me
now that he's broke.

599
00:51:26,348 --> 00:51:28,142
This is the same as before.

600
00:51:29,143 --> 00:51:32,938
He proposed to me, saying
he'd invest with his parents' money.

601
00:51:37,067 --> 00:51:40,737
My debt started to get bigger
when that went south.

602
00:51:40,821 --> 00:51:44,950
But he was the person I chose,
so I thought we'd work it out together.

603
00:51:45,701 --> 00:51:47,828
He was selfish.

604
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:52,624
Anyway, all my choices were backwards.

605
00:52:09,308 --> 00:52:11,226
You'll get fat if you eat like that.

606
00:52:17,858 --> 00:52:23,155
I used to give a stray cat food
in college.

607
00:52:25,866 --> 00:52:27,826
I wanted to bring him home,

608
00:52:28,702 --> 00:52:31,622
but I was scared
I couldn't raise him properly.

609
00:52:32,539 --> 00:52:33,540
Then...

610
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:37,961
the cat disappeared one day.

611
00:52:38,045 --> 00:52:39,588
It was a cold winter.

612
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,008
I regretted it so much then.

613
00:52:46,386 --> 00:52:49,348
He was so tiny. Like this big.

614
00:52:50,224 --> 00:52:52,100
He had such a temper.

615
00:52:54,269 --> 00:52:57,397
He got chased away
after trying to fight other cats.

616
00:52:58,774 --> 00:53:01,818
He hated people,
so I don't think anyone took him.

617
00:53:14,706 --> 00:53:16,166
To tell the truth,

618
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:18,627
I was discharged early.

619
00:53:19,753 --> 00:53:22,089
It was similar to a car accident.

620
00:53:23,966 --> 00:53:26,093
Similar to a car accident?

621
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,409
Are you okay?

622
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:51,535
Yeah, I'm fine.

623
00:54:00,752 --> 00:54:01,753
Are you okay?

624
00:54:10,971 --> 00:54:12,472
<i>I ruptured my knee ligaments.</i>

625
00:54:17,436 --> 00:54:20,480
I jumped in front of a car to save a cat.

626
00:54:20,564 --> 00:54:22,149
I didn't get hit, though.

627
00:54:27,738 --> 00:54:28,905
Then...

628
00:54:31,325 --> 00:54:34,411
the cat you're raising now...

629
00:54:35,412 --> 00:54:37,414
It was the winter of 2005.

630
00:54:39,499 --> 00:54:42,252
A cheese tabby with a bad temper.

631
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,715
Doesn't like people.

632
00:55:01,313 --> 00:55:03,190
Are you going to work out?

633
00:55:04,232 --> 00:55:05,400
Hello?

634
00:55:05,942 --> 00:55:07,027
Where'd they go?

635
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,490
Was it you? It was you all along!

636
00:55:12,574 --> 00:55:15,577
I thought you looked similar.
It was really you!

637
00:55:17,204 --> 00:55:18,789
It's 20130419.

638
00:55:19,373 --> 00:55:20,415
My passcode.

639
00:55:20,499 --> 00:55:21,708
Come anytime.

640
00:55:22,459 --> 00:55:23,794
Really? Can I?

641
00:55:25,087 --> 00:55:27,506
Let's see each other more often!

642
00:55:29,466 --> 00:55:30,592
You're so cute!

643
00:55:39,393 --> 00:55:42,229
Either way, Mr. Park must get married now.

644
00:55:43,814 --> 00:55:46,650
Yes. Since he needs
to get money from his family.

645
00:55:48,944 --> 00:55:53,490
His debts are probably
about half a billion won in total.

646
00:55:53,573 --> 00:55:55,701
Maybe more.

647
00:55:57,035 --> 00:55:58,954
It was worthwhile lending him

648
00:55:59,037 --> 00:56:01,998
my money to make him go all in with TKU.

649
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:06,586
But at this rate, I don't think
he'll give up marrying you.

650
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,841
So I came up with this plan.

651
00:56:13,051 --> 00:56:14,094
Although,

652
00:56:16,179 --> 00:56:18,390
I'll have to get his crappy proposal.

653
00:56:21,935 --> 00:56:24,396
It must be so annoying for me, right?

654
00:56:24,479 --> 00:56:28,024
But if I want to live a long life,
I must work hard.

655
00:56:30,902 --> 00:56:32,821
He proposed on my birthday.

656
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:37,701
Everything he did was tolerable back then.

657
00:56:38,368 --> 00:56:39,369
But I hated it.

658
00:56:40,287 --> 00:56:41,913
One, two, three.

659
00:57:18,533 --> 00:57:20,327
I have to see that again?

660
00:57:22,954 --> 00:57:24,039
Terrible, right?

661
00:57:24,122 --> 00:57:27,959
It's my first birthday after being reborn.

662
00:57:37,427 --> 00:57:38,970
Ji-hyuk did?

663
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:40,639
Yes, sir.

664
00:57:40,722 --> 00:57:42,224
Oh, right. Also...

665
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:50,982
NECESSITY OF R&D

666
00:57:51,066 --> 00:57:53,068
TEST FLIGHT RESULTS

667
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:55,737
Wait, so this technology is possible?

668
00:57:55,821 --> 00:57:59,616
Apparently, the development team says
we can finally try it.

669
00:58:00,492 --> 00:58:03,745
As you can see,
those are the test flight results.

670
00:58:05,705 --> 00:58:07,916
U&K Aerobotics.

671
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,668
Shall I secure more stocks?

672
00:58:09,751 --> 00:58:11,878
If this is possible, of course.

673
00:58:11,962 --> 00:58:13,964
That's that. About Ji-hyuk again.

674
00:58:17,133 --> 00:58:20,178
What on earth is he thinking right now?

675
00:59:00,802 --> 00:59:01,803
Ji-won?

676
00:59:07,726 --> 00:59:09,394
Min-hwan, what is all--

677
00:59:12,898 --> 00:59:14,149
Don't say anything.

678
00:59:15,775 --> 00:59:17,652
Tonight's for you.

679
00:59:21,907 --> 00:59:23,033
My princess.

680
00:59:30,874 --> 00:59:31,875
Kang Ji-won.

681
00:59:40,342 --> 00:59:41,551
I love you.

682
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:14,960
Let me.

683
01:00:27,889 --> 01:00:31,726
<i>I'll do everything I can for you, Ji-won.</i>

684
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:34,187
<i>She won't know this is cubic, right?</i>

685
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:36,481
<i>But it's not like she'll toss it.</i>

686
01:00:37,107 --> 01:00:40,568
<i>I won't let them marry.</i>

687
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:44,614
<i>You'd hate to see me happy.</i>

688
01:00:54,249 --> 01:00:55,417
<i>Yes.</i>

689
01:00:56,084 --> 01:00:58,837
<i>Please use whatever means necessary</i>

690
01:01:01,047 --> 01:01:03,299
<i>to marry my husband.</i>

<i>Ji-won jumped in the water for me.</i>

01:01:21,818 --> 01:01:22,902
Ji-won.

694
01:01:23,695 --> 01:01:26,364
It's your turn to make me happy.

695
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:30,410
It was the best first birthday.

696
01:01:32,412 --> 01:01:34,372
I'm engaged!

697
01:01:34,956 --> 01:01:38,877
<i>I'm going to milk him</i>
<i>for the first and last time.</i>

698
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,420
She bought all this?

699
01:01:40,503 --> 01:01:42,756
My mother-in-law has high standards.

700
01:01:43,548 --> 01:01:44,632
<i>Why are you here?</i>

701
01:01:44,716 --> 01:01:46,176
Isn't the family meeting today?

702
01:01:47,177 --> 01:01:48,511
I'm happy with now.

703
01:01:49,054 --> 01:01:53,933
It's obvious what kind of family
she'll marry into.
