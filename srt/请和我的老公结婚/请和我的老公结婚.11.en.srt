1
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,103
Either way, the
inevitable will happen.

2
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:05,149
<i>After my dad died,</i>

3
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,735
<i>it feels like I'm
on a boat every day.</i>

4
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,947
I want to be happy.

5
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,590
<i>I want stability.</i>

6
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:32,343
<i>I want to step on solid land.</i>

7
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,400
I'm not the right
person for you.

8
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,030
Because I want you to be happy.

9
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,786
You'll regret this.

10
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,998
I won't regret it.

11
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,241
{\an8}EPISODE 11.

12
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,825
{\an8}BASED ON THE NAVER SERIES WEBNOVEL
<i>MARRY MY HUSBAND </i>BY SUNGSOJAK.

13
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,029
Hello.

14
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,906
My goodness. Yang Ju-ran.

15
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,699
Are you just getting to work?

16
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,034
That's just sucky.

17
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:22,620
Ju-ran, you can't be like this.

18
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,705
You're management now.

19
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,206
You must get here early.

20
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,543
Your computer should be
on before anyone else.

21
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,671
Also, I didn't want to say this,

22
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:36,634
but I saw your Jomart email. "If
you need anything, let me know"?

23
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,971
I mean, will you do everything
people ask? Is that it?

24
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:45,059
God, this is the
problem with women.

25
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:49,855
If you act that way, it makes
our entire team look bad.

26
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,692
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

27
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,072
Mr. Kim isn't even
the manager anymore.

28
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:02,660
When he was the manager, I never saw
him come early and turn on his computer.

29
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,413
I think you need to
address his attitude once.

30
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,041
It's been officially announced.

31
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,211
But in his position...

32
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,464
What position? He's not
the manager anymore.

33
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,801
I think you should make it
clear that you're his boss.

34
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:23,889
You may be okay, but it'll be hard
for new recruits to adapt to our team.

35
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,852
Excuse me.

36
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,649
I hate Kim Gyeong-uk so much.

37
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,401
- Yeah.
- He's the worst.

38
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,736
How could he act like that?

39
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,406
Does he have no shame?

40
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,491
{\an8}No sane person
could act that way.

41
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,285
Don't be ridiculous.

42
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,663
I've been promoted to manager.

43
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,707
How can I leave at 5?

44
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,125
Work ends at 6...

45
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,502
You may not know this,

46
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,462
but I had a temper as a kid.

47
00:04:55,546 --> 00:05:00,551
And my grandfather always stressed
the importance of patience.

48
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,177
I've lived by that...

49
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,847
When did I look down on you?

50
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:06,724
Do I look like a bum?

51
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:10,894
Is this good?

52
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,564
Yeah, it tastes like coffee.

53
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:17,276
- Yeah.
- Give me one too.

54
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,569
I need to wake up.

55
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:22,573
I think I have to leave
early and come back later.

56
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,419
Can't your parents help?

57
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,629
It must be tough for you.

58
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:43,010
My husband's at home. How can
I ask my parents for help?

59
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,971
But you practically
do everything.

60
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,725
- Worrying about your...
- My husband is...

61
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,273
I feel so exposed.

62
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,692
You're just like me.

63
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,737
I also worried
about my husband...

64
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,450
No, I mean, my boyfriend.

65
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,163
In the end, I was the
one who was ruined.

66
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,167
Hey.

67
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,297
I learned a lot.
Consideration has limits too.

68
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:25,094
Bad people won't appreciate
your consideration for them.

69
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,729
Is Mr. Yu not coming
to work today?

70
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:38,148
No. Do you have
something to report?

71
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:41,026
He took a day off
today. He's sick.

72
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,986
I think he's caught a cold.

73
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:46,782
It's been cold lately.
This is a first for him.

74
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,559
Open up.

75
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,356
Hey, I said I didn't need it.

76
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,568
You're so stubborn. Did
you have to make that?

77
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,529
You didn't do that for me.

78
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,741
It's for your own satisfaction.
I told you, I hate porridge.

79
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,413
Still, take one more bite.

80
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,249
I said, I won't. God damn it.

81
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,838
This is so like me.

82
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,775
Is he not home?

83
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,287
It's 20130419.

84
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,164
My passcode.

85
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:25,964
Pang?

86
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,134
Mr. Yu!

87
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,055
Mr. Yu!

88
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:34,890
Mr. Yu!

89
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,730
Get up. Let's go
to the hospital.

90
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,074
It's Kang Ji-won.

91
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,666
I can't keep seeing
you like this.

92
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,963
Are you okay?

93
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,840
A doctor came by.

94
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,468
I took my medicine.

95
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,231
Are you still

96
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:26,984
anxious?

97
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,321
Does it feel rocky?

98
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,577
I hope you don't feel
like you're on a boat.

99
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,255
It feels like I'm
on a boat every day.

100
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:57,222
My feet are firmly planted,
but the boat keeps rocking.

101
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,058
I feel anxious.

102
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,771
I can't be your land.

103
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,899
I want stability.

104
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,989
I want to step on solid land.

105
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,743
I want to be solid land.

106
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:23,415
I hope you're stable and happy.

107
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,169
<i>Because you're a good person.</i>

108
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,647
Were you that man?

109
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,496
I'm so hurt.

110
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,293
I knew it was you the
moment I saw you again.

111
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:17,552
You've always been in my heart.

112
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,494
Hello!

113
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,751
You're so much
like your brother.

114
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,463
What? I am?

115
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,506
That's such an insult.

116
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,883
You're mean.

117
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,718
I came here to talk strategy.

118
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:44,598
I just happen to have two musical
tickets. You two should go together...

119
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,187
Well, I...

120
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,190
Ji-won...

121
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,608
What?

122
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,531
I thought I was okay.

123
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:08,163
I'm not the wrong sentence

124
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,542
in her novel.

125
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:17,881
What? The wrong sentence?
What does that mean?

126
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,369
Hey. Are you okay?

127
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,498
Your fever's down. That's good.

128
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,710
I have to go to work!

129
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,758
Did something happen last night?

130
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,098
Wait.

131
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:55,145
You won't say last night
was a mistake, will you?

132
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:01,401
No, that never happened. I took
medicine, so I was out of it.

133
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,237
And I thought seeing
you was a dream.

134
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,199
You remember then.

135
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,289
What did I say last night?

136
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,584
You have a surprising side.

137
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,420
You spoke casually to me.

138
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,797
I'm sorry.

139
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,634
You said you hoped I
was stable and happy.

140
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,764
And that you recognized me
the moment we met again.

141
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,143
Also

142
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,855
that you continued to like me.

143
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,028
And that you wanted
to be land for me.

144
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,573
Ji-won, I...

145
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,953
I'm sorry I didn't
recognize you.

146
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,424
We might regret it.

147
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,764
But let's regret it
together if we do.

148
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,558
Then we'll be okay.

149
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:25,985
To tell the truth, when
you told me how you felt,

150
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:29,572
I thought it was the
reason I came back.

151
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,828
To be able to trust
someone again,

152
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,413
like someone,

153
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,417
and be happy.

154
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,798
I can do that, right?

155
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,872
{\an8}<i>What are you doing next weekend?</i>

156
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,464
<i>Us? Whatever you want to do.</i>

157
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,055
"Us"?

158
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,501
Let's talk.

159
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:47,669
Do it here.

160
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,215
We have to work together.

161
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:56,094
But treating me like I'm invisible
makes everyone uncomfortable.

162
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,388
You mean you are.

163
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:02,517
Then you shouldn't have done
something to cause that.

164
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,782
Damn it!

165
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,744
Let go! Let go of me!

166
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,751
<i>I asked to break up</i>

167
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:32,714
because our relationship isn't
the same as it used to be.

168
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,633
<i>I want a relationship that
everyone's envious of.</i>

169
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,262
Damn it.

170
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,014
Where did things go wrong?

171
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,776
Are the only women
you know on your team?

172
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:57,530
You messed up with
that terrible woman,

173
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,366
and this one doesn't
seem that better.

174
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,494
I'll be honest.

175
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:09,417
I didn't think my son
would get married this way.

176
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,881
Still, since you graduated
from Hankuk University.

177
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:19,135
She was a business major. She's
smart and good at her job.

178
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,221
And she'll work after she
gives birth. Great, right?

179
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,933
I liked studying, Mother.

180
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,729
Sons take after their moms.

181
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,397
Don't be too upset.

182
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,985
My mom didn't think I'd get
married like this either.

183
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,322
But I convinced her.

184
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:43,034
Also, she adores Min-hwan.

185
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,285
Yeah, that's true.

186
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:47,121
So your dad ran a
business in Busan?

187
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,040
And your mom's a teacher?

188
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:50,959
Yes.

189
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,046
Before my dad passed away,

190
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,799
our family was very happy.

191
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:01,302
I just want to live
like my parents did.

192
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:03,805
They loved each other so much

193
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,432
and were very devoted parents.

194
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:13,606
From what I saw in the cooking
class, I can tell you're smart.

195
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:18,152
I lack a lot. I hope
you can teach me.

196
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,824
Originally, a woman needs
to meet the right man.

197
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:26,661
Judging by your taste in
men, you're very smart.

198
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,665
- Eat up.
- Okay.

199
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:34,252
You're right. Sons
take after their moms.

200
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,963
That's why Min-hwan
takes after me

201
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,673
and is very smart.

202
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,719
You're right, Mother.

203
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,308
- Bye, Mom.
- Okay, I'm off.

204
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,019
Get home safe, Mother.

205
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,145
Okay, you too.

206
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,069
What?

207
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,196
Hankuk University?

208
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,991
Why did you lie about that?

209
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,370
I did it for you.

210
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,122
Ji-won graduated from there.

211
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:15,084
So how could I tell her that
you went to a no name college?

212
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,920
You wanted a fresh
start. Why lie...

213
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,088
Lie?

214
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,383
Does your mom adore me?

215
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,428
How can she when
I've never met her?

216
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,013
Goodness...

217
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,602
Let's not get
sensitive over this.

218
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,979
Everything will work out.

219
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,275
I think my mom approves.

220
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,570
I'll tell you the date
of the family meeting.

221
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,656
- See you then. Bye.
- What?

222
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,795
They booked a wedding hall?

223
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,380
It looks like they
won't tell the company,

224
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:04,133
- but it's called Crown...
- Crown Wedding Hall.

225
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:05,967
That's it.

226
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,763
That's where I married him.

227
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:15,019
It's the worst place
imaginable to women.

228
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:19,982
It must be over now.

229
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,906
<i>This is huge news.</i>

230
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:30,952
{\an8}<i>My parents told my husband
to work at their restaurant.</i>

231
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:36,499
We didn't say anything
when you quit your job

232
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:41,254
because we thought it didn't matter
which one worked outside these days.

233
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,337
But!

234
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,757
My daughter goes to work,

235
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:47,718
takes care of Yeon-ji,
and does the housework.

236
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,388
Ju-ran does everything.

237
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:57,228
I should go to work.

238
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:01,816
The head of the family raising a
child and doing housework is just...

239
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,361
That's why I'm telling you to
work at our <i>galbi </i>restaurant.

240
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:09,323
It's big, so there's so much to
do. Wash the grills and dishes,

241
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:12,243
get the meat, serve
customers, clean.

242
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,079
Sir, just hear me out.

243
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,791
I'm not the type to
do that kind of work.

244
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,001
What...

245
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,587
How could you say that?

246
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,505
You're not the type?

247
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:28,342
- Then what type of work is for you?
- Housework and parenting?

248
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:32,638
It's decided then.

249
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:37,059
Wake up early, take Ju-ran to work,
and bring Yeon-ji to the restaurant.

250
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,731
<i>You're amazing.</i>

251
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:46,819
Ms. Yang usually just puts up with things.
And you helped her take a step further.

252
00:24:57,371 --> 00:25:00,374
Isn't this great? So
refreshing, right?

253
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,923
I'd always come here when I
had a hard time in college.

254
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:11,093
To regain the strength
to keep going.

255
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:16,015
It's my first time
coming here happy.

256
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:26,317
Wow... I never though
I'd have this again.

257
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,652
Is it a hot spot?

258
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:29,946
To me, it is.

259
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,032
It disappears in a few years
because of redevelopment.

260
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,037
Do you remember?

261
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,997
We went to eat <i>gukbap</i>.

262
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:42,875
Wasn't I brave then?

263
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,880
I was so surprised.

264
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:50,925
To see such a luxurious
<i>gukbap </i>restaurant.

265
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:57,014
You were quite classy. You
gave off a young and rich vibe.

266
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:58,891
No way.

267
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:06,774
There. The way you put
the rice into the soup.

268
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,651
Anyone could tell.

269
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,863
Add the <i>jeongguji</i>.

270
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:15,324
That's right. I should.

271
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:19,411
No.

272
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,748
I was kidding.

273
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:39,889
This one. Chives.

274
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:43,894
This isn't a side dish.
You put it in your soup.

275
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,983
But people from Seoul
eat it separately.

276
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,735
That's just wrong.

277
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:54,904
All right.

278
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,831
Eat it with the meat.

279
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:04,915
Okay.

280
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,378
How is it? Better, right?

281
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,215
It's nice and spicy.

282
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:15,551
Eat up.

283
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:21,724
Mr. Yu, when you date, do you
say, "Today marks day one."

284
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,059
Or things like that?

285
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,564
When will you stop
calling me Mr. Yu?

286
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,026
Well...

287
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,862
Until you get
promoted to director?

288
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,324
I'm just kidding.

289
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,120
What did your
ex-girlfriends call you?

290
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,379
I didn't have to do any of that.

291
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:55,883
I don't remember
what they called me.

292
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,053
It didn't matter.

293
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,707
<i>The only name I know is this.</i>

294
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,839
<i>"Kang Ji-won."</i>

295
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:37,925
<i>"Ji-won."</i>

296
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:42,555
Only Kang Ji-won.

297
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,138
What's wrong with him?

298
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,015
Look at him. What's with him?

299
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,349
I don't know.

300
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,143
What?

301
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:31,353
Isn't he tired of it?

302
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,147
He hasn't changed a bit.

303
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,363
I'm here.

304
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,165
Hello, sir.

305
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:55,544
I'm Kim Tae-hyeong, and I have
been assigned to Marketing Team 1.

306
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:56,754
Nice to meet you.

307
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,006
Yeah.

308
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,591
I'm originally a manager.

309
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,012
Hey, you're here.

310
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:12,013
Gosh, this chair recognizes its
owner. It fits my butt perfectly.

311
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,023
Ms. Yang.

312
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,316
No...

313
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:21,028
Manager Yang, you'll
return it to me soon,

314
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,239
so use it carefully, okay?

315
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:26,617
- Hey. Work hard.
- Yes.

316
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,826
Yes, sir.

317
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,584
Assistant Manager Kim.

318
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,341
Where's your proposal?

319
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:45,594
I said I'd do it...

320
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:47,930
What did you just say?

321
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:52,851
Your idea isn't that good, so
you should at least be diligent.

322
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,521
Oh, don't worry.

323
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,897
It doesn't suck.

324
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,316
It's just not that good.

325
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:03,153
Are you insane?

326
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:04,947
What the hell are you doing?

327
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:08,325
You know hierarchy
better than anyone does.

328
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:12,204
You know how it works. You're
not the manager anymore.

329
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:14,665
But isn't sitting
here uncomfortable?

330
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,628
I need to know your standards
in order to meet them.

331
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:28,095
Why are you speaking to me like
that? Where are your formalities?

332
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,516
That's how you spoke to
me. I figured it was okay.

333
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,019
I'm your boss now.

334
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:38,606
But I'm respectful
while you're not.

335
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:40,399
It's strange.

336
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:46,113
So what shall we do? Shall we
both be more respectful? Or

337
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,325
shall I speak casually to you?

338
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:11,555
Mr. Kim.

339
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:25,694
Surely, only men look after men.

340
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,155
These little chicks...

341
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:31,742
How dare these chicks try to
break up a male friendship?

342
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,702
- So cheeky.
- Right?

343
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,330
Mr. Park.

344
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,707
Let's drink and go
to a sauna tonight.

345
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,919
Ms. Yang's dad is
buying <i>galbi </i>tonight...

346
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,464
But I can't go there.

347
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,257
I have plans at home. Sorry.

348
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,218
Really? Okay.

349
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,386
By the way,

350
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:58,936
you're not really in a
relationship with Su-min, are you?

351
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,688
No, sir.

352
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,315
Good.

353
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,735
What a great day.

354
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,906
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR PROMOTION!

355
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:17,162
Ms. Yang, congratulations!

356
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,338
Eat as much as you
want and drink!

357
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:28,465
Yang Ju-ran bombs!

358
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,100
Is that not it? This
is pretty famous.

359
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,063
Amazing.

360
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,774
Wow, you're the best.

361
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:47,901
- Great job.
- Congrats.

362
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:50,654
Thanks.

363
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:54,491
Thanks, everyone.

364
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:57,786
Shall we toast?

365
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,080
Cheers.

366
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,875
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

367
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,043
My, my!

368
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,384
We have prepared the best beef
for the best marketing team!

369
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:21,185
It's the full course with
all the special cuts!

370
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:24,521
I hope you take your
time to enjoy it!

371
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:29,401
- Yang Ju-ran!
- Yang Ju-ran!

372
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:31,278
Okay, everyone.

373
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,614
Please take care of my princess.

374
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:38,827
Princess! Hip, hip, hooray!

375
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,705
- Princess!
- Princess!

376
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:45,125
- Yang Ju-ran!
- Dad!

377
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:47,127
Don't call me Princess.

378
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:49,713
Daughter, don't say that.

379
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:51,215
Honey.

380
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,386
- Princess.
- Stop it.

381
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,138
I swear...

382
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:00,265
I'll do everything
for my princess.

383
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:04,353
<i>I think this is what
I really wanted, Dad.</i>

384
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,564
<i>Not being alone.</i>

385
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:12,653
<i>Standing on firm land and not
letting any wave shake me.</i>

386
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:16,156
<i>It was so easy.</i>

387
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,784
<i>All I needed was one
person on my side.</i>

388
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:24,414
<i>I think I really have one now.</i>

389
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,763
Go inside first.

390
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,640
- What?
- Your lips.

391
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,475
All right. Go now.

392
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,018
Bye.

393
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,242
Honey.

394
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:02,703
Where were you?

395
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,746
You could've said hi...

396
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:08,667
Sir.

397
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:15,549
Come on in.

398
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,018
Hurry up. Say hi.

399
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,480
Hello.

400
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:34,610
I'm Lee Jae-won,
Ju-ran's husband.

401
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:38,280
Well...

402
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,616
Please take good
care of my wife.

403
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,034
Yeah.

404
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,287
Thank you.

405
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:56,632
- Ms. Yang.
- Yeah?

406
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,426
How is Mr. Lee here?

407
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:02,054
I invited him.

408
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:06,391
I got promoted because
he believed in me.

409
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:11,980
Excuse me.

410
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,109
Mr. Lee.

411
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:19,613
- May I?
- He came because she asked?

412
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:21,990
Seriously?

413
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:26,119
Damn it...

414
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:27,621
This sucks.

415
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,331
- I can't do it.
- I can't do it.

416
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,958
- What the hell?
- What?

417
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:32,918
You scared me.

418
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,756
Unbelievable.

419
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:44,012
<i>Let's have a guys
night out soon.</i>

420
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,974
What's wrong with him?

421
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:57,317
I won't tell my
coworkers. Got it?

422
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:59,152
What are you saying?

423
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,989
- Hello.
- Hello.

424
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,908
This house is decent, right?

425
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:07,953
There aren't many houses
for rent when it's urgent.

426
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,413
I happen to have one.

427
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,581
Wait. Rent?

428
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,876
Rent? You said you'd
buy me a house.

429
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,462
After you live
together for two years.

430
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:19,965
- What?
- The couple is so blessed.

431
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,550
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

432
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:25,387
Why is it suddenly rent?

433
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:29,057
Southeast Asia is nice
too. I recommend Hawaii.

434
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:30,142
DOMESTIC HONEYMOONS

435
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:34,688
She's pregnant. It's not safe to
fly. There are lots to see in Korea.

436
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:35,772
Bulguksa?

437
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:40,861
{\an8}GOLD, JEWELS, WATCHES
SPECIALTY STORE.

438
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:43,238
{\an8}What are you doing? Go in.

439
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,949
Hello.

440
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:47,868
Get me a drink.

441
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,995
This color is nice.

442
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,330
Let's do the makeup like this.

443
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:55,000
- Okay.
- For the dress... Let's see.

444
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:58,545
This is too exposed. No.

445
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:02,507
This is nice. It's decent.

446
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:06,094
We'll pick this for the dress.

447
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,512
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED

448
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:10,015
WEDDING

449
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:12,851
YOU'RE INVITED

450
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,772
What is this?

451
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:20,609
Who picks these types of
invitations? What's with your mom?

452
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,235
Then tell her that!

453
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:25,280
You can't say it to her.
Why take it out on me?

454
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,075
How can I say that to her?

455
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:29,743
You have to do it!

456
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:31,953
Damn it.

457
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:36,166
Wow, items are free.

458
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,211
Seriously?

459
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:45,258
JEONG SU-MIN

460
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:52,265
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED PARK
MIN-HWAN, JEONG SU-MIN

461
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,226
<i>We're getting married.</i>

462
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:03,151
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

463
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:04,444
JI-WON

464
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,173
Can you believe this?

465
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:26,883
They're really doing it?

466
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:30,262
- Wow...
- I can't believe it.

467
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,431
U&K EMAIL INBOX
COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT

468
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,539
I think you should
check your email.

469
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,039
My email?

470
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,847
Sir, what's with the email?

471
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:14,973
Who said to

472
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,434
send out a company announcement?

473
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:19,895
Name and department, please.

474
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:23,732
A wedding announcement for Park
Min-hwan, Marketing Team 3.

475
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,693
Aren't you getting married?

476
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:30,780
Well... I am, but...

477
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,368
When an employee gets married,

478
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,496
announcements and
monetary gifts are given.

479
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,751
And the team will be given
days off to attend the wedding.

480
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:46,713
And you need days off
to go on your honeymoon.

481
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,757
That's all right, but...

482
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:52,844
It's my wedding, and
I didn't say anything!

483
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:54,763
Did I ask you to announce it?

484
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,640
This is insane.

485
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,518
It seems he's in a
difficult position

486
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:04,064
because he's marrying
Ms. Kang Ji-won's friend.

487
00:42:05,649 --> 00:42:07,734
I mean, it's frowned upon.

488
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,091
I get that you like Kang Ji-won.

489
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:33,468
But

490
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:37,264
you don't seem like the type to
meddle with Min-hwan and Su-min.

491
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:41,726
Scumbags like them have
nothing to do with you.

492
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,854
If it concerns Ji-won,
it concerns me.

493
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,750
He's laughing.

494
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:11,131
I've never seen him like
that before. It was touching.

495
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:12,924
You?

496
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:14,968
That's not like you.

497
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,555
I saw him in a new light.

498
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:22,809
I understand your intent,

499
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:26,813
but Ji-hyuk was no fun at all.

500
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:29,983
He didn't want anything.

501
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,068
He suppressed his emotions.

502
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:36,156
He had everything, so he
didn't really need me.

503
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:38,283
But this time

504
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:46,499
he seems like he's really
living. For the first time.

505
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,089
Ji-hyuk, you sent it?

506
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:58,219
<i>I couldn't stand it.</i>

507
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:03,183
SENDER: YU JI-HYUK
RECIPIENT: HR DIRECTOR

508
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,227
I admit that it was childish.

509
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,318
This is amazing.

510
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:15,820
What is?

511
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:20,450
That someone's on my side.

512
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:24,621
Someone to get mad
about things for me.

513
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,170
What are you thinking?

514
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:37,092
I'm thinking about kissing you.

515
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,386
What?

516
00:44:39,803 --> 00:44:41,304
Actually, more than that...

517
00:44:41,388 --> 00:44:42,931
What's wrong with you?

518
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,281
- Damn it!
- My goodness!

519
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:03,034
What are you doing?
She's pregnant!

520
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:06,371
Mom, please! You
don't know anything.

521
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,790
What is this?

522
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:11,418
Did you send the
invitation to work?

523
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:13,253
Work?

524
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:17,965
What?

525
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,055
This is...

526
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:30,603
It was announced at work!

527
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:32,355
What?

528
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:35,400
Everyone knows we're
getting married now.

529
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,193
How can I go to work?

530
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:38,862
How can I work there now?

531
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,447
God damn it!

532
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,116
- You're so loud!
- Why can't you?

533
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,035
What's the problem? Is
marrying me that bad?

534
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:47,287
Exactly!

535
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,832
Things like this happen! I
thought there was big trouble.

536
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:54,252
Hey! I need to collect
at your wedding!

537
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:58,965
Yeah, you're not alone now.
Think about our baby general.

538
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:01,885
Our baby, my foot! Why's
he holding me back?

539
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:02,969
Damn it!

540
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:05,013
You brat! That's my grandson!

541
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,056
Stop hitting me!

542
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,141
Seriously?

543
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:09,267
What about me?

544
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,144
This is hardest on me!

545
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,729
Damn it!

546
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:15,440
Go inside. This won't do.

547
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:17,817
What's wrong with him?

548
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:19,152
He's so loud.

549
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,070
Be careful, sweetie.

550
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:23,990
It must be too loud
for our baby general.

551
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:28,578
Listen. All men are children.

552
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:32,123
He'll go back to being
normal when he calms down.

553
00:46:32,207 --> 00:46:34,042
So don't worry about a thing.

554
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,753
Just think about
having a healthy baby.

555
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,924
I know he's hot-tempered.

556
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:45,803
Why don't you stay
the night here?

557
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:48,056
No, I should go home.

558
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,434
This is supposed to
be good for the baby.

559
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:56,064
It's great for brain development.
Listen to it before you go.

560
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,316
I'm off.

561
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:30,723
<i>I thought about it, and I
want to go to this wedding.</i>

562
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:33,101
<i>I'll pay 1,000
won and eat a lot.</i>

563
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,978
<i>Yeah, I'm going too.</i>

564
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:38,690
YU HUI-YEON

565
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,194
I want to live.

566
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,127
{\an8}KANG HYEON-MO I LOVE YOU, DAD.

567
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:39,751
Hey.

568
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:17,830
Are you ready?

569
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:20,041
Yeah, almost. Just a second.

570
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:22,043
Ji-won, wait.

571
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:24,712
Can you sit for a second?

572
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:38,810
What's this?

573
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:44,315
Kang Ji-won deserves the best.

574
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:25,815
{\an8}CROWN WEDDING HALL
MARRIAGE TO YOUR HAPPINESS.

575
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:37,535
It's okay. You're pretty.

576
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:40,538
I'm getting a family.

577
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:45,585
I won.

578
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:50,673
Hey!

579
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,341
Mother.

580
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:57,388
Is my stomach poking out?

581
00:50:57,472 --> 00:51:01,225
It'd better not. That's why we're
having this shotgun wedding.

582
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:04,437
By the way, where
are your friends?

583
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:07,940
Are you sure you told
them the right time?

584
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:10,151
Well... Yes.

585
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:13,196
Oh, your mother's here.
Shall we take a picture?

586
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,490
No, this is my mother-in-law.

587
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,868
I look good in pink.

588
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:21,704
Isn't this color so beautiful?

589
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:23,998
Yes, you look beautiful.

590
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,166
Thanks.

591
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:26,959
- Let's sit down.
- Okay.

592
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,384
The wedding dress is a little...

593
00:51:36,052 --> 00:51:38,179
Just take the picture.

594
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,933
Her bump isn't showing yet, but
it's best we leave no records.

595
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,518
Just take it.

596
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:44,602
Now.

597
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,354
Yes, I understand.

598
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:48,064
Smile.

599
00:51:50,817 --> 00:51:52,401
- Hey...
- Yes?

600
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:54,362
Where's your mother?

601
00:51:56,823 --> 00:51:58,157
Hello!

602
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:03,120
I'm sorry I'm so late.

603
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:05,164
Hello.

604
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:09,335
There must've been
a lot of traffic.

605
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:11,212
Yes, there was.

606
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:14,048
I only lived in Busan.

607
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,385
Seoul's traffic surprised me.

608
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:26,435
Su-min, you look so pretty.

609
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,606
I'm sorry I'm late.

610
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:33,568
CROWN WEDDING HALL

611
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,988
Why are you so late, ma'am?
I told you to come early.

612
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:39,031
Sorry.

613
00:52:39,115 --> 00:52:40,950
There was so much traffic.

614
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:43,286
There was an accident near here.

615
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:44,912
Whatever.

616
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:48,791
Do you remember everything? My
dad passed away. You're a teacher.

617
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,209
Of course.

618
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:54,547
He ran a business, left a lot of
wealth, and I'm set for my later life.

619
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:59,218
What about friends? For 11
people, 300,000 won each, right?

620
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:02,138
Hello! Thank you.

621
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:03,764
Hello.

622
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:07,476
- It's been so long.
- Congratulations.

623
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,936
- Hey.
- Hey.

624
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,607
You're going after all. You
said she wasn't the wife type.

625
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,525
Thank you.

626
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:16,152
Stop that!

627
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:19,155
Did you come alone?
Where are the others?

628
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:21,073
You know Yun-gyeong's temper.

629
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:25,870
She won't come to a cheater's wedding.
The other girls wouldn't come either.

630
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:29,206
Jong-chan's on a business trip.
Yong-go will be at the reception.

631
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,376
Reception? That useless bastard.

632
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:40,593
Wow. Who are they?

633
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:43,554
Friends of the bride?

634
00:54:06,786 --> 00:54:07,787
Congratulations.

635
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:12,833
I think you should
keep this to yourself.

636
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,630
You came.

637
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,298
You look pretty.

638
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,303
But this... You didn't have to.

639
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:29,225
You'll eat before you go, right?

640
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:39,193
Wait, that's...

641
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:41,569
Let's go.

642
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,915
I thought I'd seen her before.

643
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:55,459
Is that your
ex-girlfriend? Kang Ji-won?

644
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,295
What? She's a goddess.

645
00:55:00,423 --> 00:55:03,217
You got dumped, didn't you?
I thought you dumped her.

646
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,220
Damn you! Stop talking!

647
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:09,348
You're so annoying.

648
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:13,060
{\an8}COMPLAINT.

649
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:14,645
{\an8}What's this?

650
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,400
Are you sued? Did
you borrow money?

651
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:32,621
You'll be entering soon.

652
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:34,415
Okay.

653
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,422
That's okay.

654
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:56,187
Why are you so late?

655
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:58,481
I thought you weren't coming.

656
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,423
You caught my bouquet.

657
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,093
What?

658
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:32,640
Come on. You want the
bouquet? That's not right.

659
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:36,268
Min-hwan's parents
know your face.

660
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:39,522
That's true.

661
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:43,025
The dress looks good on you.

662
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:50,658
Right? My mother-in-law
picked it for me.

663
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:56,080
It's a little disappointing, but the
elders like it, so what can I do?

664
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:58,124
She thinks of me
as her daughter.

665
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:03,587
I'm glad you two get along.

666
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:09,718
Let's take a picture.
Call the photographer.

667
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:11,261
No.

668
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:14,557
I don't think that's necessary.

669
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:25,692
Congratulations

670
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:29,530
on picking up

671
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:33,701
my trash.

672
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,505
Park Min-hwan bought me this.

673
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:53,053
So use it or sell it, do
whatever you want with it.

674
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:13,282
<i>Trash?</i>

675
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:15,910
<i>She threw Min-hwan away?</i>

676
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:18,621
Damn it. Wow, items are free.

677
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:21,957
How can I work there now?

678
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:25,252
<i>No, that's not possible.</i>

679
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:27,421
I'm marrying Min-hwan.

680
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,381
I'll start a new family.

681
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:31,926
I can't be tied to you forever.

682
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:34,803
You're entering soon.

683
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:38,807
Now, it's time to meet
the beautiful bride.

684
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:40,267
- Okay.
- Let's greet her with

685
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:41,602
a round of applause.

686
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:45,481
<i>No, I stole them. The man and
family that used to be Ji-won's.</i>

687
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:46,941
<i>They're all mine now.</i>

688
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:49,860
<i>I won.</i>

689
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:53,197
<i>I'm starting over now.</i>

690
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,790
The groom, Park Min-hwan,
and the bride, Jeong Su-min,

691
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:30,627
will be wed in the presence of
their family and friends today...

692
01:00:55,194 --> 01:00:56,862
Let's smile a little, ma'am.

693
01:00:57,363 --> 01:00:58,364
Okay, good.

694
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:04,745
Jeong Su-min doesn't look
like her mom at all, right?

695
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:06,455
She must look like her dad.

696
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:08,499
You're right.

697
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,084
I'll take two more.

698
01:01:10,626 --> 01:01:14,004
Let's all smile. Sir, smile.

699
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,049
I guess you haven't seen her.

700
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:22,596
People hire guests these days.
Do you think she hired her?

701
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:24,807
Come on.

702
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:27,726
<i>But if my memory's correct,</i>

703
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:30,479
<i>Jeong Su-min's mom
is still alive.</i>

704
01:01:32,648 --> 01:01:35,192
Eun-ho, what are you doing here?

705
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:38,153
Su-min sent me the
wedding invitation.

706
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:44,451
But the problem is...

707
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,831
Could the friends of the
bride and groom come out now?

708
01:01:57,798 --> 01:02:00,467
I showed it to Ye-ji,

709
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,180
and they came looking like that.

710
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:06,265
Wait!

711
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:10,394
- The bride's old friends are here!
- Here!

712
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:17,568
They're sorry, so they'll
take revenge for you.

713
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:24,241
Are they your friends?

714
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:26,410
No...

715
01:02:27,453 --> 01:02:29,288
Su-min, I'm here.

716
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:31,582
Who's getting the
bouquet? Shall I?

717
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:34,793
Ji-won may be your other half,

718
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:37,713
but you're marrying
her man after all.

719
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:40,382
How could she catch
the bouquet for you?

720
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,342
Is that true?

721
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:44,470
She stole her friend's man?

722
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:49,391
Who else did you send
the invitation to?

723
01:02:51,018 --> 01:02:52,102
Take care of this.

724
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:57,900
What do you think you're doing?

725
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:02,446
Who are you people?

726
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,949
- I should say hi to her.
- No...

727
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:12,789
I'm Su-min's best
friend. The left ball!

728
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:16,293
Let go of me.

729
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:18,462
What... Where are your manners?

730
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:21,673
I'm her other best
friend. The right ball.

731
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:24,843
Where did these vulgar
people come from?

732
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:28,430
Vulgar?

733
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:30,015
What are you thinking?

734
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:35,896
We're like her eyeballs. And we're
the apple of each other's eyes.

735
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,900
Come on! Were you thinking
about something vulgar?

736
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,443
I'm the nose!

737
01:03:41,527 --> 01:03:44,738
They're the right and left
balls, and I'm the nose.

738
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:48,242
Do you know whose
family wedding this is?

739
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:53,705
The family who raised a dog that cheated
on his girlfriend with her bestie.

740
01:03:54,373 --> 01:03:57,125
But if there's more
to know, enlighten me.

741
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:59,419
What did you just say?

742
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:01,213
How dare you?

743
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:04,883
Stop! Mother!

744
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,136
How dare you!

745
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:13,058
- Mother!
- Kick them out!

746
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:21,567
Where's Min-hwan?

747
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:24,027
Calm down, everyone.

748
01:04:24,111 --> 01:04:25,862
Nothing's wrong.

749
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:29,616
Let's finish the wedding.
Where's the groom?

750
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:30,701
Min-hwan!

751
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:33,453
<i>You've got great friends.</i>

752
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:37,791
They were amazing too
when they bullied me.

753
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:43,672
If you're tired, shall we go?

754
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:45,382
Shall we?

755
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:47,926
You two can talk later.

756
01:04:50,596 --> 01:04:52,848
Yeah, you two. I'll
call you later.

757
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,766
Yeah, okay.

758
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:58,395
Aren't you going to eat? I paid
1,000 won for a meal ticket.

759
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:01,148
Let's go.

760
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:11,241
He must've made up his mind.

761
01:05:12,618 --> 01:05:13,619
Are you okay?

762
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:17,748
I'm going to eat. Do
you want to join me?

763
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:22,669
If you're okay with
somewhere else, I'll buy.

764
01:05:23,629 --> 01:05:25,422
Of course! Sounds great.

765
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:32,220
But my manager was
supposed to come too.

766
01:05:33,305 --> 01:05:34,389
Where is she?

767
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:48,278
I told you not to
come back here.

768
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:53,867
It's the weekend.
Why are you here?

769
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:01,750
I can't go home right now.

770
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:07,255
Yeon-ji's at home.

771
01:06:09,216 --> 01:06:13,053
And I haven't gotten
myself sorted yet.

772
01:06:16,515 --> 01:06:18,308
I've been so busy.

773
01:06:20,686 --> 01:06:24,648
So I didn't get a chance to
hear the checkup results.

774
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,903
And I heard it over the phone.

775
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:33,073
Calm down and speak clearly.

776
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:34,658
No...

777
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:37,327
Let's just leave here.

778
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:44,960
I have stomach cancer.

779
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,931
Great job. Go and rest.

780
01:07:40,015 --> 01:07:41,057
You too.

781
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:56,865
I came to talk for a moment.

782
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,536
But this is awkward.

783
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:10,712
Hello.

784
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:12,964
I'm Yu Ji-hyuk's fiancée.

785
01:08:16,635 --> 01:08:19,721
Wait... Ex-fiancée, I guess?

786
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:24,184
Since he called
off the engagement.

787
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,604
I didn't know it was
because he had a woman.

788
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:04,099
{\an8}<i>Did you ever hear
that I was married?</i>

789
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:07,769
{\an8}<i>How would it feel to have my
boyfriend marry my best friend?</i>

790
01:09:07,853 --> 01:09:10,230
{\an8}What do we do? Ms. Yang
has stomach cancer.

791
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:11,314
{\an8}<i>It's my fault.</i>

792
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:13,483
{\an8}<i>My fate went to her.</i>

793
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,986
{\an8}<i>I know Mr. Yu's a good person.</i>

794
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:17,612
{\an8}This is my fault.

795
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:19,656
{\an8}Park Min-hwan?

796
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,950
{\an8}<i>She dumps Min-hwan on me</i>

797
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:24,452
{\an8}<i>and goes for a rich man?</i>

798
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:29,958
{\an8}<i>I don't like anyone
touching what's mine.</i>

799
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:33,920
{\an8}<i>I realized I dreamed
of something too happy.</i>

800
