1
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,460
请在这里等待
Please, wait here.

2
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,040
事故发生六天前
6 DAYS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT

3
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,040
你本人好看很多
You look better in person.

4
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,840
大家都说我本人比较好看
Yeah, everyone says that I look better in person.

5
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,050
请问我们在哪里见过吗？
By the way, have we met before?

6
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,760
你有点眼熟
You look familiar.

7
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,430
我们没有见过
We've never met.

8
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,300
不过我们有共同认识的人
But we know the same person.

9
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,230
姜智媛抢走我的未婚夫
Kang Ji-won stole my fiancé.

10
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,610
唉，你是猪脑袋吗？
Goodness... Are you stupid?

11
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,450
你怎么能先提到钱呢？
How could you bring up money first?

12
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,030
我说过要装作好妈妈的样子，慢慢坑她的钱啊
I said to work her acting like a good mom!

13
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,450
我有这么做了
I tried!

14
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,290
可是她就一刀划清界线，我能怎么办？
She just drew the line.

15
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,830
她当着我的面顶嘴，不是普通的厉害
She confronted me right in my face. She's really something.

16
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,710
那你就应该要装傻啊
Then you should've played dumb!

17
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,460
算了啦
Forget it.

18
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,760
就你那种水平，难怪你会过得那么惨
No wonder why you live a crappy life.

19
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,630
可恶
Damn it.

20
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,800
敏焕哥
MIN-HWAN

21
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,640
你是从哪拿到刘志赫的照片？
Where'd you get Ji-hyuk's photos?

22
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,350
你问得还真晚，不过你知道要做什么？
Took you long enough to ask. Why?

23
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,350
都这么晚了，你在哪里？
Where are you? It's late.

24
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,690
我在问你问题
I'm asking you a question!

25
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,310
你有收到一个信封吗？
Did you get those in an envelope?

26
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,360
信封上写什么？
What did it say?

27
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,030
你怎么会知道？
How do you know that?

28
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,410
你的朋友寄来的

29
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,910
朋友？
"Friend"?

30
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,050
看来是富家千金，被抢走男人在不高兴啊
I guess a rich girl is upset because someone stole her man.

31
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,180
可是最近的小虾米都很聪明
But shrimps are smart these days.

32
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,390
他们都知道插手大鲸鱼间的斗争，会小命不保
They know they'll only suffer in a whales' fight.

33
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,140
开什么玩笑？
Are you joking me?

34
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,020
真是的
Damn it...

35
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,360
这里又是哪里？我居然就这样跟着来了
Where am I? Why did I follow her here?

36
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,740
像你这样想的人，就会一辈子当个小虾米
People who think like you live as shrimp all their lives.

37
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,070
尤其是你，你是淡水虾
Especially you, a freshwater shrimp.

38
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,200
你是连大海有多大，都不想去了解的一口小虾
A bite-sized one who doesn't know how big the ocean is.

39
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,250
你真的是…你再说一次
You little... Say it again.

40
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,580
那你就一辈子活得这么窝囊吧
Then live like a loser for the rest of your life.

41
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,340
一面怨叹为何人生那么苦，只有自己事事都不顺
Wondering why nothing goes your way and feeling sorry for yourself.

42
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,880
你讲话小心一点
Watch your mouth.

43
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,800
你含着金汤匙出生，不晓得小虾米有多可怕
You must not know how scary a shrimp can be, rich girl.

44
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,470
虾子咬人还是会流血的
You'll bleed if a shrimp bites.

45
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,900
我不是要你当个咬人会流血的虾
Don't just be a shrimp that bites,

46
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,360
而是要你当个抓大鲸鱼的小虾米
be a shrimp that can beat a whale.

47
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,280
你以为就只有姜智媛，可以一夜之间改变人生吗？
Do you think Kang Ji-won's the only one whose life can change overnight?

48
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,540
这种机会为何会找上我？
Why is that chance coming to me?

49
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,870
因为我生气
Because I'm angry.

50
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,630
看到勾引我男人的女人过得很好，我好委屈
She lives well after stealing my man. It's not fair.

51
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,590
而像我这种等级的人，忍受不了委屈
And people like me can't stand feeling cheated, you see.

52
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,010
我可以出气，运气好的话，还可以把U&K弄到手
I get to blow off steam and get U&K if I'm lucky.

53
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,690
你惩罚背叛你的女人，然后去过着，用你的月薪做梦也不敢想的生活
You punish the woman who betrayed you, and change your life with a fortune.

54
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,900
那我要怎么做
What do I have to do

55
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,110
才可以那样？
to make that happen?

56
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,700
那个嘛…
Well...

57
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,240
等到小虾米下定决心之后，我再告诉你
I'll tell you when you've made up your mind, shrimp.

58
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,280
第13集
EPISODE 13

59
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,370
哦，主厨正在美国出差吗？
The chef's on a business trip to the States?

60
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,710
不会，我可以配合
No, I can adjust my schedule.

61
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,670
如果可以告诉我，他方便的日期和时间…
If you could let me know when he'll be available...

62
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,790
对
Yes.

63
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,590
到公司吗？
To the company?

64
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,220
不会，我可以配合
No, that's fine.

65
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,430
对
Yes.

66
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,140
请问你看过我传过去的提案了吗？
Have you checked the proposal I sent you?

67
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,020
对，最新的版本
The latest version.

68
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,020
你这是在做什么？
What are you doing?

69
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,070
你比我想的还有野心呢
You're more ambitious than I thought.

70
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,190
刘志赫
Yu Ji-hyuk.

71
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,160
你怎么会知道他是业主家的人，而勾搭上他？
How did you know he was from the owner family?

72
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,330
他一副窝囊样，表面上完全看不出来
He looks like a loser. I couldn't tell at all.

73
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,620
你都知道了，我当然早就知道
You know now. I knew way before.

74
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,830
你不记得了吗？
Don't you remember?

75
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,670
我什么都比你强
I was always better than you.

76
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,090
是从什么时候开始的？
So when was it?

77
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,630
我真是受够了
I'm getting sick of this.

78
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,260
该死
Damn it...

79
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,850
他说那是公司福利的时候，我就该怀疑了
The company benefits. I should've known.

80
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,310
你和他是在求婚那时候看对眼了吧？
Did you two develop feelings the night I proposed?

81
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,770
所以你在见家长的时候才会大闹，在公司演出内裤秀，让我变成笑柄
That's why you ruined the family meeting and humiliated me at work.

82
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,770
一切都串得起来了
Everything makes sense now.

83
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,150
你从哪时开始变心的？
When did you start planning all this?

84
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,530
你说啊！
Tell me!

85
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,240
哪来的疯狗在乱叫？
What the hell are you saying?

86
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,910
要串得起来还要加上一点
You're forgetting one missing piece.

87
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,910
你出轨郑秀敏
You cheated on me with Su-min.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,580
这是这一切的起源
That's the cause of all of this.

89
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,170
真是该死
That little...

90
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,690
大姐
Ji-won!

91
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,730
你好
Hi.

92
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,030
请问有什么事吗？
What brings you here?

93
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,570
是大哥派我来的
Ji-hyuk sent me here.

94
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,160
这个请你吃，这是我们店里炸的
Have this. I fried it at my restaurant.

95
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,410
-请用 -好
-Take it. -Okay.

96
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,540
谢谢
Thanks.

97
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,580
大哥要你继续练柔道
He said to continue judo.

98
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,880
他怕你因为他的关系觉得不方便
If you're uncomfortable because of him,

99
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,510
要我把我的电话给你
he asked me to give you my number.

100
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,760
大哥是个很好的人
Ji-hyuk is a great guy.

101
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,600
个子非常高，个性也非常好
He's really tall and has a great personality.

102
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:48,810
还有啊，要是我没在社团遇见他，我真的会什么事都不做
Also, if I didn't meet him in our club, I wouldn't be doing anything.

103
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,480
他真的是个很好又很善良的人
He's a decent and nice person.

104
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,530
等等，那个炸鸡…
Wait, that chicken...

105
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,650
你有点炸鸡吗？
Did you order chicken?

106
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,910
请问您点了好烫原味炸鸡，好辣酱料炸鸡和好咸酱油炸鸡吗？
Did you order hot fried chicken, spicy chicken, and salty soy sauce chicken?

107
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,790
对
Yes.

108
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,830
那时我就觉得奇怪了
Something did feel off then.

109
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,420
而且他体育也很好，柔道很厉害
And he's so athletic. He's so good at judo.

110
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,670
等等，那个黑色的口罩
Wait... The black mask.

111
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,760
这些家伙在耍我吗？
Did these bastards play me?

112
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,640
姜智媛
Kang Ji-won.

113
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,780
我一定会让你后悔
I will make you regret it.

114
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,900
你要上来吗？
Do you want to come up?

115
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,110
什么？
What?

116
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,440
不了，我不怎么喜欢暴力
No, I don't like violence.

117
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,650
真无趣，为什么？
You're no fun. Why not?

118
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,570
你可以劈腿交往七年女友的闺蜜
You can cheat on your girlfriend of seven years with her bestie,

119
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,660
却无法挥拳，是吗？
but you can't throw a punch?

120
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,330
我到了这个年纪，可以分辨什么该做，什么不该做
I'm old enough to know what I can and can't do.

121
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,590
往后我们要做的事，没有胆量做不来
You can't do what we're about to do without guts.

122
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,560
那好吧
All right, then.

123
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,640
不过不管你是有钱，还是有受过训练
But no matter how rich you are and how hard you trained,

124
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,350
你知道男女对上，再怎样都是男人有利吧？
men have the advantage.

125
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,280
你都不晓得男人有多可怕
You don't know how scary men can be.

126
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,740
什么？
What?

127
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,370
哦，我是要跟他打哦？
Oh, I'm fighting him?

128
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,790
别再瞪了，真是的
Stop glaring, dude.

129
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,090
来吧
Let's go.

130
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,770
这是拳击，可以用脚踢吗？
This is boxing. Are you allowed to kick?

131
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,770
获胜没有规则
There are no rules for winning.

132
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,190
那你应该要早说啊！
Then you should've told me beforehand!

133
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,950
我现在比较喜欢你了，可以跟你共事
I'm starting to like you now. I can work with you.

134
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,000
今天我把税金问题都处理好了
I took care of the taxes today.

135
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,870
现在姜智媛在不知情的情况下
Now, Kang Ji-won has unknowingly become

136
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,710
成了韩国数一数二的不动产富豪了
one of the richest real estate owners in Korea.

137
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,300
这样真的可以吗？
Is this really right?

138
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,220
没有什么不可以
Why not?

139
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,090
这个是更大的问题
And here's a bigger problem.

140
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,260
我真不晓得这件事，是否可以不跟会长报告
I'm not sure about not telling the chairman.

141
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,270
说我什么都做得到的人是你
You're the one who said I could do anything.

142
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:13,980
我是这么说过
I did.

143
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,940
不过你到底是要做什么？
But what are you trying to do?

144
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,030
要不是我在管理你的健检报告，我真的会以为你要死了
If I wasn't managing your health checkup results, I'd think you were dying.

145
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,910
猫咪的事就算了，为何你还要为姜智媛的未来做准备？
I can understand the cat, but why prepare for Ms. Kang's future?

146
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,490
你们不是分手了吗？
Didn't you two break up?

147
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,160
我就只是想这么做而已
I just want to do this.

148
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,710
希望她在很久很久以后都过得很好
I just hope she'll live a good life later on.

149
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,960
反正她本来就不是属于我的人
Since we're not meant to be together.

150
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,800
姜智媛名下有一些不动产
Ji-won has real estate in her name.

151
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,680
楼房、土地、公寓
Buildings, land, apartments.

152
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,810
大约有八百亿韩元左右
Worth about 80 billion won.

153
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,190
姜智媛有八百亿韩元？
Kang Ji-won has 80 billion won?

154
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,280
什么？
What?

155
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,990
你不能这样就吓到
You shouldn't be surprised.

156
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,830
要是姜智媛死了，你可以拿到比这个还多一百倍
You'll get 100 times more than that if she dies.

157
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,620
一百倍？
Wait, 100 times?

158
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,880
你老婆和姜智媛的关系还真是有趣
Your wife's relationship with Ji-won is so fun.

159
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,550
她们不只是情同姐妹
They're not like sisters.

160
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,970
而且可说是真的姐妹
You could say they're actually sisters.

161
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,470
炸我吧，店长赵东硕
FRY ME JO DONG-SUK

162
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,560
我可以向你解释
I can explain this.

163
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,560
因为志赫是U&K的继承人？
Because Ji-hyuk's U&K's successor?

164
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,060
那你有钱吗？
Do you have any money?

165
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,990
爸
Dad.

166
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,450
我以为我这次能做得很好
I thought I could do well this time,

167
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,330
但是现在我不知道该怎么办才好
but I don't know what to do.

168
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,300
你有好多事都没跟我说
You kept a lot of things from me.

169
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,260
什么事？
Like what?

170
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,230
你找来姜智媛的妈妈要坑她钱，却失败了
You used Ji-won's mom to swindle her but failed.

171
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,350
你怎么会知道这件事？
How did you know that?

172
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,280
你这个傻瓜
You dummy.

173
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,070
给你照片的人所暗示的
The person who sent you the photos

174
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,160
不是要你去找她妈妈讨钱
wasn't suggesting you find her mom to beg for money.

175
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,540
现在重点是姜智媛有八百亿韩元
What's important right now is that Ji-won has 80 billion won.

176
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,710
什么？姜智媛有八百亿韩元？
What? She has 80 billion won?

177
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,840
刘志赫给她的
Yu Ji-hyuk gave it to her.

178
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,960
她真的是不同凡响吧
She's on another level.

179
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,730
姜智媛…
Kang Ji-won...

180
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,320
不过这对我们来说是好事
But it's good for us.

181
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,780
假如姜智媛死了
If she dies,

182
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,450
她唯一的家人也就是她妈妈，会获得一切
her only family member gets it, her mom.

183
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,120
我们得等到她死吗？
We just wait until she dies?

184
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,960
要是她死了
And if she dies,

185
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,670
她妈妈会给我们钱吗？
will her mom give it to us?

186
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,680
秀敏，你这个可怜的小东西
Su-min, you poor thing.

187
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,890
之前你都没办法告诉我，心里该有多么难受？
How hard has it been for you not being able to tell me?

188
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,230
你爸爸…
Your dad...

189
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,360
不是还活着吗？
I know he's still alive.

190
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,820
拿钱出来！
Bring the money!

191
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,370
为什么要这样？
Why are you doing this?

192
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,540
先生，你跟人借钱就要还啊
Look. If you borrowed money, you should pay it back.

193
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,790
你在当老板，还硬说没钱
You run a restaurant but say you have no money.

194
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,210
我们是要怎么办？
What should we do?

195
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,840
不是，你们听我说
I mean... Listen to me.

196
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,680
我这个月内一定会想办法还钱给你们
I'll get the money to you within this month no matter what.

197
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,140
开什么玩笑？
Are you joking me?

198
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,770
要建立信任关系，就要表现出诚意
You should show sincerity if you want to build trust with us.

199
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,900
先给我们一亿韩元，我们就可以再等
Get us a 100 million won, and we'll give you more time.

200
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,570
我哪里有一亿韩元？
Where can I get that kind of cash?

201
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,110
-我说真的 -嘿，把他抓起来
-I swear... -Hey, hold him.

202
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,110
你们为什么要这样？
What are you doing?

203
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,910
人只有一颗肾脏也能活
You can live with one kidney.

204
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,700
-什么？-肝脏也是只要有一半
-What? -If you have half a liver,

205
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,700
就可以再长
it grows back.

206
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,710
-你们听我说 -听什么听？
-Look... -Look at what?

207
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,090
要我砸店吗？
Shall I break it?

208
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,180
什么东西？
What now?

209
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,020
秀敏
Su-min.

210
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,560
你怎么会来这里？
What are you doing here?

211
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,410
跟你住在一起的那位阿姨在哪里？
Where's the lady you live with?

212
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,530
什么？
What?

213
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,650
这是可以让云彩航空和凯尔利特旅游
It's a stock transfer certificate

214
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,740
独立于U&K之外的股份转让证明
that can separate Cloud Air and Kelite Tour from U&K.

215
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,030
你可以完全掌握支配权
You can take full control.

216
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,780
我还以为是什么好东西
You had me curious.

217
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,870
要作为成全你那伟大爱情的代价，这可说是寥寥无几
It's a small price if it's for that great love of yours.

218
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,960
要我拿了就滚的话，也太微不足道
And it's boring if you want me to get lost with it.

219
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,460
你对我从来没有兴趣
You were never interested in me.

220
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,840
我这么做是要你以后也继续如此
I'm asking you to live that way.

221
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,970
是你对我没有兴趣
No, you weren't interested in me, but weren't

222
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,180
但你本来也没有打算要解除婚约
going to call off the engagement.

223
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,430
我们应该会在适当的时机举行婚礼
We would've gotten married when time was right

224
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,230
然后互不关心，各自过自己的生活
and lived our own lives, indifferent to each other.

225
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,660
我喜欢这样
This is nice.

226
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,210
这样就像是害怕未婚妻有别的男人，在嫉妒一样
Like a jealous man afraid his fiancée has another man...

227
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,550
我喜欢男人坐立不安
I like it when a man's restless.

228
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,140
要试看看吗？
Do you want to try it?

229
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,060
挖彼此的弱点，互相折磨，让对方坐立不安？
Finding each other's weakness and tormenting one another?

230
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,820
别忘了你做得到，我也做得到
Don't forget that I can do whatever you can do.

231
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
不
No...

232
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,070
我应该会做得比你好吧？
Won't I be better at it?

233
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,590
不管现在你正在做什么，收下这个，然后停止
Take this and stop what you're doing.

234
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,380
我不晓得为何你会认为我在做什么
I don't know why you think I'd do anything.

235
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,470
你讲这种话，有点伤人
Things you just said, it hurts.

236
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,310
还有即使没有这个，我也什么都不会做
Even without this, I won't do anything.

237
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,310
我只是了解到接受解除婚约是个错误
I realized breaking off the engagement was a mistake.

238
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,980
然后想要挽回而已
I just want to take it back.

239
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,020
你尽量玩吧
Have your fun.

240
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,740
爱情总有一天会结束
Love always comes to an end.

241
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,950
到时候，你再回到我身边
When yours does, come back to me.

242
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,760
李室长，有事需要请你帮忙打听
There's something you need to look into.

243
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,110
出来
Come out.

244
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,150
怎样？事情怎么样了？
What... What just happened?

245
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,530
刚才那是刘志赫吧？
Wasn't that Ji-hyuk?

246
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,240
我们被发现了吗？
Are we caught?

247
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,490
你知道云彩航空，和凯尔利特旅游的市值多少吗？
Do you know how much Cloud Air and Kelite Tour are worth?

248
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,040
什么？
What?

249
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,580
两个加起来
When combined,

250
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,540
大概有四兆韩元
about four trillion.

251
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,670
四兆韩元？
Four trillion won?

252
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,970
可是他却随便扔给我，气死人
But he just gave it to me. It's so upsetting.

253
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,390
帮我杀了姜智媛，我会收拾善后
Kill Kang Ji-won. I'll clean up the mess.

254
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,940
你可以拿到足以生活一辈子的钱
You'll have enough money for the rest of your life.

255
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,900
而我得到刘志赫
I'll get Yu Ji-hyuk.

256
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,070
并且我会让他后悔把这种东西扔给我
And I'll make sure he regrets offering me something like that.

257
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,710
总共是一亿五千万韩元
It's 150 million won.

258
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,630
这笔钱先拿去应急
Pay off your urgent debts first.

259
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,420
等到事情结束，我会帮你们还清债务
I'll pay the rest off when it's over.

260
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,170
让你们有钱可以游山玩水一辈子
And I'll make sure you get a fortune.

261
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:52,430
你…这些钱是哪来的？
Where... Where did you get this money?

262
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,260
你想这会是我的吗？
Do you think it's mine?

263
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,270
你又没有为我做过什么
What did you ever do for me?

264
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,150
你们听好了，给这笔钱的人
Listen up. This money...

265
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,610
能够神不知鬼不觉地把你们俩给埋了
was given by someone who could bury you without anyone knowing.

266
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,330
你们只要照做，这种穷酸的生活就会结束了
Do as you're told, and this shitty life is over.

267
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,620
否则…
Or...

268
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,750
我们全都会一起死
we'll all die together.

269
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,210
你们做不做得到？
Can you do it or not?

270
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,420
做得到
We can.

271
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,180
嗯
Yeah.

272
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,760
好，做得好
Okay, good job.

273
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,060
不过你没有提起我吧？
You didn't tell them about me, right?

274
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,690
对啦，他们不知道我们结婚了
Yeah, they don't know we're married anyway.

275
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,900
没必要把事情搞得那么复杂
Let's not make things uncomfortable.

276
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,070
而且办完这件事之后，我也不会跟他们见面
I won't see them again after this.

277
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:50,110
都已经把要做的每个步骤都写下来了，还会办不到吗？
Of course. We're telling them what to do, step by step.

278
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,450
已经讲好了，立刻开始吗？
They said yes. Shall I get started?

279
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,160
嗯，加油
Yeah, good luck.

280
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,420
我相信你
I'll trust you.

281
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,090
好
Okay.

282
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,970
-我去去就回 -好
-I'll be back. -Okay.

283
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,150
男人都不会对睡过的女人有戒心
Men are not wary of women they slept with.

284
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,730
为什么？
Why is that?

285
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,570
这个周末是姜智媛父亲的忌日
Ji-won's dad's death anniversary is this weekend.

286
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,570
那就把日期订在那一天吧
We can make that D-day then.

287
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,370
她不是会去看她爸吗？
She'll go see her dad.

288
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,210
盛星林园
MEMORIAL ARBORETUM

289
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,140
对不起，我是个傻女儿
I'm sorry I'm such a fool.

290
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,780
喂？李室长
Yes, Mr. Lee?

291
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,200
宥拉没有任何行动
Yu-ra hasn't made any moves.

292
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,910
可是我想我们做错一件事了
But I think we made a mistake.

293
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,080
姜智媛的母亲借名在位于京畿道的，重机械业者那里非法借了一辆翻斗车
Ji-won's mother illegally rented a dump truck under a borrowed name.

294
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,090
-意思是… -假如姜智媛死了
-That means-- -If she dies,

295
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,380
你转到她名下的不动产
all of the real estate in her name

296
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,920
全都会落到她母亲手上
will go to her mother.

297
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,970
现在那台翻斗车在哪里？
Where's the dump truck now?

298
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,310
根据目前的全球定位系统显示
According to the current GPS,

299
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,270
那台车正行驶在424号公路上
it's going down Route 424.

300
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,630
现在大姐正离开盛星林园
Ji-won's leaving the arboretum now.

301
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,300
搞什么？
What the heck?

302
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,430
这是怎样？
What is this?

303
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,480
喂？
Yes.

304
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,440
信宇，拦住姜智媛，不要让她开车
Sin-u, stop Ji-won. Don't let her drive.

305
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,570
什么？大哥，我正要从林园出去，车子就抛锚了
What? But Ji-hyuk, my car broke down in the parking lot.

306
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,320
大姐已经开走了
Ji-won already drove off.

307
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,490
这里出去就是424号公路
Route 424 is right outside of here.

308
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,950
喂？
Hello?

309
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:51,000
如同走在雾中，有时模糊不清的事物会忽然变得清晰
There are times when things that were foggy and unclear become clear.

310
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,970
我是为了什么回到这个时候？
Why did I come back to this time?

311
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,690
要是我早知道，我就会守护她
If I had, I'd have protected her.

312
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:15,110
因此要是我有机会，我会确实抓住
So if I get a chance, I'll take it.

313
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,280
如果我不能跟她在一起，为何我会回来呢？
If I can't be with her, why did I come back?

314
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,000
智媛
JI-WON

315
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,330
您拨的电话无法接听，将转接到语音信箱
The person you have called is unavailable.

316
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,590
哔声后请留言
Leave a message after the beep.

317
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,050
现在开始我要告诉你的事，我没想到会是这么告诉你
I'll tell you something I didn't expect to tell you like this.

318
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,300
我死于2023年
I died in 2023.

319
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,810
是一场车祸
It was a car accident.

320
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,980
当我睁开眼睛，就是2013年
And when I opened my eyes, I was in 2013.

321
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,160
接着我见到活着的你
Then I met you again.

322
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,750
误以为自己头一次可以拥有幸福
I mistakenly believed I could be happy.

323
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:18,170
可是我无法守护你到最后
But I can't protect you forever.

324
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,180
因为我不晓得我何时会死
I could die at any time.

325
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,940
我抗拒不了，可以短暂跟你在一起的诱惑
I couldn't resist the temptation to be with you.

326
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,110
我喜欢你
I like you.

327
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,280
我喜欢你
I like you.

328
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,170
我真的很喜欢你
I like you so much.

329
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,340
所以…
So...

330
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,300
对不起
I'm sorry.

331
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,350
虽然我是为了守护你而来
I came here to protect you,

332
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,940
但要是我知道这一刻会来得这么快
but if I knew it'd happen so soon,

333
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,780
我就不会牵起你的手
I wouldn't have held your hand.

334
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,820
希望你不要自责
Don't blame yourself.

335
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,530
这只是该发生的事发生了而已
The inevitable just happened.

336
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,990
您有一则新留言
New voice message.

337
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,410
我死于2023年
I died in 2023.

338
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,540
是一场车祸
It was a car accident.

339
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,920
怎么都联络不上他？
Why won't he pick up?

340
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,840
不是撞上去就结束了吗？
All he had to do was crash into her!

341
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,130
他刚才就应该要打来了
He should've called way earlier.

342
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,840
为何都联络不上他？
Why can't I reach him?

343
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,890
撞上去就结束的是你女儿的性命
You're talking about your daughter's life ending.

344
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,850
你好像都不担心那个
I guess you're not worried.

345
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,310
你这丫头
You brat.

346
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,060
你讲话还讲得真难听
You put it in such a mean way.

347
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,860
你知道比血缘更可怕的是什么吗？
Do you know what's scarier than blood?

348
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,770
那就是钱
It's money.

349
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,530
真搞笑
Don't make me laugh.

350
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,780
要是你在乎的是钱，就不会跟我爸在一起了
You wouldn't be with my dad then.

351
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,570
他是那种虚有其表，油嘴滑舌
He's pretentious, and everything he says is a lie.

352
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:20,200
好像一副会为你牺牲奉献的样子，结果什么都没为你做的人
He offers you everything, but he never does anything for you.

353
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:23,670
看看你，居然这样说你爸爸
Listen to you, talking about your father like that.

354
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,420
你知道我爸爸…
Do you have any idea

355
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,340
装作有多爱我的样子吗？
how much my dad pretended to love me?

356
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,260
可是回想起来，实际上他什么都没为我做过
But when I think about it, he's never actually done anything for me.

357
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,060
他对你不会这样吗？
What about you?

358
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,770
他应该老是做什么都一事无成
I'm sure nothing he does goes right.

359
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,810
幸好你不用为他收拾善后
Maybe you even clean up his mess.

360
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,870
你怎么会这副模样？
Why do you look like that?

361
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,670
因为他是一事无成的人
Because he never does anything right!

362
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,630
看来你压力很大哦
You must be under a lot of stress.

363
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,300
这里好僵硬
This part is so stiff.

364
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,470
你好会按摩哦
You're good at this.

365
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,140
由于刘志赫部长冲出来，代替她被撞，被送到唯一医院了
Mr. Yu cut in and got hurt, and is now in Yuil Medical Center.

366
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,610
驾驶立刻逃离现场，目前正在寻找中
And the driver ran from the scene.

367
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,400
刘志赫怎么会出现在那里？
How could Ji-hyuk be there?

368
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,820
我正在了解中，很抱歉
I'm looking into it. I'm sorry.

369
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,530
真是羡慕你
It must be nice.

370
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:40,160
你只要道歉就没事了，我还得收拾烂摊子
All you have to do is apologize since I clean up the mess.

371
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,210
等等
Wait.

372
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:48,250
那个女的和驾驶的女儿，在旅馆等他吧？
Isn't the woman and his daughter at the hotel?

373
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,880
那么他应该会去那边
Then the driver must've gone there.

374
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,050
先从那附近找
Search that area first.

375
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,760
你快带着你老婆回家去
Take your wife and go home.

376
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,470
什么事都没发生过
Nothing happened.

377
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,970
在我联络你之前，什么事都别做
Don't do anything until I call.

378
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,680
好
Okay.

379
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,440
你疯啦？
Are you insane?

380
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,400
我爸又抛弃我了
My dad abandoned me again.

381
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,530
他带着那个阿姨逃走了！
He ran away with that woman!

382
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,830
我做错了什么？
What did I do wrong?

383
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,410
我做错了什么？
What did I do wrong?

384
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,830
全都是姜智媛害的
It's all Ji-won's fault!

385
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,670
我要把他们全杀了
I'm going to kill them all!

386
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,840
全都是姜智媛害的！我要把她也杀了
It's Ji-won's fault! I'll kill her too!

387
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,680
我要把他们都杀了！
I'll kill everyone!

388
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:49,230
郑秀敏！清醒过来，还没有结束
Jeong Su-min! Snap out of it. It's not over yet.

389
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,310
那个女的是我们这边的人
That woman's on our side.

390
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,360
有我们这种人不知道的世界
There's a world people like us don't know about.

391
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,200
我们就照着吩咐去做
Let's just do as we're told.

392
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,870
她说她会收拾善后
She said she'd clean up the mess.

393
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,370
要我们先待在家里
We were home all night.

394
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,700
就算有警察上门
If the cops come,

395
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,330
你也要说你不知道你爸在做什么
you don't know about your dad.

396
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,830
知道没？
Got it?

397
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:16,880
嗯
Well?

398
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,260
他在一个钟头前抵达急诊室之后，马上就进手术室了
He arrived at the ER an hour ago and went into surgery.

399
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,300
最顶尖的医疗团队正在抢救中，我们边看病历边向您说明情况
Top doctors are on him. I'll explain with the chart.

400
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,850
手术时间，麻醉时间
OPERATION TIME, ANESTHESIA TIME

401
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,070
手术时间会不会太久了？
Isn't the surgery taking too long?

402
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,860
我哥会不会…
What if my brother...

403
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,910
不会
No.

404
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,320
这只是该发生的事发生了而已
The inevitable just happened.

405
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,620
绝对不会发生那种事
That will never happen.

406
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,710
所以不要往不好的方向想
So don't think that way.

407
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,680
肇事驾驶名叫做郑万植
The driver's name is Jeong Man-sik.

408
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,230
我们得先找到他
We must get him first.

409
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,810
同时也向警方和电信公司请求合作，取得裴熙淑的资料
And get information on Bae Hui-suk too from the police.

410
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,900
这绝对不可能是郑秀敏，自己一个人做出来的事
Jeong Su-min could never have done this on her own.

411
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,200
刚才你是说郑秀敏吗？
Did you just say Jeong Su-min?

412
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,580
这不是单纯的车祸，对吧？
It wasn't just a car accident, was it?

413
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,970
可是他们杀了我又得不到什么
But she won't gain anything from killing me.

414
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,390
她也没有那个胆敢杀人
And she's not daring enough to kill.

415
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:52,060
我们认为有人在背后指使，正在了解中
We're looking into it assuming there's someone behind this.

416
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,230
你死后他们能得到的东西…
And what they gain if you die is...

417
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,730
是志赫给的
something Ji-hyuk made.

418
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,410
他这么做是为了你好
It was supposed to be for you.

419
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,960
人不会轻易改变
People don't change easily.

420
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:27,050
即使我曾走到了最后才回来，我又打算要逃跑
I came back after seeing the end, but I tried to run away again.

421
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,430
我没有报到仇
I didn't get revenge.

422
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,270
我什么都没有做成
I haven't done anything.

423
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,850
而部长…
And Mr. Yu...

424
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,360
我们已经尽了全力
We did everything we could.

425
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,450
可是还不晓得他哪时会恢复意识
But we don't know when he'll wake up.

426
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,530
你得救活他啊
You have to save him.

427
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:54,200
你在说什么？你得想尽办法救活他
What are you talking about? You have to save him at all cost!

428
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:01,920
可是我无法守护你到最后
But I can't protect you forever.

429
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,720
因为我不晓得我何时会死
I could die at any time.

430
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,690
所以请你忘了所有不好的事
So forget all the bad things

431
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,110
只记得美好的事
and remember the good.

432
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,740
过得充满幸福
I hope you're happy.

433
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,600
另一半
OTHER HALF

434
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:18,040
你真的不能放过我吗？
Can you really not leave me alone?

435
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,210
我从以前就很想问你，现在终于可以问你了
I've wanted to ask you for some time, and I finally can.

436
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,800
你怎么会想要杀人？
How could you think of killing someone?

437
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,260
为了钱？
Was it for money?

438
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,770
你在说什么？
What are you saying?

439
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,860
你从哪里听到了什么，怎么会说这么可怕的话？
Why would you say something so scary?

440
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,110
我才要问你
What about you?

441
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,070
你不知道你对我做了什么吗？
Don't you know what you did to me?

442
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,790
我…
I...

443
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,960
因为你的关系，流产了
miscarried because of you.

444
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,010
别胡说了
That's nonsense.

445
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,680
怀孕？
Pregnant?

446
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,930
朴敏焕有无精症
Min-hwan has azoospermia.

447
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,730
根本就不可能让人怀孕
He can't get anyone pregnant!

448
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,640
你在说什么？我真的怀孕了
What? I was really pregnant.

449
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,110
我有超音波照片，我也感觉到了胎动
I have an ultrasound picture. I felt it.

450
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,480
够了！
That's enough!

451
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,700
别再说谎了，那该死的谎言！
Stop lying. You keep lying and lying!

452
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,830
你到底是怎么回事？你为什么要这样对我？
What's with you? Why are you doing this to me?

453
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,040
我才要问你是怎么回事
What's wrong with you?

454
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,730
你问我能不能放过你吗？
You asked if I could leave you alone...

455
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,940
嗯，不行
No, I can't.

456
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,570
你不可以幸福
Because you can't be happy.

457
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,490
你应该不知道
You probably don't know.

458
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:24,870
我们14岁的时候，你妈外遇离家的时候
When your mom had an affair and left you when we were 14,

459
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,500
她的对象…
it was...

460
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,130
是我爸爸
with my dad.

461
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,880
你不晓得这件事，一副天真无邪
You had no idea and were so happy.

462
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,140
因为如此，我…
Because of that...

463
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,850
爸，你为什么不回家？
Dad, why won't you come home?

464
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:44,640
妈说你离家出走了，因为你有外遇
Mom said you left because you had an affair.

465
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,850
她说你抛弃了我们
She said you abandoned us.

466
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,400
不管你说什么都好，拜托你打给电话给我
Say anything. Just call me.

467
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,740
不然我要去死，我会乖乖的，请你带我一起走
If you do this, I'll kill myself. I'll be good, so take me with you.

468
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,620
我叫你过来店里帮忙，你窝在家里做什么？
I told you to come and help. Why are you at home right now?

469
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,660
我要读书啊
I have to study!

470
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,040
唉唷，鱼腥味
God, you reek of fish.

471
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,960
你这个坏丫头
You little brat.

472
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,960
你最好是要读书啦
Study, my foot.

473
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,250
你爸之前都很宠你，我可不会
Your dad might've been sweet to you, but not me.

474
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,260
你清醒一点，有点自知之明
Wake up and know your place.

475
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,840
不然你去找你爸
Or just go to your dad!

476
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,970
真是受不了你
I can't stand you!

477
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,060
有人打来了
Someone's calling.

478
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,560
谁？女人吗？
Who is it? Is it a woman?

479
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,070
不是啦，是我女儿
No, it's my daughter.

480
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,570
唉唷，真烦
I'm sick of this.

481
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,780
她跟她妈妈一样
She's just like her mom.

482
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,070
固执得不得了
I can't even begin to tell you how tenacious she is.

483
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,700
你不会要把她带过来吧？
You're not thinking of raising her, right?

484
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,080
那我也要带我女儿过来，把她丢给你，然后逃走
If you do, I'll bring mine too, dump her on you, and run away.

485
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,670
我干嘛要那样？
Why would I do that?

486
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:53,460
我只要有你一个小公主就够了
You're the only princess I need.

487
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,800
唉唷，好恶心哦
You're so gross.

488
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,380
我们走吧
Let's go.

489
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,800
爸爸的新公主有个女儿
My dad's new princess had a daughter.

490
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,740
钱包不见了吗？
Did you lose your wallet?

491
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,530
唉唷，你一副就是妈妈离家的孩子
Goodness. You make it so obvious that your mother ran away.

492
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,450
别那么闲言闲语
Don't be so nosy.

493
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,130
这个
Here.

494
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,840
是你的吗？
Is it yours?

495
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,670
所以…
So...

496
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,800
我们才能成为好朋友
we could've been good friends.

497
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,890
打开电热毯，要冷死了
Turn on the floor heating. It's cold.

498
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,220
好冷
It's so cold.

499
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,140
哦？很温暖耶
What? It's warm.

500
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,270
是哦？
Is it?

501
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,940
应该是我爸先打开了
My dad turned it on.

502
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,690
你说有朋友要来，我就先让房间暖和起来
You said a friend was coming, so I warmed it up.

503
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,780
爸
Dad.

504
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,280
叔叔好
Hello.

505
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,200
唉唷，你长得真漂亮
My goodness. You're so pretty.

506
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,910
我买了X世代的公主们超爱的蛋糕
I bought the cake that young girls love these days.

507
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
你们配着牛奶一起吃哦
Make sure to eat it with milk, okay?

508
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,130
零用钱
An allowance.

509
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,380
零用钱
Your allowance.

510
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,140
-谢谢 -爸爸出去啦
-Thank you. -I'm off.

511
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,010
玩得开心哦
Have fun.

512
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,610
他又来了
He did it again.

513
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,400
你等一下
Just a second.

514
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,360
爸，我说过不要在钞票上乱画了
Dad! I told you not to draw on money like this.

515
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,660
好啦，我知道了
Okay, fine.

516
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,370
我以后真的不会再这样了
I promise, I won't do it again.

517
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,950
不要开太快，慢慢开
Don't drive too fast. Go slowly.

518
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:53,330
公主大人是从哪时开始这么漂亮的？
When did you get so pretty, Princess?

519
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,540
不要叫我公主大人啦
Don't call me that.

520
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,090
因为爸爸爱你啊
It's because I love you.

521
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:06,050
假如我不知道你和我不一样，你拥有一切，没有失去任何东西
Maybe if I didn't know that you still had everything, unlike me.

522
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:10,560
他怕我没有妈妈…
He thinks I might be

523
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,440
会觉得沮丧
downhearted without a mom.

524
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,730
他最近又更夸张了
He overdoes it.

525
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:16,980
不要理他
Don't mind him.

526
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,230
从那时候起
That's when I started

527
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,360
我开始在意你
to be bothered by you.

528
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,570
开始想要抢走你的一切
And started to want to steal everything from you.

529
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,410
为什么你总是好好的？
Why are you always okay?

530
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,630
为什么你身边…
Why are there...

531
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,590
都只有美好的事物？
always good things around you?

532
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,680
你现在懂了吧？
Do you get it now?

533
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,400
我从来不曾喜欢过你
I've never liked you.

534
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,520
搞不清楚状况，只会整天笑嘻嘻
You were always smiling without a clue.

535
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,740
天真无邪是种错
Being happy is a sin.

536
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,610
超不识相，烦死人了
You're so clueless. It's annoying!

537
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:12,620
你知道生存在这个世界有多难吗？
Do you know how hard life can be?

538
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:15,580
你知道有多么像地狱吗？
Do you know how hellish it can be?

539
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:19,750
我这么不幸，你不可以幸福啊
You can't be happy when I'm so miserable.

540
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,420
现在让我来告诉你
Now, I'll show you

541
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,090
这个世界有多么不仁慈
how unkind the world can be.

542
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,760
活着…
How hellish...

543
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,720
有多么地煎熬
life can be.

544
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,360
就只是因为这样？
Was that all?

545
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:55,620
因为你爸外遇的对象是我妈
"Your dad had an affair with my mom."

546
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,080
因为没有人知道，就只有你知道
"No one knew, but you did."

547
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,790
你以为…
You think...

548
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:05,630
光是那样足以做为你一辈子欺负我
you can make me suffer

549
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:09,340
抢走我宝贵的一切的理由吗？真的吗？
and steal what's precious to me for that reason? Really?

550
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,140
真有你的哦
You're so full of yourself.

551
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,720
我也很讨厌看到你，一副自以为聪明的样子
I hate it when you act like a know-it-all.

552
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:18,980
你没感情吗？不觉得我可怜吗？
Don't you feel sorry for me?

553
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,310
我觉得我自己可怜得要命！
I feel so bad for myself!

554
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,480
不可怜！
Not at all!

555
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,940
我一点也不觉得你可怜
I don't feel bad for you.

556
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,780
因为我都知道
Because I knew too.

557
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,950
你爸爸…
That your dad...

558
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:39,410
和我妈外遇的事
had an affair with my mom.

559
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,960
我也知道
I knew it too.

560
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,050
以前我觉得很庆幸
I thought it was a relief...

561
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,100
幸好你不知道这件事
that you didn't know.

562
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,640
唉，我们为什么要做这种事？
Why do we have to do this?

563
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,480
要是我爸还活着，他肯定会冲来学校
My dad would've come to school if he were alive.

564
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:10,320
你说他过世两年了吗？
Did he die two years ago?

565
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:13,620
-嗯 -你肯定很想他
-Yeah. -I bet you miss him.

566
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,280
我非常想念他
I miss him so much.

567
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:18,370
我爸超级爱我
He loved me so much.

568
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,210
-爸爸 -嗯
-Dad! -Hi.

569
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,960
-爸爸 -你来啦？
-Dad! -Hey!

570
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,260
下雨了，我们走吧
It's raining. Let's go.

571
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,220
妈妈
Mom!

572
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,830
曾经我想对你好
I wanted to be good to you.

573
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:01,040
我以为我们可以一起变得幸福
I thought we could be happy together.

574
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,750
即使在我难过得要死的时候
Even when I felt like I was dying...

575
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:20,430
直到我要死的那刻为止，也都还是不希望你不幸
I hoped you'd be happy even when I was dying.

576
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,270
别一副你很为我着想的样子
Don't act like you cared.

577
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,780
因为刘志赫是富三代，你就把朴敏焕丢给我？
You dumped Min-hwan on me for a rich guy?

578
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:40,410
你把他丢给我？
You dumped him on me!

579
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,410
你总是这样
You were always like this.

580
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,000
装作一副善良的样子，结果好处都是你拿走
You pretend to be nice and took everything in the end!

581
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,960
你全都拿走了！
You took everything!

582
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:54,970
我现在终于明白
I just realized

583
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,050
你为何会落得这副模样
why you ended up like this.

584
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,850
你是自作自受
You brought this upon yourself.

585
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,770
而且还没有结束
Also, it's not over yet.

586
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,270
有更残酷的地狱在等着你
A harsher hell awaits you.

587
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,650
我会这么做
I'll see to it.

588
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:24,120
你等着吧
Look forward to it.

589
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,670
那将会和以前完全不一样
It'll be different than before.

590
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:37,930
我必定要把我的命运转移到你身上
I'll make sure my fate goes to you.

591
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,410
熙妍，你回家去休息吧
Go home and rest.

592
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:03,990
我来顾着他
I'll stay here.

593
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,160
唯一医院
YUIL MEDICAL CENTER

594
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:17,800
智媛，你今天下班后要做什么？
Ji-won, what are you doing after work today?

595
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,260
我们可不可以见个面？
Can we meet for a moment?

596
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,430
有什么事吗？
Is something wrong?

597
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,350
说起来很不好意思
It's embarrassing to say,

598
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,400
我老公好像外遇了
but I think my husband's cheating on me.

599
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,150
可恶
This little...

600
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,290
公主大人排骨，24小时营业
PRINCESS PORK RIBS OPEN 24 HOURS

601
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,830
我要不要去外带就好？
Should I just get it to go?

602
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,340
杨…
Ms. Yang...

603
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:02,640
过来
Come here.

604
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,220
我就跟你说在店里不要这样了，真受不了你
I told you, not here. I can't believe you.

605
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,850
为什么？
Why not?

606
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:10,980
我回到家要看生病老婆的脸色，在店里就要看岳父的脸色
I always walk on eggshells around my sick wife and father-in-law.

607
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,580
李室长
Mr. Lee.

608
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:44,640
穿上
Put it on.

609
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:47,930
打起精神来，把鞋穿上
Snap out of it and put it on!

610
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,900
发现老公外遇，就应该马上去赏他一巴掌
Go slap your husband if you caught him cheating.

611
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:07,070
用脚踢他要害，把他眼睛给挖出来，打破他的头才对
Kick him, claw his eyes out, and crack his skull open!

612
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,160
你为什么要逃跑？
Why are you running away?

613
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,160
你怎么会知道？
How did you know?

614
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,330
现在我为何知道重要吗？
Is that what's important right now?

615
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,670
你要回去吗？我车上有高尔夫球杆，要借你吗？
Do you want to go back? Want to borrow my golf club?

616
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,880
你到底是怎么生活过来的，怎么做人会这幺正直？
How have you lived to be so upright like this?

617
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:26,050
为何连我这样胡来
Even when I'm so out of line,

618
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,560
你都不敢生气？
why can't you get angry?

619
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:35,310
所以那家伙才会不把你当一回事，在岳父的店里乱搞
That's why he does it even at your dad's restaurant.

620
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:56,120
不管我敢不敢生气
Whether I can get angry or not,

621
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:59,790
不是都不可以乱来吗？
isn't it wrong to act out like that?

622
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,420
不是不可以不把我当一回事吗？
Isn't it wrong to disrespect me?

623
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,510
如果对方很善良，不是应该要同样善良以对吗？
If someone's kind, shouldn't you be kind back to them?

624
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,640
我对他好，在等他
I'm good to him, and I wait.

625
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,270
我一直在等着他
I keep waiting.

626
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:20,820
那他应该要清醒过来才对吧？
Shouldn't he come to his senses?

627
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,700
已经和警方谈好，以现场管理不善
The police agreed to close the case

628
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:31,780
醉汉抢夺翻斗车而造成的意外结案
as an accident by a drunk man who stole a truck.

629
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,870
郑万植和裴熙淑在京畿道
Jeong Man-sik and Bae Hui-suk are in Gyeonggi-do.

630
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,250
很快就能逮到他们了
I'll catch them soon.

631
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,840
花太久时间了，我担心到都睡不着
It's taking too long. I was so worried that I lost sleep.

632
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:48,340
把事情处理得干净俐落
No loose ends, okay?

633
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,490
我是首席主厨，白恩浩
I'm Head Chef Baek Eun-ho.

634
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,820
请问您觉得餐点如何呢？
How was your meal?

635
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:16,000
听说您有话要跟我说
I heard you wanted to speak with me.

636
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:24,300
餐点非常好，我想说的是…
The meal was great, and I wanted to know...

637
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:27,880
你和刘志赫是什么关系？
how you know Yu Ji-hyuk.

638
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:31,890
刘志赫先生吗？
Yu Ji-hyuk?

639
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,560
真想揍他
I ought to...

640
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,390
吴宥拉
OH YU-RA

641
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,260
你要我有需要尽量利用你
You told me to use you anytime.

642
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,010
现在是怎样？
What is this?

643
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,520
请你睁开眼，志赫
Open your eyes, Ji-hyuk.

644
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:12,860
真是的
I mean...

645
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:14,860
你连这个都做不到
You can't even do that.

646
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,660
话说…
By the way,

647
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:27,750
我现在已经成长和坚强许多
I've grown and become much stronger.

648
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,340
不是刚回来的那个姜智媛了
I'm not the old Kang Ji-won.

649
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,380
所以…
So...

650
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:35,970
命运？
Fate?

651
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,680
我一点都不害怕那种东西
I'm not scared of it anymore.

652
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,270
所以你也要战胜你的命运
So I want you to overcome your fate too.

653
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:55,150
我一直都是一个人
I was always alone.

654
00:55:55,950 --> 00:56:00,200
所以从我妈离家那天起，我就开始算日子
So I've counted the days since my mom left

655
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:03,080
自从我爸过世后也在算日子
and since my dad died.

656
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:06,920
可是现在…
But now...

657
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:12,210
我想要数着和你一起度过的日子
I want to count the days of us together.

658
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,890
回到我身边
Come back to me.

659
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:23,220
不要丢下我一个人
Don't leave me alone.

660
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:28,060
拜托你睁开眼睛
Open your eyes. Please.

661
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:34,440
我也想要听你的声音
I want to hear your voice.

662
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:39,070
语音信息
VOICE MESSAGE

663
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,540
现在开始我要告诉你的事，我没想到会是这么告诉你
I'll tell you something I didn't expect to tell you like this.

664
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:46,330
我死于2023年
I died in 2023.

665
00:56:58,510 --> 00:56:59,470
我喜欢你
I like you.

666
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:03,180
我喜欢你
I like you.

667
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:05,640
我真的很喜欢你
I like you so much.

668
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,020
我也喜欢你
I like you too.

669
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:12,900
所以…
So...

670
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:14,860
对不起
I'm sorry.

671
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:04,870
我爱你
I love you.

672
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:11,370
我也爱你
I love you too.

673
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,800
我的命运好像落到杨科长身上了
I think my fate moved to Ms. Yang.

674
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,050
这是怎样？
What's going on?

675
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:02,800
要是你敢动她，我不会放过你
If you touch her, I'll make you pay!

676
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,930
吴宥拉肯定也在找他们
Oh Yu-ra must be looking for them.

677
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:06,800
问题就在于谁先找到
It's a matter of who's faster.

678
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:08,930
我第一次看到有人死掉
It's my first time seeing someone die.

679
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,770
你好，我是郑秀敏
Hello, my name's Jeong Su-min.

680
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:14,810
姜智媛今天来上班了，一副什么事都没有的样子
Kang Ji-won came to work as if nothing happened.

681
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,860
要是她有八百亿韩元，那我不能杀了她
If she has 80 billion won, I shouldn't kill her.

682
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,320
如果我再次勾引她
If I seduce her again,

683
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,690
八百亿韩元就会直接进到我口袋里
that 80 billion won will come to me.

684
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,240
因为必须要让朴敏焕有外遇
Because Min-hwan

685
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,700
认为自己的老婆死了也无所谓
must have an affair and not care if his wife dies.

686
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:30,410
志赫，我得诱惑朴敏焕
Ji-hyuk, I have to seduce Min-hwan.

687
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,960
